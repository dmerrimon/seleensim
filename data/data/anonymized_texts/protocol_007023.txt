After a review of the 1st cohort results, it was decided that an additional two cohorts be added and to 
remove references to the second stage (parallel design portion) of the study.  The parallel design study 
will be conducted under a new protocol with new numbering identifier with the design features to be 
determined after the results from all three cohorts are evaluated.  Additional changes were made to 
reduce confusion and augment the standard of care treatment for all subjects.

After a review of the top line results from the bunionectomy study (CA -PS-201), it was decided 
that the concentration used i n this study should be 0.05 mg/mL for a total dose of 5.0 mg which 
is slightly higher  than the 4.2 mg dose, the highest dose used in the Phase 2 bunionectomy study  
(CA-PS-201) and the Phase 1b study (CA -PS-2017 -101).  Note that the safety profile in the se 
two bunionectomy studies were  similar  in that all active doses were well tolerated without an 
apparent dose response to adverse events .

Pharmacokinetics and Safety Study of CA -008 in Subjects Undergoing 
Complete Abdominoplasty  
Study Treatment  • CA-008, the investigational product  
• Placebo to match  
Planned Study 
Center(s):  1 US site  
Indication:  Acute postsurgical pain  
Sample Size:  • Cohort #1: total N=18 ( randomized 1:1 active  or placebo)   
• Cohort #2: total N=18 (randomized 2:1 active  or placebo)  
• Cohort #3: total N=18 (randomized 2:1 active  or placebo)   
• Optional 4th cohort with a total N=24 randomized 1:1 to CA -008 or 
placebo  
Population:  Adults ages 18 to 6 5 years, inclusive, who are planning to undergo an 
elective complete (full) abdominoplasty (C -ABD) and otherwise meet 
eligibility criteria may be considered for enrollment into the study.  
Study Duration:  Approximately 76 days per subject  from screening to the day 29 (D29) visit 
(however this could be longer to follow any AE to resolution or 
establishment of a new baseline)  
Overall Study Design:  
 This is a Phase 2, single -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled, parallel  design study evaluating  up to 4  exploratory cohorts,  each 
with a single dose  of CA-008 or placebo.  
For each subject, t he study  will be conducted in two parts:  
• Inpatient period  starts with admission to Post -anesthesia care unit 
(PACU) and continues to 96h (T96h) after completion of study 
treatment injection (T0) .   
• Outpatient period begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through 
various follow visits to D29 ±2 (W4) after surgery .  Note that additional

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 8 of 105 follow up visits may occur at any time or even after D29/W4 to follow 
adverse events (AEs) to resolution or establishment of a new baseline.  
Study Objectives:  Primary  Objective :  To evaluate the efficacy  of a single intraoperative 
administration of CA-008 vs. placebo  in subjects undergoing an elective C-
ABD .  
Secondary  Objectives:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intraoperative 
administration of CA -008 vs. vehicle placebo in subjects undergoing an 
elective C-ABD.  
• To evaluate the PK profile of a single intraoperative administration of 
CA-008 vs. vehicle placebo in subjects undergoing an elective C-ABD .  
• To evaluate the opioid -sparing effect of CA -008 vs. placebo  in terms of 
consumption and time to cessation.  
Study Treatment 
Dosing Schedule:  Study treatment is to be administered intraoperatively as a single 
administration via “surgical site” infiltration prior to wound closure.   
“Surgical site” is defined as the area extending approximately 2 -3 cm in all 
directions (lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the incision site and 
surrounding tissues.  
Anesthesia:  The surgery is to be performed under general anesthesia supplemented by a 
transverse abdominis plane ( TAP ) block  and local surgical site infiltration .  
Prior to the  surgery , perform the TAP block  as a single injection of 0. 25% 
bupivacaine  hydrochloride (HCl) 60 mL ( 150 mg).  
Dose Groups:  • Cohort #1: total N=18 randomized 1:1 CA -008 5 mg or  placebo  
• Cohort #2: total N=18 randomized 2:1 CA -008 10 mg or  placebo  
• Cohort #3: total N=18 randomized 2:1 CA -008 15 mg or  placebo  
• Optional 4th cohort with a total N=24 randomized 1:1 to CA -008 or 
placebo at a dose between 5 mg and 15 mg as determined based upon 
results from cohorts #1 -3 
The volume for each cohort is 100 mL of CA -008 or placebo vehicle.   
Injection of Study 
Treatment:  Prior to wound closure, study treatment will be infiltrated uniformly 
throughout  the soft tissues  around surgical sites  with particular attention to 
the rectus fascia .   
A 25 g (or lar ger) 3.5” spinal needle may be useful for the infiltration 
process.  
Note that T0 is the time that the study treatment injection is completed.  
Allowed 
Substitutions:  Note that if any standard of care drugs are  unavailable, for example due to 
stock outages, available clinically equivalent alternatives may be substituted, 
particularly for the protocol -specified  analgesic drugs for intraoperative or

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 9 of 105 postoperative inpatient analgesia , after approval of the medical monitor who 
should notify Sponsor of said substitution.  
Intraoperative 
Analgesia:  Within 30 min of anesthesia induction give the subject IV hydromorphone 
0.02 mg/kg.  
During the  surgery, ensure that each subject has received at least 100 mcg of 
IV fentanyl  with adjustments above this dose per anesthesiologist discretion.  
Within 15 min of the end of surgery, administer IV acetaminophen 1g 
(Ofirmev® full prescribing information at http://ofirmev.com/ ) and IV 
hydromorphone 0.007 mg/kg . 
Inpatient Analgesia:  
 No non -opioid analgesics are to be administered after transfer to the PACU 
during the inpatient phase (through T96h).  
Postsurgical Care:  After surgery, subjects will be monitored in the post -anesthesia care unit 
(PACU) during which time efficacy asssessments can begin once the subject 
is awake.  Document PACU entrance and discharge times.  
After discharge from the PACU, subjects are followed through T96h as an 
inpatient.  Safety and efficacy evaluations will be performed and blood 
drawn and urine collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.  Subjects 
will be required to meet standard criteria for discharge to outpatient status .  
Subjects will continue to be monitored as an outpatient after discharge 
through D29/W4 for various safety and efficacy assessments, and later if 
necessary for safety follow up.  
Rescue Medication 
During the Inpatient 
Stay : During the PACU stay, the subject may be administered IV fentanyl 25 -50 
mcg q5 min prn for moderate -to-severe pain (≥ 4) as reported by subjects 
using the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale of current pain intensity (NRS).   
From the time of PACU discharge thr ough T12h administer IV 
hydromorphone 0.2 to 0.5 mg q10 -15 min prn for NRS ≥ 4 as reported by 
subjects.  
After T12h, administer PO oxycodone 5 mg q2h prn moderate pain (NRS ≥ 
4 and ≤ 6) or 10 mg q2h prn severe pain (NRS ≥ 7).   
After T24, administer PO oxyc odone 5 mg q4h prn moderate pain (NRS ≥ 4 
and ≤ 6) or 10 mg q4h prn severe pain (NRS ≥ 7)  
Subjects will be encouraged to rescue only for moderate -to-severe pain 
scores (NRS ≥ 4), however rescue may be requested at any time and 
medication will be provided w hen requested.  
Analgesia during the 
Outpatient Period:  
 Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be 
instructed to take a combination of over -the-counter (OTC) analgesics at an 
appropriate dose per medical judgment to manage any  residual or 
breakthrough postsurgical pain.  
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-204               Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 10 of 105 If a subject is still requiring opioid rescue in the 12h prior to discharge from 
the inpatient unit (i.e., from T84h on regardless of whether discharge is 
delayed) , then prescribe no more than 9 tablets of oxyco done 5 mg (1 PO tid 
prn) per investigator discretion for the initial outpatient period . 
If needed for pain management, acetaminophen up to 1000  mg prn tid /qid 
(3g daily maximum limit)  and ibuprofen 400 -600 mg prn tid/qid will be 
recommended for subjects to  self-administer (note that th ese medications 
will not be provided by the Sponsor) . 
Persistent pain or pain exacerbations during the outpatient period may 
suggest the need for an unscheduled in -person visit to assess the surgical 
site.  If such a situation  occurs, the Investigator should use clinical discretion 
on adequacy of analgesic treatment, but to capture this event as an adverse 
event (AE) and document any required treatments.

product within 30 days or five half -lives (whichever is longer) prior to 
the planned surgery, or is scheduled to receive an investigational product 
other than CA -008 while participating in the study.  
Visit Schedule:  • Screening D -45 to D-1: Subjects undergo screening during this 
period. All screening assessments (including informed consent form 
[ICF]) must be completed at least 1 day prior to surgery.   
• Site Unit Admission D0 : Day of surgery, subjects will be 
randomized and baseline evaluat ions will be performed prior to 
surgery.   
• Surgery D0 : C-ABD procedure is performed; study treatment is 
injected prior to wound closure with T0 defined as the time of study 
treatment completion of administration.  PK assessments are to be 
done per protocol -specified time points through T 24h. 
• Post-surgery T0 to T96h : Subject remains at the Site Facility  for 
study assessments and PK blood draws.  Discharge after T96 ±4h 
assessments with follow up instructions, particularly on diary 
completion.  
• Follow Up D8±1 ( W1): clinic visit for study assessments  
• Follow Up D15±2 (W2):  clinic visit for study assessments  
• Follow Up D29±2 (W4):  clinic visit for study assessments and 
study completion visit, unless follow up for wound healing is needed  
• If needed, Unscheduled visits  or Follow Up after D29±2:  Clinic 
visit as needed for any ongoing safety issue occurring between 
scheduled visits or continuing after the D29 visit  
• Early Termination (ET):  For subjects who terminate early, an ET 
visit will be required if the subject is agr eeable. Safety and subject -
reported outcome assessments will be performed.  If the subject does 
not wish to participate in these assessments, he/she should be asked 
to at least return for a wound check.

Safety Parameter 
Assessment Times:   • Incidence of spontaneous reported TEAEs or SAEs from T0 through 
D29/W4 or later if necessary:  
o TEAEs are defined as AEs occurring post T0  
o AEs recorded from the time the informed consent form (ICF) is 
signed up to D0/T0 will be recorded in medical history.   
• PE: full PE at screening (without a breast, genital or rectal examination). 
Interim targeted PE on D -1 or D0 prior to surgery (to be conducted on 
D0 if not done on D -1), T96h, and as an outpatient on D8/W1, D15/W2, 
and D29/W4 (later if necessary).  
• Vital signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], respiratory rate [RR]) 
at screening, D0 prior to surgery, post -surgery T1, T2, T4, T6, T12, and 
T24h, and every 8 hours thereafter until T96h, and as an outpatient on 
D8/W1, D15/W2, and D29/W4 or later if necess ary.  Assess temperature 
on D -1 or D0 prior to surgery. Daily temps can be recorded along with 
vital signs per site SOPs at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and every 8 hours thereafter 
until discharge from the inpatient facility (if awake at the time of 
assessment bet ween hours of midnight and 6 a.m.).  
• Surgical site assessments at T96h (prior to discharge from the unit) and 
then as an outpatient on D8/W1, D15/W2, and D29/W4 (later if 
necessary) .  If there are skin reactions atypical for the type of surgery, 
e.g., more than expected erythema, drainage, bruising or hematoma, 
induration, swelling or other skin changes, they should be documented 
as AEs, graded for severity and followed regularly until resolution or 
establishment of a new baseline.  
• Neurosensory testing near the incision (compared to a control site just 
distal to the costal margin ) will be performed at Screening visit, T96h 
(prior to discharge from the unit) and then as an outpatient on D8/W1, 
D15/W2, and D29/W4.  
o Numbness at or near the incision need not be considered a 
neurologic AE since this could occur because of tissue trauma 
and inflammation from the surgery.  
o Sensory deficits or clinically significant persistent sensory 
change beyond the area immediately proximal/distal to the 
incision at time of discha rge, such as allodynia or hyperalgesia,

 1. NRS scores will be assessed as follows:  
• During the inpatient stay, NRS at rest beginning with the PACU 
admission may be assessed once the subject is awake.  If the subject 
is able to provide responses, obtain NRS scores at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 
12, 16, 20, 24, and every 4 hours (if awake at time of assessment) 
until discharge from the inpatient unit.   Time windows: for T0.5 to 
T2 (± 5 min ) and from T4 onward (±15 min ). 
• Pain scores may be skipped between the hours of midnight an d 6 
a.m., but the subject may not miss two consecutive assessments.  
• An additional NRS assessment must be obtained prior to rescue 
medication request (±15 min) .  The T12, T24, T48, T72 and T96h 
assessments must be completed even if the subject is asleep at these 
times.

 • During the inpatient stay, starting on postoperative day 1  perform 
the following  each morning : on arising at  0800h (±2 h) and each 
evening at 2000h (±2 h) document the NRS on arising from a 
recumbent position to a sitting or standing position .  Actual 
assessment times must be documented .  If however these twice daily 
assessments coincide with timed assessments of NRS at rest, then 
the time assessment at rest is used in place of the twice daily 
assessments.   Resting pain scores are performed on th e schedule 
noted above in the first bullet.  
• During the outpatient period, instruct the patient to document, if 
possible, their NRS scores twice daily at 0800h (± 4h) and 2000h 
(±4h) at rest and on arising from a recumbent position to a sitting or 
standing p osition at T96. W1. W2. Amd W4 .  Note that the actual 
time of these assessments must be documented in the diary  
whenever possible .  Instruct the patient to:  
o Obtain the morning NRS assessment prior to taking any pain 
medication or 2  (±15min ) hours after tak ing any pain 
medication  
o Obtain the evening NRS assessment 2 (±15min ) hours after 
taking any pain medication  
2. Total opioid consumption (OC) and daily opioid (rescue medication) 
consumption in MEDs will be recorded during the inpatient period.   
• Document subject days in which no rescue medication or analgesic 
consumption is required (opioid free, OF) during the inpatient and 
outpatient period.   
• Document daily use of OTC analgesics (and oxycodone if 
prescribed) during the outpatient period.   
• Docu ment the fraction of subjects who rescue at T6, T12, T24, T48, 
T72 and T96h  
• Document any prescriptions for opioids provided to the subject prior 
to discharge to outpatient status and the number of tablets 
prescribed.  Also document any new such prescriptio ns. 
3. Patient Global Evaluation (PGE) at T96 ±4h prior to discharge, D8/W1, 
D15/ W2 and D29/ W4 clinic visits.  
4. Investigator Global Evaluation (IGE) at T96 ±4h prior to discharge, 
D8/W1, D15/ W2 and D29/ W4 clinic visits.

any investigator or sub -investigator.  
PK Endpoints:  The time points for whole blood collection will be at baseline ( from checkin 
and up to  30 min before the start of surgery ), and T5min, T10 min, T15min, 
T30m in, T45min, and T1, T1.5, T2, T2.5, T3, T4, T6, T8, T12, T16, T24 ,

treatment administration .  Actual sampling times w ill be used to calculate 
plasma -derived PK parameters.  The PK will be documented in the PK 
Analysis Plan document.  
Additionally, immediately post surgery begin a 24h urine collection to assess 
urinary CA -101 excretion to be collected in two aliquots: after surgery to 
T6h and T6h to T24h .   
Stopping Rules:  Study enrollment  will be paused  if subjects experience intolerable at least 
possibly related TEAEs, as defined:  
• 1 or more subjects with any grade 4 “related” TEAE in any of the 
categories shown in the table below  
• 2 or more subjects with the same  grade 3 “related” TEAE in any of 
the categories shown in the table below

Should a stopping rule be triggered, an external independent Safety Review 
Committee (SRC) will review the data to determine whether or not  it is 
appropriate to continue with enrollment.  The SRC Charter details the 
membership, roles and responsibilities of the SRC.  
Sample Size 
Justification:  Given the uncertainty in estimating a sample size for C -ABD surgery, the 
data from the current study will be used to determine the sample size for a 
subsequent parallel design study  selecting one or more optimal doses of CA -
008 vs. placebo in the setting of standard of care for abdominoplasty . 
Study Populations:  The following three analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• The Safety Population will include all subjects who received any part of 
a dose of study treatment.   
• The PK Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of 
study treatme nt and complete all PK assessments . 
• The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects as 
randomized to study treatment.  The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) 
Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of study 
treatment and complete the first 3 pain assessments (through T2h).   
• Study completers (Study Completers) will include all subjects who 
receive a full dose of study treatment and complete the entire study 
period through D29±2/W4.  
Subjects who elect to discontinue study participation  (early termination or 
ET) after randomization but prior to receiving study treatment will be 
replaced.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 19 of 105 Subjects who elect to ET after receiving study treatment will not be 
replaced, however those who ET  during the inpatient phase of the study, will 
be asked to continue with asse ssments through T96h if they have not elected 
to withdraw from all aspects of study participation.  Subjects who elect to 
discontinue participation prior to D8 (W1) will be considered to have 
terminated as of the date of their election, however they will b e asked to 
return to the site one time, if willing and at their conven ience, to ensure 
wound healing.  
Statistical 
Considerations:  
 All safety assessments and baseline characteristics will be summarized using 
the Safety Population.  Efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT 
population.  PK analyses will be performed using the PK population.  All 
summaries will be grouped by the actual treatment received.  Subjects 
receiving vehicle placebo will be combined for summaries.  
Safety and tolerability wi ll be evaluated by examining the occurrence of 
AEs, including Treatment -Emergent AEs.  AEs leading to discontinuation 
from the study, AEs related to study treatment and AE severity will be 
summarized by treatment group.   
Actual and change from baseline in  clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, 
and ECGs will also be assessed and summarized by treatment group.  These 
data will be summarized using descriptive statistics including n, mean, SD, 
SEM (if appropriate), median, minimum and maximum.  Abnormal va lues 
will be determined and flagged in the listings.  Laboratory shift tables 
displaying the change (number of subjects) relative to the normal range from 
baseline to each study visit will also be presented by treatment for each test.  
The Investigator sho uld exercise medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.  
While the study is not specifically designed to detect a significant difference 
in efficacy between CA -008 and placebo, efficacy analyses will be 
performed as secondary endpoints.

vital signs  and temperatures there will be a ± 15-minute window allowed.  
5 A complete medical history and physical examination including all major body systems  will be performed at Screening.  In addition, at the following times, an interim medical history and targeted 
physical examination will be performed prior to surgery (if not done on D -1), and to capture changes after Surgery, at 96 hours ( ± 4 hours ) after the administration of study medication, but prior to  
discharge, and Day 8, Day 15 and Day 29 after the administration of study medication or if the subject terminates early, at t hat time if allowed.  Body weight (kg), in indoor clothing, but withou t 
shoes, will be measured at Screening  and at 96 hours.  Height (in cm) will be measured and BMI will be calculated at Screening only.  
6 Post-Surgery ECG should be performed at 24 hours (±2 hours) after study medication administration . 
7 Surgical Site assessme nt: 48 hours (± 2 hours) and 96 hours (±4 hours after study medication administration but prior to discharge from the inpatient unit ) and Day 8, 15 and 29 . 
8 Neurosensory Exam of the area proximal to the surgical incision approximately 3 cm from the incision at Screening visit, 48 hours (± 2 hours) , 96 hours (±4 hours, but prior to discharge) and Day 
8, Day 15 and Day 29 after the administration of study medicat ion or if the subject terminates early, at that time if allowed.

allowed for the collection of each assessment in the fi rst 2 hours after PACU admission , after which will be a ±15 -minute window allowed.  During the inpatient period document the NRS at rest 
and on arising from a recumbent position twice daily at 0800h (±2h) and 2000h (±2h) with the actual time of these assessments documented. These twice daily scores are performed 
independently of pain scores at rest during the inpatient period. If however these twice daily assessments coincide with timed assessm ents of NRS at rest, then the time assessment at rest is used 
in place of the twice daily assessments.   During the outpatient period, instruct the subject to document, if possible, their NRS scores twice daily at 0800h (±4h) and 2000h (±4h) at rest and on 
arising from  T96 through D15 (not t hrough D29) .  Note that the actual time of these assessments must be documented in the diary.  Instruct the subject  to: 
• Obtain the morning NRS assessment prior to taking any pain medication or 2 (±15-min) hours after taking any pain medication . 
• Obtain the evening NRS assessment 2 (±15-min) hours after taking any pain medication . 
If an early termination is elected before Day 15, collect efficacy assessments, including NRS scores and diary logs.  
11 The subject is expected t o document NRS pain scores at rest and on arising from recumbency to sitting or standing 2x/day through Day 15 (at the times and qualifications noted above).   
12 The diary and instructions are provided to the subject prior to discharge (T96h).  At each subsequent visit, r eview Subject Diary instructions with subject  and collect  their NRS scores and other 
study -related assessments.  
13 Collect Subject Diary Data   
14 If the subject is continuing to require opioids during the 12 hours prior to discharge (any time from T84h onward), then write a prescription for  no more than 9 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg tablets 
for use tid prn per investigator discretion.    
15 Collect blood samples for PK . The time points for whole blood collection will be at baseline ( from Check -in and  up to  30 min prior to surgery ), and T5min, T10 min, T15min, T30min, T45min, 
and T1, T1.5, T2, T2.5, T3, T4, T6, T8, T12, T16, T24, T30, T36 and T48h for a total of 20 samples)  where T0 = end of study treatment administration . There will be a ±2 -minute win dow 
allowed for the 5 to 15 -minute collections, a ±5 -minute window allowed for collections T30 min through T4h, and a ±15 -minute window for collections after T4 hours . 
16 Subjects must abstain from foods containing capsaicin for 24 hours prior to all PK blood  draws.  
17 Collect the subject’s urine for 24 hours after surgery in two aliquots: post surgery to T6h and T6h to T24h.    
18 Assess for presence of rebound pain at the surgical site  (yes/no response) . 
19 If the subject terminates early and is willing to come in to complete all safety and efficacy assessments  then complete all procedures listed . If unwilling to come in for all such assessments, at 
least attempt to bring the subject in for a surgical site assessment ,

5.1. Background  
Concentric Analgesics, Inc. (Concentric) is developing CA -008 to provide long-lasting pain  
relief of post -surgical pain following a single local administration  (for 96h and beyond) .  CA-008 
is a prodrug of trans -capsaicin (trans -8-methyl -N-vanillyl -6-nonenamide) , the substance in chili 
peppers that produces the sensation of spiciness.  Capsaicin is a transient receptor potential 
cation channel, subfamily V (vanilloid), member 1 (TRPV1)  agonist.  TRPV1 is a ligand -gated, 
nonselective, cation channel preferentially expressed most densely in C -fiber nociceptors and to 
a lesser extent on Aδ –fiber nociceptors (Babbar 2009, Caterina 2001 ). TRPV1 responds to 
noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heat, and extracellular acidification, and integrates 
simultaneous exposures to these stimuli (Suresh 2010, Surh 1995, Tominaga 1998 ).   
Capsaicin exposure  to TRPV -1-expressing nociceptor peripheral terminals  results in initial 
excitation of the nociceptor followed by a functional desensitization which continues for some 
time after removal of capsaicin from the site.  Capsaicin, however, is virtually insoluble in 
aqueous media  or local anesthetic solu tions which means that capsaicin formulations tend to be 
quite hydrophobic and viscous making them hard to inject and less likely to permeate surgical 
site tissues.  Anesiva, which had been developing capsaicin for the management of post -surgical 
pain and osteoarthritis, solubilized capsaicin in polyethylene glycol  300 (Hartrick  2011 ).  The 
product was instilled into the open surgical site and after waiting for 5 minutes, was removed via 
surgical suction.  This route of administration while simple and perhaps convenient , limited 
exposure of capsaicin only to the exposed surfaces of cut tissue and bone  with little to no ability 
to penetrate into the af fected soft tissues . 
To work around the solubility limitations of capsaicin, t he highly water soluble capsaicin pro -
drug CA -008 was developed for local infiltration .  It avoids  the physicochemical limitations of 
capsaicin while providing greater target engagement which theoretically would produce superior 
local analgesia , particularly after surgical trauma .  Based upon this mechanism of action, local 
delivery of a TRPV1 agonist throughout the tissues around the  surgical site prior to wound  
closure to maximize target engagement should result in a meaningful reduction of post -surgical 
pain over several days to weeks.  This improved long -term pain relief  has the ability to augment 
current multimodal analgesia or enhanced recovery programs whic h may help to avoid the need 
for supplemental opioid use after surgery.  
While no capsaicin products have been approved for injection or instillation into a wound site in 
the US, several companies have or had clinical development programs for such products .  
Centrexion Therapeutics has an active development program (CTNX -4975) for intraarticular 
injection of capsaicin for chronic osteoarthritis  and Morton’s neuroma (see 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 29 of 105 http://centrexion.com/our -pipeline/ ).  Note that Centrexion is using the Anesiva highly viscous 
polyethylene glycol formulation for its intraarticular knee joint injections.  
5.2. CA-008 Product Introduction  
The active moiety of CA -008, capsaicin, has certain attractive properties for treatment o f post -
operative pain from a pharmaceutical perspective.  CA-008 is water soluble and easy to inject 
through a 25 g needle or larger.  It readily penetrates surgical site tissues where it releases 
capsaicin through a non -enzymatic pH -driven process.  Local  administration of CA -008 at or 
near the source of pain either topically, by infiltration or by instillation into a surgical site results 
in low systemic levels of capsaicin.   
CA-008 was created to improve delivery of capsaicin without having to account f or its poor  
solubility profile in tissues.  CA -008 provides an aqueous formulation that could be simply 
infiltrated in the wound site to achieve local capsaicin release to produce a maximal effect.  The 
free base form of CA-008 rapidly breaks down  at physi ological pH to yield capsaicin and a 
cyclic urea,  as shown in the scheme below:  
 
CA-008 was specifically selected for development due to its short half -life (<5 min) at neutral 
pH.  In Tris buffer at pH 7.4 and 37°C, it completely breaks apart to capsaicin and CA -101 as the 
sole degradants.  
The cyclic urea (CA-101) formed has not been previously evaluated for biological activity.  
While not a known compound in the clinical literature, its safety was evaluated in all nonclinical 
studies with CA -008 and it was shown to be inactive.  The toxicokinetic profiles for CA -008, 
CA-101, and capsaicin were determined in GLP safety studies  and the PK profile for various 
doses were determined in a Phase 1 ascending dose safety study in patients undergoing 
bunion ectomy . 
5.3. Previous Human experience  
There is substantial clinical support for the potential safety of capsaicin, the active molecule 
released by CA -008 in vivo.  In addition to consumption in hot spicy foods (chili peppers), 
capsaicin is an approved product for dermal applications for OTC and prescription use (Qutenza; 
8% patch for management of neuropathic pain associated with post herpetic neuralgia) , is 
frequently used intradermally in experimental pain models,  and has been studied clinically for 
wound ins tillation for postsurgical analgesia (Anesiva; Adlea; capsaicin for instillation).

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 30 of 105 5.3.1.  Study CA -PS-201 (Bunionectomy)  
A first-in-human study (Study CA -PS-2017 -101) evaluated  the safety and tolerability of CA -008 
in subjects undergoing a unilateral transpositi onal first metatarsal osteotomy for correction of 
hallux valgus deformity, more commonly known as a  bunionectomy.  This study also evaluated 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary efficacy assessment of CA -008 to inform future studies in 
our clinical develop ment plan.   This study was originally designed to look at 4 different doses of 
CA-008 (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg) , however based upon the relatively benign adverse 
event (AE) profile, the Data Management Committee gave the go -ahead for a 5th cohort (4.2 mg) 
to be added .  The safety, efficacy and PK results for the Phase 1 bunionectomy study are shown 
in the current Investigators’ Brochure.    
Additionally, a follow -on Phase 2 bunionectomy study (CA -PS-201) was completed with 147 
subjects enrol led and randomized to one of 3 active doses: 0.05 mg/mL (0.7 mg), 0.15 mg/mL 
(2.1 mg) and 0.3 mg/mL (4.2 mg) vs. placebo in a 1:1:1:1 randomization, respectively.  The 
results are still being compiled at the time of this protocol amendment.  Based upon top line 
results, the highest dose of 4.2 mg was statistically significantly superior to placebo for the 
primary efficacy endpoint of AUC 0 -96h (p=0.005) and key secondary efficacy endpoints: AUC 
0 to week 1 (p=0.036); mean opioid consumption (reduced by 50%, p<0.002); and percent of 
subjects who were opioid free from 0 to 96h (26% vs. 5% for placebo; p=0.039).  The following 
Tables 2 -7 show the summary of safety for the study based upon summary tables and subject 
listings.  Note that in Table 3, the Summary of  TEAEs by MedDRA SOC/PT, there were a 
number of preferred terms that were somewhat vague, so these are accompanied by footnotes 
detailing the verbatim terms to provide background context.

5.3.2.  Study CA -PS-204 (Abdominopl asty)  
Preliminary unblinded safety data was made available with an interim data snapshot after the 
first cohort (5 mg) was completed.  For this cohort, 18 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 
100 mL infiltration of either 5 mg CA -008 or placebo vehicle in the setting of standard of care 
treatments including a a general anesthetic supplemented with a transverse abdominis plane 
(TAP) block , intraoperative IV opioids and intraoperative IV acetaminophen . 
There were 8/9 subjects in each treatment group who experienced TEAEs: 28 in the placebo 
group and 26 in the CA -008 group.  There was one SAE of a deep venous thrombosis in the 
active group which occurred on day 10 after surgery and was deemed unrelated and moderate in 
severity.  There were no severe events.  Most TEAEs were moderate in severity: 20/28 in the 
placebo group and 20/26 in the active group.  Most TEAEs were deemed unrelated.  There were 
5/28 possibly related events in the placebo group (all nausea events)  and 2/26 possible related in 
the active group (one each of pruritus – mild and nausea – moderate).  The most frequent TEAEs 
in descending order were:  
• Placebo:  nausea – 14; low back pain – 5; vomiting, constipation and hypoxia at 2 each and 
the rest single  events  
• CA-008: nausea – 9; headache – 5; low back pain – 3; constipation – 3; and the rest were 
single events  
5.4. Study Rationale  
CA-008 is being investigated as a potential therapy for treatment of pain following surgery.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 42 of 105 5.5. Dose  Rationale  
5.5.1.   Selection of Doses  
The safety of CA -008 was established in relevant animal models and supported by two studies 
after bunionectomy (CA-PS-2017 -101 and CA -PS-201) and knowledge from prior human 
studies with an injectable formulation of c apsaicin.  Taken together, the characte rization of the 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology profiles are considered sufficient to support the 
intended use of CA -008 in th is study.  
5.5.2.  Selection and Timing of Dose  
CA-008 is a pH labile prodrug of capsaicin that rapidly releases capsaicin a fter administration 
into tissue.   Decision for single administration at the time of surgery is based on capsaicin’s 
mechanism of action. Capsaicin exposure results in initial excitation followed by a functional 
desensitization of TRPV -1-expressing nocicep tors which continues for some time after removal 
of capsaicin from the site.   Administration while the patient is under anesthesia for the 
procedure supplemented by a regional local anesthetic block or local anesthetic infiltration 
addresses the pain that  results from TRPV1 agonism.  Administration of CA -008 during the  
closure process is ideal for delivering therapy to the surgical site, thus optimizing target 
engagement.  During closure, the surgical tissue is exposed and visible which allows for  
complete  and adequate delivery of CA-008 (and capsaicin)  to the potential areas where noxious 
pain is being generated.

7.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 2, single -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel  design 
study  consisting of  three  exploratory cohorts  of 18 subjects each : a single dose  of CA -008 at 5.0 
mg, 10 mg or 15 mg  vs. placebo each in 100 mL of vehicle , randomized 1:1 in the first cohort 
and 2:1, respectively, in cohorts 2 and 3 , and an optional 4th cohort may be enrolled with a total 
N=24 randomized 1:1 to CA -008 or pl acebo at a dose between 5 mg and 15 mg as determined 
based upon results from cohorts #1 -3. 
For each subject, the postoperative  assessments will be conducted in two parts:  
• Inpatient period  which  starts with completion of study treatment injection (T0) and continues 
through  96h (T96h ).    
• Outpatient period which begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through various follow 
up visits to day 29 (D29) or week 4 (W4) after surgery, or later if ne cessary for ongoing 
safety assessments.  Note that additional follow up visits could occur after D29/W4 to follow 
adverse events (AEs) to resolution or establishment of a new baseline.  
7.2. Study Stopping Rules  
Study enrollment will be paused  if subjects  experience intolerable at least possibly related 
TEAEs, as defined:  
• 1 or more subjects with any grade 4 “related” TEAE in any of the categories shown in the 
table below  
• 2 or more subjects with the same grade 3 “related” TEAE in any of the categories shown

9.1. Study Treatment  
Complete details of study drug packaging, storage, dispensation, preparation and tracking are 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
9.1.1.  CA-008 HCl Description  
CA-008, provided as the hydrochloride salt is a white solid, highly soluble in water.  It degrades 
rapidly to capsaicin at neutral pH but is stable for several days at room temperature in aqueous 
solution at pH~3.  Capsaicin is known to be irritating to mucous membranes when aerosolized 
and is a skin irritant . 
9.1.2.  Study Treatment Description  
The active drug product will be provided as CA-008 frozen concentrate s olution for injection in a 
1.0 mL vial with doses calculated as the freebase.   
The placebo comparator is identical in appearance.  
The proposed dose of CA -008 to be evaluated in the study are:  
• Cohort #1: CA -008 5 mg vs. placebo in 100 mL of vehicle  
• Cohort #2: CA -008 10 mg vs. placebo in 100 mL of vehicle  
• Cohort #3: CA -008 15 mg  vs. placebo in 100 mL of vehicle  
• Optional 4th cohort with a total N=24 randomized 1:1 to CA -008 or placebo at a dose 
between 5 mg and 15 mg as determined based upon results from cohorts #1 -3 
At time of use, the concentrate will be completely reconstituted in saline and used for treatment 
(see the Pha rmacy Manual).  All study treatment vials are unblinded and the dose (for CA -008) 
or placebo will be identified on the vial label .  The pharmacist reconstituting the study treatment 
for administration is unblinded, however the surgeon and other site partic ipants are blinded.  
9.1.3.  Study Treatment Storage  
Study treatments will be shipped to sites and stored at -20°C (-15°C to -30°C) until the day of 
surgery.   All study treatment  should be stored in a secured area and in accordance with the 
product labeling and all  applicable laws, regulations, and local/institutional requirements.  A 
description of storage conditions for all investigational products will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 51 of 105 9.1.4.  Study Treatment Accountability  
All study treatment  will be transported, received, stored, and handled strictly in accordance with 
the container or product label, the instructions provided to the research site, and applicable 
regulations.  Detailed drug accountability records must be maintained, including the dates 
shipments are received, the quantity of material received, the dates dispensed and the running 
inventory.  The unused quantities will be returned to the Sponsor’s drug supply vendor at the end 
of the trial. All unused supplies will be checked aga inst the drug accountability records during 
the study and/or at the end of the study. The Investigator or designee must maintain an inventory 
record of all dispensed rescue medications to subjects. Additional details are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
Only eligible subjects participating in the study will receive the study treatment . Only authorized 
research site staff may supply, prepare or administer the study treatment s. Once dispensed, study 
treatment  may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by othe r subjects.  
9.1.5.  Control of Study Treatment and Rescue Medication  
Mishandling, potential theft, significant loss of clinical supplies, including study treatments, 
systemic  analgesia medications and rescue medication s at the site, or other suspected diversion 
must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first knowledge of the issue. If 
diversion is confirmed or suspected (e.g., excessive use of rescue medications), the study staff 
will be required to complete a clinical supply documentation form, including information related 
to situations in which  a subject sold drug or gave drug to a friend or relative, there is a 
discrepancy in drug accountability and suspected diversion, or a subject had drug stole n, or if 
there was diversion or theft by site  staff or others.  
9.2. Other Interventions  
Note that if any standard of care drugs are unavailable, for example due to stock outages, 
available clinically equivalent alternatives may be substituted, particularly for the protocol -
specified drugs in Section 9.2.1 and 9.2.2, after approval of the medical monitor who should 
notify Sponsor of said substitution.  
9.2.1.  Intraoperative  and Early Postoperative Analgesia  
Within 30 min of anesthesia induction give the subject IV hydro morphone 0.02 mg/kg  and IV 
acetaminophen 1 g (Ofirmev®, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals 2018) full prescribing information 
at http://ofirmev.com/ .  
During the surgery, ensure that each subject has received at least 100 mcg of IV fentanyl with 
adjustments above this dose per anesthesiologist discretion.  
Within 15 min of the end of surgery, give the subject IV hydromorphone 0.007  mg/kg. 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 52 of 105 9.2.1.  Inpatient Rescue Medications  
After surgery, subjects will be monitored in the post -anesthes ia care unit (PACU) during which 
time efficacy asssessments can begin once the subject is awake.  During th e PACU stay 
administer the subject IV fentanyl 25 -50 mcg q5 min prn for moderate -to-severe pain (≥ 4) as 
reported by subjects using the 0 to 10 numer ical rating scale of current pain intensity (NRS).  
After discharge from the PACU, subjects are followed through T96h as an inpatient.  
From the time of discharge from the PACU through T12h administer IV hydromorphone 0. 2 to 
0.5 mg q 10-15 min prn for NRS ≥  4 as reported by subjects.  
After T12h, administer PO oxycodone 5 mg q2h prn moderate pain (NRS ≥ 4 and ≤ 6) or 10 mg 
q2h prn severe pain (NRS ≥ 7).   
Subjects will be encouraged to rescue only for moderate pain scores ( NRS ≥ 4), however rescue 
may be requested at any time and medication will be prov ided when requested.  
9.2.2.  Outpatient Analgesic Medications  
Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be instructed to take a 
combination of over -the-counter (OTC) analgesics at an appropriate dose per medical judgment 
to manage any residual or breakthrough postsurgical pain.  
If needed for pain management, acetaminophen up to 1000 mg prn tid /qid (3g daily maximum 
limit) will be recommended for subjects to self -administer (note that this medications will not be 
provided by the Sponsor).  
If a subject is still requiring opioid rescue in the 12h prior to discharge from the inpatient unit 
(i.e., from T84h on regardless of whether discharge is delayed) , then prescribe no more than 9 
tablet s of oxycodone 5 mg (1 PO tid prn) per investigator discretion  for the initial outpatient 
period . 
Persistent pain or pain exacerbations during this period may suggest the need for an unscheduled 
in-person visit to assess the surgical site.  If such a situa tion occurs, the Investigator should use 
clinical discretion on adequacy of analgesic treatment, but capture this event as an AE and 
document any required treatments.  
9.3. Method of Assigning Subjects  to Treatment Groups  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias  in the assignment o f subject s to treatment s, to increase 
the likelihoo d that known and unknown subject  attributes (e.g., demographics, baseline 
characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of 
statistical compar isons across treatment groups.  
Subjects  who have provided written informed consent will be assigned a unique number in the 
screening process. This number will be used to identify the  subject  throughout the study.  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 53 of 105 In the Pilot Stage, 18 subjects will be ra ndomized to either the active medication  or placebo in a 
1:1 ratio.  Subsequently, the number of active treatment groups and sample size will  be 
determined  after the interim unblinded analysis of topline data from the Pilot Stage . 
Once any subject  number or randomization number is assigned, it cannot be  reassigned to any 
other subject . This study will use manual  randomization.  
Subjects may be rescreened if the screening window is exceeded due to scheduling issues.  
9.4. Blinding  
In order to reduce the p otential for bias in the study, treatment group ass ignments will be double -
blinded during the study . Aside from the unblinded pharmacist who reconstitutes the study 
treatment for administration by the surgeon, t he subject, surgeon and all other study parti cipants, 
including the  Sponsor , directly involved in the conduct and/or monitoring of this study will not 
be aware of the treatment group assignments.  Note that t he placebo is identical in appearance to 
CA-008. 
Under normal circumstances, the blind will not be broken until all participants have completed 
treatment. In case of emergency, and only if the information is required by the Investigator to 
ensure subject’s safety in managing a medical condition, the treatment may be unblinded at the 
site by using  a code break module.  The code break module will be provided by the Sponsor or 
designee. If possible, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor prior to unblinding and after 
any actions have been taken. Whenever a treatment sequence is prematurely unbli nded, the 
reason, date and time of the unblinding, and the individual who broke the blind must be 
documented. Individual code breaks will result in withdrawal of the participant from the study.  
It is assumed that the need to unblind a study subject’s treat ment assignment will occur in the 
setting of an SAE, and therefore, all procedures for the reporting of a SAE must be followed . 
9.5. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All non -study medications, including prescription, over -the-counter, or herbal therapies, used by 
the subject  will be documented for the 30 days prior to Screening and throughout the study. The 
Investigator will determine if the prior/concomitant medication(s) affect the subject’s eligibility 
to participate or continue to participate in the study.  
On a case -by-case basis, the Investigator is permitted to allow the use of some concomitant 
medications, for example, to treat an AE, as long as the Investigator determines that the 
medication will not affect the subject ’s safety or study integrity. Wherever possible, the 
Investigator should obtain approval from the Medical Monitor prior to administering the 
medication.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 54 of 105 9.6. Study Restrictions  
In addition to the criteria described in Sections 8.2, 9.5, and 10.1.2  the subject must agree to 
abide by the following study restrictions:  
Abstain from the following during the inpatient portion of the study:  
▪ consuming any alcohol  
▪ smoking or vaping (nicotine -containing or other substances)  
▪ illicit drug use or non -medical use of therapeutic drugs not allowed by the protocol  
▪ any foods containing capsaicin for 24 hours prior to PK blood draws  
Abstain from the following during the outp atient portion of the study:

day of alcohol  
▪ Subjects will be asked to abstain from illicit drug use or non -medical use of therapeutic drugs  
▪ Subjects will be asked to abstain from taking prohibited medications  
9.7. Treatment Compliance  
Because all study medication  is being administered by  study personnel, no compliance 
procedures are necessary. Diversion  will be monitored and recorded  through  rescue medication  
accountability . Any suspected or confirmed diversion will be documented and reported.

10.1.2.2.  Surgery Day 0  
The surgery is to be performed under general anesthesia supplemented by a transverse abdominis 
plane (TAP) block  with bupivacaine  hydrochloride  (Bupi HCl).  Note that the regimen for the 
general anesthetic is left to the anesthesiologists’ discretion.  Prior to the surgery, perform the 
TAP block as a single injection of 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCl) 60 mL (150 mg).  
Refer to Section  17.12  Appendix  L for bupivac aine dosage recommendations.   The volume 
windows for the bupivacaine  injection  is ± 2 mL.  
During the surgery, ensure that each subject has received at least 100 mcg of IV fentanyl with 
adjustments above this dose per anesthesiologist discretion.  
Upon completion of surgery, subjects will be observed for 96-hours in the clinic. AEs will be 
assessed during the surgery.  
10.1.3.  Surgery Phase : Administration of Study Medication  Into the Surgical Site  
The “surgical site” is defined as the area extending approximately 2 -3 cm in all directions 
(lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the incision  and surrounding tissues which may be 
affected by the infiltration of the study drug .  Study treatment is to  be administered 
intraoperatively as a single administration via “surgical site” infiltration  prior to wound closure .  
A total of 100 mL of study treatment will be infiltrated into the deep peri -incisional 
subcutaneous tissues  and rectus fascia within the exposed incision surfaces.    
10.1.4.  Inpatient Phase : Time 0  (Post -Surgery) to Day 4  (Discharge)  
Time 0 is defined as the time of completion of study drug administration. Following surgery, 
subjects will be transferred to the appropriate recovery unit where they will undergo an 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 57 of 105 assessment of safety and efficacy over the next 96 hours. The schedule of assessments are as 
follows:  
• Subjects with inadequately controlled pain may request rescue at any time; however, subjects 
will be encouraged to receive rescue medication only w ith an N RS ≥ 4.        
• Pain intensity (assessed with NRS):   
o During the inpatient stay, beginning with the PACU admission and after the subject is 
awake: assess the NRS at rest at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours , and every 4 
hours (if awake at time of assessment) until discharge from the inpatient unit.  Time 
windows: for T0.5 to T2 (±5 min) and from T4 onward (±15 min).  
o Pain scores may be skipped between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m., but the subject 
may not miss two consecutive assessments.   The T12, T24, T48, T72 and T96h 
assessments must be completed even if the subject is asleep at these times.  
o Pain intensity (NRS) will be completed at the time of rescue medication request ( ±15 
minutes).      
o During the inpatient stay, starting on postoperative day 1: each morning on arising  at 
0800h (±2h) and each evening at 2000h (±2h)  document the NRS at rest and on arising 
from a recumbent  position to a sitting or standing position.  Actual assessment times  
must be documented.   These assessments are in addition to the time -specific NRS 
assessments at rest .  If however these twice daily assessments coincide with timed 
assessments of NRS at rest, then the time assessment at rest is used in place of the twice 
daily assessments.  
• Vital signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], respiratory rate [RR]) and temperature are 
assessed together  at screening, D0 prior to surgery, post -surgery at T1, T2, T4, T6, T12, and 
T24h, and every 8 hours thereafter until T96h, and as an outpatient on D8/W1, D15/W2, and 
D29/W4 or later if necessary.  Assessments between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 may be 
skipped if the subject is sleeping; however, two conse cutive assessments may not be skipped.  
The allowable window is ±5 minutes for the first 4 hours post -surgery, and ±15 minutes for 
all other times.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 62 of 105 10.2. Subject Completion and Withdrawal  
10.2.1.  Subject Completion  
A subject is considered to have completed the study once all end -of-study assessments are 
completed at D29 (or later if necessary ), or at the last visit upon early termination of the study.  
10.2.2.  Subject Withdrawal  
A subject is free to withdraw his/her consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time 
for any reason. A subject’s participation must therefore be terminated immediately upon his/her 
request,  and the reason(s) for discontinuation appropriately documented.  
A subject may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
▪ Safety reasons, including AEs or significant concomitant illness, injury, or urgent 
surgeries/procedures that wo uld, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant extent, require discontinuation of study drug, or both  
▪ At the request of the Sponsor, regulatory agency, or Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
▪ Subject is lost to  follow -up 
▪ Subject treatment allocation is unblinded (i.e., individual code break; Section 9.4) 
▪ Death of subject  
A subject may also be discontinued from the study, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or 
Sponsor, for any of the following reasons:  
▪ Subject refuses or is unable to adhere to the study protocol  
▪ Major protocol violation  
▪ Pregnancy  
▪ Use of unacceptable concomitant medication(s)  
▪ It is not  considered in the best interest of the subject to continue  
▪ Administrative reasons (e.g., termination of enrollment or study)  
The Investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who discontinue from the study prior to 
completion; the reason(s) for stud y discontinuation will be documented. In the event that a 
subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to 
obtain and record the reason(s) for withdrawal in as much detail as possible, although the subject 
is not obligated to provide such a reason.  
Subjects who elect to discontinue participation prior to D8 (W1) will be considered to have 
terminated as of the date of their election, however they will be asked to return to the site one 
time, if willing and at their convenience, to ensure wound healing.  If a subject refuses to 
complete early termination/Follow -up procedures or continued data collection, this information 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 63 of 105 will be recorded.  
10.3. Study Procedures  and Assessments  
10.3.1.  Informed Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by the 
Investigator or designated study personnel. The subject must voluntarily provide written 
informed consent on an ethics -approved informed consent form (ICF), prior to performing any 
study -related procedures. The subject’s source  records must document that the consent process 
has been completed and that written informed consent has been obtained from the subject prior 
to the initiation of any study -specific procedures. Documentation that the s ubject was given 
adequate time to ask the Investigator (or designee) questions about their participation in the study 
and that a signed and dated copy of the ICF was provided to the subject should also be included 
in the medical records or clinical chart.  
10.3.2.  Demographics  
The following demographics will be recorded: age (birthdate), sex, race, and ethnicity.  
10.3.3.  Medical and Surgical History  
The complete medical and surgical history will include histories of acute, chronic, or infectious 
disease; surgical or oncolo gic histories; and any reported conditions affecting major body 
systems. All findings on medical history will be evaluated by the Investigator for clinical 
significance.  
10.3.4.  Medication History  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription, herbal medicat ions/natural health products, 
or investigational drugs) taken by the subjects during the 30 days prior to Screening will be 
recorded in the source documentation as medication history.  
10.3.5.  Contraceptive Requirements  
Female subjects of childbearing potential mu st be using and willing to continue using medically 
acceptable contraception during the study unless they have a same sex partner.  Examples of 
medically acceptable forms of contraception include true abstinence, hormonal contraceptives 
(combined oral pill , patch or vaginal ring, intrauterine device or system, progestin implant or 
injection), bilateral tubal ligation, or double -barrier methods (i.e., male condom in addition to a 
diaphragm or a contraceptive sponge).  
Female subjects of non -childbearing pote ntial are not required to use contraception or undergo 
pregnancy tests; however, they must be surgically sterile ( e.g., hysterectomy and/or bilateral 
oophorectomy or salpingo -oophorectomy, as determined by subject medical history) or 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 64 of 105 congenitally sterile, or must be post -menopausal. Post -menopausal is defined as being 
amenorrheic for at least one year without another cause.  
Male subjects, unless in a relationship with a same sex partner or a female partner who is of non -
childbearing potential (see above), must either be sterile (surgically or biologically) or commit to 
using double -barrier methods (i.e., male condom in addition to a diaphragm or a contraceptive 
sponge)  during the study .   
10.3.6.  Subject Pain Assessment Training  
Subjects will undergo study participation education on pain assessments and written testing 
procedures according to the Schedule of Study Procedures.  
10.3.7.  Digital Photographs  of the Surgical Site  
During the informed consent process, subjects will be asked if they are willing  to allow digital 
photographs to be taken  of the surgical site . This is optional and their response will in no way 
affect their inclusion in the study. Their response will be included on the ICF.  
10.3.8.  Numerical Rating Scale for Pain Intensity  (NRS ) 
The NRS  is an 11 -point scale with anchors 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst possible pain)  (Section 17.2 
Appendix B).   
Subjects will report or record the intensity of their curr ent pain at designated  times  during the 
study after  administration of study treatment .  Subjects should be at rest for at least 5-10 minutes 
prior to completing NRS  resting assessment  and have sat or stood up from a recumbent position 
within the 5 -10 minut es prior to completing NRS assessment after this change in position .   
10.3.9.  Rebound Pain at the Surgical Site  
Subjects will be queried at each outpatient follow up visit as to whether they have noted any 
worsening pain (rebound pain) at the surgical site since the prior visit report ( Section 17.3 
Appendix C) . 
10.3.10.  Patient Global Evaluation (PGE)  
Each  subject will be asked to report their satisfaction with the s tudy treatment for pain using a 4 -
point categorical scale .  Each subject will be asked the following question:  
“How would you rate the study treatment  that you have received for pain? Poor (0), Fair (1), 
Good (2), or Excellent (3)”  (see Section 17.4 Appendix D).

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 65 of 105 10.3.11.  Investigator Global Evaluation (IGE)  
The investigator will report their satisfaction with the subject’s study treatment for pain using a 
4-point scal e at designated  times  during the study after  administration of study treatment .  A 
study Investigator will be asked the following question:  
“How would you rate the study treatment  that the patient received for pain? Poor (0), Fair (1), 
Good (2), or Excellent (3) ” (see Section 17.5 Appendix E). 
10.3.12.  Rescue Medications  
The details of rescue medication (doses and times) will be recorded beginning from the end of 
surgery through 14 days after the end of surgery (D15 visit) or to Early Termination Visit  if 
applicable .  Subjects will be instructed on the proper use and timing of rescue medication.  Use 
Table 9 to calculate the morphine equivalent dose (MED) of various opioids.  
Table 9. Equianalgesic Conversion Table  
Opioid (Doses in mg)  Conversion Factor  
IV Fentanyl  0.3 
PO Hydrocodone  1 
PO Hydromorphone  4 
PO Morphine  1 
PO Oxycodone  1.5 
PO Tramadol  0.1 
Multiply the opioid dose by the conversion factor = oral morphine equivalent dose 
(MED):  
e.g., PO oxycodone 5 mg  X 1.5 = 7.5  mg MED  
or 
IV fentanyl 25 mcg X 0. 3 = 7.5 mg MED  
10.3.13.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments   
All protocol -specified laboratory tests on blood and urine samples will be collected, processed, 
shipped and analyzed according to instructions from a selected cent ral labor atory . The lab will 
generate laboratory reports and forward them to the clinical site in a timely manner. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to review and sign all lab reports expeditiously, in order to 
document appropriate safety monitoring of s tudy subjects. The Investigator should sign and date 
each lab report concurrent with her or his review, and should indicate the clinical significance of 
each abnormal/flagged value by noting “NCS” (not clinically significant) or “CS” (clinically 
significan t), for example. Notations indicating that a value is clinically significant should also 
include a brief description of the underlying disease or condition that is associated with the 
value, e.g., “CS/mild anemia ”.  In general , and as determined by the inv estigator , abnormal,

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 66 of 105 clinically significant laboratory values are expected to be associated with an item recorded in 
medical history or with an AE.  
Additional laboratory samples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator if the results of 
any tests  fall outside reference ranges or clinical symptoms necessitate testing to ensure safety.

a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to surgery  for women of childbearing potential . 
ALT or AST > 3x ULN / Tot. Bili > 2 X ULN/ A LK >2X ULN will be considered an adverse 
event, as well as any other changes deemed clinically significant by the Investigator.   
10.3.14.  Urine Drug Screen and Alcohol Test  
Urine drug sc reen and alcohol breath /saliva  tests will be completed  at screening  and pre -
procedure . All subjects will be tested for drugs -of-abuse ( e.g., amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol, methadone, 
meth amphetamine, tricyclic anti -depressants, oxycodone and others ).

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 67 of 105 10.3.15.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will consist of  BP, HR, and RR  and temperature following a rest period. Vital signs 
will be assessed per the Schedule Assessments.    
10.3.16.  12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
12-Lead EC Gs will be performed per the Schedule of Assessments after the subject  has been 
resting in a recumbent/supine position for at least 5 minutes. The ECG variables will include 
ventricular heart rate and the PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals. ECGs will  be signed and dated 
by a medically -qualified individual to confirm review of the ECG and verify whether any 
abnormalities are clinically significant. In general, abnormal, clinically significant ECGs are 
expected to be associated with an item recorded in medical history (e.g., at Screening) or with an 
AE (if it occurred post study treatment) .  Note that for QTc, clinically significant changes in 
ECG (using  QTCf , should be <450 msec  for male subjects  / < 470 msec for female subjects .  
Clinically significant changes in ECG are: an increase of QT cF of 30msec or greater, as well as 
any other changes deemed by the Investigator  as significant  will be considered an AE. 
10.3.17.  Physical Examination  
A complete PE including all major body systems (HEENT,  neurologic , cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, dermatologic and musculoskeletal systems) will be performed at Screening .  A 
focused interim or targeted PE will be performed pre -surgery and after surgery  during the inpatient 
and outpatient periods  as per Table 1.  
Body weight (kg ), in indoor clothing, but without shoes , will be measured at Scre ening  and 96 
hours.  Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured, and BMI will be calculated at Screening 
only. BMI shall be calculated as kg/m2.  The site should use NIH website BMI calculator 
(available at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi -m.htm . 
10.3.18.  Surgical  Site Assessment   
The s urgical site should be assessed per the Schedule of Assessments  to determine if any site 
related AEs have occurred.   The investigator will evaluate their satisfaction with the healing of 
the wound during this Surgical Site assessment using an 11 -point scale (0 -10) where a score of 0 
is “Completely unsatisfied,” and a score of 10 is “Completely satisfied.” (Section 17.6 Appendix 
F).  Assessments will also be performed  at each of the Follow -up visits  or at the time of early 
discontinuation. When assessed on Day 29, if the Investigator observes insufficient wound or bone 
healing  or to ensure an ongoing AE has resolved , the subject will be scheduled for a follow -up 
visit.  
If  there are skin reactions atypical for the type of surgery, e.g., more than expected erythema, 
drainage, bruising or hematoma, induration, swelling or other skin changes, they should be 
documented as AEs, graded for severity and followed regularly until re solution or establishment 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 68 of 105 of a new baseline  (the grading guide for atypical wound findings may be useful to the 
investigator: Section 17.7 Appendix  G). 
10.3.19.  Neurosensory Testing  
A Neurosensory testing  of the skin surrounding the incision will be conducted per the Schedule 
of Events .  This evaluation will include the details described i n Section 17.8 Appendix H.  
Numbness or other sensory changes  at or near the incision need not be considered a neurologic 
AE since th ese could occur because of tissue trauma and inflammation from  surgery.  
Sensory deficits or clinically significant persistent sensory change beyond the area proximal to 
the incision at time of discharge, such as allodynia  or hyperalgesia, must be designated as a 
neurologic AE.  Subjects will be followed until there is full ret urn to baseline for the 
neurosensory assessment or until there is a determination that it has reached a resolution or 
establishment of a new baseline  
10.3.20.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
All SAEs and non-serious AEs will be documented and followed from the time of  administration 
of study treatment until Day 29 or until resolution or establishment of a new baseline .  AEs that 
occur between Screening and the surgery  should be considered medical history, and be added to 
the subject’s medical record , unless related to a study procedure . Serious AEs and AEs that have 
been designated as possibly related to study drug will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization. Further details on AEs, including definitions, elicitation, and reporting are provided 
in Section  11. 
10.3.21.  Pharmacokinetic Assessments  and Samples  
Details for the collection and processing of blood samples for measu rement of PK (CA -008, 
Capsaicin , and CA-101) and urine collections are outlined in the Lab Manual.

11.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The following definitions, developed in accordance with the United States (US) Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Clinical Safety 
Data Management Guidance for Industry, E2A, will be used to identify AEs  in this study.  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., includi ng an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or increase in severity of a preexisting abnormality, temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
A “suspected adverse reaction” means any AE for which there is a reasonable  possibility that the 
drug caused the event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.   
11.1.1.  Relationship  to Study Treatment  
A qualified investigator must make the determination of relationship to the investigational 
product for each AE.  The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event m ay have been caused by the study treatment.   
 
Causality 
Category  Description  
Unlikely related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration which  makes a causal 
relationship improbable or if other drugs, chemicals or underlying 
disease provide more plausible  explanations.  
While temporal sequence may be an important factor in determining 
causality: i.e., whether the observed reaction or event began after the 
study treatment, it may well be that the surgery, anesthesia, a concurrent 
medical condition or concomitant medications administered during or 
after surgery were more likely than not to be responsible for the AE.  
The investigator should use clinical judgment to evaluate the evidence 
and determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that study 
treatment actually cause d the AE or whether based upon the evidence it 
is more likely that something else is responsible.  If the former, choose 
“possibly related” and if the latter, “unlikely related.”   
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 71 of 105 For the purpose of this protocol, the term “unlikely related” will be 
consi dered an AE not related to study treatment.  
Possibly related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration, which also may be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemi cals.  In such 
cases, if the investigator using clinical judgment is unable to rule out a 
reasonable possibility that study treatment was partly responsible, then 
choose “possibly related.”  
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has possible rela tionship 
to study treatment will be defined as a “Suspected Adverse Drug 
Reaction”.   
Probably related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration, in which the investigator 
has de termined that the event is unlikely to be attributed to other 
factors.    
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has probable relationship 
to study treatment will be defined as an “Adverse Drug Reaction”.  
 
11.1.2.  Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs must be entered on the AE CRF, regardless of causality or severity. AEs include new 
AEs, worsening baseline conditions, clinically significant laboratory findings, disease -related 
signs and symptoms that were not present at baseline, and any events or findings tha t the 
Investigator feels are clinically significant.  
Disease -related signs and symptoms that are present at baseline should not be recorded as AEs 
unless they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.  
Information collected concerning AEs will include th e following:  
▪ Name of the event  
▪ Onset date  
▪ Resolution date  
▪ Severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe or potentially life -threatening)  
▪ Relationship to study treatment  
▪ Action and outcome  
▪ Seriousness of event  
All SAEs will be documented and followed from the time  the subject has signed the ICF until 
D29±2 after the completion of surgery.  All SAEs and non -serious AEs will be documented and 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 72 of 105 followed from the time of administration of study treatment until Day 29 or later  if necessary. 
AEs that occur between Screening and the administration of study medication should be 
considered medical history and added to the subject’s medical record, unless the AE is due to a 
study -related procedure (such as phlebotomy), in which case  it will be recorded as a non -
treatment emergent AE.  Serious AEs and AEs that have been designated as possibly related to 
study treatment will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
11.1.3.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE or reaction is any adverse dru g experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
▪ Death  
▪ Is life -threatening (at the time of the event)  
▪ Requires subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
▪ Results in persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity  
▪ Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in an offspring)  
▪ An Important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
All AEs requiring hospitalization or prolongation of a pre -existing hospitalization should be 
reported as SAEs un less they occur ≥ 14 days after the Day 29 visit, or 21 days after an early 
termination AND are not considered to be study treatment -related by the Investigator.  
Hospitalizations meeting the following criteria will not be reported as an SAE but must be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF: study specified hospitalization, short -term administrative 
hospitalization for procedures, tests or treatments of conditions that would not otherwise 
constitute an SAE, elective hospitalizations.  
11.1.3.1.  Serious Adverse Event Reportin g 
Serious AEs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event. All SAEs that occur while a subject is receiving study treatment and within 14 days 
following the study completion visit (or 21 days following an ET if app licable) are reportable 
within 24 hours. During this follow -up period beyond study completion or after an ET, only 
those SAEs considered to be possibly related to study treatment should be reported within 24 
hours.  
The procedure for reporting an SAE is as follows:  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 73 of 105 ▪ All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) by email to the CRO 
Medical Monitor or designee.  Calls related to SAEs should first be directed to the CRO 
Medical Monitor or designee.  
o CRO Medical Monitor: Jon Ruckle, MD  
o 24/7 Emergency contact: 808-349-9812 /  (253) 448 -8690  
o SAE Reporting email: MedicalMonitorCA -PS-204@Lotuscr.com  
▪ The Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor is available for questions about safety -related issues:  
Mike A. Royal, MD JD MBA; 858 -204-1112 or mike@concentric analgesics.com.  
▪ The initial report should include all information known at the time of the report (additional 
information can be reported as discovered). Do not delay the initial reporting in order to 
obtain resolution or follow -up information.  
▪ The site wi ll enter into the electronic database (or fax, if the database cannot be accessed for 
any reason) an SAE report, or similar form, that includes the following information, as 
available:  
o Subject ID  
o Basic demographic information (age, gender, weight)  
o Outcomes  attributed to the event (death, life -threatening hospitalization [new or 
prolonged], disability, congenital anomaly, required medical intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment/damage, etc.)  
o Onset date and severity of the event  
o Brief description of the event including frequency and severity of symptoms leading 
to diagnosis  
o List of relevant test results and laboratory data  
o Any other relevant history  
o Whether the study treatment was discontinued  
o Investigator ’s assessment of causality  
The CRO Medical Monitor  or another representative of the Sponsor may contact the Investigator 
to request additional information regarding the event or to confirm information. All SAEs will be 
entered on the AE CRF. The same nomenclature should be used on both the SAE report and the 
AE CRF.  The Investigator is responsible for the complete and timely reporting of all SAEs to 
the Sponsor (or designee), reporting pertinent follow -up information on the SAE, and notifying 
the appropriate IRB of the occurrence of and details surroundin g the event. In the event there is a 
question as to whether the AE is serious, the event should be reported.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 74 of 105 11.2. Severity Grading for AEs  
Grading the severity of AEs is per investigator discretion (the guidance reflected in Sections 
17.9, 17.10  and 17.11 ; Appendices I, J and K may be helpful ).   Additionally,  the following 
general guideline may be helpful : 
• Grade 1 (mild) = asymptomatic or mild symptoms requiring no treatment, only clinical or 
diagnostic observation  
• Grade 2 (moderate) = event or symptoms limit age -appropriate activities of daily living  
(ADLs)  more than is expected from the surgery itself , requiring minimal treatment or 
local noninvasive intervention indicated .   
• Grade 3 (severe) = medically -significant but not immediately  life-threatening, 
significantly limiting of self -care ADLs, requiring of medical treatment and may require 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization.   
11.3. Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant at any time during the study, the Investigator must notify 
the CRO Medical Monitor or designee within 48 hours of learning about the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will be required to follow the subject through the pregnan cy term, and report to the 
CRO Medical Monitor or designee the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal or neonatal 
outcome. Information on the status of the mother and the child will be forwarded to the CRO 
Medical Monitor or designee. Any premature t ermination of the pregnancy will also be reported 
on this form. Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an SAE, 
any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
recorded as an AE  and will be followed as such. A spontaneous abortion is considered to be an  
SAE.

This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. To ensure compliance, the Sponsor or design ee may conduct a quality assurance 
audit, as outlined in Section 12.2.  
Actions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with the 
Investigato r and study personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents 
with appropriate instructions for use (where applicable); the internal audit of source data 
according to GCP and internal procedures to ensure their accuracy, completeness,  and 
verifiability; as well as the periodic site monitoring by the Sponsor. The Sponsor or designee will 
review source documents for accuracy and completeness during on -site monitoring visits and 
after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be  resolved with the Investigator, as 
appropriate.  
Significant and/or repeated non -compliance will be investigated and remedial action instituted 
when appropriate. Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in investigational site 
termination and re gulatory authority notification.  
12.1. Data Collection  
Source documents include , but are not limited to , original documents, data and records such as 
hospital/medical records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab results, 
participant diaries , data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic media, and 
pharmacy records, etc. This study will use electronic data capture (EDC). At a minimum, all data 
required by the protocol should have supporting source documentation for entries in the EDC 
system.  
All CRFs will be completed by the site staff prior to review by the Sponsor’s monitor or 
designated representative. The Sponsor’s monitor or designated representative will review all 
source records on -site and compare them to the data colle cted on the CRF.  All entries, 
corrections, and alterations will be made by the Investigator or other authorized study personnel. 
All data entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by independent monitors. The 
electronic data capture system mai ntains a full audit trail.  
12.2. Study Auditing and Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limited to, reviewing CRFs for accuracy and 
completeness) will be performed by the Sponsor’s designated monitor(s). The extent, nature, and 
frequency  of on -site visits will be based on such considerations as the study objectives and/or

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 76 of 105 endpoints, the purpose of the study, study design complexity, and enrollment rate. By signing the 
protocol, the Investigator agrees that, within local regulatory restric tions and institutional and 
ethical considerations, authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and/or 
an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including the drug storage area, study 
drug stocks, drug accountabilit y records, participant charts and source documents, and other 
records related to study conduct. The purpose of the Sponsor audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether th e study -related activities were conducted, and data recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, the site’s standard operating procedures, GCP 
guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirement s. The Investigator sho uld 
contact the Sponsor immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency regarding an inspection.

SAMPLE SIZE  
13.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The sections of the Statistical Considerations describe the statistical m ethods to be used to 
analyze the efficacy and safety.  These methods may be revised and updated due to rea sons such 
as regulatory requirements or need for further clarifications.  The final analysis will be 
documented in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that must be finalized before database 
lock.  The SAP will include details on how variables will be derived, how missing data will be 
handled, and how data will be presented as well as the details on statistical methods to be used 
for safety and effi cacy analyses.  The final clinical study report will discuss deviations from the 
SAP, if any.  
13.2. Sample Size Justification  
Given the uncertainty in estimating a sample size for C -ABD surgery, the data from the current 
study will be used to determine the sampl e size for a subsequent parallel design study selecting 
one or more optimal doses of CA -008 vs. placebo in the setting of standard of care for 
abdominoplasty . 
13.3. Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• The Safety P opulation will include all subjects who received any part of a dose of study 
treatment.   
• The PK Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of study treatment and 
complete all PK assessments.  
• The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects as randomized to study 
treatment.   
Membership in analysis populations will be determined before unblinding.  
Subjects who elect to discontinue study participation (early termination or ET) afte r 
randomization but prior to receiving study treatment will be replaced.   
Subjects who elect to ET after receiving study treatment will not be replaced, however those who 
ET during the inpatient phase of the study, will be asked to continue with assessmen ts through 
T96h if they have not elected to withdraw from all aspects of study participation.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 78 of 105 13.4. Planned Analyses  
Unless otherwise indicated, all testing of statistical significance will be 2 -sided, and a difference 
resulting in a P value of less than or eq ual to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  
Furthermore, the baseline will be the las t assessment before the  dosing of study medication.   
All inferential assessments will be 2 -sided tests performed at the 0.05 alpha level unadjusted for 
multiple comparisons.  A hierarchical alpha testing strategy will be utilized to control for the 
overall experiment -wise alpha.  First the primary analysis w ill be performed at the 0.05 alpha 
level.  If the primary analysis is statistically significant, then a limited number of key secondary 
analyses will be analyzed in a pre -specified order and analyses will be considered as statistically 
significant only if the preceding test is statistically significant.  The order of the secondary 
analyses will be specified in the SAP and signed off prior to unblinding.  
Summary statistics will be provided for the variables described in the following sections. For 
continuous  variables, these statistics will t ypically include the number of subject s, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, these 
statistics will typically include the number and percentage of subjects in each catego ry. 
13.5. Study Subjects and Demographics  
13.5.1.  Disposition and Withdrawals  
The numbers of subjects randomized, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated overall and by treatment group. The number of subjects in each 
analysis po pulation will be reported.  
13.5.2.  Protocol Deviations  
Major protocol deviations will be classified and documented before database lock and will be 
discussed in the CSR.  All protocol deviations, whether  minor  or major , will be presented in a 
data listing.  
13.5.3.  Demogra phics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, race, weight, and height) will be 
summarized for each treatment group and for the overall population by descriptive statistics. 
Medical history and clini cal laboratory tests will be listed.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment group, by the number and 
percentage of subjects taking each medication, classified using World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic  Chemical classes and preferred terms . 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 79 of 105 13.5.4.  Exposure  
Since this is a single dose s tudy, study  drug administration will be summarized in terms of total 
exposure  by cohort and treatment group.  
13.5.5.  General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by treatment and time point (as applicable) 
using the descriptive statistics n, mean, SD, median, and range (minimum, and maximum).  
Categorical assessments will be summarized by treatment and time point (as applicable) using 
frequency counts and rates of occurrence (%).  Changes from baseline for continuous outcomes 
will be presented as their corresponding continuous measures for post -baseline visits.  All study 
data will be listed by treatment group, subject and time point.  
No preliminary rounding will be performed; rounding will only occur after the analysis.  Means 
and medians will be presented with one more decimal place than the precision of the data.  
Standard deviations will be presented with two m ore decimal places than the precision of the 
data.  Percentages will be presented with one decimal place.  A percentage of 0% or 100% will 
be reported as 0% or 100%, respectively.  Minimums and maximums will be presented with the 
same precision as the orig inal data.  
All analyses will be performed using the SAS System® version 9.3 or higher. The domain 
(Study data tabulation Model [SDTM]) and analysis (Analysis Data Model [ADaM]) data sets 
will be taken as input to the SAS programs that generate the report -ready tables, figures and 
listings. The submission ready SDTM and ADaM data sets will be provided to the sponsor along 
with display deliveries. The specifications for the domain data sets and analysis data sets will be 
provided in a separate document.  
The following conventions will be used throughout the study analysis:  
• Time T0 is the time of completion of study treatment administration.  
• Day of surgery is defined as D0  
• Assessment visit times are defined by time T0 /D0. 
• Baseline value is defined as the last v alid measurement prior to beginning study treatment 
administration.  
• Change from baseline is defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value.  
• Duration of an AE will be computed in days for AEs lasting longer than 24 hours, and as 
hours for AEs lasting l ess than 24 hours.  Duration in hours will be calculated as the stop 
date/time of the event minus the start date/time.  Duration in days will be calculated by using 
stop date minus the start date +1 if AE occur on or after taking study medication.  If AE 
occur prior to the study medication, then the duration will be calculated by using stop date 
minus the start date.  If reported as ongoing at the time of database lock, the duration will be 
calculated using the date of the last visit or the last date of any  AE for the subject in the 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 80 of 105 database, whichever is later.  Missing dates will be imputed as described in the Study’s 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
• The number of days in the study is computed as: [Date of study completion or withdrawal 
minus the date of study drug administration (Day 1)] + 1.  
• If duplicate values are obtained at a given visit (e.g., repeated vital sign measurements), the 
last value will be used unless it is noted that the measurement was in error for that v alue. 
Values that compromise interpretation will not be used in summaries (e.g., values that were 
obtained post -dose will not be summarized as pre -dose values).  
13.5.6.  Analysis of Efficacy Measures  
All efficacy endpoints (e.g., NRS scores), will be summarized ove r time by treatment using 
descriptive statistics including confidence intervals as appropriate.  
AUC calculations will be done using the standard trapezoidal rule  
AUC  =     ∑ (𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+1
2)𝑥
𝑖=0 ∗ (𝑇𝑖+1− 𝑇𝑖) 
Where:  NRS i = NRS at time i, and (T i+1 – Ti) is the Time difference in minutes between time i 
and time i+1.  A similar calculation and handling of missing data will be performed for the NRS 
scores with position changes.  
Missing NRS will be handled as discussed in the Study’s SAP.   
The AUC analyses will be presented in a summary table with standard summary statistics for 
each dose cohort and placebo as well as active vs. placebo mean  difference s, standard errors, 
confidence intervals and comparison p -values  as appropriate . Comparison s of individual dose 
cohorts for dose response may also be presented for certain secondary AUC endpoints.  
The AUC analyses will be presented in a summary table with standard summary statistics for 
each treatment group mean differences standard errors, conf idence intervals and comparison p -
values as appropriate.   
Mean NRS scores over time (in -clinic and diary) will be graphed over time by  treatment group .  
NRS over time by each subject may also be displayed graphically as warranted.  The individual 
NRS and the computed AUC variables will be listed for all individual subjects.   
In this study, subjects are permitted to take rescue medication for analgesia.  It is expected 
subjects randomized to placebo arm will take rescue medication more often.  During both 
inpatient and outpatient portions of the studies, the subjects will be instructed to record NRS  
immediately prior to taking rescue medication.  
For subjects who take rescue, the pre -rescue pain score will be used to impute scheduled 
assessments.   Intermittent missing pain scores (due to subject sleeping, etc.) will not be imputed, 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 81 of 105 and AUC will be calculated based on non -missing values. For subjects who drop out of the study 
prior to Day 15 due to Lack of Efficacy or Adverse Events, scheduled asse ssments may be 
imputed using worst prior pain score carried forward.  All other subjects who drop out will have 
their last pain score carried forward.  
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable using different methods of imputation for 
rescue me dication may also  be performed.    
Additional  sensitivity analysis with different missing value imputation methods for subjects who 
drop out of the study may also be performed.    
All imputation methods for pain intensity will be documented in the SAP.  
13.5.6.1.  Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
All efforts will be made to minimize missing data .  These efforts will include the following:  
• Subjects are required to consent continuous data collection even after subjects 
discontinue the study medication;  
• Continue data collection after subjects taking rescue medication;  
• Establish robust efficacy data collection procedures.  
With the procedures above, it is expected that the missing would be minimal.  Missing at random 
is expected to be a reasonable assumption and the prim ary analyses  are expected to be sufficient 
for this dose escalation study. Additional s ensitivity analyses will be performed to support robust 
conclusion s, if warranted and details are presented in a detailed SAP prior to database lock .  
For subjects who t ake rescue  medication a windowed last pain score carried forward (wLOCF) 
will be used.  The pre -rescue pain score will be used to impute scheduled  assessments for 30 
minutes following the rescue use when IV fentanyl is used, 2 hours when IV hydromorphone is  
used, and 4 hours  when PO oxycodone is used . Intermittent missing pain scores (due to subject 
sleeping, etc.) will not  be imputed, and AUC will be calculated based on non -missing values.  For 
subjects who drop out  of the study prior to Day 15, scheduled assessments  will first be imputed 
using the worst prior pain score carried forward (WOCF).  As sensitivity analyses, the AUC will 
also be calculated where assessments after drop out will be imputed using LOCF, using the last 
scheduled non missing pain score  prior to drop out, and the median scores for the remainder of 
the group continuing in the study, without imputation using actual data . 
For secondary continuous efficacy endpoints, similar methods as the primary analysis will be 
used.  For categorical endp oints, when assessments are imputed for data after a subject 
discontinues from the study, a WOCF method will be used.  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 82 of 105 Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable using different methods of imputation for 
rescue medication may also be performed.  Additional sensitivity analysis with different missing 
value imputation methods for subjects who drop out of the study may also be performed.   All 
imputation methods for pain intensity will be documented in the SAP.  
13.5.7.  Analysis of Safety  
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the Safety Population (as defined in 
Section  13.2).  
Safety will be assessed through treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs); hematologic, biochemical, 
and urinal ysis laboratory parameters; vital signs measurements ; ECGs; physical exam, surgical 
site and neurosensory assessments .  
No formal statistical comparisons will be performed for safety endpo ints. 
13.5.7.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) reporting system. Treatment -emergent AEs are 
defined as any of the following:  
▪ Non-serious AEs w ith onset on the date of treatment with the study drug through Day 29  or 
Early Termination, whichever occurs first;  
▪ Serious AEs with onset on the date of treatment with the study drug through 30  days after 
Day 29  or Early Termination, whichever occurs fir st; 
▪ AEs that start before the start of treatment but increase in severity or relationship at the time 
of or following the start of treatment through Day 29  or Early Term ination, whichever occurs 
first. 
The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be displayed for each treatment group 
by SOC and preferred term. Additionally, TEAEs will be tabulated for each treatment group by 
severity and by relationship to the study drug. A listing of SAEs will be provided if applicable.  
13.5.8.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluat ions 
For continuous laboratory parameters, descriptive statistics will be presented for the value at 
each assessment time  and for the changes from baseline by treatment group.  
Additionally, clinical laboratory parameters will be categorized as low, normal , or high 
according to laboratory range specifications and the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category will be presented in shift tables.  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 83 of 105 Laboratory values that are outside the normal range will also be flagged in the data listings, 
along with c orresponding normal ranges.  
13.5.9.  Vital Signs  and ECG  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and 
changes from Baseline will be calculated for vital signs and ECG .  Detailed description of the 
analysis will be included in the Study SAP.  
The incidence of abnormal ECG findings will be summarized for each visit.

Additional details may be outlined in the Clinical Study Agreement between the sponsor and the 
investigational sit e.  
14.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
14.1.1.  Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The Investigator will conduct the study in accordance with GCP and all applicable regulations, 
including, where applicable, the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will also be carried out in 
keeping with applicable national and local laws and regulations. This may include an inspection 
by the Sponsor’s representatives and/or regulatory authority’s representatives at any time.  
14.1.2.  Ethics Approval  
The investigational site’s IRB must meet all relevant regulatory requirements. The study protocol 
and ICF will be reviewed by the IRB prior to enrolling participants into the study; written 
approval from the committee must be received by the sponsor before drug will be released to the 
Investigator.  The Investigator is responsible for submitting all protocol or ICF changes and SAE 
reports to the IRB according to local procedures. At a minimum, all SAEs requiring an 
investigational new drug safety report must be immediately reported.  
In accordance with  applicable local regulatory requirements, the Investigator may be obligated to 
provide periodic safety updates on the conduct of the study at his or her research site and 
notification of study closure to the IRB. Such periodic safety updates and notificat ions are the 
responsibility of the Investigator and not of the Sponsor. The Sponsor will be provided with 
copies of all notifications sent to the IRB.  
All relevant correspondence from the IRB will be forwarded by the respective study site to the 
Sponsor in  a timely fashion.  
14.1.3.  Subject Informed Consent  
The Investigator (or authorized designee) will ensure that the participant (or the participant’s 
legal representative) is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, 
purpose, potential and possible risks and benefits of the study. Each prospective subject will 
receive an IRB -approved ICF that summarizes the pertinent study information and will be given 
ample time to read the form and ask questions about the study. All information is to b e provided 
in a language understandable to the participant and must not include any language that waives 
the participant’s legal rights. Prospective participants must also be informed of their right to 
withdraw consent without prejudice at any time during the study. If the participant chooses to 
participate, he/she must sign the ICF before any study -related procedures are performed.  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 85 of 105 Significant changes to the protocol or product safety information may require a revision of the 
ICF, which must be reviewed a nd signed by all applicable study participants.  
The time that informed consent is obtained must be documented. The Investigator must maintain 
the original, signed ICF in the participant’s source documents. A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to the stud y participant.  
14.2. Privacy and Confidentiality  
The Investigator is responsible for complying with applicable privacy regulations, per his or her 
jurisdiction. Only information identified in this protocol will be collected. The information 
collected will only b e used for the purposes identified in this protocol.  
To ensure anonymity and to limit disclosure, participants will be assigned a unique identifier at 
their first assessment. This identifier will be cross -referenced in the participant’s chart. The 
identifi er will not contain any potentially identifiable information. An identifier log will be 
maintained, linking each participant’s name to the corresponding identifier. This log will be 
stored at the research site in a secure location.  
The knowledge gained thr ough this study is the property of the Sponsor. The Sponsor, 
representatives and affiliated companies of the Sponsor, the IRB, and regulatory agencies (such 
as the United States FDA) may inspect medical records related to the study to check the validity 
and accuracy of the data gathered in this study. Participant medical records (with participant’s 
initials and/or date of birth) may be copied. Confidentiality of participant records will be 
maintained except where release of information is required by law.  
The results of this study will be reported in such a manner that participants will not be 
identifiable in any way. Published reports or presentations will refer to grouped data or coded 
individual data and not to any identifiable individuals. Study reports  sent to the Sponsor or drug 
regulatory agencies will not include participant names.  
By signing the ICF, the participant consents to the collection, access, use, and disclosure of his or 
her information as described in the ICF document. If a participant wi thdraws consent, some of 
the subject’s information may still be collected, used, and disclosed by those involved in this 
study, per applicable laws.  
By signing this protocol, the Investigator affirms that he or she will maintain in confidence 
information furnished to him or her by the Sponsor and will divulge such information to his or 
her respective IRB or IEC under an appropriate understanding of confidentiality with such board. 
All data will be considered the sole property of the Sponsor. Please refer t o the Clinical Study 
Agreement for details.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 86 of 105 14.3. Study and Site Closure  
Upon completion of the study, all study data will be provided to the Sponsor following review of 
site study records for completeness, and data clarifications and resolutions. Accounting, 
reconciliation, and final disposition of used and unused study drugs, treatment codes, and 
emergency code break envelopes will be performed, as applicable.  
In addition, the Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this 
study at any time and for any reason. If such action is taken, the Sponsor will discuss this with 
the Investigator (including the reasons for taking such action) at that time. The Sponsor will 
promptly inform any other investigators and/or institutions conduc ting the study, if the study is 
suspended or terminated for safety reasons and will inform the regulatory authorities of the 
suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action. If required by applicable 
regulations, the Investigator wi ll inform the IRB promptly and provide the study participants 
with the reason for the suspension or termination. If the study is prematurely discontinued, all 
study data will be returned to the Sponsor.  
14.4. Regulatory Documents and Records Retention  
The Investigator is responsible for creating and/or maintaining all study documentation required 
by 21 CFR 50, 54, 56 and 312, ICH E6 section 8, as well as any other documentation defined in 
the protocol or Clinical Study Agreement . The Investigator must p rovide key documents to the 
Sponsor prior to the start of the study.  A complete list of required regulatory documents will be 
supplied by the Sponsor or its representative.  
Federal and local regulations require that the Investigator retain a copy of all r egulatory 
documents and records that support the data for this study for whichever of the following is the 
longest period of time:  
▪ A period of 2 years following the final date of approval by the FDA or other regulatory 
agency of the study drug for the purp oses that were the subject of the investigation; or  
▪ A period of 5 years following the date on which the results of the investigation were 
submitted to the FDA or other regulatory agency in support of, or as part of, an 
application for a research or marketi ng permit for the study drug for the purposes that 
were the subject of the investigation.  
The Sponsor will notify investigators once one of the above 2 timeframes has been satisfied.  
If the investigation does not result in the submission of the data in support of, or as part of, an 
application for a research or marketing permit, records must be retained for a period of 2 years 
following notification by the Sponsor that the entire clini cal investigation (not merely the 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 87 of 105 Investigator’s portion) is completed, terminated, or discontinued or 2 years following withdrawal 
of the Investigational New Drug application/Clinical Trial Authorization or request for 
marketing approval (New Drug Applica tion/Marketing Authorization Application).  
If the Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of 
keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the 
responsibility. The Sponsor  must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new 
custodian. Study records should not be destroyed without consultation with the Sponsor.  
14.5. Delegation of Responsibilities and Adequate Resources  
The Investigator should have adequate time to cond uct the study properly and should have an 
adequate number of qualified staff to assist with the conduct of the study.  
The term “Investigator” used throughout this protocol refers to the principal investigator and/or 
qualified sub -investigators. However, t he Investigator may delegate responsibilities to other 
investigational site personnel. The Investigator shall delegate tasks only to individuals qualified 
by education, training and experience to perform the delegated tasks. The Investigator shall have 
direct oversight of all delegated activities and shall document delegation of responsibilities. The 
Investigator is responsible for ensuring all delegated staff has been properly trained on the 
protocol and their assigned study responsibilities. A delegation log identifying all delegated 
duties and the individual to whom they have been delegated will be maintained at the 
investigational site.  
14.6. Protocol Amendments  
Approval of a protocol amendment by the Investigator’s IRB must be obtained before 
implementation of the protocol amendment, unless a change is necessary to eliminate an 
apparent immediate hazard to the participant or when the change involves logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study. The protocol amendment must be signed and dated by both 
the Sponsor and the Investigator. The Sponsor or designee will submit protocol amendments to 
the appropriate regulatory authorities, if required.  
14.7. Financial Disclosure  
Clinical investigators are required to provide financial disclosure information for the submi ssion 
of certification or disclosure statements required under 21 CFR § 54. As defined in 21 CFR § 
54.2, a clinical investigator is a listed or identified investigator or sub -investigator who is directly 
involved in the treatment or evaluation of research participants. The term also includes the 
spouse and each dependent child of the investigator. In addition, investigators must promptly

Neurosensory testing should be performed in an area approximately 3 to 5 cm above and 
below the surgical incision site  in three locations lateral on each side and in the midline.  The 
instructions below may assist the investigator or designee in performing  neurosensory 
testing.  
• Monofilament (von Frey) Testing:  For this examination, the filament should initially be 
prestressed (4 -6 perpendicular applications to the dorsum of the examiner’s first finger). 
The filament is then applied perpendicularly at the location to be assessed and briefly, 
(<1 second) with even pressure.  When the filament bends, the force of 10 grams has 
been applied.  The subject, whose eyes are closed, is asked to respond yes if he / she feels 
the filament.  Eight correct respon ses out of 10 applications is considered normal: one to 
seven correct responses indicate reduced sensation and no correct responses translates 
into absent sensation.  
• Testing for Allodynia: testing should be performed  at the location to be assessed using a 
foam brush but allodynia may also be a finding during the monofilament testing .

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 99 of 105 For allodynia assessment  the foam brush will be lightly stroked 3 times across the skin  in the 
location to be assessed.   Subject will be asked to compare sensation  to the con trol site just distal 
to the costal margin .  If the sensation is described as painful or very unpleasant then allodynia 
will be reported as present.  If sensation is slightly unpleasant or mildly irritating compared to 
the control  area then hyperaesthesia will be reported as present. If subject reports the stimulus as 
the same as the control  area then sensation will be reported as normal. If sensation is less than 
the control  area then sensation will be reported as reduced, and if sensation is not felt as a ll then 
it will be reported as absent.

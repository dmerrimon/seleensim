Contrasting Ketogenic and Mediterranean Diets in Individuals With Type 2 
Diabetes and Prediabetes  
 
Background  
The proposed randomized clinical trial will investigate differential population -specific effects of 
two low -carbohydrate (low -carb) diet patterns, addressing a gap in the evidence base in this area 
that will lead to 1) improved treatment strategies for common adverse clinical conditions, 2) 
improved health for these individuals, and 3) long- term decreases in health care costs. This 
impactful research will advance the field of personalized and precision medicine. 
 
A Mediterranean Diet (Med -Plus) , as defined in this study, maximizes the intake of vegetables, 
legumes, fruits and nuts, whole intact  grains/cereals and fish; and minimizes the intake of meat, 
poultry, and dairy. This diet should exclude added sugars and refined grains. 
 A Well -Formulated Ketogenic Diet (WFKD) diet, as defined in this study, maximizes the intake 
of non- processed beef, p ork, and poultry (preferably organic/grass -fed), fish, heavy cream, low -
lactose, high -fat cheeses, animal fats, oils (avocado, coconut, or other nut oils), non- starchy 
(above ground) vegetables and limited amounts of some fruits (berries). This diet should exclude legumes, grains, sugars, starchy (below ground) vegetables, most fruits, and polyunsaturated oils (soy, sunflower, peanut, cottonseed, canola, etc.). Furthermore, this diet will aim for an intake of 20 g of carbohydrates/day at start, with the goa l to have no more than 50 grams/day to maintain 
ketosis.  

The objective of the current study is to contrast the potential beneficial and adverse health 
consequences of two metabolically distinct diets: Well- Formulated Ketogenic Diet (WFKD) vs 
Mediterranean  Diet (Med -Plus), in a crossover design among generally healthy adults.  
 
Study Design:  
This cross -over study aims to investigate the impact of two metabolically distinct diets  on 
Glycated hemoglobin, cardiovascular health, the gut microbiome, and metaboli c status. 
Participants are recruited using media advertisements , email lists , and clinician referral (Dr. 
Kim)  from previous recruitment for nutrition studies conducted by our laboratory group.  Forty 
participants are planned to be randomized between the t wo arms: (1) start with 12 week WFKD  
and switch to 12 week Med- Plus; (2) start with 12 week Med -Plus and switch to 12 week 
WFKD .  Randomization will be stratified by diabetes vs pre -diabetes status.  As displayed in 
figure above, clinical and metabolic measurements are taken at baseline, and weeks 0, 6, 12, 
(Phase I, weeks 1 -12), 18, 24 (Phase II, weeks 13- 24) and 36 (Maintenance Phase).  Continuous 
glucose monitoring will be collected  five times during the trial, each time data will be collected 
every hour  for ten days . 
 
Primary O utcome:    
• Difference in  percent difference from baseline after 12 weeks of each phase  
   
Secondary O utcomes:   
• Difference in percent difference from baseline in LDL cholesterol a fter 12 weeks of each 
phase  
• Difference in percent difference from baseline in HDL cholesterol a fter 12 weeks of each 
phase  
• Difference in percent difference from baseline in triglycerides a fter 12 weeks of each phase  
• Difference in percent difference from baseline in fasting insulin a fter 12 weeks of each phase  
• Difference in percent difference from baseline in blood pressure a fter 12 weeks of each phase  
• Difference in percent difference from baseline in weight  after 12 weeks of each phase  
• Difference in percent difference from baseline in alpha diversity after 12 weeks of each 
phase. P rimary metric of alpha diversity will be using number of observed sequence variants 
("species") determined by standard 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (V3 -V5 region followed 
by DADA2 to define er ror-corrected sequence variants).  Note: Higher alpha diversity is 
better. The units are the # of sequence variants  
• Difference in percent difference from baseline in composite of short -chain fatty acids 
(SCFA) concentration (ug/g stool: acetate + propionate + butyrate) a fter 12 weeks of each 
phase  
 
Exploratory outcomes:  
• Difference in s atisfaction with WFKD and Med -Plus diets , using a 5- point Likert scale 
(1=not at all satisfied; 2=slightly satisfied; 3=moderately satisfied; 4=very satisfied; 5=extremely sati sfied).  
• Difference in adherence to diet protocols  by diabetes vs. pre -diabetes status , according to 3 -
day food records.  
• Tabulate COVID -19 Survey  answers  
 
 
 
Primary Analysis  
Patient demographics and baseline clinical characteristics will be summarized by arm, as n (%) and median (interquartile range) for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. To assess any differences in each variable between the two arms, the abs olute standardized differences are 
presented, where a value of 0.2 or less, 0.5, and 0.8 or more correspond to small, medium, and large differences, respectively.  Characteristics found to display large differences will be adjusted for in a  sensitivity ana lysis.  We will also compare rate of adherence for WFKD after 12 weeks 
and Med -Plus diets  after 12 weeks using a Fisher’s Exact test with weekly NDSR (and 
Cronometer) data.  We will develop a composite score to measure a participant’s adherence to each diet .  
 We will use a mixed -effects  linear model  (1) with HbA1c percent difference from baseline for 
diet, j, as the outcome.  We want to assess for a difference in diet ( WFKD vs Med -Plus), while 
adjusting for fixed effects:  order (e.g. study arm), pre-diabetes vs. diabetes status, and a random 
effect for each participant , i.

 For the primary outcome, we will use a two -sided likelihood ratio test to test for no difference 
between diet types.   The primary analysis will include participants with baseline blood draws, and at least one blood draw in each phase (including crossing over). The primary analysis will b e 
a complete case analysis and use participants’ last available lab values in each phase or week 12, if available ; patients who did not complete both phases (i.e. crossover) will be excluded. A 
significance level of 0.05 is set for all analyses.   In a sens itivity analysis, we will adjust for 
baseline weight and percent weight change if weight change from baseline is found to be significant, since this is known to impact HbA1c values ; and in a separate analysis, we will 
adjust for adherence to each diet.  
 Similarly, for our secondary outcomes, we will use separate mixed -effects models to evaluate 
fasting lipids, insulin,  glucose,  blood pressure and short -chain fatty acids  for WFKD vs Med -
Plus, adjusting for order, phase, pre -diabetes vs. diabetes status, an d repeated measures.   A two -
sided likelihood ratio test will be used to assess no difference between diet types.  For our 
exploratory outcome comparing diet satisfaction, we will use a Wilcoxon signed -rank test to 
evaluate the null hypothesis that the diffe rence between pairs follows a symmetric distribution 
around zero, which indicates similar satisfaction with both diets. We will use a Fisher’s Exact test to evaluate any difference in the rate of adherence due to diabetes vs pre- diabetes status , 
within each diet . 
 
Sensitivity Analysis  
 Due to COVID- 19, visits to collect blood draws were delayed for some participants.  
These participants report they maintained the phase’s diet until the lab measurements could be 
collected.  We will check adherence to diet  based on NDSR  at Week 12 and Week 12 extra  visit 
(taken when allowed back into clinic) , and also check for a change in dietary and exercise habits 
during shelter -in-place.  Potential impact of delays are unclear; subsequently, we will perform a 
number of sensitivity analyses:  
Sensitivity Analysis 1  (SA1): For a simple truncated analysis, we will consider 
only the first phase (12 weeks) of each group and compare differences (two -sample)  
Sensitivity Analysis 2 (SA2): For a simple estimate of Week 12 analysis, we will 
consider the average of the last lab measurement of each 12 week phase and the extra 
data point at Week 12 extra visit. 
Sensitivity Analysis 3 (SA 3): For an extended -phase analysis, we will consider 
using the last lab measurement from eac h phase, i.e. the “extra” data timepoints after 
week 12 in study  for some participants . 
Sensitivity Analysis  4 (SA 4): For a pre -COVID -19 truncated analysis, we will 
consider the subset of data prior to the official Shelter -in-Place date for the Bay Area, 
March 16 , 2020.  
Sensitivity Analysis 5 (SA 5): To assess any effect on outcomes due to COVID -19 
impact on logistics, we will consider the subset of data when participants received groceries for each diet.  We will also evaluate if adherence was better for the first four 
weeks when groceries were delivered.  
 
Secondary Analysis  
For our secondary analysis, we want to investigate: (a) a potential difference in the primary outcome by diabetes status; (b) the different trajectories of each diet;  and (c) different metrics 
using c ontinuous glucose m onitoring data and how that compares with the gold standard HbA1c 
data.  In a low -power analysis for (a), we will use model (1) and include an interaction term for 
diet and diabetes status.  For (b), we will  use all time points in a model similar to (1) but with a 
time variable.  Lastly for our analysis in (c), we will consider different metrics used in the literature for continuous glucose monitoring and compare trajectories of each metric with that of the g old standard using HbA1c data.  
 
Exploratory Analysis  
For our exploratory analysis, we want to investigate long term maintenance.  Upon completing both diet phases, for three months participants were instructed to eat the diet of their choosing.  This anal ysis will be largely descriptive on what participants were consuming and their change in 
lab measurements.

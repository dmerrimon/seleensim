Protocol 2660.00  
Page 4 of 57 2. Introductio n 
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a frequent complication of allogeneic hemato poietic 
cell transplantation (HCT)  in adults and in children. Morbidity and mortality as a 
consequence of GVHD result from direct organ damage, and from inf ections and organ 
toxicity related to the use of immunosuppressive drugs to treat GVHD.[1] 
 
Despite the administration of immunosuppressive drugs early p ost transplant to prevent 
GVHD, following myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplant from unrelated  
donors in children at the FHCRC and other centers the incidence of grade II – IV acute 
GVHD is 40 -90% and t he incidence of extensive chronic gr aft vers us host disease is  20-
60%. [2-7] In an analysis of data reported to the Center for International Bone Marrow 
Transplant  Research (CIBMTR), Eapen and colleagues observed a rate of chronic GVHD 
of 32% amongst 116 childr en with acute leu kemia who received bone marrow transplants 
without T cell depletion from 8/8 allele matched unrelated donors. [4] Similarly, amongst 
51 children who received myeloablative bone marrow trans plants f rom 10/10 allele 
matched unrelated donors (URD)  at FHCRC the rate of clinically extensive chronic 
GVHD was 35%.[8] & pe rsonal communication AW and TG  
 
Although bone marrow is currently the most frequently u sed dono r stem cell source  for 
pediatric HCT recipients there has been a trend toward increasing use of peripheral blood 
stem cells (PBSC) in pediatrics as well as adults.  At FHCRC , of the transplants 
performed in pediatric recipients with HLA matched unrelated donors in the past t en 
years, 40% have employed PBSC and 60% have employed bone marrow as the stem cell 
source . PBSC has several  advantages over BM including more rapid engraftment  and a 
shorter duration of initial hospitalization, and is frequently  preferr ed by the donor ce nter 
or donor for feasibility reasons. However, a large randomized study demonstrated a n 
increased rate of chronic GVHD was observed amongst predominantly adult patients who 
received PBSC (53%, CI 45 to 61) compared with bone marrow (41%, CI 34 to 48) from  
HLA matched (78%) or 1 -2 antigen mismatched (22%) URD  [9], although the rate of 
graft failure was lower amongst PBSC recipients (3% CI 1 -5%) compared to bone 
marrow recipients (9% CI 6-13% ). There  was no significant difference in overall survival 
between the groups.  There is a clear need to develop strategies to reduce the rate of 
chronic GHVD, particularly in PBSC transplants. An optimal approach would preserve  
the benefit of the rapid eng raftment  time and low rate  of graft failure associated with the 
use of PBSC but substantially reduce the rate of chronic GVHD to lower than that 
observed with either PBSC or BM.  
 
In HCT using HLA -identical donors, GVHD results from recognition of minor 
histocompat ibility (H) antig ens expressed on recipient tissues by donor T cells.[10] 
Complete depletion of T cells from the donor hematopoietic cell product is a highly  
effective alternat ive to pharmacologic immunosuppression for preventing GVHD, but is 
complicated by a profound delay in immune reconstitution, which contributes to life  
threatening infections, and has been associated with an increased risk of graft re jection 
and leu kemia re lapse.[11,12] Laboratory studies have suggested that donor T cells 
specific for recipient minor H antigens are found predominantly within the naïve s ubset 
of T cells that express the cell surface molecule CD 45RA, and that the selecti ve depletion 
of CD45RA+ T cells from PBSC  grafts can preserve the subset of pathogen -specific 
memory T cells that lack CD45RA.This protocol will evaluate the selective remova l of 
CD45RA+ cells from PBSC as a strategy to reduce  chronic GVH D and provide rapid

unrelated  donor transplants.  
 
3.    Background 
3A. GVHD  
The pathogenesis of GVHD involves multiple interacting factors including tissue da mage 
resulting from the conditio ning regimen, the release of inflammatory cytokines, and the 
activation and proliferation of mature donor T cells that express the αβ T cell receptor 
(TCR) and recognize recipient alloantigens presented as peptides by class I and II m ajor 
histocompatibility complex (MHC or HLA in humans) molecules on antigen present ing 
cells (APCs) [1,13]. The mature T cell repertoire is  “tolerant” to peptides derived from 
self-proteins due to thymic deletion and/or peripheral suppression of autoreactive T ce lls 
[14]. However, in the setting of allogene ic HCT between HLA -identical individuals, the 
repertoire of peptides displayed on recipient cells will include distinct species  that differ 
from those on donor cells as a consequence of polymorphisms in genes outside of the 
MHC, and those peptides can be recognized as minor H antigens by donor T cells. [10] 
The activation of donor T cells to recipient minor H antigens is likely to occur afte r 
contact with specialized APCs  and/or other cell types particularly in the gastrointestinal 
tract and leads to proliferation of T cells and their differentiation to effector cells  that 
produce cytokines including IFN-γ and TNF α, and mediate cytotoxicity against recipient 
tissues [10]. The tissues that are most frequently damaged during acute GVHD include 
skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver, although other organs can be involved, particula rly 
when acute GVHD evolves into chronic GVHD.  Chronic GVHD has a characteristic 
clinical presentation which often resembles autoimmune vascular diseases and is d istinct 
from acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD can be highly debilitating and prolonged and has a 
20-50% mortality rate due to i mmune dysregulation and opportunistic infections. [15] 
  
The administration of immunosuppressive drugs that interfere with T cell activation o r 
proliferation such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, FK506, prednisone, and mycophenolate 
mofetil, alone or in various combinations, are used at most transplant centers to prevent 
GVHD [16]. The development in the early 1980s of the combination of a short course of 
methotrexate with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine represented a significan t 
advance in the prophylaxis of GVHD, but major improvements in pharmacologic 
immunosuppression have not been achieved since that time [16,17] . At the FHCRC, a 
short course of methotrexate combined with either cyclosporine or tacrolimus  continues 
to be a frequently used immunosuppressive regimen for GVHD prophylaxis after 
allogeneic HCT.  With this regimen of GVHD prophylaxis, following myeloablative 
allogeneic bone marrow transplant from unrelated  donors in children at the FHCRC and 
other centers the i ncidence of grade II – IV acute GVHD is 40 -90% and the incidence of 
extensive chronic graft versus host disease is 20 -60%. [2-7] Patients who develop GVHD  
typically  require treatment with additional immunosuppressiv e drugs, which increases 
their risk of post transplant infections and may diminish the graft versus leukem ia (GVL) 
effect [18]. Additionally, many patients with acute leukemia will relapse after HCT and 
those with GVHD are less likely to be eligible for, or benefit from, T cell immunotherapy  
designed to augment the GVL effect.   
 
3B. T Cell Depletion to Preve nt GVHD  
The recognition of recipient minor H antigens by donor T cells is an essential 
requirement for the induction of GVHD after HCT from HLA -identical donors. Thus, 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 6 of 57 many centers have used partial or complete depletion of T cells from the donor bone  
marr ow or PBSC graft as an alternative approach to pharmacologic immunosuppression 
for preventing GVHD [11,12,19-23]. A variety of methods have been used to remove T 
cells from bone marrow or PBSC grafts including soybean lectin agglutination, 
monoclonal antibodies, and positive selection of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors 
[11,12,19-22,24]. Depending on the approach, the extent of T cell depletion can vary 
from 2 -5 log 10.  More co mplete T cell depletion is generally associated with less GVHD, 
although an absolute minimum threshold dose of donor T cells needed for development 
of GVHD has been difficult to define in humans.  
 
T cell depletion is a highly effective strategy for preven ting GVHD in both murine 
models and in humans [11,12,19-23] but recipients of T cell-depleted grafts have poor 
reconstitution of T cell immunity to  pathogens, and some studies found T- cell depletion 
to be associated  with an increased risk of graft rejection and relapse [11,12,19,25]. The 
Bone Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials N etwork recently published a multicenter trial of 
complete T cell depletion for AML patients undergoin g HCT from HLA -identical sibling 
donors.[22,26] The BMT -CTN study 0303 used TBI (13.75 Gy), Cyclophosphamide , and 
ATG  as a conditioning regimen, and the Miltenyi CliniMACS device to select 
CD34+cells from G -CSF mobil ized PBSC using anti- CD34 -coated immunomagnetic 
beads. CD34 selection with the Miltenyi CliniMACS device provided a 4. 9 log 10 
removal of total T cells  (3.2-5.9) including both the memory and naïve subsets . All 
patients engrafted with secondary graft failu re occurring in only 1 of 44 patients. Low 
rates of acute GVHD (grade II -IV 22.7%, III-IV 4.5%) and extensive chronic GVHD 
(6.8%) were observed. The DFS and OS at three years after CD34+ transplant were 53% 
and 56% respectively for the whole group, 58% and 60% for patients transplanted in 
CR1, and 29 and 38% for patients transplanted in CR2. [22,26]The OS and DFS figures 
are broadly comparable to those seen after T- replete transplant , at least for patients in 
CR1. [27-31] However, as expected the CD34+ selected transplant was associated with a 
high risk of opportunistic viral infections (57% of patients). In particular high- level EBV 
reactivation requiring treatment was observe d in 18% of patients and 1 of 44 patients die d 
of EBV -PTLD. [31] 
 
Two single center studies performed for MRD and URD recipients with hematologic 
malignancies at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center emplo yed a similar 
conditioning regimen TBI (13.75 Gy), Thiotepa (10mg/kg over two days), Fludarabine 
(125mg/m2 over five days) and equine ATG (60mg/kg) and CD34+ selection of stem 
cells from G -PBSC or BM from matched (≥ 7/10) unrelated donors with the Isolex 
Device followed by sRBC -rosette depletion of T cells, achieving a 5 log depletion of T 
cells. [20,21] Amongst MUD recipients the rates of aGVHD II -IV and extensive chronic 
GVHD were reported to be 5.8% and 11% respectively. DFS and OS at 4 years were 57 
and 59% respectively, whilst the relapse rate was surprisingly low at 6% at 4 years.  
Opportunistic infections were also frequent in this trial, with several clini cally significant 
adenoviral infections (14.7%) including one death, a nd three (9%) EBV reactivations - 
including one death from EBV PTLD. 
 
In children there is less published experience with CD34+ TCD transplants  from 
unrelated donors. The largest study was published by a European group in 2003.[32] 
Purified URD CD34+ stem cells (median 8 x 106/kg, obtained using Miltenyi MACs 
devices) were infused following a range of conditioning regimens each including ATG . 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 7 of 57 All pat ients with an HLA matched URD achieved sustained primary engraftment . Acute 
GVHD was observed in 10% of the patients, and chronic GVHD was <10%. P atients 
with ALL in CR1  (N=14) mostly received TBI containing conditioning regimens and the 
overall survival was 63% amongst this group. Patients with AML were treated withou t 
TBI (BuMelCy) and had a poor survival (14%). A retrospective analysis of the MSKCC 
pediatric experience with CD34+ TCD using the Isolex device followed by sRBC -rosette 
depletion of T cells was published more recently. Eleven patients with AML or adva nced 
MDS received a standard conditioning of Busulphan, Melphalan, Fludarabine and ATG. 
All engrafted  and achieved full donor chimerism. The overall survival of the Bu- Mel-Flu 
subgroup is 54.5% with patients dying of relapse (27%), GVHD (9%) or infection 
(9%). [33] 
   
3C. Naive T cells (T N) are primarily responsible for GVHD in rodent models  
Transplant approaches that selectively deplete T cells that recognize minor H anti gens 
and retain T cells specific for pathogens in the stem cell graft could reduce GVHD an d 
improve reconstitution of T cell immunity. S tudies in murine models of allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation have provided insights into how such selective manipulat ion of the T 
cell content of hematopoietic cell grafts might be achieved. Mature CD3+ CD8+ and 
CD3+ CD4+ T cells can be classified into naïve (T N) and memory (T M) subsets that differ 
in cell surface phenotype, prior exposure to cognate antigen, and functional activity 
[34,35] . In mice, the T N subset is CD44- CD62L+ and the T M subset is CD44+ and can be 
further subdivided into a CD62L+ central memory (T CM) population, and a CD62L- 
effector memory (T EM) population [35]. Studies in murine bone marrow transplant 
models have evaluated the potential for T cells derived from T N and T M subsets to cause 
GVHD across both minor and major histocompatibility  differences. The first study to 
examine this question employed a multiple minor H antigen mismatched CD4+ dependent 
GVHD model [B10.D2 (H-2d)  BALB/c (H -2d)]. In this model, tr ansplantation of 
irradiated BALB/c mice with T -cell depleted bone marrow combined with unfractionated 
splenocytes or with purified CD4+ CD44- CD62L+ TN from B10.D2 donors caused severe 
GVHD. However, transplantation of T-cell depleted bone marrow with puri fied CD4+ 
CD44+ CD62L- TM did not cause GVHD and provided for the transfer of T cell immunity 
to a model antigen [36].  
 
The efficacy of removing T N from the stem cell graft for preventing GVHD has been 
confirmed in  other murine strain combinations including CD8 dependent minor H 
antigen- mismatched and MHC -mismatched models, and in rats [36-44] [Table 1]. It 
should be noted that the intent in these studies was to deplete T N, but the cell selection 
procedure that was utilized in some studies would also remove the T CM subset of T M from 
the graft. In other studies, the selection procedure targeting CD44+ did not allow the 
effects of T CM or T EM to be delineated. In subsequent experiments by the Shlomchik 
group, purified T N or T CM obtained by cell sorting were transplanted with T cell depleted 
bone marrow in a CD8 dependent minor H antigen- mismatched murine model of GVHD 
in the absence of immunosuppression. Mice that received T N developed severe GVHD, 
whereas mice that received T CM developed only mild GVHD [37] . Similar results were 
obtained in an MHC -mismatched model.  These results demonstrate that in murine 
allogeneic minor H antigen and MHC mismatched bone marrow transplantation, the T N 
subset of T cells is primarily responsible for GVHD and bone marrow grafts conta ining 
only T M exhibit limited capacity to cause GVHD.

Page 9 of 57 3D. Human T cells specific for minor H antigens are predominantly in the T N subset . 
Inferential data suggests that the results obtained in murine models using sel ective 
depletion of T N to prevent GVHD might also apply to humans. The T N subset in humans, 
which expresses both CD45RA and CD62L, has been shown to contain the greatest T cell 
receptor (TCR) diversity [45,46]. The T M subset, which contains CD45RO+ CD62L+ TCM 
and CD62L- TEM populations, and a subset of CD62L- cells that re -express CD45RA 
(TEMRA ), is comprised of cells that have clonally expanded in response to antigen 
stimulation and contains relatively less  TCR diversi ty compared to T N.  A major fraction 
of the T M subset consists of T cells specific for latent herpes viruses including CMV, 
EBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). Cross reac tivity of 
virus- specific T M for major alloantigens has b een observed infrequently and in humans 
does not appear to cause GHVD [47,48] , and cross reactivity with minor H antigens has 
not been reported and is likely to be exceedingly rare.  To evaluate the presence of  minor 
H antigen- reactive T cells in T N and T M subsets, we purified CD8+ TN (CD45RAbright, 
CD62L+, CD45RO-) and T M (CD45RO+, CD62L+/-, CD45RA-) from leukapheresis 
products obtained from HLA-identical sibling pairs and determined the frequency of 
alloreactive T  cells in each subset by limiting dilution analysis. Individuals may be 
exposed to minor H antigens by pregnancy or blood transfusion and develop minor H 
antigen- specific T M responses, therefore donors without a prior history of pregnancy or 
blood transfus ion were selected for these experiments. In multiple assays of different 
HLA -matched pairs, the frequency of minor H antigen- reactive T -cells was significantly  
higher in the T N subset than in the T M subset.  Indeed, only very rare cells (~1/2,000,000-
1/6,000,000) in the T M subset exhibited weak recognition of recipient cells in these 
assays, and this weak alloreactivity was not reproducible with repeated testing. T hus, in 
individuals without a history of pregnancy or blood transfusion, minor H antigen- speci fic 
CD8+ T cells are predominantly in the T N subset [49]. We attempted to evaluate the 
frequency of T cells specific for minor H antigens in CD4+ TN and T M subsets using 
lymphoproliferation assays, but these assays were confounded by high background 
reactivity to autologous cells in both subsets.  
 
3E.  Depletion of T N from human PBSC grafts as a strategy to reduce GVHD  
The in vivo  data in animal models and in vitro  analysis of alloreactivity of CD8+ TM and 
TN subset s in HLA -identical siblings suggest ed that selective depletion of T N from human 
PBSC grafts is a rational strategy to investigate for reducing GVHD and for improv ing 
the tempo of immune reconstitution after allogeneic HCT. In preclinical studies, we  
examin ed methods for selectively depleting T N from G -CSF mobilized PBSC products. 
We initially considered using anti-CD62L mAb to deplete T N, based on the data from 
murine models. However, CD62L is subject to proteolytic cleavage by ADAM-17 and 
other proteases r eleased during G -CSF mobilization [50], and we found that cell surface 
CD62L declined on T cells in G-CSF mobilized products. CD45RA is expressed stably 
on all CD8+ and CD4+ TN in G-CSF mobilized PBSC but a minor subset of CD34+ cells 
also express CD45RA. Thus, to remove CD45RA+ T cells without interfering with 
CD34+ progenitors, we used sequential positive selection of CD34+ progenitor cells using 
Miltenyi CD34 immunomagnetic selection, followed by depletion of CD45RA+ cells 
from the CD34 -negative fraction. Our goal was to develop a cell selection procedure that 
would result in an engineered stem cell graft that contains >2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
recipient body weight, <7.5 x 104 TN/kg and 1-10 x 106 TM/kg. The dose of 1-10 x 106 
CD3+ cells/kg was selected for two reasons. First, this number is nearly equivalent to  the 
T cell content of an unmanipulated bone marrow graft and is 10 - 100 fold greater than 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 10 of 57 the threshold dose of unselected T cells that causes GVHD after HLA -identical sibling 
HCT [51].  It w ould therefore allow us t o test the hypothesis that CD45RA- T cells can 
safely be transferred with less GVHD.  Second, it would provide a sufficient number of 
memory T cells such that we would reasonably anticipate improved immune 
reconstitution as compared to recipients of only a TCD allograft.  
 
A GMP -grade murine αCD45RA monoclonal antibody that is directly conjugated to 
Miltenyi iron dextran beads w as produced by Miltenyi Biotec under contract from the 
NIH RAID program.  Using the new αCD45RA  mAb -conjugated bead and the existing 
αCD34 -conjugated bead we have now su ccessfully completed more than 3 0 clinical scale 
cell selection procedures, including preclinical validation runs and procedures for twenty -
four patients who have been treated on our first (adult) Phase II Study of Selective 
Depletion o f CD45RA+ T Cells from Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Grafts for 
the Prevention of GVHD using HLA- matched related donors (see section 3H).  
 
3F. T cell responses to pathogens are retained after depletion of CD45RA+cells from G -
PBSC  
We have evaluated CD45RA depleted hematopoietic cell products for retention of 
functional memory T cells specific for common pathogens including CMV, EBV, 
influenza, Candida albicans, and VZV . For persistent viruses such as CMV and EBV, a 
major fraction of the CD8+ TM respo nse may reside in the CD45RA+ (TEMRA ) subset of 
TM, and the use of αCD45RA for depletion of T N could compromise the transfer of T M 
responses to these pathogens. Therefore, we compared the frequency of CD8+ T-cells 
specif ic for known epitopes of CMV, EBV and adenovirus in PBSC before and after 
depletion of CD45RA+ cells us ing an interferon gamma Elispot assay  after a single in 
vitro  stimulation. Interferon -producing virus- specific CD8+ T-cells were present in both 
the CD45RA-depleted fraction and unselected PBSC at comparable frequencies. CD4+ 
TM cells are uniformly CD45RO+ CD45RA- and should be retained in G-PBSC depleted 
of CD45RA+ T-cells. We analyzed lymphoproliferative responses to CMV, HSV, VZV,  
Adenovirus, Influenza and Parainfluenza and Candida antigens before and after deplet ion 
of CD45RA+ T-cells from G -PBSC produc ts. To avoid measuring CD8+ T-cells that 
might respond to soluble proteins that are taken up by APC in the culture and enter the 
class I pathway, CD4+ T-cells from the CD45RA depleted product were enriched by 
negative selection prior to plating in the assa y. CD4+ TM responses to all the antigen 
preparations were detected in the CD45RA depleted product.  These results demonstrate 
that CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cells to common opportunistic pathogens are retained 
after depletion of CD45RA+ cells.  
 
3G.   Prelimin ary analysis of the first phase II study to evaluate selective depletion of naïve T 
cells from PBSC grafts for preventing acute GVHD in (adult) patients with acute 
leukemia or MDS undergoing allogeneic HLA- identical HCT from a related donor.  
We are conduct ing a phase II study to evaluate selective depletion of naïve T cells from 
PBSC grafts for preventing acute GVHD in (adult) patients with acute leukemia or MDS 
undergoing allogeneic HLA -identical HCT from a related donor. We employ a 
myeloablative preparat ive regimen consisting of fludarabine , thiotepa, and TBI that 
provides a high rate of engraftment. The product that is administered to each patient 
consist s of an infusion of purified CD34+ cells, obtained by Miltenyi CliniMACS 
selection of G -CSF mobilized  cells collected from the donor by apheresis, and an 
infusion of CD45RA- cells obtained by depletion of CD45RA+ cells from the flow -
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 11 of 57 through remaining after the CD34+ cell selection.  
As discussed above, our goal is to administer a CD34+ cell dose of >2.0  x106/kg of 
recipient body weight and a total T cell dose of 1 -10 x 106 CD3+ cells/kg, of which 
<7.5x104/kg are  CD45RA+ RO- naïve T cells. The cell selection goals were readily 
achieved in each of the first twenty -four patients treated on the trial. All pati ents received 
>5.0 x106/CD34+cells/ kg, with the median CD34+ dose being 8.1 x106 CD34+cells/kg. 
The median T cell dose administered was 10.00 x 106 CD3+cells/kg (1.59-10.04 ) with 
most ( 22/24) patients receiving 9.9-10.04 x 106 CD3+cells/kg . All patients re ceived less 
than 7.5 x104 CD45RA+ RO- naïve T cells per kg with a median of 0.37 x104 CD45RA+ 
RO- naïve T cells per kg (range 0.09-7.46 , all but one patient received ≤1  x104 naïve T 
cells/kg ). Approximately two third s of the residual CD45RA+ RO- naïve T ce lls were 
within the CD34+ cell fraction (median 0.21 x104) and one third were from the CD45RA-
depleted PBSC product (median 0.12 x104). In summary , cell selection process to retain 
CD34+ stem cells and memory T cells whilst depleting naïve T cells is effec tive and 
reproducible.  
To date w e have treated twenty -four patients with acute leukemia  or advanced MDS  
(ALL N=1 6, AML N=6, MDS N=2 ) with an age range of 19-55 years. Fourteen  patients 
were in CR1 without minimal residual disease  (MRD)  prior to HCT , four patients had 
MRD but were in first morphological remission, and six patients were in CR2  or CR3 . 
The median time of follow -up is 545 days (40-1134) (February 2013). The preliminary 
analysis of engraftment and survival is encouraging (Table 2).

a. Mild acute  GVHD  grade II- III, universally  steroid -responsive, has been observed in 
17/22 (77 %) evaluable patients. Fifteen  patients developed grade II GVHD  and 
responded rapidly to corticosteroids . Two other patients were considered to have 
grade III GVHD on the basis of large volume diarrhea but also responded rapidly to 
prednisone with no subsequent recurrence. In each of the 17 cases GVHD within the 
gastrointestinal tract was observed, predominantly involving the upper GI without 
lower GI involvement (12/17). S kin involvement was al so seen in 7/17 patients while 
liver GVHD has not been observed to date. A biopsy of the intestinal tract was 
obtained in all patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal GHVD. The histopathologic 
changes were considered minimal or mild. The high rate of  mild upper 
gastrointestinal GVHD is similar to the historical experience for adult patients  treated 
with myeloablative TBI containing conditioning with T replete BMT or PBSCT at 
FHCRC where there is a high diagnostic sensitivity and awareness of the potential  for 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 12 of 57 mild gastrointestinal GVHD without skin involvement [52].   
b. Chronic GVHD : Amongst the 22 patients have  completed >100 days of follow-up 
three have  been diagnosed with chronic GVHD fulfilling NIH criteria , includi ng one 
mild classic chronic (steroid responsive skin rash and dry eyes) and two late acute 
gastrointestinal with subclinical oral involvement . The frequency of chronic GVHD 
appears to be lower than the historical experience of 45-50% for adult patients 
receiving unmanipulated  PBSC transplants from HLA -identical sibling donors. [30]  
c. Discontinuation of immune suppression. The median time to discontinuation of 
prednisone for patients treated on the study was 100 days and the median time to 
discontinuation of all immune suppression was 298 days. Of the 11 patients aged ≤40 
years  at the time of HCT the median time to discontinuation of prednisone for 
patients treated on the study was 6 7 days and the median time to discontinuation of 
all immune suppression was 2 11 days. All young patients (<40 years) who were alive 
without relapse at one year post HCT completed all immune suppression at or prior to 
that time point . The time to completion of all immuno suppression amongst patients 
treated on this naïve T cell depletion study appears to be considerably faster than in 
concurrent controls who received standard myeloablative PBSC transplants at 
FHCRC, amongst whom 50% of the living patients are still on immune suppression at 
two years after transplant.   
d. Immune reconstitution: The median CD3+ T cell/mm3 of peripheral blood observed in 
recipients of naïve T cell depleted transplant is above 300 at 28 days after transplant 
and remains at this level for the first three months and increases to 700 at 1 year post 
transplant. CD4+ T cells median values are above 100 CD4+ T cells/mm3 of bl ood for 
the first 3 months and 250 at one year. The numbers of CD4+CD3+ and CD4+CD8+ T 
cells in peripheral blood after naïve T cell depleted HCT exceed those seen after TCD  
HCT over the first 3  months after HCT  after which time the levels are similar .[22] 
EBV reactivation has been monitored weekly by quantitative PCR and no EBV 
reactivation has been detected in patients receiving naïve T cell depleted PBSC . In 
comparison a  much higher 18% rate of EBV reactivation was seen after  TCD 
HCT. [22] In summary , in the first three months after HCT  overall immune 
reconstitution appears to be superior in recipients of naïve T cell depleted grafts  
compared to total TCD transplants , with a corresponding reduced level of viral 
reactivation . 
 
3H.  New pediatric clinical trial: A Phase II Study of Selective Depletion of CD45RA+ T 
Cells from Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Grafts for the Prevention of 
GVHD  in Children  
The strategy of deple ting naïve T cells from stem cell grafts is effective for 
preventing GVHD in murine models . In adult humans naïve T cell depletion of PBSC 
appears to reduce the frequency , severity  and duration of chronic GVHD relative to 
unmanipulated PBSC, and to improve immune reconstitution relative to TCD HCT. 
The frequency of acute GVHD is not reduced using naïve T cell depletion and 
tacrolimus monotherapy compared to T cell replete HCT with conventional 
calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate prophylaxis, but the acut e GVHD observed is 
mild and steroid responsive.  
Children are not eligible for the open ongoing trial of naïve T cell depletion as they 
mostly have pediatric donors and bone marrow is preferred to PBSC as a stem cell 
source from younger pediatric donors on research studies due to safety concerns  
primarily related to the insertion of central venous catheters required for the  
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 13 of 57 collection of apheresis . Selective depletion of naïve T cells from bone marrow grafts 
would not provide a stem cell product with an opt imal number of CD34+ cells in 
many patients , as the available number of CD34+ cells in the starting bone marrow 
product is substantially lower than PBSC (median of 2.75 x 106/kg CD34+ cells in 
bone marrow in adults , range1.94 -4.53 x 106/kg[9]; median of 6.2 x 106/kg CD34+ 
cells in bone marrow in children Heimfeld personal communication ) and there is typically a 20-
30% loss of CD34+ cells during CD34+ enrichment using current CliniMACs 
technology.  
We plan to study the naïve T cell depletion approach in 20 pediatric recipients of 
PBSC from HLA -identical unrelated donors and to employ tacrolimus and 
methotrexate as pharmacological prophylaxis of GVHD. The primary objective of the 
trial will be to e stimate the time to d iscontinuation of systemic immunosuppression in 
pediatric recipients of CD45RA+ T cell-depleted PBSCT.  Unpublished data from our 
center shows that amongst 55 children with a history of leukemia who received a 
myeloablative bone marrow (N=34 ) or PBSC (N=21 ) transplant from an unrelated 
donor (HLA -A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 molecularly matched) following 
conditioning with TBI and cyclophosphamide between July 2002 and December 2010 
the median time to discontinuation of all immunosuppression was 1076 days, with a 
median time to discontinuation of 608 days for bone marrow recipients, and median 
time to discontinuation not reached for recipients of PBSC. The goal is to increase the 
proportion of patients who discontinue all systemic immunosuppression by 608 days 
from the historical value of 5 0% to 80 % in the current trial by depletion of naïve T 
cells from PBSC without observing an increased frequency of graft failure. A 
secondary objective will be to estimate the frequency of acute GVHD in pediatri c 
recipients of T N cell-depleted PBSC who receive tacrolimus and methotrexate 
pharmacological prophylaxis.

9. Plan of Treatment  
9A. Conditioning Regimen  
The conditioni ng regimen will consist of fludarabine, thiotepa, and fractionated total 
body irradiation (TBI) and will be administered as outlined below and shown 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 16 of 57 schematically in Table 2. Note that for chemotherapy administered during conditioning 
and other drugs listed in this protocol, in keeping with institutional practice  it is 
acceptable  to administer a dose within 10% of the protocol specified dose.  
TBI will be given as 165 cGy fractions twice per day x 4 days – total dose 1320cGy  (days 
-10 to - 7).  
1. After completing the TBI, patients will be treated with thiotepa 5 mg/kg/day (adjusted 
body weight – see appendix I) administered  intravenously over approximately 4 hours 
on each of two consecutive days (days -6 and - 5). If actual weight is less than ideal 
body weight, actual body weight will be used. The total dose is 10 mg/kg (adjusted 
body weight - see appendix I).  
2. Patients will receive fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day (m2 based on actual weight  see 
appendix I) administered intravenously over approximately 30 minutes for 5 days 
beginning on the first day of thiotepa (days - 6 to -2).  
3.  Day -1 will be a day of rest. 
4.  GCSF -mobilized CD34 enriched PBSC and CD45RA depleted cells will be infused 
on day 0.

1 An apheresis collection will be performed on day -1, and may also be performed on day 0. The selected product 
will be infused on day 0.  (Also see section 9C, 9D &9E and Appendix A).  2On rare occasions an additional 
collection of PBSC, or bone marrow could be required.  
 
9B.  Central Nervous System Prophylaxis and Testicular Irradiation  
Patients will have a diagnostic lumbar puncture prior to the preparative regimen. 
Intrathecal chemotherapy will be given according to institutional standard practic e if a. 
the CSF is positive for malignant cells; b. the patient has a prior history of CNS disea se; 
c. the patient has a history of ALL; or d. the patient is otherwise deemed to be at 
significant risk of CNS disease. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be omitted if the attending 
physician considers that it is contraindicated for an individual patient bas ed on prior 
toxicities or comorbidities. No dose of intrathecal therapy will b e given within 72 hours 
of CD34+ stem cell infusion. Male patients with ALL will receive a 400 cGy testicular 
irradiation boost pre -transplant during the conditioning regimen.  For patients with a 
history of CNS leukemia a CNS irr adiation boost may also performed if it is clinically 
indicated in the opinion of the pediatric BMT physician and radiation oncologist. 
 
9C. Collection of G CSF mobilized PBSC (see also appendix A)  
All donors will receive G CSF administered by subcutaneous i njection for 5 consecutive 
days on day s -5 thru day-1. Unrelated donors will receive a dose of 10 µg/kg/day of 
GCSF according to standard NMDP and DKMS practice for unrelated donors whilst 
related donors will receive a dose of 16 µg/kg/day of GCSF accordin g to FHCRC 
standard practice. On infrequent occasions 1 -2 additional doses of GCSF may be required 
for further PBSC collections if the cell infusion goals are not met initially . The schedule 
of G- CSF administration and PBSC collections will be determined w hen the schedule for 
the conditioning regimen and day 0 is established and should be confirmed with the 
personnel in the Cellular Therapy Laboratory . Day 0 should usually be fixed on a 
Monday- Friday . Typic ally, for URD transplant recipients the first apheresis would be 
performed on a Wednesday and transported to the SCCA  Cellular Therapy Laboratory  for 
cell selection on a Thursday . PBSC collection by apheresis: Unrelated d onors will 
undergo vein to vein apheresis collections. Vein to vein apheresis is also preferred for 
related donors but insertion of a central venous catheter for apheresis collectio n is 
permitted for related donors if necessary. PBSCs will be collected on day -1 (unrelated 
donors and related donors) and sometimes also  day 0 (some related do nors) .  
On rare occasions CD34+ cell target numbers may not be achieved according to the 
specified plans, and an additional PBSC collection would be requested and infused 
without cell selections.  
  
9D.  PBSC graft engineering - CD34+ cell selection and de pletion of CD45RA+ cells (see also  
appendix A)  
• Prior to cell selection, a sample of the PBSC products will be analyzed for the c ontent 
of total nucleated cells, CD34+ cells, CD3+, CD3+ CD45RA+ RO- and total CD45RA+ 
cells and an aliquot of cells will be obt ained for subsequent analysis of other cell 
subsets (see section 9D.3 below).   
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 18 of 57 • Cell selections  will only be performed when the PBSC product from day -1 or a 
pooled collection from day-1 and day 0 contains ≥5x106 CD34+ cells/kg of recipient 
body weight to ensure that the final CD34+ cell dose will be ≥2x106 CD34+ cells/kg 
of recipient body weight. In most  cases we expect that cell selections will be 
performed on a PBSC product containing ≥10x106 CD34+ cells/ kg of recipient body 
weight which should provide a final CD34+ cell dose of ≥5x106 CD34+ cells/kg of 
recipient body weight. 
•  If the available PBSC product contains <5x106 CD34+ cells/kg of recipient body 
weight the PBSCs will be infused without any cell selection and the patients will not 
be included in the analysis of study efficacy end points. We exp ect that ≤ 5% of 
patients enrolled on protocol 2660 may receive a G -PBSC product that does not 
undergo any cell selection. 
• For the patients in whom cell select ion is performed we expect to achieve :  
 The CD34 goal  of a minimum of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg of recipient body 
weight in all patients  
 A maximum of 5 x 104 CD45RA+RO-CD3+ T cells/kg recipient body weight and 
a range of 1 -10 x 106/kg total CD3+ T cells in  >95% of patients.  
• Cell processing would commence ideally within 24 hours of the end of an apheresis  
collection , but may be delayed for up to 48 hours if necessary. 
• Timing (for additional details please see Appendix A): 
• Unrelated donors  
 The apheresis w ill be performed on day -1, and transported as soon as 
possible on day -1.  
 Cell selections will be performed on day 0 using the day -1 apheresis  
 The cells will be infused as soon as possible after cell selection and release 
testing  are completed . 
• Related do nors 
 The first apheresis will be performed on day  -1. A second apheresis may  
be performed on day 0, depending on the size of the recipient and the 
CD34+ content of the day -1 apheresis product (Appendix A). 
 Cell selections will be performed on day 0 using the day - 1 apheresis, or a 
pooled product from the combined day-1 and day 0 apheresis depending 
on the size of the recipient and the CD34+ content of the day - 1 apheresis 
product. 
 The cells will be infused as soon as possible after cell selection and relea se 
testing  are completed . 
• On rare occasions CD34+ cell target numbers may not be achieved according to 
the specified plans, and an additional PBSC collection would be requested and 
infused without cell selections .  
 
The cell selection will be performed as outlined below and in the flow chart provided as 
Appendix A.  
 
1. CD34+ cell selection (Also see Appendix A) 
The apheresis products will be processed by CD34+ cell selection using the clinical -
grade Miltenyi anti CD34+ conjugated iron dextran microbeads and m agnetic 
selection with the CliniMACs device using the institution’s Standard Operating 
Procedures. The goal is to obtain a target CD34 cell dose of >5.0x106/kg (minimum 
of >2.0x106/kg) of recipient body weight and this goal is expected to be achieved for 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 19 of 57 all products that undergo cell selection. The CliniMACS system of CD34 selection  
results in a 4 -5 log 10 depletion of CD3+ cells and typically result s in a median CD3+ 
cell dose of 2 x104/kg of which ≤ 30% are CD45RA+RO-. 
2.  CD45RA+ cell depletion to remove  TN cells (See also Appendix A) 
The CD34 -depleted flow through fraction(s) will be collected and processed to 
deplete CD45RA+ cells using clinical grade anti -CD45RA -conjugated iron dextran 
beads and magnetic selection with the CliniMACS device according to the 
institution’s standard operating procedures. The phenotype and content of T cells tha t 
remain in the product after removal of CD45RA+ cells will be determined by flow 
cytometry (see section 9D3, below). We will plan to administer a  total CD3+ T cell 
dose of 10 x106/kg to the patient including both the CD34+ enriched fraction and the 
CD45RA depleted fraction.  10 x106/kg total T cells is highly likely to contain <  5 
x104/kg of CD3+CD45RA+RO- cells/kg on the basis of our experience to date. If 
necessary t he total T cell dose may be reduced to maintain a maximum infusion of 5 
x104/kg of CD3+CD45RA+RO- cells/kg.  
3.  Analysis of the engineered cell products.  Samples will be taken from the apheresis  
products before and after the CD34 selection and depletion of CD45RA+ cells, and 
analyzed as follows (also see Appendix B “Product Testing”): 
a. Viability testing  
b. Sterility testing  
c. Total nucleated cell count 
d. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry will be performed on the initial apheresis 
product (s) and cells that have completed the selection process:  
i. The following cell subsets will be enumerated to guide cell selection and to 
determine whether the goals for the composition of the  product are achieved:  
- CD34+ cells  
- CD3+ cells  
- CD3+ CD45RA+ RO- cells  
ii. Additional cell markers may be evaluated such as  
- CD3+ CD45RA+ CD45RO- CCR7+ (TN)  
- CD8+CD45RA+ CD45RO- CCR7+ (CD8 TN) and CD4+CD45RA+ 
CD45RO- CCR7+ (CD4 TN) 
- CD3+ CD45RO+ (TM), CD3+CD8+ CD45RO+ (CD8 TM) and CD3+ CD4+ 
CD45RO+ (CD4 TM) 
- CD3+ CD45RO+ CCR -7+ (TCM) and CD3+ CD45R O+ CCR -7- (TEM) 
- CD8+ CD45RO+ CCR -7+ (CD8 T CM) and CD8+ CD45RO+ CCR -7- (CD8 
TEM), and CD4+ CD45RO+ CCR -7+ (CD4 T CM) and CD4+ CD45RO+ 
CCR -7- (CD4 T EM) 
- CD3+/- CD56+, CD3+/- CD16+, CD14+, CD19+ and CD20+  
- CD4+ CD25+FoxP3+. 
e. Specific T cell responses to pathogen -derived antigens may be performed on 
aliquots of the CD45RA depleted cell product and PBSC prior to CD45RA 
depletion using functional assays which may include ELISPOT, intracellular 
cytokine staining and/or tetramer analysis.  
  
9E. PBSC  Infusion  
The CD34+ selected product and CD45RA- depleted  product will be infused through a 
central venous catheter on day 0 or + 1 (‘second day 0’ ) of the transplant  (see Appendix 
D).  The CD34+ product will be infused first followed as soon as possible by the 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 20 of 57 CD45RA-deplet ed product. In the very unlikely event that additional CD34+ cells are 
required (see section 9D.1 and Appendix A and D) unselected PBSC will be 
administered.  
 
9F. Post-transplant immunosuppression 
GVHD prophylaxis will consist of tacrolimus and methotrexat e. Tacrolimus (FK506) will 
be started on day -1 and should be continued for 50 days followed by a standard taper if 
there is no GVHD (see section 9F.1b). Methotrexate should be administered on day +1, 
+3, +6, +11 (see section 9F.3). 
 
1. Tacrolimus administ ration   
a. Tacrolimus will be administered beginning on day -1 at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day 
by continuous IV infusion per institutional standard practice guidelines. 
Tacrolimus doses are based on actual body weight. If actual weight is more  than 
ideal body wei ght, it is recommended to use adjusted body weight. Conversion to 
the oral formulation of tacrolimus (IV: PO ratio of 1:4) may be made when oral 
feeding is established. Oral tacrolimus is recommended to be given in two divided 
daily doses every 12 hours on an empty stomach. Children < 6 years old may 
require oral dosing every eight hours to maintain target serum trough levels. 
b. If there is no evidence of grade II -IV acute GVHD on or prior to day 50, 
tacrolimus should then be tapered at the rate of approximately 5% of the day 50 
dose each week for liquid, and 20% of the day 50 dose per month for capsules.  
c. If there is evidence of acute GVHD, then the standard recommendations for 
treatment of acute GVHD and tapering of immunosuppression should be followed 
according to institutional practice. Patients with GVHD may be considered for 
enroll ment in investigational protocols for GVHD treatment  after discussion with 
the principal investigator.   
d. If there is evidence of disease progression and no evidence of GVHD prio r to day 
50, patients should taper tacrolimus and all other immunosuppressive agents 
within 2 weeks and be observed for the development of GVHD. The taper may be 
accelerated or tacrolimus may be discontinued, as clinically indicated.  
 
2. Monitoring of tac rolimus levels and dose adjustment   
a. It is recommended that t acrolimus levels are maintained in the range of 5- 15 
ng/ml. It is recommended that w hole blood trough levels are obtained on 
approximately day 2, then approximately once each week or more often if 
clinically indicated . Dose adjustments are recommended  if the levels are outside 
the therapeutic range, or if there is evidence of toxicity that may be related to 
tacrolimus.  
b. When initiating therapy with voriconazole or posaconazole in patients receiving  
tacrolimus, it is recommended that the tacrolimus dose be reduced according to 
institutional practice, and followed with frequent monitoring of the tacrolimus 
blood levels.  
c. Weekly tacrolimus levels can be discontinued during a tacrolimus taper when the 
dose has been reduced by 25% if the patient has an adequate oral intake, volume 
status, renal function and the absence of toxicities that might be attributed to  
tacrolimus.  
d. Blood pressure, renal function tests (creatinine, BUN), electrolytes and 
magnesium should be monitored regularly as per institutional standard practice 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 21 of 57 guidelines. 
 
 
3. Methotrexate administration  
In patients weighing >10kg m ethotrexate should be administered by IV push on days 
+1, +3, +6 and +11 at a dose of 1 5 mg/m2 (on day +1) and a dose of 10 mg/m2 (on day 
+3, +6, +11) . Calculation of m2 should be according to institutional standard practice 
guidelines. Children weighing 10kg or less will have methotrexate dosed per kg rather 
than per /m2  and should receive 0.5mg/kg on day +1 and 0.33mg/kg on days +3,+6, 
and +11. The first dose of methotrexate should be given at approximately 24 hours, 
but no sooner than 24 hours after completion of the cell i nfusion . The day 11 
methotrexate dose may be omitted if the patient develops severe mucositis, a pleur al 
effusion, ascites, or another relative contraindication to methotrexate administration . 
 
9.G.  Use of hematopoietic growth factors  
There will not be routine post- transplant use of growth factors  in patients enrolled on this 
protocol. Growth factors may be recommended by the Attending Physician to manage 
slow engraftment or in the event of infectious complications as indicated in Se ction 12 E. 
 
10. Evaluation 
10A. Donor evaluation  
Pre-donation evaluation for unrelated US donors should be conducted as per NMDP 
(National Marrow Donor Program) standard procedure. Pre-donation evaluation for 
unrelated German donors should also be conducted according to the same FDA required 
screening and eligibility tests. Infectious disease markers (IDM) testing  for both NMDP 
and DKMS donors is performed in CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments) certified laboratories using FDA licensed, cleared and approved t est kits. 
IDM testing for DKMS donors is sent to the central NMDP contracted laboratory 
(currently Labs Inc, Centennial, Colarado).    
Related donors evaluation: The following should be obtained for all related donors:  
1. Screening for high -risk behavior and HepBsAg, antiHepB core antibody, HBV NAT, 
antiHep C antibody, HCV NAT, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 antibodies, a serologic test for 
syphilis, and HIV (1 & 2) antibodies and HIV NAT, all performed within 30 days of 
donation and West Nile Virus NAT testing and Trypanosoma antibody testing 
according to institutional standard practice. These tests are performed using FD A 
licensed, cleared, and approved test kits in a CLIA -certified laboratory.  
2. CMV and EBV serologies performed within 30 days of donation. 
3. Serum pregnancy qualitative within 2 weeks of the start of conditioning 
4. G-CSF and monitoring blood draws (including CBC and Hepatic Function Panel with 
LDH) should be conducted per institutional standard practice guidelines.  
5. Research Tests: A 90 cc sample of related donor blood should be collected 
(preferably before the donor starts GCSF) in sodium heparin or ACD tubes for 
immunologic studies, specifically T  cell responses to pathogens by functional assays 
which may include ELISPOT, lymphoproliferation assays, intracellular cytokine 
staining and/or tetramer analysis (SCCA patients send to the Bleakley lab and  contact 
the p rotocol 2 660 research technician at (206) 667-4804 or Marie Bleakley at (206) 
469-4487).  
 
10B. Patient pre -transplant evaluation  
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 22 of 57 Patient pre -transplant evaluation should be conducted as per standard institutional 
practice.  Results of tests and/or procedur es conducted as part of that evalution  may be 
used for eligibility determination . It is recommended that the following information is 
obtained for all patients:  
1. History  
a. Possible antecedent causes for the development of leukemia or MDS including 
prior cytotoxic therapy. 
b. Hematologic, cytogenetic and flow cytometric findings at diagnosis and at the 
time of enrollment.

10C. Patient post transplant evaluation guidelines  
See Standard Practice Manual for standard evaluation procedures during the first 100 
days post transplant, evaluation prior to departure and long- term follow -up. Post 
transplant evaluation prior to day 80 will in most cases be performed whilst the patient is 
under the care of the SCCA pediatric BMT team. After day 80 evaluations may be 
performed under the supervision of the SCCA pediatric BMT team and/or the patient ’s 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 23 of 57 local physician. Specific recommendations  (which may be modified by the clinical team 
as deemed clinically appropriate) include: 
1. It is recommended that b one marrow aspiration is performed at baseline and on 
approximately days +28 and between approximately day +80 and + 100. Bone 
marrow aspiration may also be performed at approximately one year after transplan t. 
Additional bone marrow aspirations and/or biopsies may be performed at the 
discretion of the treating physicians. 
2. It is recommended that donor and recipient chimerism of CD3+ and CD33+ subsets in 
the peripheral blood is evaluated at approximately day +28  +56, and +80 by STR 
polymorphism. Peripheral blood chimerism studies are also recommended to  be 
performed at approximately 6 , 9 and 12 months post transplant.  
3. It is recommended that q uantitative immunoglobulins (to include IgG, IgA and IgM) 
are assessed at approximately  days + 28, +56 and +80 and if possible on 
approximately day +180, +270 and +360.  
4. CMV, EBV and Adenovirus monitoring is recommended for all patients.  Spec ifically 
it is recommended that:  
a. CMV PCR should be performed  at least  once every week until day 180 according 
to institutional standard practice . Preemptive anti viral therapy should be instituted 
for a positive PCR according to institutional guidelines  for recipients of T cell 
depleted allogeneic HCT  (or an IRB approved research protocol for CMV 
management). CMV PCR monitoring is suggested to continue for at least one 
year beyond transplant  for patients who have had CMV reactivation in the first 
100 days and/or have active GVHD requiring steroids or other agents. 
b. Surveillance for EBV reactivation should be performed using a quantitative EBV 
DNA PCR assay approximat ely weekly until day 180. Infectious disease (ID) 
consultation should be obtained for patients who develop EBV DNA levels of 
>1000 copies/ml plasma on any test.  
c. Surveillance for Adenovirus reactivation should be performed using a quantitative 
PCR assay (including adenovirus AF, and BCDE serogroups) approximately 
weekly until day 180. ID consultation should be obtained for patients who 
develop Adenoviral DNA levels of >300 copies/ml plasma on any test.  
d.  HHV6 monitoring by PCR may also be performed in th e first 1 -3 months after 
transplant at a frequency and for a duration determined by the patients attending 
physician as clinically indicated.  
5. Research Tests   (Also s ee appendix K for pediatric research blood draw guidelines)  
a. It is recommended that a 4ml peripheral blood sample is obtained (sent to 
SCCA/UWMC Hematopathology lab)  for research  flow cytometry for lymphocyte 
subset evaluation on approximately  days + 28, + 56 and + 80 and if possible on 
approximately day +180, +270 and +360. Specifically, it is recommended that the 
following subsets are enumerated: CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD4+TN 
(CD3+/CD4/CD45RA+/ CD45RO-/CD62L+), CD8+TN 
(CD3+/CD8+/CD45RA+/CD45RO-/CD62L+), NK (CD3-CD56+CD16+), B cells 
(CD19+), Tregs (CD4+/CD25+/CD127-).  
b. It is recommended  that peripheral blood ( ≤1ml/kg, maximum 50ml for a single 
draw)  is obtained on days +28, +56, +80-100, +180, +270 and +360 for research tests  
that may include  
i. T cell responses to EBV and possibly to other pathogens performed using 
functional assays which may include ELISPOT, lymphoproliferation assays, 
intracellular cytokine staining , and/or tetramer analysis.  
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 24 of 57 ii. T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis  
iii.  TCR Vβ spectratyping or deep sequencing 
iv. Additional lymphocyte subset analysis which may include detailed analysis of 
T reg ulatory cell  subsets. 
In smaller patients it  may not be possible to perform all of the tests specified above 
due to the smaller recipient blood volume and the need to avoid contributing to 
anemia or hypovolemia. Blood samples for research testing will not exceed the 
volumes specified in Appendix K. Research samples may also be deferred or declined 
by the patient, their guardian or attending physician depending on the patient’s 
clinical status and preferences. The research tests performed will be prioritized  by the 
PI depending on the number of available cells and the patient’s clinical course.

Post transplant time points represent guidelines for performance of required eval uations. Due to numerous factors influencing  
scheduling (pt and provider availability, testing services limitations etc),  variation in evaluation performance  dates is anticipated and 
acceptable to the protocol (e.g., within +/ - 7 days of time points < day 100; +/ - 30 days for time points > day 100).  There may also be 
variation in the content of the evaluation performed particularly beyond day 100 dependin g on the patient’s health status, size, 
geographical location, physician and/or PI recommendations and unanticipated variab les. In particular the timing of blood draws may 
be spaced out or some tests not obtained to ensure that excessive blood is not drawn from s mall children at any given time, or over a 
given period.  
1. Height on baseline only  
2. Serum Chemistry should include the following: Na, K, Cl, CO2, BUN, Cr, Ca, Mg, Phos, ALT,  AST, and BILIT/D 
3. Bone marrow aspiration; evaluation with a. histopathology b. flow cytometry  c. cytogenetics and/or molecular testing where clinically 
relevant  (FISH and PCR informative for disease status eg BCR -ABL for Ph+ ALL )  
4. Chronic GVHD evaluation should be performed  between  approximately day 80 and 100, and  on day 180, 270, 360 where possible. Day 
180, 270, 360 evaluations should be performed at the SCCA if possible, or patients may have a  ‘home town evaluation’ conducted by 
their regular medical provider with guidance by SCCA Pediatric long term follow -up (LTFU ) as appropriate. Patients with symptoms or 
signs compatible with chronic GVHD between day 100 and day 360 , based on report by the PMD and/or patient , should evaluated by the 
pediatric LTFU team at the SCCA or using telemedicine and/or medical photography in consultation with the patients regular medical 
provider as appropriate . 
5. Optional test: May or may not be performed depending on the age and developmental stage of the chil d and the recommendation o f the 
pediatric attending physician.  
6. Research tests:  In smaller patients it may not be possible to perform all of the tests specified in section 10C.6. due to the smaller recipient 
blood volume and the need to avoid contributing to anemia or hypovolemia. Blood samples for rese arch testing wil l not exceed the 
volumes specified in Appendix K. Research  samples may also be deferred or declined by the patient, their guardian or attending physician  
depending on the patient’s clinical status and preferences. The research tests will be prioritized by the PI depending on the number of 
available cells and the patient’s clinical course.  
 
 
 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 26 of 57 11. Drugs, Irradiation and PBSC Administration - Toxicities and Complications.  
Note that for chemotherapy administered during conditioning and other drugs listed in 
this pr otocol,  in keeping with  institutional practice, it is acceptable to administer a dose 
within 10% of the protocol specified dose.  
 
11A.   Total Body Irradiation (TBI) 
1. TBI will be given as 165 cGy fractions twice per day x 4 days (days - 10 to -7) to all 
patients using the linear accelerator at a rate of 6 -7 cGy/min. Dosimetry calculations 
will be performed by the radiation oncologist.   
2. Toxicity:  
a. Myelosuppression is the major dose limiting toxicity.  
b. Erythema may occur in the first 24 hours. 
c. Hyperpigmentatio n may occur in the first month following TBI.  
d. Oral ulceration, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, fatigue and alopecia 
occur frequently.  
e. Parotitis

g. Hepatic dysfunction and rarely liver failure.  
h. Late effects include cataracts, growth failure, gonadal failure and sterility, 
hypothyroidism, pulmonary dysfunction and secondary malignancies.  
 
11B.   Thiotepa  
1. Dosage. Thiotepa will be administered in a dose of 5 mg/kg/day (adjusted body 
weight) IV over approximate ly 4 hours for 2 consecutive days (day -6 and day -5). 
The total dose is 10 mg/kg (adjusted body weight). If actual weight is less than ideal  
body weight, actual body weight will be used.  Thiotepa is available in 15 mg  vials 
and is reconstituted with sterile water resulting in an isotonic solution with 10 mg/ml 
of thiotepa.  
2. Toxicity   
a. The major dose limiting toxicity of thiotepa is myelosuppression.  
b. Oral ulceration, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, fatigue and alopecia 
occur frequently. 
c. Occasional ly patients develop a skin rash that involves darkening of the skin and 
peeling, particularly in the axillary and inguinal folds. Thiotepa is secreted in 
sweat, therefore the axillary and inguinal areas should be washed twice daily 
during administration and for 2 days after administration.  
d. Dizziness and headache

11E.  Tacrolimus administration  
1. Also see section 9F  for information about tacrolimus administration and dosage 
adjustments.  
2. Administration and dosage 
a. Intravenous dosing - The standard mode of IV administration is by continuous 
infusion over 22-24 hours. Tacrolimus should be initiated as an IV continuous 
infusi on on day –1 at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day based on actual body weight. If 
actual weight is greater  than ideal body weight, it is recommended to use adjusted 
body weight.  
b. Oral dosing – The oral formulation of tacrolimus is supplied as 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 5 
mg c apsules or as oral syrup (0.5 mg/ml).  
c. Conversion from IV to PO dosing of Tacrolimus.  Patients should be converted to 
an oral dose at 4 times the IV dose to be given in divided (Q 12 hour) doses. 
Children < 6 years old may require oral dosing every eight hours to maintain 
target serum trough levels. 
3. Toxicity  
Side effects are generally reversible and may include:  
a. Rise in serum creatinine, electrolyte wasting, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and 
renal failure.  
b. Nausea and vomiting and hepatic dysfunction. 
c. Hypertension, 
d. Increases in cholesterol and triglycerides  
e. Paresthesia, tremors, seizures, headache, insomnia, dizziness, depression, 
confusion, hallucinations, psychosis, myoclonus, neuropathy, agitation.  
f. Blurred vision, photophobia. 
g. Hirsutism  
 
11F.  Methotrexate administration  
1. Also see section 9F  for information about methotrexate  administration and dosage 
adjustments.  
2. Administration and dosage  
a. In patients weighing >10kg methotrexate should be administered by IV push on 
days +1, +3, +6 and +11 at a dose of 15 mg/m2 (on day +1) and a dose of 10 
mg/m2 (on day +3, +6, +11). Calculation of m2 should be according to 
institutional standard practice guidelines.  
b. Children weighing 10kg or less will have methotrexate dosed per kg rather than 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 28 of 57 per /m2  and should receive 0.5mg/kg on day +1 and 0.33mg/kg on days +3,+6, 
and +11.  
c. The first dose of methotrexate should be given at approximately 24 hours, but no 
sooner than 24 hours after completion of the cell infusion.  
d. If clinically indicated methotrexate levels may be obtained  and/or methotrexate 
dose adjusted according to institutional standard practice guidelines and/or 
leucovorin rescue may be considered. In the case of severe mucositis or in the 
presence of effusions, ascites, or another relative contraindication to methotr exate 
administration , the day 11 methotrexate may be withheld at the discretion of the 
attending physician.  
3. Toxicity  
a. In this setting of HCT, mucositis is the primary toxicity related to methotrexate.  
b. If there is also renal dysfunction methotrexate clearance may be delayed.  
c. Methotrexate may cause an elevation in serum transaminases.  
d. Severe skin reactions after single or multiple doses of methotrexate have 
occasionally been reported.

12B. Infection Prophylaxis  
1) Antibiotics 
(a) Prophylactic antibacterial antibiotics should be used for all patients that develop 
neutropenia (ANC <500/ml) according to institutional standard practice 
guidelines or according to currently active protocols. 
(b) In order to prevent early Streptococcus viridians  bacteremia all patients should 
receive additional prophylactic therapy.  Patients should be started on oral 
penicillin daily beginning at day -2 until they are unable to take PO, when they 
should be moved to penicillin IV through day +10.  Patients with a known allergy 
to penicillin should receive Vancomycin IV from day -2 through day +10. The 
recommended standard regimens are:  
(i) Standard: Penicillin VK 25mg/kg PO BID (maximum 1 gram PO BID) 
starting at day -2 until no t able to take oral therapy and then IV Penicillin G 
25,000U/kg IV every 6 hours (maximum one million units IV every six hours, 
4 million units total /day) until day +10.  
(ii) If Penicllin Allergic :  IV Vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV every 12 hours from day -
2 through day +10 
(c) Neutropenic fever: In patients with any active mucositis and neutropenia, IV 
Vancomycin (15 mg/kg IV at least every 12 hours ) or an alternative antibiotic 
regimen cover ing streptococcus viridans  should be given in addition to the other 
empiric neutropenic fever antibiotic therapy specified by institutional standa rd 
practice guidelines (e.g. Cefazidime).  Prophyla ctic penicillin may be 
discontinued when vancomycin or an alternative  anti-streptococcus  viridans agent 
is initiated.  
2) Prophylactic fluconazole or an alternative antifungal medication should be used from 
the first day of conditioning or sooner until day +75 post transplant in accordance 
with standard practice (or according to an IRB approved anti- fungal research 
protocol) 
3) Preemptive therapy for CMV reactivation should be administered according to 
institutional standard practice guidelines  for a T cell depleted allogeneic HCT (or 
according to an IRB approved CMV research protocol). 
4) Infectious disease consultation should be obtained for patients who develop EBV 
DNA levels of  >1000 copies/ml plasma on any test.   
5)  Infectious disease consultation should be obtained for patients who develop 
Adenovirus DNA levels of >300 copies/ml plasma on any test.   
6) Patients should receive acyclovir or valacyclovir according to institutional s tandard 
practice guidelines as prophylaxis for HSV and VZV. Acyclovir or valacyclovir can 
be withheld during periods that the patient is receiving ganciclovir, foscarne t or other 
effective antiviral drug for management of CMV.  
7) After engraftment  and ≥20 -30 days after HCT , patients may receive prophylaxis for 
pneumocystis carinii according to institutional standard practice guidelines.  
 
12C.  Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prophylaxis of hepatic complications of transplant  
1. UDCA is recommended to prevent hepatic complications according to standard 
practice guidelines.  
 
12D.  Management of acute and chronic GVHD  
1. Patients who develop > grade II acute GVHD should be treated with systemic 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 30 of 57 corticosteroids and /or with beclomethasone or budesonide if clinically indicated. 
Patients failing initial therapy will be eligible for second line therapy. Second  line 
immunosuppressant therapy includes but is not limited to sirolimus, mycophenolate 
mofetil, monoclonal antibodies, pentostatin, denileukin difitox, thalidomide and 
extracorporeal photopheresis, given on or off study protocols.  
 
2. Patients who develop chronic GVHD and require systemic immunosuppressant 
therapy should be treated with immunosuppressive therapy according to institutional 
guidelines or may be treated on rese arch protocols.  
 
12E.  Management of Delayed Engraftment  
1. If the ANC has not reached 100 by Day 21, a bone marrow examination may be 
performed to ascertain cellularity. If the ANC is <100 on Day 21, G- CSF, GM -CSF 
or other appropriate cytokines may be utiliz ed and chimerism studies should be 
performed. Care of patients that have continued poor graft function after cytokine  
administration or who reject their grafts after initial engraftment is at the discretion of 
the attending physician.  
 
12F. Management of Relapse  
1. Patients who are at high risk of relapse, have persistent leukemia or who relapse aft er 
transplant may be treated according to institutional practice which can include b ut are 
not limited to chemotherapy , small molecule inhibitors  and/or donor lymphocyte 
infusions (DLI), or may be eligible for research protocols including immunotherapy 
with antigen- specific T cells.  
 
13. Records  
The medical record containing information regarding treatment of the patient wil l be 
maintained as a confidential document, within the guidelines of the Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children’s , the University of Washington Medical 
Center, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance .  
Each patient is assigned a unique patient number to assure patient confidentialit y.  
Patients should not be referred to by this number, by name, or by any other individual 
identifier in any publication or external presentation.  The Clinical Statistics Department 
maintains a patient database at FHCRC to allow storage and retrieval of patie nt data 
collected from a wide variety of sources. The licensed medical records department s, 
affiliated with the institution where the patient receives medical care, maint ains all 
original inpatient and outpatient chart documents.  
 
The primary research rec ords will be contained and accessed through CORE, an 
encrypted, password- protected web site maintained by the FHCRC Clinical Research 
Data Systems division. Access is restricted to personnel authorized in writi ng by 
the FHCRC  principal investigator.   
 
Information gathered from this study regarding patient outcomes and adverse eve nts will 
be made available to the Federal Drug Administration. All precautions to maintain  
confidentiality of medical records will be taken.  
 
14.   Evaluation and statistical considerations 
14A. Type of study 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 31 of 57 This is a prospective phase II study of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in pediatric 
patients using PBSC that are selectively depleted of CD45RA+ T cells.  
 
14B. Definition of endpoints 
1. Estimate the time to discontinuation o f systemic immunosuppression in pediatric 
recipients of CD45RA+ T cell-depleted PBSCT (a. including and b. excluding 
calcineurin inhibitors)  
a. Definition s:  
i. Time from transplant to the final discontinuation of all systemic immune 
suppression. 
ii. Time from transplant to the discontinuation of all systemic immune 
suppression with the exception of calcineurin inhibitors.  
b. Evaluation: The research team will follow the study participants via the database 
of the FHCRC long term fo llow-up program (LTFU) and the patient ’s primary 
care physician and/or oncologist as required to determine the final date of 
completion of immunosuppression as defined.  
2. Graft failure  
a. Definition: Graft failure is defined operationally as:  
i. Failure to reach an ANC of >500/µl for 3 consecutive days by day 28 
ii. Irreversible decrease in ANC to <100 after an established donor graft:  If the 
reduction in ANC is the result of relapse, as determined by histopathology, 
flow cytometry or molecular studies, this will not be considered graft failure.  
If the re is a reasonable explanation, such as viral infection or drug effect that 
may be responsible for a reversible decrease in ANC, this will be not 
necessarily be considered graft failure.  
b. Evaluation: Engraftment endpoints will include: 
i. Time to ANC of >500/uL on the first of three consecutive days. 
ii. Time to ANC of >1,000/uL on the first of three consecutive test results 
iii. Time to platelet count >20,000/µL for 3 days without transfusion. 
iv. Time to platelet count >50,000/µL for 3 days without transfusion.  
v. It is rec ommended that c himerism analysis of CD3 and CD33 cells in 
peripheral blood be performed on or around day 28, 56, 80-100, 180, 270 and 
360. Additional peripheral blood or marrow chimerism studies may be 
performed as clinically indicated.   
3. Chronic GVHD  
a. Definition: Chronic GVHD will be diagnosed using NIH criteria outlined in 
Appendix F. Chronic GVHD will be defined operationally as the occurrence of 
compatible symptoms  fulfilling NIH criteria and requiring treatment with 
systemic immunosuppression .  
b. Evaluation will be conducted by the FHCRC pediatric LTFU team at day 80-100 
and where possible on approximately day 180, 270, 360 and yearly up to 5 years 
after HCT. The patient’s primary care physician and/or pediatric oncologist will 
conduct clinical assessments  between these time points as required.  
i.  The primary chronic GVHD endpoint will be the occurrence of chronic GHVD 
meeting NIH criteria and requiring systemic pharmacological immunosuppression 
(systemic corticosteroids and/or other systemic agents, excludin g calcineurin 
inhibitors which are generally not considered adequate as sole agents for the 
treatment of chronic GVHD)  
ii. A secondary chronic GVHD endpoint will be use of additional immune 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 32 of 57 suppressive agents other than first line therapy (first line therapy is considered 
prednisone and tacrolimus/cyclosporin).  
c. If patients do not develop chronic GVHD after transplant but do relapse and 
then receive donor lymphocyte infusion or antigen specific T cells as treatment  
of relapse they will not be considered evalua ble for the chronic GVHD 
endpoint. 
4. Acute GVHD  
a. Definition:  
i. Acute GVHD will be diagnosed and graded using the clinical and laboratory 
criteria in Appendix E. Acute GVHD is defined operationally as the occurrence of 
compatible symptoms or signs in the skin,  gastrointestinal tract, or liver prior to 
Day +100. In most cases histology of biopsy material of at least one involved 
organ will be used to confirm acute GVHD, but biopsy is not absolutely required 
for the diagnosis.  
ii. Steroid refractory GVHD will be def ined by the decision of the attending 
physician to initiate secondary systemic therapy for acute GVHD due to concerns 
that corticosteroids are providing inadequate control of acute GVHD 
manifestations.  
b. Evaluation: During the inpatient stay, clinical evalua tions will occur daily.  
During the outpatient stay, each patient should be evaluated at least weekly until 
departure.  Clinical evaluations will be performed by an attending physician. 
Cutaneous, hepatic and gastrointestinal GVHD should be confirmed by biopsy 
except where medically contraindicated  or considered medically unneces sary. An 
attending pathologist will interpret the biopsy material. The decision to initiate 
GVHD therapy will be made by the attending pediatric BMT physician.  
At the conclusion of the study, two pathologists with experience in GVHD will 
independently review the histology of biopsy specimens. An acute GVHD grade 
will be assigned for each patient by three experienced transplant physicians.  
c. Endpoints for acute GVHD that will be collected include: 
i. Presence of acute GVHD grades II -IV 
ii. Presence of acute GVHD grade III-IV 
iii. Presence of steroid refractory acute GVHD  
5. Relapse  
a. Definition: Relapse is defined by the presence of malignant cells in marrow, 
peripheral blood, or extramedullary sites by histopathology. Minimal residual 
disease is defined as the presence of malignant cells in the marrow, peripheral 
blood, or extramedullary sites detectable only by molecular methods, 
cytogenetics, or flow cytometry, but not observed by histopathology. 
b. Evaluation: Testing for recurrent malignancy in the blood and bone marrow will 
be performed by monitoring the CBC and bone marrow as outlined in Table 3.  
Suspected extramedullary sites of recurrent disease may  be evaluated by biopsy 
and/or lumbar puncture if clinically indicated.   
6. Transplant related mortality (TRM). TRM is defined as mortality in any patient for 
whom there has not been a diagnosis of relapse. 
 
14C. Statistical Analysis and Stopping Rules  
1. Duration of immuno suppression 
The first primary object ive is to estimate the time-to-discontinuation of systemic 
immunosuppression in pediatric recipients of CD45RA+ T cell-depleted PBSCT.  The 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 33 of 57 goal is to observe a statistically significant reduction in the time -to-discontinuation of 
systemic immunosuppressio n compared to th e historical experience without an 
accompanying increase in the probability of graft failure.  
Unpublished data from FHCRC shows that amongst 55 children with a history of 
leukemia who received a myeloablative bone marrow (N=34 ) or PBSC (N=21) 
transplant from an unrelated donor (HLA -A, B, C,  DRB1 , and DQB1 molecular ly 
matched ) following conditioning with TBI and cyclophosphamide between July 2002 
and December 2010 the median time to discontinuation of all imm unosuppression 
was 1 076 days, with a median time to discontinuation of 608 days for bone marrow 
recipients, and median time to discontinuation not reached for recipients of P BSC. 
Based on these data, we shall use a median time to discontinuation of systemic 
immunosuppression of 608 days as our benchmark for comparison in the current trial. 
The goal is to increase the proportion of patients who discontinue all systemic 
immunosuppression from the historical value of 50% to 80 % in the current trial.  
Evaluation of 20 patients will provide 90 % power to observe a statistically significant 
difference between (the fixed probability of) 50% and 80% of patients discontinuing 
by 608 days (w ith a 1 -sided significance level of 0.05 ).  
Pediatric patients with HLA -identical related donors ≥18 years will also be eligible 
for enrollment on the protocol but only a few such patients are likely to be enrolled 
and GVHD may be less frequent and less prolonged in these patients. Therefore the 
time to discontinuation of immunosuppression data for th e subgroup of pediatric 
patients with related donors will be analyzed separately.  
 
2. Graft Failure  
Graft failure will be closely monitored throughout the study. A true probability of 
graft failure of 10% will be considered excessive. If there is sufficient evidence to 
suggest that the true probability of graft failure  exceeds 10%, the study will be 
stopped.  Sufficient evidence will be taken to be an observed rate whose lower one -
sided 90% confidence limit exceeds 10%.  Operationally this will occur if any of the 
following observed ratios occur: 2 of the first 5 or fewer, 3 of the first 11 or fewer , 4 
of the first 18 or fewer, or 5 of the first 20 of fewer patients develop graft failure .  If 
the true probability of graft failure is 0.05, the probability of stopping after 10 or 20 
patients is approximately 0.03 and 0.04, respectively.   If the true probability is 0.3, 
then the probability of stopping is approximately 0.67 and 0.88, respectively 
(probabilities estimated from 5,000 simulations).  
 
3. Failure to deliver therapy  
If the CD34+ stem cells  cannot be delivered as planned for the first 2 patients 
enrolled, or for any other two consecutive patients, the study will be suspended for a 
period of time in order to optimize the procedure. This is defined as failure to deliv er 
a minimum of 2.0x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient body weight. If an improved 
procedure is achieved, the study may be resumed.  
 
4. Patient withdrawal from treatment or study  
All patients who receive infusion of PBSC with or without cell selection wil l be 
considered evaluable for study safety  endpoints. If they received PBSC with cell 
selection they will be evaluable for study efficacy endpoints. 
 
When a patient withdraws consent from P2660 they will no longer have research 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 34 of 57 samples taken  and the resear ch team will no longer have access to clinical records to 
follow them for study endpoints unless they have signed the general FHCRC consent 
and authorization form allowing their leftover specimens and medical records to b e 
used for research.  If they have signed that consent then they will still be evaluable for 
clinical endpoints although research blood draws would be discontinued. I f the patient  
refused to sign this general consent or withdrew general consent to the use of clinical 
data for research purpo ses then no further follow-up would be done. 
 
15. Guidelines for Reporting and Tracking Events  
15A. Toxicity Grading  
Toxicities will be graded according to the current version of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.  The f ull text of the NCI 
CTCAE is available online at : 
 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html  
 
15B. Definitions  
Definitions associated with reportable events can be found on the FHCRC’ s Institutional 
Review Of fice (IRO) extranet website .  
 
According to ICH guidelines (Federal Register. 1997; 62(90):25691-25709) and 21 CFR 
312.32, IND Safety Reports, and ICH E2A, Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting , an adverse event is defined as f ollows: 
 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subj ect 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unin tended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related  to the 
medicinal product. 
 
Abnormal laboratory values for laboratory parameters specifi ed in the study should not 
be recorded as an adverse event unless an intervention is required (repeat testing to 
confirm the abnormality is not considered intervention), the laboratory abnormality  
results in a serious adverse event or the adverse event res ults in study termination or 
interruption/discontinuation of study treatment. 
 
Medical conditions present at screening (i.e., before the study treatment is adminis tered) 
are not adverse events and should not be recorded on adverse event pages of the CRFs.  
These medical conditions should be adequately documented on the subject chart.  
However, medical conditions present at baseline that worsen in intensity or frequ ency 
during the treatment or post- treatment periods should be reported and recorded as adverse  
events.  
 
15C.  Tracking and reporting of events 
 
Patients enrolled in this study are receiving treatments that are generally ass ociated with 
high rates of “expected” adverse events ( outlined in Appendix G as well as Section 11 of 
the protocol). The following events will be tracked and reported:   
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 35 of 57 1. Non-hematologic adverse events assessed as Grade 3 -5 per NCI CTCAE, expected or 
unexpected, from the start of study treatment (pre -transplant conditioning) through 
day 100 will be collected, with the exception of some abnormal lab values and 
medical conditions present at screening (as noted in section 15B).  
2. Grade 3 -5 Blood/Bone Marrow adverse events occurring between day 60 and day 100 
will be collected.  
3. Graft versus host disease assessment done as part of routin e care will be reviewed 
approximately once weekly through day 100. Details about GVHD symptoms, 
diagnosis, treatment , and outcome will be collected. After day +100, GVHD data will 
be captured at day +180, +270, 1 year, and then yearly through 5 years after day 0 
whenever possible.  
4. Relapse, graft failure, and death data will be captured as they occur in the firs t 200 
days post transplant for all patients, and from 200 days up to 5 years whenever 
possible.  
5. All treatment related mortality attributed to the in vestigational cell product occurring 
in the first 100 days will be reported to the IRB and the FDA as stated in sections 
15.D and E. 
6. Grade 3 -5 infusion reactions will be reported to the IRB and FDA  as stated in 
sections 15.D and E. 
 
15D. Reporting Requireme nt to FHCRC IRB  
The Principal Investigator, study nurse, or coordinator shall submit to the FHCRC  IRB 
reportable events according to current reporting policies as outlined in FHCRC IRB  
Policies for Reportable Events.   
 
The FHCRC PI and research nurse wil l meet regularly  and will together review all 
reported events that could potentially meeting reporting requirements .  If the event meets 
FHCRC IRB current reporting obligations it will be sent to them.  
 
All reportable events should be submitted on the rele vant FHCRC Forms (URLs linking 
to the FHCRC IRO website are found in Table 5 FHCRC IRB Forms for Reporting).

15E.  Reporting to the FDA 
As a study conducted under I ND (Investigation al New  Drug ) regulations we will comply 
with the FDA regulations regarding safety reporting  21CFR312.32 including the 
following requirements:  
1. A sponsor must promptly review all information relevant to the safety of the drug  
21CFR312.32 (b). 
2. A sponsor must notify FDA in an IND safe ty report of potential serious risks, as 
soon as possible but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines  
that the information qualifies for reporting under 21 CFR312.32 (c) (1). Information that 
is required to be reported includes, but is not limited to, a. Serious and unexpected 
adverse reactions and b. An increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse  
reactions.  
3. The IND safety report must  be completed and sent to the FDA in a narrative format , 
on FDA Form 3500A, or an e lectronic format . 
4. A sponsor must also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life- threatening 
suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days 
after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information  21CFR312.32 ( c)(2). 
 
16. Data safety monitoring plan 
16A. Monitoring the progress of trials and the safety of participants  
The FHCRC PI /Sponsor is responsible for monitoring this clinical trial, with oversight by 
a Data and Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), the Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee ( DSMC ) and the IRB at the FHCRC . This is a Phase II study and the 
assessment of risk is considered above minimal.  The PI reviews outcome data for each 
individual patient at approximately 3 and 12 months after HCT , at a minimum. 
 
A DSMB w ill be in place to meet approximately every 6 months to review the data 
particularly as it relates to engraftment, grades III -IV GVHD and relapse. The DSMB 
confirms that the trial has not met any stopping rules and reviews any patient safet y 
problems necessitating discontinuation of the trial. A report from the DSMB is  submitted 
to the FHCRC IRB and the PI. The DSMB will discontinue the review of outcomes when 
all subjects on this trial have completed all protocol -specified follow -up.

All members  will have experience in the management of patients with leukemia and 
myelodysplasia and in the condu ct and monitoring of clinical trials.  At lea st some of the 
members of the  DSMB will have experience in the management of pediatric patients with 
leukemia and myelodysplasia. 
 
The DSMC at FHCRC will review the progress of the protocol with respect to the 
monitoring plan at the time of each annual ren ewal. As with initial review,  annual 
FHCRC IRB review and approval is also required.  
 
A protocol monitor (from the FHCRC Clinical Research Support Office or an external 
monitor) will be retained to monitor study  progress. The scope of monitoring will be 
based on the FHCRC/UW Data and  Safety Monitoring Plan: 
http://centernet.fhcrc.org/CN/depts/iro/irb/dsm / Per the DSMP subjects will be randomly 
selected for verification .  An initial monitoring visit is expected within six months of 
enrollment of the first s ubject and preferred prior to enrollment exceeding 4 subjects as 
100% verification is expected during an initial visit.  Monitoring reports will be 
forwarded to the DSMB, and the Principal Investigator/Sponsor at FHCRC.  
 
Flow of information concerning clinical trial participants orig inates with the clinicians 
and nurses in the clinic and is transmitted to the FHCRC Research Nurse. At the  FHCRC 
health care providers and rotating attending physicians assess patient s and record their 
observations regarding toxicity and response outcomes in the medical record. Thus, 
multiple health care providers provide independent observations and participate in 
monitoring this trial. The PI may be a clinician for some patients entered on this trial.  
However, assessments are the sum total of the multiple  clinicians involved with the 
patient averting possible conflict of interest having the PI as the attending clin ician for 
protocol patients. If determination of adverse events is cont roversial, co -investigators will 
convene on an ad hoc basis as necessary to review the primary data and render a decision. 
 
 16B. Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance 
The study has a research nurse  that follows patients to confirm eligi bility , reporting of 
adverse events , reporti ng of events which are part o f the safety -monitoring plan, and 
protocol adherence. The PI and research nurse are responsible for review and 
maintenance of all patient research records to ensure data integrity and  protocol 
adherence.  
 
Health care providers and rotating attending physic ians assess patients and record their 
observations in the medical record. This documentation is extracted by the site’s research 
staff by approximately day 100 (and no later than day +130 ) and again at approximately 1 
year (no later than 1 5 months) after H CT via chart review and entered into electronic  
protocol specific Case Report Form s (CRF s). The principal investigator will review  the 
CRFs and the primary source documents verifying by signature (electronic) their  data 
accurac y.  
 
The study is monitored under the FHCRC Monitoring Plan. The FHCRC Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan details the full scope and extent of monitoring and provides for 
immediate action in the event of the discove ry of major deviations.

Protocol 2660.00  
Page 42 of 57 2. We will also perform cell selection only when the T  cells in the PBSC product include a distinct CD45RO+, 
CD45RA- population observed by f low cytometry. ≤5% of donor products are expected to ha ve a CD45 variant in 
which all the T cells express CD45RA and there is the refore no CD45RO+, CD45RA- population. If there is no 
CD45RO+, CD45RA- population the PBSCs will be infused without any cell selection and the patients will not be 
included in the analysis of study efficacy end points.  
3. Situations may arise where the goals for cell selec tion are not achieved with cell processing . These very unusual 
situations will be discussed with the protocol PI  and a recommendation made. General guidelines are as follows:  
a) If a total CD34 cell dose of ≥2.0 x 106 cells/kg is not achieved after the processing the apheresis  collection (s) all 
available CD34+ cells will be administered to the patient as soon as possible and a n additional apheresis collection 
will be requested and t he un -manipulated G -PBSC product will be administered to the patient with out any cell 
selection procedure. These patients will not be inc luded in the analysis of study efficacy end points .   
b) If < 5 x 104CD3+ CD45RA+ RO- cells/kg in the sum of the CD34+ fraction and CD45RA depleted fraction 
cannot be achieved by simply reducing the number of CD3+ and/or CD34+ cells within the target range (minimum of 
2.0 x 106/kg CD34+ cells and a range of 1 -10 x 106/kg total CD3+ T cells) as described above, the following s teps 
may be required:   
i. Repeat the CD45RA depletion of the CD34 depleted fraction using a sec ond magnetic column.  
ii. If 1 x 106 CD3+ cells/kg an d <5 x 104CD3+CD45RA+ RO- cell/kg cannot be achieved by i. then the patients 
should receive the CD34 selected produ ct (minimum of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) and may receive an 
aliquot of the CD3+ cells (i.e. less than 1 x 106 CD3+ cells/kg) containing <5 x 104CD3+CD45RA+ RO- 
cell/kg. These patients who do not meet the goals fo r cell selection will not be included in the  analysis of 
study end points. Patients will receive immunosuppression as de scribed in the protocol unless they receive 
only the CD34+ selected product and < 1 x 105 CD3+ cells/kg in which case they will receive no 
immunosuppression.  
3. In a typical case we expect to a. perform cell selections on the day -1 apheresis collection  (unrelated donors, 
some related donors) , or a product pooled from the day -1 and day 0 collection  (some related donors) , b. to use a 
portion of the apheresis collection(s) containing a t least 8-10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg  for the cell selections , c. to 
reserve at least 3 -5 x 106 CD34+ cells /kg as a back -up for infusion of unselected PBSC into the patient if 
unanticipated problems arise in the cell selection procedure, a nd d. (for URD recip ients) to cryopreserve at least 
1 x 107 CD3+ cells/kg for potential future  donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI). We also plan to cryopreserve any 
available additional unmanipulated PBSC  left over from the cell processing requirements  as a back -up in the 
unlikel y event of graft failure . In the unlikely event that there are insufficient unmanipulated P BSC to 
cryopreserve as DLI for URD recipients we may instead cry opreserve aliquots of the CD34 -depleted fraction to 
be used as DLI.  
Apheresis Collection Guidelines  
Collection of unrelated donor GCSF mobilized apheresis products wi ll be managed by the N MDP (US donors) or 
DKMS (German donors) . Collection of related donor GCSF mobilized apheresis products will be managed by the 
SCCA apheresis center. The following repre sents a general guideline  
Unrelated donors  
1. A large volume  apheresis collection (processing approximately 24L of blood)  will be performed on day -1 and 
transported as soon as possible on day -1.  
Related donors  
1. A large volume apheresis collection (processin g approximately 18L of blood) will be performed on day -1. The 
CD34 content will be evaluated on day -1.  
a) If  ≥ 15 million  CD34 cells/kg have been obtained from the day -1 no further apheresis is required. Cell 
processing can commence on day 0 using 10 million CD34 cells/kg w ith 5 million CD34 cells/kg held in 
the event of cell processing problems, and cryopreserv ed if not required.  
b) If  <15 million CD34 cells/kg have been obtained from the day -1 collection a second collection will be 
obtained on day 0 to a maximum of 18L.  
i. The second collection may be totaled with the day -1 apheresis for a pooled or two separate cell 
selection(s) on day 0 and/or day +1 ( e.g. if the day -1 apheresis was ≤ 8 x 106 CD34/kg and the total of 
the day -1 and 0 aphereses is ≥ 5 x 106/kg )  
ii. The second collection may also be held as a back -up in case of unanticipated problems in the cell 
selection procedure of the first apheresis  and sub sequently cryopreserved if not required for cell 
selection.   
On very rare occasions the minimum CD34+ cell target number of 2 x 106/kg may not be achieved before or after 
cell processing and a n additional donor apheresis collection may be requested and infused without cell selection s. 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 43 of 57 APPENDIX B  
Product Testing  
 
The CD34 -enriched and CD45RA -depleted cells, because they are derived solely as the result of a cell 
selection process with no culturing required, will be considered as having undergone “minim al 
manipulation”. Each of the CD34 -enriched and CD45RA -depleted cell batches will be tested for safety, 
purity and potency, identity and stability as indicated below. In general, once myeloablati ve therapy has 
been initiated, the patient must receive the CD34 -selected PBSC product, to reconstitute his/her 
hematopoietic system.  
 
a) Safety : Samples from the final products (CD34+ and CD45RA-) will be sent for sterility testing for 
bacterial and/or fungal contamination of products according to methods specified in  21 CFR 610.12. The 
tests will be performed in clinical laboratories . If positive cultures are found organism species identification 
will take place.  FHCRC has defined procedures and action plans in place to notify appropriate personnel 
and take appropria te measures if positive cultures are detected after infusion has taken place .  
 
b) Purity and potency:    
CD34+ product:  Viability will be determined by flow cytometry using exclusion of propidium iodide or 7 -
AAD with a not ification specification set of < 70% viable cells (i.e. If there are <70% viable cells in the 
CD34+ product the PI will be notified). Quantitation of CD34+ cells will be performed by flow cytometry, 
with a  notification specification of < 70% final purity and CD34+ cell dose of < = 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. 
Quantitation of residual naïve T -cells (CD3+CD45RA+CD45RO-) and total T cells (CD3+) will be 
performed by multi -color flow cytometry, however no specification will be set  for these cell subsets other 
than the total dose indicated below.  
 
CD45RA- product:   Viability will be determined by flow cytometry using exclusion of propidium iodide or 
7-AAD, with a notification specification set of <70% viable cells. Quantitation of r esidual naïve T -cells 
(CD3+CD45RA+CD45RO-), and total T cells (CD3+) will also be performed by multi -color flow cytometry, 
The aim is to infuse a maximum of 5 x 104 CD3+CD45RA+ RO-/kg and a range of 1 -10 x 106 CD3+ cells/kg 
in the sum of the CD45RA -depleted and CD34+ cell products and a minimum of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.  
 
c) Identity:   Proper identification of all the intermediate and final cell products will be as sured by defined 
process and label controls as specified in standard operating procedures within the cell pro cessing facilities 
to ensure the recipient is recei ving the correct cell products.  
 
d) Stability:  The first leukapheresis coll ection will be transported and stored for a total of up to 48 hours 
from the end of apheresis collection at 4C prior to CD34 selection and CD45RA depletion . Unmanipulated 
leukaphere sis products are routinely stored this duration and longer, particularly in matched unrelat ed donor 
transplantation, and we therefore do not anticipate that stability will be a major  concern for this study.  
Viability, which is an important measure of stab ility, will be assessed immediately after all processing is 
completed, and infusion of the CD34+ cells and CD45RA -depleted cells will take place within 6 hours after 
completion and release of the  cell product s.

Protocol 2660.00  
Page 45 of 57 APPENDIX D  
Infusion of Selected Cells  
 
General Guidelines  
The selected cells (CD34+ and CD34 depleted CD45RA depleted fraction s) will be infus ed through a blood 
administration set filter. The cells will be suspended in clinical grade Normosol -R (Hospira) plus HSA (Baxter) 
for infusion. Central venous access is preferred for infusion. A peripheral IV line may be used only if  central 
access is not  available. Under no circumstances will these cells be irradiated . The staff caring for the patient must 
be familiar with the practices and complications of HPC infusion. Staff should be prepared to treat the recipient 
for an acute hemolytic transfusion re action.  
 
Questions regarding ABO mismatches should be directed to the SCCA Transfusion Services O ffice or the 
SCCA Transfusion Medicine attending on call. Other questions regarding handling of selected cells  should 
be directed to the Medical Director of the Cellular Therapy Laboratory.  
 
 
Timing  
After completion of the conditioning regimen cells should not be infused earlier than 36 hr s after the last dose of 
chemotherapy . Selected cells will be infused as soon as they are available. The CD34+ fraction will be given first 
followed as soon as possible, by the CD34 -depleted CD45RA -depleted fraction. If a delay is anticipated because 
of timing of conditioning regimen or patient medical status as determined by the attendi ng physician, cells may be 
stored in the r efrigerator (4 °C). It is aimed to commence administration of each fraction within 6 hours from the 
end of processing of that fraction.  
 
Volume  
The CD34+ cell volume will be approximately 50ml or less, and the CD34 -depleted, CD45RA -depleted cells will 
also be approximate ly 50ml or less.  
 
Pre-medication  
No pre -medication will be given unless patient has previously reacted to blood or platelet t ransfusions, then 
premedication will be administered as per patient’s transfusion guidelines for allerg ic or febrile reactions.  
 
Filtration  
Product s should be filtered through a blood administration set .  
 
Product Infusion Rate  
Begin at 0.5 times maintenance rate for 15 minutes, then increase to 1.5 times mainten ance rate as tolerated.  
 
Monitoring  
Vital signs before infusion, after 15 minutes, then hourly during infusion, and at completion of infusion. If any 
reaction occurs, notify primary care provider.  
 
Concomitant Infusions:  
No medications or fluids may be given "piggy -back" with the selected cells, although they may be given thr ough 
the other lumen of a double lumen catheter. Amphotericin, antibodies, investigational  medications or blood 
products should not be given concomitantly because of difficulty in evaluating reactions. Ce lls must not be 
infused during plasmapheresis or dia lysis.  
 
Reactions:  
Volume Overload: Generally, the CD34+ fraction and CD34 depleted CD45RA depleted cell volumes will be 50 
ml each so volume overload is not expected. Volume reduction may be required if the cell volum e of either 
individual infusion exceeds 15 ml/kg recipient weight  (highly unlikely), or if the patient is volume overloaded by 
clinical criteria. Request volume reduction by contacting the Cellular Therapy La boratory.  
 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 46 of 57 Transfusion Reaction : Recipients who have clinically significant antibodies  to AB or other antigens found on 
donor red cells may be at risk for an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (i.e. major m ismatch). Red cell 
depletion (or recipient plasma exchange) may be indicated in some cases. Patients also may exp erience 
hemoglobinuri a from damaged cells in the cell inoculum. Delayed hemolysis may occur in the setting of  major 
mismatch and rebound of recipient antibodies after plasmapheresis (if performed).  Refer to the Clinical 
Coordinator's Patient Information Sheet for instructions regarding red cell reduction o f product (or 
plasma exchange of recipient). The SCCA Transfusion Services Offices may also be consulted  as a resource 
for management of specific patients.  
 
Patients with minor mismatch (i.e. donor antibodies against patient r ed cells) may experience hemolytic 
transfusion reactions. Circulating donor antibodies will be removed during processing of  the manipulated cells by 
the Cellular Therapy Laboratory so early hemolytic transfusion reactions are unlik ely. Delayed reactions ca n 
occur about 5 -14 days after marrow infusion. Delayed reactions may occur from formation of antibodies  by donor 
lymphocytes against either recipient or incompatible transfused red cells (see R ed Blood Cell Infusion 
Guidelines). The SCCA Transfusion Services Office may be consulted as a resource for management of 
specific patients.  
 
Allergic Reaction : Recipients may have allergic reactions (chills, fever, hives) to the selected cell prod uct. Please 
note, these products have been manipulated in the laboratory and may contain foreign proteins  or reagents. 
Treatment is the same (diphenhydramine, meperidine, hydrocortisone) as for react ions to platelet transfusions. For 
anaphylaxis, treat per Institutional standard practice Guidelines, “Anaphylaxis Em ergency / D rug Chart 
Reference ”. 
 
Pulmonary Micro -Embolism : Fat and particulates may result in micro -emboli. Patients may complain of chest 
pain, dyspnea, or coughing. Excessive fat is highly unlikely in the selected cell products but  can be removed by 
centrifugation  by the Cellular Therapy Laboratory after discussion with the Medical Director.  Slowing of infusion 
and administration of oxygen may alleviate mild dyspnea during infusion.  
 
Excessive Anti -coagulation : Selected cells will not be anticoagulated with hepari n and/or citrate solutions. When 
heparin is used, rapid or large volume infusions may result in transient anti -coagulation of the recipient.

APPENDIX G  
Potential Adverse Even ts Associated or Expected with Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  
 
1. Opportunistic infections, including viral and fungal infections, can results in sever e pulmonary, neurologic, 
hepatic and other organ dysfunction, and possible death.  
 
2. Gastrointestina l toxicity . Nausea and vomiting can be anticipated during the entire course of ablative therapy. 
Mucositis and diarrhea should be expected. Prednisone can cause GI bleeding.  
 
3. Cardiac toxicity . Cardiotoxicity (congestive heart failure, pericardial effusi on, EKG changes) is uncommonly 
associated with chemotherapy agents and TBI and these sequelae may prove lethal.  
 
4. Pulmonary toxicity. Diffuse interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage of unknown etiology 
occurs with some regularity after B MT. Interstitial fibrosis  occur s less frequently . Each  are well -described 
complications of intensive chemotherapy and TBI regimens and may prove lethal.  
 
5. Hepatic toxicity . Veno -occlusive disease of the liver is a common toxicity of high -dose chemoradiotherapy and 
may result in death. Tacrolimus may cause elevation of ALT/AST.  
 
6. Renal dysfunction.  Chemoradiotherapy may uncommonly cause renal dysfunction. More commonly, 
nephrotoxicity results from tacrolimus and generally responds to dose reduction. Rare ly, idiopathic or calcineurin 
inhibitor -associated hemolytic -uremic syndrome may occur and may be progressive and fatal. A syndrome of 
moderate renal insufficiency and hemolysis has been seen 5 -7 months post HSCT after intensive conditioning 
plus TBI.  
 
7. Hemorrhagic cystitis, manifested either as gross or microscopic hematuria, is a common  toxicity after high -
dose chemoradiotherapy, but usually associated with regimens that include cyclophospha mide. Hemorrhagic 
cystitis may predispose to a long -term increased risk of bladder cancer.  
 
8. Central nervous system toxicity . Radiation and chemotherapy can cause CNS toxicity, including seizures, 
depressed mental status, or leukoencephalopathy. Calcineurin inhibitors can cause seizu res or other CNS toxicity.  
 
9. Marrow aplasia . Severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, is expected to occur for a period of 7 to 42 
days following infusion of marrow. Transfusion of platelets and red blood cells is e xpected as supportive care. 
Transfusion of blood products may b e associated with acquisition of HIV or a hepatitis virus. Neutropenia may 
increase the risk for acquiring serious infection. Thrombocytopenia may increase t he risk of life -threatening 
hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic or infectious complications during the expected  period of aplasia may result in death.  
Primary and secondary graft failure occur uncommonly.  
 
10. Miscellaneous . Alopecia and sterility are expected complications of the program as a whole. Cataract 
development is possible after TBI and/or steroids. Defic iencies of growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and sex 
hormones are possible after TBI. Calcineurin inhibitors can cause transient gingi val hyperplasia, tremor, seizure, 
hypertension, headache, dysesthesia , metabolic complications  and hirsutism. Steroid thera py can also contribute 
to fluid retention, easy bruising, hypertension, aseptic necrosis of bone , metabolic complications including 
diabetes mellitus  and increased susceptibility to infection. Hospitalization during conditioning and re covery 
period is expe cted to be 5 -9 weeks in duration.

Weight / Adjusted Body Weight for Drug Dosing  
 
Drug Dosing By Body Size:  
Drug dosing will be based on either body surface area (BSA) or body weight.  
1. BSA is calculated in M2. The formula by definition adjusts for both under and over -weight individuals.  
The formula for this calculatio n is: 
  __________________________  
√actual * weight in kg x height in cm  
60 
BSA  calculations used in this protocol are based on actual  body weight for all individuals, not on adjusted weight.  
 
2. Body weight  is measured in kg. Body weight may be adjusted in  patients who are above ideal body weight.  
 
Calculating adjusted weight . Calculating adjusted weight requires determining an ideal body weight first.  
The ideal body weight (IBW) will be calculated in the following ways  
For Pediatric Patients : 
Pre-pubertal children (females < 12 years old and males < 14 years old):  
Ideal weight will be calculated by matching weight at the 50th percentile for length -for-age or  
height -for-age at the 50th percentile.  
Post pubertal adolescents (females > 12 years old and males >  14 years old):  
Ideal weight will be assessed using the body mass index (BMI) [weight in kg/height in  
meters squared)]. If the child’s normal BMI is between the 25 -75th percentile, the child may  
be considered at IBW.  
Adolescents whose BMI exceeds the 75th percentile : Ideal weight will be the 75th percentile BMI  
weight.  
Adolescents whose BMI is below the 25th percentile : Ideal weight will be the 25th percentile BMI  
weight  
Note: When deviating from these age ranges (based on early or late maturity), the dieti tian will  
document the rationale in the nutrition assessment.  
 
Weight / Adjusted Body Weight for Drug Dosing  
 
Adjusted Body Weight will be calculated as follows:  
Ideal Weight + 0.25 (actual weight – ideal weight)  
 
Weight Shifts After Initial Evaluation:  
Individuals with significant weight shifts after the initial evaluation will have th e adjusted body weight reassessed 
by the Clinical Nutrition Staff as appropriate.

APPENDIX J 
Radiotherapy Treatment Guidelines  
 
1.1 Total Body Irradiation  
 
1.1.1 Patien ts 
Every patient will receive total body irradiation as part of the preparatory regime n for stem cell transplantation.  
The treatment dose regimen will be 165 cGy BID over 4 treatment days to a total dose of 13 20 cGy.  
Lung shielding will be used as describ ed below.  
All male patients having ALL will receive a testicular boost as part of the transplant regi men.  400 cGy for one 
fraction will be delivered by an en fosse electron field.  For patients with a history of CNS leukemia a CNS 
irradiation boost may also  performed if it is clinically indicated in the opinion of the pediatric BMT physician a nd 
radiation oncologist.  
 
1.1.2 Equipment  
 
1.1.2.1 Modality:  
High -energy photons with energy ≥ 6MV photons should be utilized. Although there is no upper limit on the 
energy as long as the skin dose requirements can be met, it is recommended that 18MV or lower  be used.  
The selection of energy is determined by the dose uniformity criterion.  
 
1.1.3 Target Volume  
The total body will be treated, including the head and feet, in one field (except in certain circumstances).  Care 
should be taken to insure that the patient is entirely within the 90% isodose decrement li ne of the beam (i.e., not in 
the penumbra region of the beam).   
 
1.1.4 Target Dose  
The prescription point is defined as the point along the longitudinal axis of the patient at t he midline at the level of 
the umbilicus (see Point 5 , section 1.5.4.1). No tissue inhomogeneity correction will be made in the calculat ion of 
dose to the prescription point.  The absorbed dose along the patient’s head to toe axis (line for med by the 
intersection of the midsagittal plane and the midcoronal plane) shall be within 10%  of the prescribed dose.  The 
dose at selected anatomical points shall be calculated and these calculations are to be submitted as part of the 
quality assurance.  Measurements of patient dimensions needed for the calculation of the p rescription dose will be 
made at the time of the simulation for lung blocks.  Measurement and calculations of requi red monitor units 
necessary for each treatment will be performed in the patient treatment position for AP -PA fields: either upright 
position or the reclining, lateral decubitus position . In the event the patient is int ended to be treated in an upright 
position, but proves to o ill for treatment, dose calculation will have been pre -calculated to permit treatment in the 
lateral decubitus position).  
 
1.1.4.1 Prescription Point:  
The following reference points will be determined:  
 
1. Head (Point 1) : this reference point is defined along the longitudinal axis of the skull at the greatest mid -
separation (immediately superior to the nasal bridge).  The depth should be taken as m idway between the entrance 
and exit points of the opposed radiation beams.  
2.  Neck (Point 2) : this reference  point is defined along the patient’s longitudinal axis at the level of C3/C4 
(approximate mid -neck, but chosen for the thinnest mid -separation of the neck).  The point is taken to be midway 
between the entrance and exit point of the beam.  
3.  Upper Medias tinum (Point 3) :  this reference point is defined along the patient’s longitudinal axis at the level 
of the angle of Louis.  The reference point is midway between the entrance and the exit poi nts of the opposed 
beams.  
4. Lower Mediastinum (Point 4) :  this reference point is defined along the patient’s longitudinal axis at the level 
of the xiphisternal notch.  The reference point is midway between the entrance and e xit points of the opposed 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 53 of 57 beams  
5. Umbilicus (Point 5) : THE PRESCRIPTION POINT is defined along the patient’s longitudinal axis at the level 
of the umbilicus.  The prescription point is midway between the entrance and exit points of  the opposed beams.  
6. Knee (Point 6):   this reference point is defined along the midline in the midplane of the knee at the level of the 
patella.  
7.  Ankle (Point 7) :  this reference point is defined along the midline at the midplane of the ankle at the le vel of 
the lateral malleolus.  
8.  Shielded Lung Dose (Point 8) :  this reference point is located on the right chest w all under the lung block.  It 
is centered (both medial/lateral and cephalocaudad) under the lung block as projected on the  patient’s skin.  The 
depth should be taken as midway between the entrance and exit points of the opposed radiation beam s.  Dose 
measu rements at this location will be taken during a fraction with lung shielding in place.  
9.  Unshielded Lung Dose (Point 9) : This reference point is the same as point 8.  Dose measurements at this 
location will be taken during a fraction without lung shielding in place.  The depth shoul d be taken as midway 
between the entrance and exit points of the opposed radiation beams.  
 
1.1.4.2 Dose definition:  
The absorbed dose is specified as centigray (cGy) -to-muscle.  
 
1.1.4.3 Prescribed Dose, and Fractionation, and T iming:  
165 cGy will be delivered in one fraction.  
 
1.1.4.4 Dose Rate:  
A mid -plane dose rate of between 6 and 15 cGy per minute is required.  
 
1.1.4.5 Dose Uniformity:  
The objective is to keep the dose throughout the body, defined to extend to within 2 mm o f the skin surface, to at 
least 90% of the prescription dose. In addition, the brain dose shall not exceed 107% of the pre scription dose.  
 
For AP/PA treatments, partial transmission lung blocks will be used to limit the overall tota l lung dose. The dose 
at the midpoint of the thickest part of the body, while in the treatment position, should be de termined and if 
necessary, modifications made to the treatment to raise the dose in this region to at least  90% of the prescription 
dose.  
 
In order to satisfy the  requirement that the skin dose at a depth of 2 mm is within at least 90% of the presc ription 
dose, beam spoilers or other equally effective devices should be used. The field size shall  be such that no part of 
the patient extends into the portion of the pe numbra region where the dose is less than 90% of the central axis 
dose.  
 
1.1.5 Treatment Technique  
Patients will be treated using AP/PA fields in an upright seated or standing position in a  TBI positioning device.  
Treatment will be delivered with equally weighted parallel opposed portals, with each treatment including both 
AP and PA fields.  An acceptable alternate arrangement will include equally weighted AP -PA parallel opposed 
fields delivered to the patient in a lateral decubitus position on a treatment  couch or gurney.  
 
Young patients requiring anesthesia will be treated in an AP/PA configuration at exten ded distance.  If more than 
a single field is needed to accomplish treatment, the field junction should be at the le vel of the thighs.  
 
1.1.5.1 Dose ca lculation for the Prescription Point  
The calculation of the treatment time or the monitor units for the prescribed dose c an be carried out using standard 
techniques. However, TBI presents special problems relative to the routine treatment situ ation in that  the field 
sizes are much larger and the treatment distances much longer.  The TBI percent depth d ose (PDD) or Tissue 
Maximum Ratio (TMR) and output factors should be measured under TBI treatment conditi ons for a range of 
phantom sizes to establish the database for TBI beam -on time calculations or to validate the calculation 
methodology.  
 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 54 of 57 Typically, a calculation methodology will be adopted which uses PDD or TMR and output factor s measured 
under standard conditions but then modified to account for the large r treatment distance. For example, modified 
values for inverse square corrected percentage depth dose or tissue -air ratios and tissue -phantom ratios are 
necessary for some treatment units when the patient is positioned at a long distanc e from the photon so urce and 
near the floor or one wall of the room. Also, some deviation from an exact inverse square d ecrease with distance 
has been demonstrated for certain geometries.  
 
Measurements of dose at the center of a phantom about the size of the typical patient s hould be performed and 
compared to the calculated dose. If differences are found, additional correction fa ctors should be introduced to the 
calculation method.  
 
1.1.5.2 Critical Organ Dose Points  
The required dose calculations should be performed for the 9  points referenced above (1.5.4.1). The midline dose 
at these locations should be recorded on the TBI Summary Form.  
 
1)  The dose can be calculated based on the thickness at each location and factors appropriate to th e TBI treatment 
conditions.  
 
It is recommended that entrance and exit TLDs or diodes be placed on the patient at each requi red dose 
assessment location.  The midline dose can be calculated from these measurements making the ap propriate 
corrections to the readings and then averaging the correct ed values.  
 
In younger patients it is also recommended that TLDs or diodes be placed underneath the lung bloc ks to 
document the transmission dose and scatter dose.  
 
1.2 Lung Shielding  
Lung shielding shall be used in all patients  
 
1.2.1 Lung Block design  
Lung blocks will confirm to the following guidelines:  The lateral edges will be 1.0 – 1.5 cm from the inner 
border of the ribs; the inferior edges will be 1.0 – 1.5 cm from the dome of the apex of the diaphragm; the 
superior borders will be 1.0 – 1.5 cm below the clavicles; the medial border 2.0 – 2.5 cm from the lateral edges of 
the thoracic vertebral bodies.  No contouring of the lung shields will be done around the hilum unle ss there is a 
residual abnormal hilar adenopathy, in which case the margins aroun d the hilar mass will be 1.0 – 1.5 cm.  
 
1.2.2 Timing  
Lung blocks will be employed for sequential treatments starting with the first tre atment.  Should patient infirmity 
preclude upright positioning during a fraction when lung shielding is prescribed, that patient may be treated in the 
lateral decubitus position without lung shielding, and lung shielding can be deferred unti l the next treatment 
fraction. Alternatively, lung blocks may be used in the lateral decubitus position for  patients being treated 
exclu sively in that position.  
 
For children receiving TBI under anesthesia, treatments will be performed in a modi fied supine and prone 
position, with the appropriate lung shielding as specified in the protocol.  
 
1.2.2.1 Fractionation Schema  
For a fractionation  scheme of 165 cGy bid x 4 days; lung shielding will be used for the first 4 fractions.  This  
schema is calculated to deliver a nominal dose of approximately 825 cGy to both lungs, witho ut correction for 
lung homogeneity (660 cGy x 0.25 = 165 cGy + 660 cGy  = 825 cGy).  
 
1.2.3 Electron boost  
No compensatory electron boost of that portion of the chest wall shielded by the lung blocks  is required.  
 
The lung dose will be reported on the TBI Summary form.  
 
Protocol 2660.00  
Page 55 of 57 1.3 Testes Boost  
 
1.3.1 Patients  
All patients with biopsy -proven testicular leukemia at relapse will receive a testicular radiation boost (400 cGy in 
1 fraction) prior to TBI.  It is recognized that there will some patients who previo usly received radiotherapy prior 
to relapse.  These patients will be treated si milarly.  
 
1.3.2 Equipment  
1.3.2.1 Modality  
Electron beams. The selection of energy is determined by the dose uniformity crite rion, to cover the testes with no 
less than the 80% isodose curve.  
 
1.3.3 Target Volume  
The target volume consists of the testes in  the scrotal sac. (Note: Cremasteric reflex may move testes high up in 
the inguinal canal.)  
 
1.3.4 Target Dose  
400 cGy  
 
1.3.4.1 Prescription Point  
The prescription point is to Dmax  
 
1.3.4.2 Dose definition  
The absorbed dose is specified as centigray (cGy) -to-muscle.  
 
1.3.4.3 Prescribed Dose and Fractionation  
The total dose to the prescription point shall be 400 cGy in 1 fraction.  
 
1.3.4.4 Timing  
Testicular irradiation should start within 3 treatment days of the beginning of the  TBI preparative regimen if th ey 
have not already received testicular irradiation as part of their induction therapy . 
 
1.3.4.5 Dose Uniformity:  
The variations of dose within the planning target volume shall be within +20%, -20% of the dose to the 
prescription point. The uniformity requ irement can in general be met with an electron beam of appropriate energy 
provided bolus is used, which is the simplest technique.  
 
1.3.5 Treatment Technique  
 
1.3.5.1 Patient Position  
The patient shall be treated in the supine position.  
 
1.3.5.2 Field -shaping  
Field shaping can be done with electron cutout blocks of the appropriate thickness.  
 
 
 
1.3.6 Normal Tissue Sparing  
 
1.3.6.1 Perineum:  
The testes shall be supported posteriorly and, if possible, extended caudally in ord er to minimize perineal 
irradiati on. The field shall not be angled towards the perineum.  
 
1.3.6.2 Penis:  
The penis shall be excluded from the field by fixing it to the skin over the symphysis pubis.

1.5 Definitions of Deviation in Protocol Performance  
Prescription Dose  
Minor Deviation:  
The dose to the prescription point differs from that in the protocol by between 6% and 10%.  
Major Deviation:  
The dose to the prescription point differs from that in the protocol by more than 10%.  
 
Dose Uniformity  
Minor Deviation:  
The dose to any of the reference points in Section 16.5.5.1 differs from the protocol dose by mor e 
than 10% but less than 20%.  
Major Deviation:  
The dose to any of the reference points in Section 16.5.5.1 differs from the protocol dose by mor e 
than 20%.

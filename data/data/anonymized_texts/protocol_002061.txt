Objective:  Brain damage following traumatic injury  (TBI)  results from both direct (eg, 
mechanical injury to the brain and vasculature) and indirect mechanisms (eg, seconda ry 
mechanisms such as inflammation). While CT and MRI can help visualize the result of 
inflammatory processes in the brain —for in stance, the development of cerebral edema —neither 
method can be used to document active inflammation itself. The translocator protein (TSPO), 
which is highly expressed in microglia and reactive astrocytes, has been used as a biomarker in 
positron emission tomography (PET) to identify active inflammatory processes. Recently, our 
laboratory developed [11C]PBR28, a new PET ligand that images TSPO with high levels of 
specific binding. We have successfully used [11C]PBR28 to investigate a number of brain 
disorde rs such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and HIV infection with minor cognitive motor 
disorder , and are detecting neuroinflammation. The current protocol aims to explore whether 
[11C]PBR28 PET imaging can show changes in subjects with TBI who have shown MR I 
abnormalities  in the acute phase and also in those who are in the chronic phase of TBI . 
Study population : The following three groups will be studied:  
1) TBI subjects who had brain injury within ~3 months and have exhibited MRI 
abnormalities consistent with TBI and  who are enrolled  in—"Evaluation, Pathogenesis, 
and Outcome of Subjects with or Suspected Traumatic Brain Injury" (10 -N-N122, PI 
Latour) , "Evaluation and Diagnosis of Potential Research Subjects with Traumatic Brain 
Injury (TBI),” (11 -N-0084, PI: La wrence Latour) , or other CNRM protocols . N = 20  
2) TBI subjects who had brain injury more than ~ 5 month ago, are enrolled in 11 -N-0084  or 
other CNRM  protocols , and meet criteria of TBI established by CNRM . N = 20  
3)  Healthy age -matched volunteers.  N = 20.  
Design:  This is an exploratory study to determine whether [11C]PBR28 can detect  the increased 
TSPO associated with neuroinflammation by scanning subjects who have shown MRI 
abnormalities  in the acute phase . We also investigate whether [11C]PBR28 detect s changes in the 
chronic phase as recently reported using an old ligand, [11C]PK 11195. Two groups of TBI 
subjects will be studied depending on their availability relative to the time of injury. To 
investigate changes in TSPO in the areas of MRI abnormalities in the acute phase, one group of 
TBI subjects (n = 20) will be studied who have shown TBI - related MRI abnormalities. These 
participants  will have up to four [11C]PBR28 PET scans; one to two PET scans within 
approximately 10 days of head injury, a third PE T scan approximately three months  after injury , 
and a fourth scan approximately one year after the scan at ~ three months . To study changes in 
TSPO in the chronic phase, a nother group of TBI subjects will be enrolled who had brain injury 
more than ~ 5 months  but within 5 years ago and meet  the criteria of TBI  by CNRM . This 
separate group is included because some TBI subjects are being recruited by CNRM only 
sometime after the injury. The participants at the chronic phase will have one PET and one MRI 
scan. In addition to MRI data, for all TBI subjects, clinical information obtained in 10 -N-N122 
(only the acute phase) and 11-N-0084 (both acute and chronic phase) will be used to evaluate the 
utility of the PET data in order to better understand the pathology of TBI. If the TBI subject is 
recruited from another protocol under CNRM, the clinical information obtained under the 
CNRM protocol will be used for 12 -M-0063 as long as both the CNRM protocol and the TBI 
subject allow.  
Outcome Measures: In this exploratory s tudy to investigate the ability of [11C]PBR28 PET to 
detect increases in TSPO, the primary goal will be to measure the magnitude and variance of any

may be used to design future studies with a larger sample size.  
 
4. Introduction/ Scientific Rationale  
Traumatic brain injury  
 Each year, at least 1.4 million people sustain TBI, with over 1.1 million treated and 
released from the emergency department (Langlois  et al. , 2006 ). Annually, a pproximately 
125,000 patients with TBI —typically those whose injuries are more severe —experience 
permanent disability as a result of damage to the brain  (Selassie  et al. , 2008 ; Zaloshnja  et al. , 
2008 ). In contrast , mild TBI, which account s for at least 75% of all TBI  cases , results in more 
subtle functional and cognitive deficits that often go undetected in the acute setting. Over time, 
these patients can experience drastic changes in their quality of life  (Pierce & Hanks, 2006 ), find 
it difficult to resume  daily activities , and may be unable to return to work for weeks or months  
(Wagner  et al. , 2002 ). 
The vast majority of TBI research and clinical care uses a three level system to classify 
the severity of the injury (mild, moderate, severe); this system has not changed in decades. It is 
based on subjective reports of symptom s, duration of loss of consciousness , post -traumatic 
amnesia , and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) . While the current taxonomy is effective for the 
acute assessment of injury and is a good predictor of mortality, it tells us little about long term 
prognosis and other key factors (e.g., the likelihood of regaining functional independence, 
resuming work, or participating in the community) (Conzen  et al. , 1992 ) (Green  et al. , 2008 ). In 
addition, the taxonomy does not take advantage of newer methodologies that might aid in 
classification, including imaging, serum biomarkers, and neuropsychological testing. Including 
these variables might add significant predictive power to any outcome model.  
 This study was initially sponsored by the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative 
Medicine (CNRM) and received CNRM funds directly for the conduct of the study. CNRM 
sponsorship fo r the study has ended. The study will, however, continue in collaboration with 
CNRM. Under this collaboration, the study will continue to use CNRM Core Resources 
including the Acute, Recruitment, Phenotyping, and Imaging Cores which encompass CNRM -
supporte d scanners and image analysis resources. In addition, data without PII will continue to 
be shared with CNRM and stored in the CNRM Data Repository.  
 
Traumatic brain injury  and inflammation  
 Brain damage following traumatic injury results from the primary m echanical injury 
followed by secondary inflammatory tissue reactions. The initiation and progression  of 
inflammation  in TBI are complex and multifactorial  issues encompassing pro - and anti -
inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,  adhesion molecules, complement factors, reactive  oxygen 
and nitrogen species, and other undefined factors. While the extant evidence suggests  that 
inflammation can have both beneficial and  detrimental effects in TBI, the mechanisms 
underlying  this dichotomy are mostly unknown. Because a nimal studies have shown that 
modifying inflammatory response is neuroprotective  (Cernak  et al. , 2001 ) (Lloyd  et al. , 2008 ), 
monitoring  inflammation may provide critical information for successfully treating patients with 
TBI.

page 6 of 48 MRI in acute phase of traumatic brain injury  
Preliminary MRI data emerging from the first 100 subject enrolled under protocol 10 -N-
N122 indicate trauma -related pathology evolve over the first week.  Within the first 48 hours of 
injury, evidence of both cytotoxic and vasogenic edema appear on diffusio n weighted imaging 
(DWI) and T2 -FLAIR.  Extravascular blood or thrombosis is seen on susceptibility weighted 
imaging.  On post -contrast FLAIR, enhancement of the meninges and subdural space occur in 
close to half of the subjects imaged.  The dynamic evolut ion of many of the markers over the 
first week suggests first, that the pathology is temporally correlated with the injury and is not 
incidental, and second, that the pathology may be part of an active inflammatory response.  By 
three months, many of the m arkers are no longer visible; either a plateau has been reached, 
pathology has reversed or recovered, or in some cases, permanent damage to the parenchyma, as 
evidenced by necrosis and atrophy on high resolution T1 imaging, has occurred.  Data between 
one week, and three months are lacking.  It is also not clear that injury is limited to the focal 
lesions that are event on MRI.  While the data points toward a time -course of inflammation that 
transpires in the period of a few weeks, the optimal time for dete cting the injury by specifically 
imaging a marker of inflammation using PET is not known.  
 
Traumatic brain injury  and translocator protein (TSPO)  
 Translocator protein (TSPO; formerly known as peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) is an 
ion-channel type rece ptor existing in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Because TSPO is 
highly expressed in activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, TSPO has been used as a 
biomarker in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. In addition to being a biomarker of 
neuroin flammation in general, TSPO may be strongly linked to biological reactions and 
pathological changes in TBI because TSPO is expressed in mitochondria; mitochondria, in turn, 
provide most of the high energy consumption caused by tissue reactions to brain tra uma. In 
addition, Ro5 -4864, a ligand binding to TSPO, showed neuroprotective effects in a rat model of 
TBI (Soustiel  et al. , 2008 ), and a PET study of a rat model of TBI showed increased TSPO (Yu 
et al. , 2010 ). 
 
PET imaging of Translocator protein  
 PET imaging of TSPO is the most widely used method to image neuroinflammation in 
vivo. Our laboratory  developed two promising radioligands —[11C]PBR28 and [18F]PBR06 —that 
selectively bind to  TSPO and that have a much greater specific signal than the prototypical agent, 
[11C]PK 11195.  After confirming high levels of specific binding in monkey (Imaizumi  et al. , 
2007a ; Imaizumi  et al. , 2008 ), demonstrating successful detection of increased TSPO in a rat 
model of cerebral infarction (Imaizumi  et al. , 2007b ), and establishing a method of quantification 
in healthy humans (Fujita  et al. , 2008 ), we initiated the following studies in a number of brain 
diseases, and are obtaining promising resu lts. 
1) Stroke.  We identified an incidental lacunar stroke in an otherwise healthy individual, 
showing that [11C]PBR28 is sensitive enough to detect even small focal changes (Kreisl  et al. , 
2009 ). 
2) Epilepsy . We used [11C]PBR28 to study 16 subjects with u nilateral temporal lobe 
epilepsy and seven healthy subjects using a high -resolution research tomograph (Hirvonen, 
submitted). Compared to healthy controls, epileptic subjects had a 10% higher brain uptake in 
the entire hippocampus ipsilateral to the seizur e focus.  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 7 of 48 3) HIV infection.  This study, conducted in collaboration with Justin McArthur (Johns 
Hopkins) was designed to measure brain inflammation in vivo in healthy HIV -seronegative 
controls, cognitively normal HIV -seropositive subjects, and HIV -seropositi ve subjects with 
minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD). Our preliminary results found that seronegative 
controls (N=8) had significantly greater [11C]PBR28 uptake than seropositive controls (N=7), 
and that MCMD subjects (N=7) showed a trend towards greater uptake than seropositive 
controls.  
4) Multiple sclerosis.  In 11 subjects with multiple sclerosis, a focal increase in 
[11C]PBR28 binding was obser ved in the areas of gadolinium -enhanced lesions (Figure below). 
In addition, in a small number of cases, increased [11C]PBR28 binding preceded the appearance 
of gadolinium -enhancement, indicating early glial activation in multiple sclerosis lesions (Oh et 
al.). 
 
Figure. Increase of [11C]PBR28 binding  in multiple scler osis 
 
As described above, the preliminary results of protocol 10 -N-N122 suggest the 
involvement of neuroinflammation in TBI. In addition, recent studies using [11C]PK 11195 
showed increase in TSPO in patients 0.5 – 17 years after injury (Folkersma  et al. , 2011 ; 
Ramlackhansingh  et al. , 2011 ) but we showed that [11C]PK 11195 has low levels of specific 
binding (Kreisl  et al. , 2010 ) and their quantification may have errors because of not obtaining 
arterial blood data. Therefore, in the current protocol, we intend to detect neuroinflammation 
using [11C]PBR28 , which selectively binds to a marker of neuroinflammation, TSPO  with high 
specific binding .  
 
High -, Low -, (Non -), and Mixed -Affinity Binders  
 Initial studies found that some individuals —hereafter referred to as non -binders — 
showed no detectable binding in [11C]PBR28 PET scans (Kreisl  et al. , 2010 ). Subsequently, a 
postmortem study reported the presence of binding sites with two different affinity levels to 
PBR28 and some other PET ligands; thus, there appear to be three distinct groups based on 
affinity: high -, mixed -, and low -affinity binders (also known as non -binders) (Owen  et al. , 2010 ) 
(Owen  et al. , 2011 ). Low -affinity binders have TSPO with only low affinity binding  sites. 
Mixed -affinity binders have TSPO with both high - and low -affinity binding sites. High -affinity 
binders have TSPO with only high -affinity binding sites. [11C]PBR28 PET data of individual 
subjects demonstrated that low -affinity binders are clearly id entified, but that it is difficult to 
differentiate high- and mixed -affinity binders. Our laboratory has conducted more [11C]PBR28 

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 8 of 48 scans than any other group in the world. When all subjects in our database were combined, 
13/149 (8.7%) subjects were classif ied as low -affinity binders; however, no discerning features 
have been found to identify low -affinity binders among healthy volunteers or patients. We are 
presently unable to state whether individual neuropsychiatric disorders are prone to different 
distri butions of low -affinity binders, because the number of subjects within each disease 
category is too small . 
 In the current protocol, TBI subjects in acute/subacute phase (group 1 in section 6.b. 
Inclusion criteria) will have one or two [11C]PBR28 scans wit hin approximately 10 days of 
injury. All TBI subjects including those who participate within ~10 days of brain injury will have 
a blood sampling to determine the affinity status to PBR28. The first PET scan will be performed 
without having results  on the a ffinity status determined by  in vitro  binding or genetic assay. 
Based on our previous observations, we expect that approximately ~10% will be low -affinity 
binders, who will thus be excluded from the data analysis. If the first PET scan indicates that the 
TBI subject is a low -affinity binder, no further scan will be performed. The first PET scan within 
~10 days of brain injury will be performed without knowing the affinity status of TSPO  because 
to obtain scientifically valuable data, the [11C]PBR28 scans ne ed to be performed within a timely 
manner once MRI abnormalities have been established in these TBI subjects. Furthermore, as 
stated above, the probability of encountering low -affinity binders is only ~10%. By waiting for 
the results  on the affinity status  before doing the first [11C]PBR28 brain scan, we will miss a 
chance to do a PET scan in a timely fashion to obtain scientifically valuable data . If the results of 
the first PET scan indicate that the subject is a low -affinity binder, no more PET scans wil l be 
performed on that subject.  
 TBI subjects recruited from protocol 11-N-0084 or other CNRM protocols may 
participate in this PET imaging protocol only at the time point of approximately three months  or 
later after the head injury. For these subjects, screening in vitro  binding assay using leukocytes 
will be performed because there is no strong time constraint to conduct the scan within 
approximately 10 days, and because additional visits for blood drawing woul d not be a 
significant extra burden to the subjects. Low -affinity binders will not undergo a [11C]PBR28 
brain scan.  
For all healthy subjects, screening binding assays to detect low -affinity binders will be 
performed because these subjects do not need to ha ve a brain PET scan within a certain time 
frame. Low -affinity binders will not undergo a [11C]PBR28 brain scan.  
For all subjects including TBI subjects who have PET scans within ~10 days and whose 
results on the affinity status will be available after the PET scans within ~10 days, the results of 
the affinity status will be used for post hoc analysis of the results . Such analyses are useful 
because as stated above, PET data itself does not differentiate high - and low -affinity binders. 
Only low affinity bind ers are clearly identified by PET.  
 
5. Study objectives or hypotheses  
 This exploratory study aims to investigate the utility of PET TSPO imaging in TBI. 
Based on the literature and the preliminary results of protocol 10 -N-N122 and literature reviewed 
above, we hypothesize that PET [11C]PBR28 imaging in TBI patients will show increased TSPO 
in the areas of brain injury due to inflammatory reactions. Pilot data obtained via the current 
study are needed to estimate the prevalence of PET positive imaging i n subjects with TBI, in 
order to help design future hypothesis -driven studies with a larger sample size based on proper 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 9 of 48 power calculations. Relationship between PBR28 binding and neurocognitive function will also 
be studied to obtain pilot data to design f uture studies. We will also attempt to compare the time 
course of the changes in PET and MRI  and changes in TSPO in the chronic phase of TBI .

surgical staples, shunts,  cerebral aneurysms clips, shrapnel or other  metal imbedded in a 
subject’s body (such as  from war wounds or accidents or previous work in metal fields or 
machines that may have left any metallic fragm ents in or near the subject ’s eyes ). 
5. Conditions  precluding entry into th e scanners (e.g. morbid obesity, claustrophobia, etc.).  
6. In female subjects, pregnancy or breastfeeding.  
7. Exposure to research related radiation in the past year that,  when combined with this 
study , would place subjects above the allowable limits.  
 
 Healthy subjects are not eligible for participation in this research study if any of the 
following conditions exist:

Statistical analysis. a. Analysis of data / study outcomes).  Results of urine drug screen and 
history of using drugs of abuse may also help interpretation of the PET results. In addition, 
inclusion of TBI subjects who show positive for urine drug screen m ay improve recruitment of

 Eligibility checklist is attached as Appendix 1. 
7. Study Design and Methods  
a. Study phases  
i. Study overview  
To detect changes in TSPO, a marker of neuroinflammation, in both acute/subacute and 
chronic phases, the following three groups will be studied. All TBI subjects will be recruited 
from the participants in the CNRM Recruitment Core protocol 11 -N-0084 (groups 1 and 2) , 
protocol 10 -N-N122 (group 1) , and other CNRM p rotocols (groups 1 and 2) that allow referrals 
to other studies . 
 
Group 1  (n = 20) : TBI in acute/subacute phase who have shown TBI -related MRI abnormalities 
under 10 -N-N122 , CNRM Image Processing Core , or other CNRM protocols that allow referrals 
to other studies  will have up to four [11C]PBR28 PET scans to compare changes in PET and MRI 
scans.  
 
Group 2 (n = 20): TBI in chronic phage will have one [11C]PBR28 PET and one MRI scan 
between ~5 months  and 5 years after injury. The participants need to meet at least one item of 
Probable or Definite TBI in the criteria established by CNRM (Appendix 6, section 24 -6). The 
criteria have been established by CNRM based on guidance by researchers specialized i n TBI.  
 
Group 3 (n = 20): Healthy controls. Healthy controls will be studied to compare  [11C]PBR28 
binding in areas with normal MRI scans in TBI subjects and the binding  in age -matched healthy 
controls.  
 
Medications are allowed for all PET scans of TBI sub jects because currently no FDA -approved 
medication binds to TSPO as a therapeutic target and direct interactions between [11C]PBR28 
and medications are not expected. Treatment history will be obtained from CNRM Recruitment 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 12 of 48 Core (groups 1 and 2) or protocol  10-N-N122 (group 1). If the TBI subject is referred from 
another CNRM protocol, treatment history will be obtained from the CNRM protocol as long as 
the protocol allows. For exploratory analysis, results of standardized and validated 
neuropsychological te sts will be used to correlate PET findings with subjects’ 
neuropsychological function.  
ii. Recruitment  
TBI subject s: 
TBI subjects participating in protocol 10 -N-N122 will be recruited from Suburban 
Hospital (Bethesda, Maryland). TBI subjects will also be r ecruited from subjects enrolled in 
CNRM Recruitment Core protocol 11 -N-0084. TBI subjects will also be recruited from other 
CNRM protocols as long as those protocols allow referrals. For the participants of 10 -N-N122, 
the PI ( Lawrence L. Latour, PhD ) or an  AI of that protocol will do pre screening to determine the 
eligibility of TBI subjects (Appendix 1). With participant ’s written consent, all research and 
medical information obtained in protocol 10 -N-N122 will be shared . A 10 -N-N122 investigator 
will prov ide the eligible TBI subject with a sheet briefly explaining the current protocol 
(Advertisements: Appendix 2  or 7), and ask if a study investigator of the current protocol can 
contact the subject. If the TBI subject agrees to be contacted, a study investi gator of the current 
protocol will contact the subject and obtain consent based on the procedures described in Section 
15. TBI subjects can also contact our PET study team if they wish to initiate study participation.  
For participants of CNRM Recruitment C ore protocol 11-N-0084, the PI or an AI of the 
present PET protocol will determine eligibility. 11 -N-0084 has been approved to share subjects’ 
information with this PET protocol. If the participants are eligible to this PET protocol, a 
member of 11 -N-0084 research team will initially  contact the subject. Appendix 5 will be handed 
over to the TBI subjects.  If the TBI subject agrees to be contacted, a study investigator of 12 -M-
0063  will contact the subject and obtain consent based on the procedures described  in Section 15. 
TBI subjects can also contact our PET study team if they wish to initiate study participation.  
The participants of other CNRM protocols that allow sharing information to determine 
the eligibility  are treated in the same way as the participants of CNRM Recruitment Core 
protocol 11 -N-0084  described in the previous paragraph.  the PI or an AI of protocol 12-M-0063 
will determine the eligibility  based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of 12 -M-0063. If the 
participants are eligible for 12-M-0063 , a member of the research team of the original CNRM 
protocol will initially contact the subject. Appendix 5 will be handed over to the TBI subjects.  If 
the TBI subject agrees to be contacted, a study invest igator of 12 -M-0063  will contact the subject 
and obtain consent based on the procedures described in Section 15. TBI subjects can also 
contact our PET study team if they wish to initiate study participation.  
 
 Healthy subjects:  
 Healthy volunteers meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria (above) will be recruited 
from the community and at the NIH through IRB approved advertisements in newspaper s and 
newsletter s, private physicians, and social service agencies . Healthy volunteers may be recruited 
from other NIMH Molecular Imaging Branch protocols.  
iii. Screening methods  
 For TBI subjects participating in protocol 10 -N-N122, the PI ( Lawrence L. Latour, PhD ) 
or an AI of that protocol will do pre screening to determine eligibility to participate in the current 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 13 of 48 protocol. 10 -N-N122 has been amended to allow the PI or an AI of that protocol to determine 
whether their participants are eligible to this PET protocol. The participants  will then be 
scheduled  for study procedures in a manner that will not interfere with the subject’s medical 
care.  For participants of 11 -N-0084  or other CNRM protocols , the PI or an AI of this PET 
protocol will determine eligibility based on shared information. The initial contact to the eligible 
subjects will be done by a member of the res earch team of the original protocol such as 11-N-
0084  and the CNRM protocols . 
 For both TBI subjects and healthy subjects, screening assessments will include  a 
diagnostic interview, neurological assessment, physical examination , lab work  (Complete Blood 
Count (CBC), Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP),  and urine analysis, urine toxicology screen ). 
Screening will be done in the outpatient clinic/Day Hospital and will include a nursing 
assessment. For subjects with TBI, written consent will be obtained to use as m uch of this 
information as possible from protocol 10 -N-N122  or from the CNRM. Some healthy subjects 
will be evaluated under the general  screening protocol 01 -M-0254. Screening procedures will not 
be repeated for healthy subjects if performed under the scre ening protocol within 12 months for 
diagnostic interview, neurological assessment , and physical examination , or six months for bloo d 
and urine tests. Otherwise , tests will be conducted as part of this study. Subjects will be screened 
for MRI safety using t he screening questionnaire used by the Radiology and Imaging Sciences 
Program of the Clinical Center (Appendix 3).  
 
iv. Study design  
Group 1 (TBI in acute/subacute phase): This group will have  [11C]PBR28 PET scans at up to 
four time points. We will attempt to perform two of these scans within approximately 10 days of 
head injury as long as they are willing to do two and the scheduling allows. Two PET scans will 
be attempted on all  TBI subjects, both occur ring within ~10 days of injury. While e very effort 
will be made to obtain both scans, completion of the imaging assessment may not be possible 
due to lim ited availability of the scanner , off-hours staf fing, and other key resources. The target 
time for the first PET scan  will be 1 -5 days followi ng head inju ry.  The target time for the second 
PET scan  will be 6 -10 day s. The minimal interval between two scans is 2 days, and the maximal 
interval is 7 days.  If the TBI subjects are not willing to have two [11C]PBR28 scans or schedule 
does not allow, o ne PET scan will be performed. In addition, one PET scan will be conducted at 
approximately 90 days after injury ( 90 +/- 50 days)  and the last PET scan will be conducted 
approximately one year (but not within one year) after the previous scan and within 5 years of 
injury . MRI scans at each time point will be performed under the current protocol or 10-N-N122. 
Clinical  information will be obtained through protocol 10 -N-N122  or CNRM . The end point of 
study enrollment is 5 years from brain injury.  
 If the first  PET scan performed within approximately 10 days of head injury indicates 
that the TBI subject is a low -affinity binder for PBR28, the study participation will be terminated 
and no further scan and other study procedure will be performed under this protoco l. 
 
Group 2 (TBI in chronic phase):  This group will have  one [11C]PBR28 PET and one MRI scans.  
We will attempt to schedule the scans soon after receiving referrals from CNRM to avoid drop 
outs. Therefore, the timing of the scans in group 2 is determined by  the timing of the referrals 
from CNRM.  The end point of study enrollment is 5 years from brain injury.  Clinical  
information will be obtained through CNRM.  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 14 of 48  
Group 3 ( Healthy subjects ): This group  will have a screening visit, one [11C]PBR28 PET scan, 
and on e MRI scan. If high resolution structural MRI was done within one year, an MRI scan may 
not be obtained under the current protocol.  For healthy volunteers who have undergone 
[11C]PBR28 PET scanning under another NIMH Molecular Imaging Branch protocol, we w ill 
use the results from that scan for the purposes of this p rotocol. Therefore, these healthy 
volunteers will not undergo a PET scan for the this study  
v. Study procedures  
 All procedures under the current protocol will be conducted for research, not clin ical, 
purposes.  
 
Existing data collected on TBI subjects:  
 Data collected on TBI subjects under protocol 10 -N-N122 or via the CNRM will be 
shared with this protocol. During the consent process for 10-N-N122  or for the CNRM 
Recruitment Core protocol 11 -N-0084, subjects will be informed that if they choose to 
participate, identifiable data and Protected Health Information  (PHI) will be shared with the 
current PET protocol . For other CNRM protocols, the participants will be asked if they allow 
sharing identif iable data and PHI with other protocols such as 12 -M-0063. The TBI subjects will 
be referred to 12 -M-0063 only if they allow sharing the data and PHI.  
 
[11C]PBR28 PET scan : 
 The NIH Clinical Center PET Dept.  Radiochemistry Laboratory will synthesize and 
perform quality control for [11C]PBR28 . [11C]PBR28 , which is for research use only , will be 
used under IND  #127,685 (sponsor:  NIH Clinical Center ). In women, a pregnancy test will be 
conducted not more than 24  hours before the PET scan and must be negative.  Participants will be 
asked not to take alcohol drink or a drug of abuse within 24 hours of the PET scan.  
 One antecubital venous and one radial arterial catheter will be placed. The venous 
catheter is for ra dioligand injection and the arterial catheter is for blood sampling. An 
anesthesiologist or credentialed staff in the Vascular Access Department  will place the arterial 
catheter in the subject’s wrist after numbing the area with a local anesthetic to minim ize 
discomfort.  
 The subject will then undergo scanning in a PET, PET/CT , or PET/MRI camera located 
at the Clinical Center  of NIH . The s ubject will be placed on the scanner bed with his/her head 
held firmly in place with a thermoplastic mask fixed to the bed. An initial transmission scan for 
PET, or a pre -emission CT for PET/CT camera will provide a measured attenuation correction. 
The PET/MRI camera does not require a transmission scan using radioactivity because 
attenuation is measured by an MRI scan. The radioligand (~10 - 20 mCi of [11C]PBR28 ) will be 
injected intravenously. The maximum allowed mass of the radiotracer will be 10 μg per 
injection. The scan  will last approximately 2 - 2.5 hours with an additional ~ 2 - 2.5 hours for 
preparations such as c atheter insertion.  
 To measure input function of the radioligand, blood samples will be obtained manually  
from the arterial line. The total blood sampling volume during the scan will be  no more than  100 
mL. 
 Pulse , blood pressure, and respiratory rate will  be recorded within 3 h before  tracer 
injection, and again at about 15, 30, 90, and 120 min after tracer injection. Before discharge, the 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 15 of 48 arterial and venous catheters will be removed and catheter sites will be assessed for any evidence 
of vascular changes  or trauma prior to releasing the subject from the NIH.  Participants will be 
monitored during the PET procedure for the development of excessive anxiety  and any adverse 
effect . 
 If the PET scan is cancelled or incomplete due to synthesis failure of [11C]PB R28 or to 
camera problems and the subject did not receive any radioactive material, the scan will be 
repeated on the same or on another day. The transmission scan may be repeated as well.  
 
MRI  scan: 
 TBI subjects will have MRI scans either under protocol 1 0-N-N122 or the current 
protocol. Healthy subjects will have a brain MRI scan under the current protocol. If healthy 
subjects had a high resolution structural MRI scan within one year, an MRI scan may not be 
obtained under the current protocol. Under the c urrent protocol, MRI scans will be performed at 
the Clinical Center of the NIH. Subjects will be screened for MRI safety using the screening 
questionnaire used by the Radiology and Imaging Sciences Program of the Clinical Center 
(Appendix 3). Subjects will  be informed  that while in the scanner they will hear loud knocking 
noises, and they will be fitted with  earplugs or earmuffs to muffle the sound. Subjects will be 
able to communicate with the  MRI staff at all times during the MRI scan, and they may ask to  be 
moved out of the  machine at any time.  
 TBI s ubjects who qualify to receive gadolinium contrast will receive the  contrast agent 
through an IV catheter. A needle will be used to guide the catheter into  one of the subject’s arms. 
The needle will be remove d, leaving only the catheter in the  vein. The catheter will be taped to 
the skin to hold it in place.  Healthy subjects will not receive gadolinium contrast . For TBI 
subjects GFR will be estimated using standard methods from creatinine clearance rate obtain ed 
as part of  the clinical laboratory work -up Subjects with a GFR < 60  mL/min will be excluded 
from receiving gadolinium contrast  agent and will receive an MRI without contrast only.  
 It is not known if MRI is completely safe for a developing fetus. Therefore, all women of  
childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed no more than 24 hours before  each 
MRI scan.  
 One MRI session will last approximately one hour . MRI scan sequences for TBI subjects  
may consist of commercially available se quences  including but not limited to: diffusion weighted 
imaging (DWI) or diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI), dynamic susceptibility contrast and or arterial 
spin labeling perfusion  weighted imaging (PWI), gradient recalled echo (GRE) and/or T2* 
susceptibility  weighted imaging (SWI), T2 weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T2 -
FLAIR),  high resolution anatomical image (3DT1 -SPGR), post -contrast FLAIR and T1.  MRI 
scan sequences for healthy subjects include a high resolution anatomical sequence to coregist er 
to PET images and may also include T2 -weighted, and FLAIR images. If the image quality of a 
given sequence is inadequate (eg, due to subject motion) these may be repeated at the discretion 
of the MRI technologist or radiologist.  
 
Neuropsychology test s and TBI assessment batter ies: 
 TBI subjects will take the following neuropsychological tests . The addition of 
neuropsychological testing to the protocol will provide data from standardized measures of 
cognitive functioning to compare with imaging data regar ding inflammation.  The 
Neuropsychological data not only allows for a functional measure of t he effects of 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 16 of 48 neuro inflammation, but also allows for an object measure of the subjects level of cognitive 
impairment.  
The test listed below will be administered b y a trained psychometrist under the 
supervision of a neuropsychologist.  Testing is conducted face to face in a standard setting using 
standardized administration procedures.  Total testing time for visits one (< ~ 10 days) , three (~ 3 
months) , and a later  time point between ~5 months  and 5 years is approximately 80 minutes and 
approximately 50 minutes on visit two (second visit < ~ 10 days).  Some of the tests have 
multiple forms which allow for administration of tests in close temporal proximity.  To avoi d 
practice effects tests without alternate forms will only be administered at time point one and 
three.  
These are standardized neuropsychological tests which are well validated for use with this 
population.  There are no known physical risks to the use of these tests.  Subjects may experience 
frustration and/or fatigue from participation in neuropsychological testing.  Subjects are 
monitored throughout testing and should fatigue or frustration interfere with testing, rest time 
will be give or the testing wi ll be discontinued to avoid excessive distress to the subject.  
• Delis -Kaplan Executive Function System (D -KEFS) Sorting Test (Free Sort 
Condition only) : An executive functioning test of concept -formation, reasoning skills, 
and problem -solving abilities. The  free sort conditions the examinee is asked to sort six 
mixed -up cards into two groups, three cards per group, according to as many different 
categorization rules or concepts as possible, and to describe the concepts used to generate 
each sort.  There are two equivalent forms of the test which will be administered in 
alternating order.  The Free Sort Condition of the D -KEFS Sorting Test takes 
approximately 5 -10 minutes to administer.  
• Delis -Kaplan Executive Function System (D -KEFS) Verbal Fluency Test :  A 
language and executive functioning test from within D -KEFS with three conditions 
which evaluate spontaneous production of words beginning with a given letter, of a given 
class within a limited amount of time, and switching between words from different  
categories. There are two equivalent forms of the test which will be administered in 
alternating order.  The D -KEFS Verbal Fluency Test takes approximately 10 minutes to 
complete.   
• Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT -R): A brief assessment of verbal learn ing and 
memory (recognition and recall) for individuals 16 years and older. It is easy to 
administer and score and is well -tolerated even by significantly impaired individuals. Its 
use has been validated with brain -disordered populations (e.g., Alzheimer's  disease, 
Huntington's disease, amnestic disorders). Six distinct forms of the HVLT -R are available 
and we will be using four (forms 1, 2, 4, and 6) different forms, as these four are the most 
reliable; using different forms eliminates practice effects on repeated administrations. 
Each form consists of a list of 12 nouns (targets) with four words drawn from each of 
three semantic categories. The semantic categories differ across the six forms, but the 
forms are very similar in their psychometric properties.  The HVLT -R tasks include three 
learning trials, a delayed recall trial (20 -25 minute delay), and a yes/no delayed 
recognition trial. This recognition trial consists of a randomized list that includes the 12 
target words and 12 non -target words, six of whi ch are drawn from the same semantic 
categories as the targets. Raw scores are derived for Total Recall, Delayed Recall, 
Retention (% retained), and a Recognition Discrimination Index. The HVLT -R takes 
approximately 15 minutes to administer.  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 17 of 48 • Trail Making Te st (TMT) Parts A and B :  A test of visual attention and task switching 
that requires visual scanning, number and letter sequencing, and visual motor speed.  The 
test requires the individual to connect the dots of 25 consecutive targets (numbers only in 
Trail A and then numbers and letters in Trail B) on a sheet of paper. The TMT take 
approximately 5 -10 minutes to administer.  (will only be administered at time points one 
and three)  
• Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Fourth Edition (WAIS -IV):  Digit span, C oding , 
Symbol Search and Arithmetic Subtests.  These subtests comprise the working memory 
and processing speed indices.  These subtests take approximately 15 -20 minutes to 
administer.  This will be administered only at time point one.  
• Glasgow Outcome Scal e-extended (GOS -E) 10 min  
The Glasgow Outcome Scale -extended (GOS -E) is an assessment of general  functioning. 
This scale evaluates 8 categories: Dead, Vegetative State, Lower  Severe Disability, 
Upper Severe Disability, Lower Moderate Disability, Upper  Mode rate Disability, Lower 
Good Recovery, and Upper Good Recovery. It takes  approximately 10 minutes to 
administer  by staff observation . 
• Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) 10 min  
The BSI is used to identify self -reported clinically -relevant psychological  symptoms i n 
adolescents and adults. The shortened form of the BSI instrument  provides a highly 
sensitive assessment of psychological factors. The BSI takes  approximately 10 minutes to 
administer  by interview .  
• Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS): 1 min  
The Satisfact ion with Life Scale (SWLS) is a short 5 -item instrument designed to  
measure global cognitive judgments of satisfaction with one's life. The scale  is done by 
interview and usually requires only about one minute of a respondent's time  to complete.  
 
 
Because the primary goal of this exploratory study is to assess the utility of PET TSPO 
imaging by comparing PET and MRI findings, we will not terminate the study even if TBI 
subjects miss component(s) of these neuropsychology tests . For non -English speakers, these 
neuropsychology tests will not be performed because non -English versions may not be available 
and tests through an interpreter may not be valid. Not doing the neuropsychology tests is 
acceptable because the primary goal of t his exploratory study is to assess the utility of PET 
TSPO imaging . Some of the tests may be done under protocol 10 -CC-0118 at ~ 3 months if the 
subject is also participating in 10 -CC-0118. If the tests are done within one week under 10 -CC-
0118, those resu lts will be used and the tests will not be repeated for 12 -M-0063. Healthy 
controls will not have these neuropsychological tests . 
 
Binding assays on blood cells and mRNA and cDNA assays  to study TSPO  
To determine the affinity status of TSPO, binding assays  using TSPO ligands and genetic 
assays on single nucleotide polymorphism  will be performed.  
For these assays, a pproximately 60 mL venous blood will be drawn  from healthy 
volunteers at the time of enrollment and also from all TBI subjects . Mononuclear cells  will be 
separated and binding assays will be performed using [3H]PBR28 or [3H]PK 11195 with 
nonradiolabeled PK11195 and /or PBR28. Platelets may also be used for the binding assays. We 
may also examine the mRNA expression of TSPO by RT -PCR and Northern blo tting and the 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 18 of 48 polymorphisms of TSPO by cDNA sequencing. Blood samples may be stored for future genetic 
studies on binding affinity to TSPO if the subject agrees. The binding assays will be performed 
by Molecular Imaging Branch, and the genetic assays will be performed by Dr. McMahon’s lab 
of NIMH.  
 
HIV testing  
 Because HIV infection was reported to increase TSPO (Cosenza -Nashat  et al. , 2009 ), it 
may affect the PET results.  To obtain the information that may help interpreting the PET results, 
HIV testing will be performed for all participants.  
 Because this study primarily focuses on local area s with MRI abnormalities as stated in 
section 11. Statistical analysis a. Analysis of data / study out comes (page 23 of the protocol) , it is 
unnecessary to exclude subjects with HIV infection and unnecessary to know the results of the 
HIV test before the P ET scan(s).  
 
vi. Follow -up/termination procedures  
 For TBI subjects, participation in this study will end after the last [11C]PBR28 PET scan. 
For healthy controls, participation in this study will end upon completion of a [11C]PBR28 PET 
and an MRI scan.  
 TBI subjects enrolled in this research study will be under the medical supervision of 
Medical Advisory Investigator , Robert B. Innis, MD, PhD, during the study procedures at NIH.  
 Research findings obtained under the current protocol, such as the results of  [11C]PBR28 
PET scans and laboratory tests, will not be shared with participants or health care providers 
unless the finding requires further evaluation and care. We are not able to provide care to 
subjects for any relevant findings observed under this res earch study and, if needed, we will refer 
subjects to their healthcare provider.  
b. Relationship of this study to other protocols  
 To test the sensitivity of [11C]PBR28 to detect neuroinflammation, for Group 1 
acute/ subacute phase, we will study subject s who have shown  abnormal MRI findings under  
protocol 10 -N-N122  or in the CNRM Image Processing Core for the participants of the CNRM 
Recruitment Core protocol 11 -N-0084  and other CNRM protocols . Therefore, subject s will be 
recruited  from the participants of 10 -N-N122 , 11-N-0084 , or other CNRM protocols . For Group 
2 chronic phase, we recruit TBI subjects who had injury ~5 months to 5 years ago and meet at 
least one of the criteria of Probable or Definite TBI. We recruit group 2 subjects from CNRM 
Recruitmen t Core and other CNRM protocols.  
 The current protocol is related to t he Center for Neuroscience a nd Regenerative Medicine 
(CNRM). CNRM is a collaborative intramural federal program involving the United States (US) 
Department of Defense  (DoD) and the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) . It joins  clinicians and 
scientists across disciplines to catalyze innovative approaches to traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
research. The Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences ( USU ) heads the operation of 
the CNRM ( www.usuhs.mil/cnrm ). 
 The subjects participating in the current protocol may be referred to another CNRM -
related protocol (Leighton Chan, PI) of NIH Protocol 10 -CC-0118 “Long Term Clinical 
Correlates of TBI: Imaging, Biomarkers, and Clinical Phenotyping Parameters”, for potential 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 19 of 48 study eligibility and participation. Subjects will be informed in the written consent fo rm that if 
they choose to participate in NIH Protocol 10 -CC-0118, identifiable data in PHI will be shared. 
If the subjects participate in 10 -CC-0118, they will be initially contacted by a study member of 
this PET protocol.  
 Data will be shared with USU  Protocol No. CNRM -004 “Biorepository and Informatics 
Warehousing” Brian M. Cox, PI, after all PHI has been removed and samples have been coded.  
c. Manag ement  of data and samples  
Storage  
All clinical imaging data will be transferred to the NIH Radiology and Imaging Sciences 
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) for clinical interpretation of the MRI 
scans.   This system is password protected and access is limited to authorized NIH users.  
In addition, all imaging data will be transferred to a secure  research server, associated 
with a study ID, and de -identified.   De-identified images will be stored and maintained by the 
CNRM.   The Director and PI of the CNRM Informatics Core, the Director and PI of CNRM 
Image Processing Core, and database administrat ive staff shall be granted the access required to 
perform data entry into the system as well as other typical database maintenance tasks.  
Blood samples will be assigned a code at the time of blood draws and a courier service 
will be used to transit the sam ples for processing and storage according to the CNRM -004 
protocol and related manual of operations (appendix 6). NIH will assign a Global Unique 
Identifier (GUID) to all samples and data submitted to the CNRM repository. The purpose of the 
GUID is to allo w data and samples on the same subject, from multiple protocols and from 
different institutions, to be identified as coming from a single individual and to be combined in 
the repository.   PII will be entered on a local server and a one -way encryption using  a keyed -
hash algorithm will be used to assign the GUID.   CNRM will not receive PII.   The one -way 
encryption assures that the GUID cannot be used to back -generate PII.  
Blood samples for in vitro binding assays and genetic assays on TSPO will  be stored in 
secured freezers on the NIH campus  and will not be discarded until fully  utilized . Any loss or 
destruction of samples will be reported to the IRB.  
 
Data  (including genomic data) and sample sharing plan  
This protocol is not subject to the Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policy.   
 
Samples and data will be shared with the Center for Neuroscience a nd Regenerative Medicine 
(CNRM).  Samples that have been delinked may then be sent to other non -CNRM repositories.  
Possible future research includes performing additional TSPO binding and genetic assays. 
Subject name and identifying information will be removed and replaced with a unique patient 
identifier. The key to the code will be kept in a separate, secure area.  
 
Data and samples may also be shared with collaborating laboratories at NIH or outside of NIH 
and/or submitted to NIH -designated repositories and databases if c onsent for sharing was 
obtained .  Repositories receiving data and/or  samples from this protocol may be open -access or 
restricted access.  
 
Samples and data will be stripped of identifiers and may be coded (“de -identified”) or unlinked 
from an identifying code (“anonymized”). When coded data is shared, the key to the code will

8. Risks/ discomforts  
Risks of study participation and minimization of risks  
Potential risks and discomforts from this study include those associated with: i) medical 
examinations including laboratory testing , ii) radiation exposure risks, iii) PET scanning, iv ) 
placement of arterial and venous lines, v) blood sampling,  vi) MRI , and vii) cognitive testing . 
 
i) Medical Examination and Laboratory Testing  
 No medical risks are associated with taking of medical history, physical examination, or 
laboratory tests other than risks from phlebotomy.  Phlebotomy may lead to the formation of 
small subcutaneous hematoma s caused by blood leaking fro m a punctured blood vessel. These  
hematoma s typically cause  only minor discomfort. There is also a small risk  of infection at the 
site of the needle puncture, which can be readily treated with antibiotic therapy.  
 
ii) Radiation Exposure Risks  
Radiation exposure in this protocol will be from up to  four [11C]PBR28 scans  and four 
transmission scan s for TBI subjects and one [11C]PBR28 and one transmission scan for healthy 
controls. The radiation absorbed dose for the transmission scans will depend on the scanner used. 
The effective dose of one transmission scan from a PET camera using a 68Ge source is 0.01 rem; 
for cameras using a 137Cs source, the dose is  0.0003 rem . The effective dose of one transmission 
scan for head from a PET/CT camera that uses CT for transmission is 0. 6 rem. Based on data 
obtained from w hole body imaging of healthy hum ans performed at the Molecular Imaging 
Branch  (MIB ) (Brown  et al. , 2007 ), we estimate that  the highest effective dose calculated for 
humans from the current  study  who have three [11C]PBR28 scans  using PET -CT is 1.65 rem 
within one year , which is  well below NIH RSC annual guideline s of 5 rem. Some TBI subjects 
have one or two [11C]PBR28 scans within one year and will have lower levels of radiation 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 21 of 48 exposure.  Radiation Safety Committee requires us to report radiation exposure within a year, and 
no TBI subject will have four PET scans within one year.  
All subjects will be asked about any prior research participation involving radiation 
exposure so that the tota l exposure, in combination with the present study, does not exceed an 
effective dose of 5 rem per 12 months.  
 
iii) PET Scanning  
PET scanning  presents no medical risk beyond that of the radioactivity exposure and 
risks of arterial line and intravenous line placement. Subjects with back problems may be 
uncomfortable lying flat for the scan.  Subjects can communicate with trained health 
professionals whil e in the scanner and can stop the scan and withdraw from the study at any time 
if they wish to do so.  
Occasi onally subjects become anxious during the scan. In that case, subjects can request 
the operator of the PET to stop the scan.  
 
iv) Arterial/Venous Line Placement  
Arterial catheterization has been shown to be a generally safe and reliable method of 
obtaining  arterial blood samples  (Lockwood, 1985 ). Placement of a radial arterial catheter may 
cause bruising or infection. There is also a risk of occlusion and microemboli. Over 5 ,000 arterial 
catheters have been placed at NIH and, o f these, only two complications requiring a physician’s 
care were reported. In the first case, a small radial artery aneurysm developed several months 
later, which was successfully repaired surgically. In the second case, a radial artery thrombosis 
developed 28 days later, which was also successfull y repaired surgically. The arterial line will be 
placed by a member of the anesthesiology staff or the Vascular Access Department after 
confirming normal double circulation (both radial and ulnar arteries). If there is a complication 
related to placement o f an arterial catheter, medical care will be provided in accord with NIH 
policy . 
Intravenous catheters will be placed in subjects to minimize discomfort from phlebotomy. 
Venous catheter insertion, which is less invasive than arterial catheterization, can a lso be 
associated with bruising, infection, or clot formation. Using proper placement techniques will 
minimize these risks.  
 
v) Blood Sampling  
Subjects will have up to four [11C]PBR28 PET scans and healthy controls will have one 
[11C]PBR28 PET scan.  Each scan will  require  no more than 125 mL for blood sampling.  
Careful screening of health status an d CBC will be done at screening. Healthy controls 
may be screened under 01 -M-0254 “ The Evaluation of Patients with Mood and Anxiety 
Disorders and Healthy Volunte ers.” Subjects will be asked not to donate blood for a period of 
eight weeks after participation is completed. The total blood drawn will be approximately 200 
mL for healthy controls and approximately 500 mL for TBI subjects who have four [11C]PBR28 
PET sc ans. These sampling volumes will  not exceed 550 mL over any eight -week period, 
including blood drawn for clinical purposes.  
 
vi) MRI  
MRI is not associated with any known deleterious biological effects. MRI scanners of 1.5 
- 3.0 Tesla are widely used as clinical imaging tool s. Subjects will be screened and excluded for 
the presence of any ferromagnetic metal in the body  both at the time of recruitment and just prior 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 22 of 48 to the MRI. Pregnancy testing will be done on women of child bearing potential before MRI 
scanning. The noise of the MRI scanner is loud and could damage hearing. Subjects will wear 
ear-plugs to minimize exposure to excessively loud noises. Subjects can also request that the 
operator stop the scan  at any time . Becau se claustrophobic individuals  find MRI scans difficult , 
subjects with this condition will be excluded at the time of recruitment.  
Gadolinium contrast will be administered to qualified TBI subjects. Symptoms from the 
contrast infusion are usually mild and m ay include coldness in the  arm during the injection, a 
metallic taste, headache, and nausea. In an extremely small  number of subjects, more severe 
symptoms have been reported , including shortness of  breath, wheezing, hives, and lowering of 
blood pressure. Subjects will not receive  gadolinium -based contrast agents if they report having a 
previous allergic reaction  to this agent . All subjects  will be asked about such allergic reactions 
before a contrast agent is administered.  Because individuals with kidney d isease who receive 
gadolinium for contrast are at risk for a condition  called “nephrogenic systemic fibrosis” (NSF) , 
which has resulted in a very small number  of deaths , such  individuals are not eligible to have 
MRI with contrast under this  protocol.  
 
vii) Cognitive testing  
The cognitive tests are not harmful, but may be frustrating or stressful to some subjects.  
We will ask subjects to try their best and inform subject that no one performs perfectly on  these 
tasks. We will also inform subject s that they may refuse to answer any question or to  stop a test 
at any time and for any reason  
 
vii) Genetic  testing  on TSPO  
The genetic testing on TSPO that will be done as part of this study is done for research 
purpose only. Because relationship between genotype of TSPO or affinity of ligands to TSPO 
and health or diseases has not been established, the genetic testing done in this protocol does not 
provide information on subject’s health.  
9. Subject monitoring  
For PET scans, t he injection site will be mon itored for any evidence of vascular changes 
or trauma at the completion of the study. Participants will be monitored during the PET 
procedure for the development of excessive anxiety.  A study team clinician  and a PET  technician 
will be present during the e ntirety  of the scan . 
For MRI scans, s erum creatinine and GFR will be checked before gadolinium -DTPA is 
given. Study personnel will closely monitor allergic reactions to gadolinium.  During the scans, 
subjects can be observed  directly through a window betwee n two rooms or via closed circuit 
television. In  addition, audible communication between subjects and the scanning personnel will 
be possible  via intercom. Subjects can be removed from the scanner immediately upon request or 
in case of medical necessity.  An MRI technician will be present during the scans, and a clinician 
is available in Radiology. Study staff will monitor  subjects during other study procedures.  
During study procedures, .in the event that a subject displays aggressive  or combative 
behavior, testing will be aborted and the subject  will be evaluated by Medical Advisory 
Investigator , Robert B. Innis, MD, PhD, or by one of clinically credentialed Associate 
Investigator . 
 
Criteria for individual subject withdrawal  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 23 of 48 Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they:  
▪ request  to be withdrawn from the study  
▪ are unable to complete study evaluations because of unforeseen circumstances  
▪ develop any condition for which, in the investigator’s opinion and following adequate 
safety review, it is in the participant ’s best interest to be withdrawn from the study  
▪ Fail to comply with study requirements . 
▪ Any serious adverse event related to the research  
10. Outcome measures  
 The primary outcome measure will be the binding levels of [11C]PBR28 measured as 
total distribution volume VT and VT normalized to plasma free fraction ( fP), VT / fP using dynamic 
brain data and metabolite -corrected arterial input function. Secondary outcome measures will 
include neuropsychology  test scores  obtained by the tests described in section 7. Study Design 
and Mehtods. A. Study phases. V. Study procedures. Neuropsychology test s. VT and VT / fP in the 
areas of MRI abnormalities in TBI subjects will be compared to those in the areas without MRI 
abnormalities in the same subject and VT and VT / fP in healthy controls.  In TBI subjects, 
relationship between VT or VT / fP and neuropsychology test  scores will also be studied.  
 
11. Statistical analysis  
a. Analysis of data / study outcomes  
 Data obtained from TBI subjects who have a [11C]PBR 28 brain within approximately 10 
days of head injury and are identified as low -affinity binders will be excluded based on the fast 
decline of brain activity (Kreisl  et al. , 2010 ). Healthy controls identified as low affinity binders 
will be excluded before their [11C]PBR28 brain scan.  
Group 1  of TBI  - Acute/subacute phase : 
 The main analysis will be performed to study whether [11C]PBR28 PET shows changes 
in TSPO in areas where radiologist(s) report changes in MRI.  
[11C]PBR28 binding will be measured as VT and VT / fP using dynamic brain data and 
metabolite -corrected arterial input function. These distribution volumes will be calculated in 
each voxel using the Logan plot and may also be calculated by other commonly used methods 
such as compartmental modeling and spectral analyses. In addition, to calculate distribution 
volumes from less noisy data, volumes of interest may be placed in individual PET images of the 
dynamic data and distribution volumes may be calculated by commonly used methods of 
quantification such as compartmental modeling and the Logan plot.  VT and VT / fP in the areas of 
abnormal MRI findings will be compared with those on the contralateral side of the same subject 
if the MRI is normal on the contralateral side. In addition, VT and VT / fP in the areas of abnormal 
MRI findings will be compared with those of he althy controls.  
 In addition to studying [11C]PBR28 binding in the areas with abnormal MRI findings, VT 
and VT / fP of [11C]PBR28 of TBI subjects in areas with normal MRI findings will be compared 
to those of healthy controls.  HIV infection and usage of drugs of abuse may be a confounding 
factor in this comparison because HIV infection was reported to increase TSPO (Cosenza -Nashat  
et al. , 2009 ) and drugs of abuse may cause neuroinflammati on (Yamamoto  et al. , 2010 ). 
Therefore, the results of HIV tests , urine drug screen , and history of using drugs of abuse may 
help interpretation of the PET results . 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 24 of 48 Group 2 of TBI  - Chronic phase : 
 [11C]PBR28 binding measured as VT and VT / fP will be compared between the site of 
injury and the contralateral side  if it showed no structural changes  at the time of injury and at the 
time of PET . In addition, PBR28 binding in all  brain areas will be compared with that in healthy 
controls because a recent study using the old ligand [11C]PK 11195 showed increase in TSPO in 
certain brain regions irrespective of the site of brain injury  (Ramlackhansingh  et al. , 2011 ). As 
stated above for Group 1, the results of HIV tests , urine drug screen , and history of using drugs 
of abuse may help interpretation of the PET results.  
For both Groups 1 and 2:  
 As an exploratory analysis, we will also study the relationship between VT and VT / fP of 
[11C]PBR28 in TBI subjects in conjunction with their neuropsychology test  scores.  
 In addition to the quantitative analysis based on VT and VT / fP values, [11C]PBR28 
parametric images may be visually evaluated by study investigator(s) blind  to subject's diagnosis, 
in order to inform future use in clinical settings. As an exploratory analysis, correlation between 
[11C]PBR28 binding and neuropsychological test scores  will be studied.  
 
b. Criteria for significance , power analysis, and accrual number request  
 In this exploratory study to investigate the ability of [11C]PBR28 PET to detect increases 
in TSPO, the primary goal is to measure the magnitude and variance of putative increases in 
[11C]PBR28 binding in inflammatory areas in TBI subjects.  Those data may be used to design 
future studies with a larger sample size. If [11C]PBR28 binding is indeed increased in TBI 
subjects, statistical significance will be tested by comparing binding on the contralateral side in 
the same subject if the contral ateral side shows normal MRI results, and also by comparing 
binding in healthy controls. The association between [11C]PBR28 binding and clinical scores 
obtained from the neuropsychological test scores  may also be used to design future studies with a 
larger  sample size.  The statistical significance of regression in the current study will also be 
assessed.  
 Because of the exploratory nature of the current protocol, we request a relatively small 
sample size of 20 in each group. After taking into account dropo uts, we expect to perform at 
least one [11C]PBR28 PET scan in approximately 15 subjects in each group. A pilot study of this 
sample size is usually adequate for studying the utility of PET brain molecular imaging and 
calculating the necessary sample size o f future studies.  
12. Human Subjects Protection  
a. Subject selection  
 The racial and ethnic dis tribution of the subjects will reflect those of the clinical 
population affected by TBI and the participating hospital. No gender or ethnic/r acial background 
preference or  exclusion will apply to subject recruitment. We anticipate that approximately 60% 
of the subjects will be male.  
b. Justification for inclusion  / exclusion of children  
 Because the study involves radiation exposure, children will be excluded.  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 25 of 48 c. Justification for inclusion of other vulnerable subjects  
 Written informed consent will not be waived for this study. We will include TBI subjects 
who signed a consent form for protocols 10 -N-N122 , 11-N-0084 or other CNRM protocols for 
him/herself without requiring a legally -authorized representative. Pregnant or breast feeding 
women will be excluded because of the radiation exposure from [11C]PBR28.   
 Procedures for consent are described in Section 15.  
d. Justification of sensitive procedures (use of plac ebo, medication withdrawal, provocative 
testing)  
 None of these sensitive procedures apply to this protocol.  
e. Safegu ards for vulnerable populations  
 Only TBI subjects who signed consent forms for protocols 10 -N-N122 , 11-N-0084 or 
other CNRM protocols for him/herself without requiring a legally -authorized representative will 
be eligible for this study. In addition, as described in Section 15, t he Decision Making Capacity 
(DMC) of all TBI subjects will be assessed by a Clinical Research Advocate (CRA) from the 
Human Subjects Protection Unit (HSPU) of the NIMH Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) to 
determine whether  a subject  can give his/her own consent. Within 24 hours p rior to any MRI  or 
PET scan , blood and urine specimens will be collected and pregnancy  tests will be performed  on 
women of childbearing potential . Subjects with positive pregnancy test s will not undergo MRI  or 
PET scans and will be withdrawn from the study.  
 All study procedures will be performed at NIH. Emergent medical problems will be 
managed by the NIH Rapid Response Team or the Code Blue Team. Participant s will be 
evaluated and can be admitted to 7SWN Neurology Unit or 3SWS Intensive Care Unit , as 
needed.  Relevant circumstances  include, but are not limited to: 1) se izure ; 2) s evere post -
concussive syndrome , such as  migraine refractory to standard medical treatment ; 3) a ny other 
unforeseen complication s requiring acute medical stabilization . Care will be pr ovided until the 
subject is stable or until care can be transferred to the subject’s own health care providers. F or 
medical problems or conditions that occur outside of the NIH  Clinical Center, participants will 
need  to seek care and treatment from their primary  care physician or a local emergency room.

13. Benefits  
 This study does not offer direct benefit to participants but is likely to eventually yield 
generalizable knowledge about the role of neuroinflammation in TBI . 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 28 of 48 14. Summary  / classification of risk  
 This protocol is classified as a more than minimal risk study due to the radiation 
exposure, arterial line placement, and blood sampling associated with [11C]PBR28 PET scans. 
The risks of the protocol are reasonable in light of the anticipated benefit derived from a better 
understand ing of neuroinflammation in TBI.  
15. Consent documents and process  
 The consent forms contain all required elements.  
Subjects with TBI : 
 TBI subjects must all provide written informed consent. Only subjects who signed the 
consent form of protocol 10 -N-N122 (only those who participate in the current study within ~5 
months  of brain injury) , 11-N-0084 (all TBI subjects) , or other CNRM protocol s (all TBI 
subjects)  for him/herself without requiring a legally -authorized representative will be enrolled. In 
addition, DMC  of all TBI subjects will be assessed by a Clinical Research Advocate (CRA)  from 
Human Subject Protection Unit (HSPU)  of the NIMH OCD to determine if a subject  can give 
his/her own consent. HSPU will develop and administer the protocol -specific capacity 
assessment tool and document the outcome in the medical record. If a subject is determined to 
have Decision Making Capacity ( DMC ), consent may be obtained from the subject by the PI/ AI. 
If clinical status changes between capacity assessment and consenting or PET, a clinically 
credentialed study investigator will judge if another capacity assessment is necessary.  
 Subjects determined by the PI, his/her designee, or the HSPU not to have DMC will be 
excluded from  this protocol . 
 Consent monitoring may be provided by the HSPU on an as -needed basis.  
 
If a non -English speaking participant is unexpectedly eligible for enrollment, the 
participant will be provided with the CC Short Written Consent Form for Non -English Speaking 
Research Subjects in the participant’s native language and a verbal explanation of the purpose, 
procedures and risks of the study. The IRB -approved English consent  form will serve as basis for 
the verbal explanation of the study. The investigator will obtain an interpreter unless the 
investigator is fluent in the prospective participant’s language. Preferably, the interpreter will be 
someone who is independent of th e participant (i.e., not a family member). Interpreters provided 
by the CC will be used whenever possible. The interpreters will translate the IRB -approved 
English consent form verbatim and facilitate discussion between the participant and 
investigator.   An interpreter will be used throughout the subjects’ visit beginning with the 
consent form process and all procedures that can validly be done through an interpreter.  
The IRB -approved English consent form will be signed by the investigator obtaining 
consent  and a witness to the oral presentation. The CC Short Written Consent Form will be 
signed by the participant and a witness who observed the presentation of information. The 
interpreter may sign the consent document as the witness and, in this case, will no te “Interpreter” 
under the signature line. A copy of both signed forms will be provided to  the participant to take 
home.  
The investigator obtaining consent will document the consent process in the participant’s 
medical record, including the name of the int erpreter.   Further, all instances of use of the CC 
Short Written Consent Form will be reported to the IRB at the time of annual review. If the CC 
Short Written Consent Form is used three times or more for the same language within an IRB 
approval period, th is will be reported to the IRB immediately.

Healthy Volunteers : 
 HSPU will not be involved in obtaining informed consent from healthy volunteers. 
Healthy volunteers must all provide written informed consent.  
 
Details on Obtaining Informed Consent : 
 For all healthy volunteers and TBI subjects, an investigator from the study will obtain 
informed consent by providing a  detailed account that includes : 1) the rationale for the study; 2) 
the subject’s  right to withdraw from the study at any time; 3) the need t o keep their scheduled 
appointments and comply with the protocol; and 4) information regarding how noncompliance 
with the protocol can result in termination from the study. Informed consent will be obtained 
after the participant has demonstrated a thorough  knowledge of the protocol.  Consent will be 
obtained by the Principal Investigator or one of the Associate Investigators.  
 Each subject will receive an oral and written explanation of the purposes and potential 
risks of participation in this protocol. Spec ifically, they will be told that (a) the information 
derived may eventually lead  to better understanding of the role of neuroinflammation in TBI,  (b) 
PET imaging as used in this study is a research tool, hence no diagnost ic interpretation will be 
given, an d (c) subjects will be given ample opportunity to ask questions of the investigators. If 
laboratory tests or medical examination show significant abnormalities, appropriate referrals will 
be made to address health problems.   
 
Consent for sharing of previo usly collected data and samples  
If consent was not obtained for broad sharing of data and samples under the original consent, 
written consent will be obtained via mail and telephone co ntact. A letter (see appendix 7 ) will be 
mailed/e -mailed to them along with two copies of the consent.  The letter will be followed by a 
phone call to assess interest.  If the participant is interested, a time will be arranged when a 
witness can be present on their end to go over the consent and answer questions. The potentia l 
participant will be instructed to sign and date one copy of the consent and have the witness also 
sign and date. The signed consent will be e -mailed or mailed back to the investigators in a 
prepaid envelope, and the participant will keep the other copy. The investigator who participated 
in the consent process will then sign the consent and a copy with all three signatures will be sent 
to the participant.  
 
16. Data and Safety monitoring  
a. Data and safety monitor   
Carlos Zarate, MD  will serve as an indepen dent data and safety monitor.  
 
b. Data and safety monitoring plan  
The PI will prepare a report on data and safety parameters for the Independent Monitor 
quarterly .  The Independent monitor will provide a written monitoring report to be submitted to 
the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 
c. Criteria for stopping the study or suspending enrollment or procedures  
The PI will notify him within one week of any serio us adverse event. The study will be 
stopped if there are any serious adverse event directly related to the study procedure until a 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 30 of 48 determination can be made on whether to proceed with the study. In such cases, Dr. Zarate may 
consult with the investigators and IRB to determine if changes are needed for research to 
continue or if it will be closed.  
17. Quality Assurance  
a. Quality assurance monitor  
Quality assuranc e will be monitored by the PI, t he research team and the Intramural 
Research Auditing Committee (IRPA C) serving NIAAA, NIDA and NIMH . 
b. Quality assurance plan  
IRPAC monitors intramural research studies to ensure compliance with GCP, 
organizational policies and regulations.  Audit frequency is determined by the IRPAC SOP based 
on the study level of r isk.  Results of IRPAC audits are provided to the PI, The Clinical Director 
and the CNS IRB.  As an IND study, this protocol will be subject to GCP audits at study initiation 
and after the first enrolled subject.  Timing of subsequent review will be establi shed by IRPAC 
but no less frequent than every other year.   
 
18. Reporting of Unanticipated problems, adverse events and protocol deviations   
The Principal Investigator is responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting unanticipated 
problems, advers e events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), and deviations in accordance 
with NIH policy, IRB requirements, and federal regulations. Relatedness to the research of all serious 
adverse events will be determined by the P I in consultation with th e CD.  
Serious unanticipated problems and serious protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB and 
CD as soon as possible and in writing on the Problem Report Form  not more than 7 days after the PI first 
learns of the event.  Not serious unanticipated pr oblems and not serious deviations will be reported to the 
IRB and CD as soon as possible and in writing on the Problem Report Form not more than 14 days after 
the PI first learns of the event.  
Deaths will be reported to the Clinical Director within 7 days  after the PI first learns of the event.   
All adverse events, deviations, and unanticipated problems will be summarized and reported at 
the time of Continuing Review.  
[C-11]PBR28 is administered under IND #  127,685. The PI will immediately report SAEs related 
to this IND to the Sponsor , NIH Clinical Center , according to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.64(b) and 
as agreed upon with the sponsor. The PI will record nonserious AEs and repo rt them to the Sponsor when 
the Sponsor submits an annual report to t he FDA.  
19. Alternatives to participation or alternative therapies  
 This study does not provide treatment and does not replac e any therapy that subjects may 
receive as part of standard care for head injury or TBI from the ED/Trauma Team or from their 
own p hysician. Subjects will not be asked to forego any treatment to participate in this study. 
Subjects may choose not to participate in this research study.  The alternative, therefore, is not to 
participate.  
20. Privacy  
All research activities will be conduct ed in as private a setting as possible.  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 31 of 48 21. Confidentiality  
 The entire MRI dataset of TBI subjects will be transferred to the research PACS of the 
CNRM Image Processing Core (at the  NIH) once it is IRB approved. Data will be assigned a 
study ID with personally -identifying information removed.  Imaging data  will be stored using 
codes that we assign. Image d ata will be kept in  password -protected computers. Only study 
investigators will have access to the identified data.  Members of the CNRM, Uniformed Services 
University, Henry M Jackson Foundation, and the US Department of Defense will have access to 
the study data for auditing purposes.  After removing personal identifiers and labeling with a code 
number, blood samples for binding and DNA analyses will be stored in locked freezers. The 
samples will be kept for future assays.  
22. Conflict of Interest  
 NIH guidelines on conflict of interest have been distributed to all investigators. No NI H 
investigators have reported a conflict  of interest.  
23. Technology Transfer  
 No technology transfer is involved in this protocol.  
24. Research and Travel Compensation  
 As shown in the tables below, both TBI subjects and healthy controls  will be 
compensated for time and research -related inconveniences.  Local transportation costs will be 
paid for any participant who must travel to participate.  For subjects recruited from remote cities, 
we will offer transportation costs at the government r ate, as well as costs related to overnight 
stays. The payments will follow the established NIH guidelines. Study subjects  will be 
compensated at current volunteer participation rates: $20.00  / first hour; $10.00  / hour thereafter. 
The reimbursement is brok en down as follows:

Protocol # 12-M-0063 PET Imaging of Translocator Protein in Patients with Traumatic Brain 
Injury ” 
 
Approved by NIMH CNS IRB on 12/30/2011  
 
Principal Investigator: Masahiro Fujita, MD, PhD, National Institute of Mental Health, National 
Institutes of Health  
 
Contact: Holly Giessen (301 -435-8982)  
 
We are looking for people with head injury who are willing to participate in an imaging 
study. The study will be done at National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland.  
 
The purpose of  this research study is to measure a  particular protein ( called the translocator 
protein) in injured brain  by using an imaging technique called positron emission tomography 
(PET) scanning . We would like to perform PET scanning because your MRI scan done un der 
another protocol 10 -N-N122 " Evaluation, Pathogenesis, and Outcome of Subjects with or 
Suspected Traumatic Brain Injury " showed some changes, which make us expect to find changes 
in PET . By doing PET scanning, we hope to better understand changes in bra in after head injury.  
 
PET images are created by the use of small amounts of radioactive chemicals whi ch are injected 
through a vein into the body.  
 
We will ask you to have one - three PET scans over about three months. Each PET scan takes 
about 2 hours to  complete. By including time of the preparation for the PET scan, you will need 
to spend about 6 hours at NIH on the day of each PET scan.  
 
In addition to PET scans, we may ask you to do MRI scan(s) at NIH.  
 
You need to be older than 18 years to participat e. 
 
We will pay you for your participation in the study.

CNRM Shipping Requirements and Instructions  
 
 
Specimens being shipped to the CNRM Repository should be consi dered as Clinical/Diagnostic specimens and as 
such must be tripled packaged and compliant with IATA Packing Instructions 650.   See the 51st Edition (2010) IATA 
Regulations for complete documentation.  
 
Triple packaging consists of a primary receptacle(s), a secondary packaging and a rigid outer packaging. The primary 
receptacles must be packed in secondary packaging in such a way that, under normal conditions of transport, they 
cannot break, be punctured  or leak their contents into the secondary packaging. Secondary packaging must be secured 
in outer packaging with suitable cushioning material. Any leakage of the contents must not compromise the integrity 
of the cushioning material or of the outer packagi ng. 
 
Packing and Labeling Guidelines for Clinical/Diagnostic Specimens : 
 
• The primary receptacle (blood draw tube or frozen vial) must be leakproof and must not contain more than 
1L. 
• The secondary packaging (biohazard bag) must be leakproof and if multiple blood tubes are placed in a single 
secondary packaging, they must be either individually wrapped or separated to prevent direct contact with 
adjacent blood tubes.  
• Absorbent material must be placed between the primary receptacle (blood tubes or the cryovial  box 
containing the frozen vials) and the secondary packaging. The absorbent material should be of sufficient 
quantity in order to absorb the entire contents of the specimens being shipped. Examples of absorbent 
material are paper towels, absorbent pads, c otton balls or cellulose wadding.  
• A shipping manifest of specimens being shipped must be included between the secondary and outer 
packaging.  
• The outer shipping container must display the following labels:  
o Sender’s name and address  
o Recipient’s name and add ress 
o The words “Biological Substance, Category B”  
o UN3373   
 
o Class 9 label including UN 1845, and net 
weight if packaged with dry ice  
o Complete shipper example:  
 
 
 
Shipping Instructions  for Blood Tubes : 
 

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev.03 -25-10)    
   
page 45 of 48 • Wrap tape around the stoppers of the various blood (yellow, lavender, red, Paxgene) tubes.  
• Place tubes in Styrofoam box for blood tubes, bubble wrap for blood tubes or individually wrapped or 
separated to prevent direct contact with adjacent blood tubes.  
• Place inside of biohazard bags with absorbent; ensure the biohazard bag is adequately sealed  
• Place the biohazard bag into a rigid outer package (shipping container)  
• Label shipping container with appropriate labels:  
o Sender’s name and address  
o Recipient’s nam e and address  
o The words “Biological Substance, Category B”  
o UN3373   
• If shipment is for local pickup and delivery contact Runners Inc.  301-948-7500 to schedule a pickup. Provide 
Runners Inc . with time and address location of pickup. Pickup time should no later than 2:00 pm if possible 
to allow for adequate time for processing at processing site.  
• A Bill of Lading will need to be filled out will sender and recipient information, as well as brief description 
of shipment content. FedEx shipments should be sent  Monday thru Thursdays to avoid shipping delays or 
Friday. Specimen integrity can be vastly compromised if blood tubes are not processed 24 to 36 hours after 
collection.  
• Linda B runson  of the shipment via email and phone  
• Use FedEx Tracking to ensure the del ivery is made  
Shipping Instructions  for Frozen Specimens : 
 
• Place cryovials and Paxgen tube into a cryovial box (cryovial box and grids can be supplied by the CNRM 
Repository)  
• Place cryovial box with absorbent material inside biohazard bag; ensure the bioha zard bag is adequately 
sealed  
• Place the biohazard bag into a rigid outer package (shipping container). The shipping container must also 
contain Styrofoam for the dry ice that must be placed in the shipper. The dry ice must surround and be place 
on top of t he biohazard bag in order to ensure the frozen state of the specimens.  
• Label shipping container with appropriate labels:  
o Sender’s name and address  
o Recipient’s name and address  
o The words “Biological Substance, Category B”  
o UN3373   
• If shipment is for local pickup and delivery contact Runners Inc.  301-948-7500 to schedule a pickup. Provide 
Runners Inc . with time and address location of pickup. Pickup time should no later than 2:00 pm if possible 
to allow for adequate time for processi ng at processing site.  
• A Bill of Lading will need to be filled out with sender and recipient information, as well as brief description 
of shipment content. Specimens should be sent to the below address. If shipping from non local location use 
our preprinte d FedEx forms. FedEx shipments should be sent Monday thru Wednesday to avoid shipping 
delays Thursday or Friday. FedEx does not replenish dry ice if shipments are delayed or held over during the 
weekend.

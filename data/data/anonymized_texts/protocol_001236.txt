2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Study Disease 
Patient enrolled in our study with have a known or presumed diagnosis of breast cancer or are 
pursuing prophylactic treatment for which they are undergoing post-mastectomy breast 
reconstruction with abdominal free flap. 
 2.2 Study Agent/Device/Procedure 
2.2.1  Nimbus Ambulatory Infusion System: 
 
Product Description: 
• Adjustable volume to be infused (VTBI), variable basal rate and bolus delivery 
• Single patient use. 
The Nimbus Ambulatory Infusion System is capable of carrying: 
• Time stamped infusion parameters 
• Incidences of bolus requests vs. bolus delivered 
 
2.2.2 Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block 
 
Protocol for RCT of TAP Blocks in Breast Reconstruction   
 
Protocol Version #3  8 28 April 2018 The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a peripheral nerve block that targets nerve roots 
T6 to L1, which innervate the anterior abdominal wall. The block is placed by administering 
local anesthetic into the fascial plane between the internal oblique muscle and the transversus abdominis muscle.
1, 2 TAP blocks have previously been show to improve immediate post-
operative patient comfort and reduce post-operative narcotic usage in a variety of other abdominal surgeries including abdominoplasty, laparotomy, and cesarean section.
3-7 
 2.2.3 Bupivacaine (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride) 
 
Bupivacaine hydrochloride is an amide-type local anesthetic metabolized primarily in the liver 
via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 
to 45 minutes following peripheral nerve block injection, followed by a decline to insignificant 
levels during the next three to six hours. The half-life of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride in adults is 
2.7 hours. When administered in recommended doses and concentrations, Bupivacaine 
Hydrochloride does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage.
8 
 
For clinicaltrials.gov compliance 
Both the Nimbus Ambulatory Infusion System and the local anesthetic bupivacaine have been FDA approved for use for analgesia in patient in the United States. 
 
2.3 Rationale 
There are many options for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction including implants, pedicled 
muscle flaps, and free muscle flaps. With the development of advanced microsurgical 
techniques, free abdominal muscle flaps have become a popular option for breast 
reconstruction.
9, 10 For these patients, the speed of recovery and hospital length of stay following 
surgery are largely determined by the abdominal flap donor site rather than the breast recipient and resection site.
9 
 Successful post-operative analgesia has been reported to decrease the incidence of both 
cardiopulmonary complications, in-hospital mortality, and healthcare costs, and it may also 
contribute to lower odds of death after surgery.
11, 12 In addition, when examining factors leading 
to expedited discharge following abdominal-based breast reconstruction surgery, use of a 
multimodal pain regimen was found to be predictive of successful early discharge.13 Though 
post-operative opioids can decrease pain scores, opioids can also lead to adverse side effects including sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and respiratory depression.
14 Because patients 
undergoing abdominal flap-based breast reconstruction have had abdominal muscle tissue manipulation, postoperative vomiting can increases the risk of incisional hernias and other 
surgical complications.  
 
An increasingly utilized option for post-surgical pain management is a pre-operative nerve block 
targeting anesthetic directly to the nerve roots innervating the surgical field. In the setting of 
abdominal flap-based breast reconstruction, a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) nerve block 
accomplishes this goal for the abdominal incision. Several studies have evaluated the TAP block 
in abdominal flap-based breast reconstruction. Hivelin et al. evaluated bilateral ultrasound-
guided TAP block in patients undergoing unilateral deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) 
flap reconstruction and found that patients reported lower pain scores post-operatively and 
demonstrated lower narcotic usage in the first 24 hours, but not in subsequent time periods out to 
Protocol for RCT of TAP Blocks in Breast Reconstruction   
 
Protocol Version #3  9 28 April 2018 48 hours after surgery. However, in this study only a single injection of local anesthetic was 
given intra-operatively, and this injection was performed by a surgeon in the operating room, 
rather than by an anesthesiologist in the pre-operative waiting area. The duration of block 
placement varied between 18 and 24 minutes, increasing the overall length of time in the 
operating room. In addition, Hivelin et al. only followed patients to 48 hours after 
reconstruction.15 Furthermore, Wheble et al. performed a retrospective review of intra-
operatively placed TAP blocks and found patients receiving the block had a shorter hospital 
length of stay, lower overall morphine usage, and less post-operative nausea and vomiting. 
However, this was a retrospective study with a small number of patients in each group (12 in th e 
TAP group, and 15 in the non-TAP group).16 
 
In addition, Zhong et al. conducted a prospective cohort study with TAP block catheters placed 
intra-operatively under direct visualization of fascial planes, and the anesthetic infusions 
continued until post- operative day 3. Zhong et al. compared this group of patients to a 
retrospective cohort from the same institution and found that patient who received TAP blocks 
had significantly less opioid usage than those who did not.17 The group conducted a subsequent 
randomized double-blinded controlled trial with TAP catheters placed under direct vision, this time administering either local anesthetic or saline for controls and found similar results.
18 
 A limitation of both studies by Zhong et al. is that patients undergoing both unilateral and 
bilateral reconstruction were combined, as were patients undergoing immediate and delayed reconstruction. Given that patients are subject ed to twice the surgical insult in bilateral versus 
unilateral reconstruction, combining these patients into one cohort for analysis of post-operative pain may confound the results attained. Similarly, in delayed reconstruction, a repeat surgical 
incision is made at the site of the breast, whereas in immediate reconstruction, the same incision 
at the breast is used for both mastectomy and reconstruction.  
 
In our study design, patients undergoing unilateral and bilateral reconstruction will be separated 
for both randomization and statistical analysis. We aim to further elucidate if the specific type of 
surgery changes the efficacy of the pre-operative TAP nerve block.

5.1.2  Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) Nerve Block 
 
The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) nerve block is a peripheral nerve block that targets nerve 
roots T6 to L1, which innervate the anterior abdominal wall. The block is placed by 
administering local anesthetic into the fascial plane between the internal oblique muscle and the 
transversus abdominis muscle.1, 2 TAP  nerve blocks have previously been show to improve 
immediate post-operative patient comfort and reduce post-operative narcotic usage in a variety of other abdominal surgeries including abdominoplasty, laparotomy, and cesarean section.

 5.1.3 Bupivacaine (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride) 
 
As reported on FDA-approved drug products website:  
<http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/018053s055lbl.pdf > 
 “The onset of action with Bupivacaine Hydrochloride is rapid and anesthesia is long lasting. The 
duration of anesthesia is significantly longer with Bupivacaine Hydrochloride than with any 
other commonly used local anesthetic. It has also been noted that there is a period of analgesia 
that persists after the return of sensation, during which time the need for strong analgesics is 
reduced. After injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride for caudal, epidural, or peripheral nerve 
block in man, peak levels of bupivacaine in the blood are reached in 30 to 45 minutes, followed 
by a decline to insignificant levels during the next three to six hours. The half-life of 
Bupivacaine Hydrochloride in adults is 2.7 hours. 
Amide-type local anesthetics such as Bupivacaine Hydrochloride are metabolized primarily in 
the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those 
with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type 
local anesthetics. Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride. The 
kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary 
excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of 
bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine. 
 
When administered in recommended doses and concentrations, Bupivacaine Hydrochloride does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage and does not cause methemoglobinemia. 
 
Bupivacaine Hydrochloride is indicated for the production of local or regional anesthesia or 
analgesia for surgery, dental and oral surgery procedures, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, 
and for obstetrical procedures.  
Bupivacaine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to it or to any local anesthetic agent of the amide-type or to other components of Bupivacaine 
Hydrochloride solutions. 
 
Maximum dosage limit must be individualized in each case after evaluating the size and physical 
status of the patient, as well as the usual rate of systemic absorption from a particular injection 
site. Most experience to date is with single doses of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride up to 225 mg

Protocol Version #3  17 28 April 2018 7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 
7.1 Potential Adverse Events As reported on FDA-approved drug products website:  
<http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/018053s055lbl.pdf > 
 “The most commonly encountered acute adverse experiences which demand immediate counter 
measures are related to the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. These adverse 
experiences are generally dose related and due to high plasma levels which may result from over 
dosage, rapid absorption from the injection site, diminished tolerance, or from unintentional 
intravascular injection of the local anesthetic solution. In addition to systemic dose-related 
toxicity, unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug during the intended performance of caudal 
or lumbar epidural block or nerve blocks near the vertebral column (especially in the head and 
neck region) may result in underventilation or apnea (“Total or High Spinal”). Also, hypotension 
due to loss of sympathetic tone and respiratory paralysis or underventilation due to cephalad 
extension of the motor level of anesthesia may occur. This may lead to secondary cardiac arrest 
if untreated. Patients over 65 years, particularly those with hypertension, may be at increased risk 
for experiencing the hypotensive effects of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride. Factors influencing 
plasma protein binding, such as acidosis, systemic diseases which alter protein production, or 
competition of other drugs for protein binding sites, may diminish individual tolerance.”

7.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.03.  Both Serious and Non-Serious 
Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event 
(AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol 
Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation. All Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution, or until 30 after the last dose of the study 
treatment.  
 
SAEs CTCAE Grade 3 and above, and all subsequent follow-up reports will be reported to the 
Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study 
specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by the DSMC, events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the IRB using eProtocol within 10 working days of DSMC review, or within 5 working days for 
deaths or life-threatening experiences.

11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to 
the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by the 
Stanford IRB and Stanford Cancer Institute Scientific Review Committee (SRC).   Any changes 
made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by the IRB prior 
Protocol for RCT of TAP Blocks in Breast Reconstruction   
 
Protocol Version #3  21 28 April 2018 to implementation.  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information 
to all participating investigators. 
 
11.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the 
monitoring entity for this study. The DSMC will audit study-related activities to determine 
whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating 
procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of the 
following types of documents participating in the study: regulatory binders, case report forms, 
eligibility checklists, and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review 
serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the 
protection of human subjects.  Results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and 
the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited 
fashion, as needed. 
 
11.3 Data Management Plan 
The Protocol Director, or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate 
participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study specific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs) will document treatment outcomes for data analysis.   Case report forms 
will be maintained by Stanford Box account, a secure data storage platform, or in a locked office accessible only to the research team. 
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Statistical Design 
This study is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. 
 
12.1.1 Randomization 
Patients will be randomized within their group (unilateral or bilateral reconstruction) to receive either a true TAP catheter or a sham TAP catheter with saline infusion. The Stanford Pharmacy 
will randomize patients into the two groups.  
 
12.2 Interim analyses There are no planned interim analyses. 
 
12.3 Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis If applicable, describe plans for descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis. 
 
12.4 Primary Analysis  Post-operative Narcotic Usage 
 
12.4.1 Analysis Population 
Subjects will be grouped according to laterality of breast reconstruction (i.e., unilateral vs. bilateral). Within each group, experiment subjects will be compared to control subjects. A first 
Protocol for RCT of TAP Blocks in Breast Reconstruction   
 
Protocol Version #3  22 28 April 2018 sensitivity analysis will explore the impact of missing data by replacing missing data with the 
more extreme values that favor the null hypothesis. A second sensitivity analysis will replace 
missing values with an extreme value that favors the alternative hypothesis.  In both cases 
"extreme" is the largest or smallest value as applicable. 
 
12.4.2. Analysis Plan 
Differences between the two arms will be evaluated using an analysis of covariance model. The comparison of the two arms will be made adjusting for the variables used in the stratified 
randomization. The primary analysis will be a modified intent-to-treat principle (using recorded 
values where available regardless of compliance).

12.6  Sample Size 
12.6.1 Accrual estimates   
Based on data from prior years of patients undergoing post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, we 
estimate a total of 40 patients will be eligible for study enrollment each year. This number was 
determined by counting the number of patients who underwent eligible surgeries in 2014 at 
Stanford Hospital and Clinics. If study accrual falls short of what is expected, we will apply for 
IRB extension and continue study enrollment until the target sample size is reached. Our target 
sample size is 64 patients in each the experimental and control groups for a total of 128 patients.  
      
12.6.2 Sample size justification 
The target sample size was determined by the two-tailed t-test power calculation. The estimated 
standard deviation of total oral morphine or equivalents is 20 mg. A difference of 10 mg between 
the two arms is considered clinically relevant. To detect a difference of 10mg of morphine (or 
oral morphine equivalents) between the experimental and control groups with a power of 80%, 
we calculated a target enrollment of 64 patients in each group. The null hypothesis is that the 
experiment and control groups will not have significantly different Post-operative Narcotic 
Usages in the first 48-hour period post-operatively. The alternative hypothesis is that the 
experiment and control groups will have significantly different Post-operative Narcotic Usages 
in the first 48-hour period post-operatively

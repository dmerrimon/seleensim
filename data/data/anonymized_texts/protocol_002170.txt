Title of Study:  An Open -Label, Multiple Dose, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Tolerability of QR -110 in Subjects with Leber ’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) due to 
c.2991+1655A>G Mutation (p.Cys998X)  in the CEP290  Gene  
Study Centers:  Participation of approximately 3 study centers  planned  
Phase of Development:  Phase 1b/2  
Study Period:  Anticipated to be approximately 18 months  
Duration of Subject Participation:  13 months  (Screening 28 days; study period 12 months)  
Rationale:  Leber ’s congenital amaurosis (LCA)  is a severe inherited retinal degenerative disease 
resulting in blindness, often in early childhood. In subjects with LCA due to the 
p.Cys998X mutation in Centrosomal Protein of 290 kDa ( CEP290 ), visual symptoms  
are usually detectable before 1 year of age  and further deterioration  over time has also 
been reported ( den Hollander 2008 , Yzer 2012 ). Patients show severe vision 
disturbances from an early age and slow progressive loss of remaining vision  
(Cideci yan 2007 , Cideciyan 2011 ). There are currently no approved therapies for the 
treatment of LCA due to the p.Cys998X mutation in CEP290  (subsequently referred to 
as the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation) and a large unmet medical need exists .   
The CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation results in aberrant splicing of CEP290  with mutant 
messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) and truncated protein production in affe cted 
individuals. QR -110 is a single stranded, chemically modified, RNA oligonucleotide 
that is designed to correct aberrant splicing in CEP290  gene, enabling production of 
fully functional RNA and protein.  
Objectives:  Primary:  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -110 administered via intravitreal  
(IVT)  injection in subject s with LCA due to  the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation   
Secondary:  To evaluate the serum pharmacokinetics of QR -110 administered by IVT 
injection in subject s with LCA due to  the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation  
To evaluate the efficacy of QR -110 administered by IVT injection in subject s with LCA 
due to  the CEP290 p.Cys998X mutation  
 
Number of Subjects (planned):  12   
The final number of subjects is dependent on whether any dose levels are expanded by 
the Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) and Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
Study Design  The first -in-human study of QR -110 will be an open -label, multiple dose, dose  
escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -110 administered  via IVT 
injection in subjects with LCA due to  the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation. Subjects will

 be assigned to receive a specified dose level of QR -110 (loading dose and maintenance 
dose) and will receive that dose throughout their participation, while they are monitored 
for safety. No intrasubject dose escalation is planned. Up to 3 dose levels of Q R-110 
will be evaluated. Dose escalation decisions and initiation of dosing in pediatric 
subjects (6 to <18 years of age) will be determined by the DMC  and Sponsor Medical 
Monitor review of safety and tolerability  data.  The DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor 
will also review all available safety data  at key study time points (eg,  prior to the first 
subject in the first adult cohort (Cohort A1) receiving each sub sequent dose of study 
drug).  
QR-110 will be administered by unilateral IVT injection. Each subject will receive up 
to 4 doses of QR -110 in their wors e eye (as defined by visual acuity  at Screening , 
subsequently referred to as treatment eye)  every 3 months  and will be assessed for 
safety and tolerability at follow up visits. If both eyes have the same visual acuity , the 
Investigator should determi ne the eye with the worse visual function  as the treatment 
eye, according to other measures of ophthalmic function  (Full-field Stimulus Testing 
[FST] or mobility course score ). If the visual function  is the same per the Investigator’s 
assessment, then the treatment eye will be determined at Investigator discretion. No 
placebo nor sham injections will be administered in the contralateral eye .  
The contralateral eye and the subject’s own baseline measurements will serve as 
controls.   
Subjects who do not meet stopping criteria prior to their next scheduled injection will 
receive their planned dose  (Section  4.2.2 ). Subjects who meet stopping criteria will be 
discontinued from dosing and will be followed for safety and efficacy.  
The DMC  and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor may decide to de -escalate the dose, hold the 
dose (delay or skip), or discontinue study drug for an individual subject, in consultation 
with the Investigator . Subjects who discontinue study drug will continue to be followed 
for safety and efficacy.  
An extension study , which would permit continued dosing of eligible subjects who 
complete PQ -110-001, is planned .  
Dose Escalation  
Specifics of the dose escalation plan are descri bed in detail in Section  4.2.1.5 . It is 
planned to dose  at least  2 adult s and, subsequently, at least 2 pediatric subjects  at each 
dose level of QR -110. Up to  3 dose levels are planned  across 3 dose cohorts . No 
intrasubject dose escalation will occur.  Dosing will be staggered such that:  
• The first 2 subjects at any dose level will be dosed at least 2 weeks apart  
• At least 4 weeks of post dose safety and tolerability data on the previous 
cohort  will be reviewed by the DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  prior to 
dose escalation in subsequent subjects  
• Dosing and dose escalation of pediatric  cohorts will be initiated following 
DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor review and will follow that of the 
corresponding adult cohort by at least 4 weeks  
Following DMC  and S ponsor Medical Monitor review and decision on dose escalation, 
the first subject at the next dose level may be dosed and the second subject at that dose 
level may be dosed 2 weeks later. S afety and tolerability data, including follow -up for 
at least 4  weeks post  dose, will be reviewed by the DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor . 
A complete discussion of the rules regarding timing of doses for individual subjects is 
presented in Section  4.2.1.5 . 
Pediatric subjects will only receive a given dose level of QR -110 following DMC  and 
Sponsor Medical Monitor acceptance of at least 4 weeks of post  dose safety  and 
Investigational Product: QR -110

   02-Aug-2018  
 tolerability  data in the 2 adults at that same dose level.  Therefore, dosing of pediatric 
subjects will remain a minimum  of 4 weeks behind dosing of the corresponding adult 
cohort at the same dose level. The safety measures around the timing of dosing and 
dose escalation of adult subjects also apply to pediatric subjects.  The first 2 pediatric 
subjects at each dose level will be dosed at least  2 weeks apart. At least 4 weeks of 
safety and tolerability data for the first 2 pediatric subjects at each dose level wi ll be 
reviewed by the DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  prior to enrollment and dose 
escalation of subsequent pediatric subjects.  
Safety review will be conducted by the DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  before each 
cohort initiation and on an ad hoc basis as needed . The Sponsor will also perform safety 
review on an ongoing basis.  
Study Plan  
The study include s a 28-day screening period.  
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed according to  the eligibility 
criteria. Historic genotyping results from a certified genetic laboratory are acceptable 
with Sponsor approval. For subjects without a historic genotyping result, genotyping 
and gene sequencing analysis to determine the presence of the CEP 290 p.Cys998X 
mutation will be performed . It is recommended that screening be conducted in a 
stepwise manner, so that eligibility is confirmed first with less intensive assessments 
and m ore intensive assessments are conducted after eligibility by all other criteria have 
been confirmed.   
Most measures of visual function (Best-corrected Vis ual Acuity [ BCVA], FST  mobility 
course , oculomotor instability and Pupillary Light Reflex [ PLR]) will be measured a 
minimum of 2 times prior to the subject’s first dose of study drug to evaluate 
intrasubject variability  (Screening and predose on Day 1) . Measures of retinal anatomy 
(infrared imaging, and Optical Coherence Tomography [OCT] ) and electr oretinogram 
(ERG ) will  be measured a minimum of 1 time prior to the subject’s first dose of study 
drug. Any predose a ssessment may be repeated if the results are considered unreliable 
or of unacceptable quality by the Investigator or if the assessment could not  be 
completed.  In the case of r epeat assessments, the measure reflecting the average of the 
measures  will be considered the Baseline value.  
Subjects who meet all eligibility  criteria will be enrolled into the study  and will receive 
their first dose of study drug  on Day 1. QR -110 will be administered via IVT injection 
into the subject’s treatment eye in accordance with the procedures outlined by the 
American Academy of Ophthalmology  (Avery 2014 ). 
Subjects will be monitored clinically for increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) and 
signs of inflammation  and endophthalmitis  during the post -injection period . 
Subjects will be eva luated the day after  each administration of study drug  for safety 
monitoring  (all doses)  and to enable collection of serum samples for pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis    
Subjects will return to the study center to complete safety assessments at 7 days , and 1  
month , 2 months (doses 1 and 2 only)  and 3 months post dose. In addition, subjects will 
be evaluated by telephone interview at 14 days post dose for the first dose onl y. 
Efficacy assessments, including retinal imaging, functional assessments of vision, 
 
 All assessments will be performed on both the 
treatment and con tralateral  eyes.

 Statistical Methods:  Baseline  demographics and disease characteristics,  safety and efficacy endpoints will be 
summarized descriptively  by dose group and for all subjects combined . Continuous 
efficacy endpoints will be summarized and may be analyzed using appropriate 
parametric or nonparametric inference tests. Serum concentrations of QR -110 will be 
summarized by dose level and time point. To determine the PK profile of IVT 
injection s at the different dose levels of QR -110, the following PK parameters will be 
calculated if sufficient data are available for each dose:  
• AUC 0-∞: Area under the curve to infinity will be calculated based on the last 
observed concentration C last (obs) using formula: 
AUC 0-∞=AUC last+C last(obs)/λz, if feasible.  
• AUC 0-tlast: Area under the curve to the final sample with a concentration 
greater than lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be calculated  based on 
the last observed concentration  using the linear trapezoidal method.  
• Cmax, C0: The maximum and minimum serum concentrations will be taken 
directly from the data.  
• Tmax: Time to C max will be taken directly from the data.  
• T1/2 (if measurable serum l evels are obtained): The terminal elimination half -
life will be estimated by non -linear regression analysis of the terminal 
elimination slope, if feasible.  
• CL: Serum clearance will be estimated using the formula: CL = Dose/AUC 0-∞. 
• Vd (if measurable serum l evels are obtained and an elimination rate constant 
(λz) is estimable): Apparent volume of distribution at steady state of the drug 
will be determined from trough levels.  
Any p values that will be calculated according to the analysis plan will be interpreted in 
view of the exploratory nature of the study.  Details on statistical analyses will be 
included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
ProQR Therapeutics (ProQR) is developing an antisense oligonucleotide  (AON)  product, 
QR-110, for the treatment of patients with Leber ’s congenital amaurosis (LCA)  due to the c.2991 
+1655A>G mutation (p.Cys998X  or IVS26+1655A>G ) in the C entrosomal Protein of 290kDa 
(CEP290 ) gene . Leber ’s congenital amaurosis is a severe inherited retinal degenerative disease 
resulting in blindness, often in early childhood. In patients with LCA due to the p.Cys998X 
mutation  in the CEP290  gene (subsequently referred to as CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation ), visual  
symptoms are usually detectable before 1 year of age  and further deterioration over time has also 
been reported  (den Hollander 2008 , Yzer 2012 ). Patients show severe vision disturbances from 
an early age and slow progressive loss of remaining vision ( Cideciyan 2007 , Cideciyan 2011 , 
McAnany 2013 ). There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of LCA due to the 
CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation  and a large unmet medical need exists. The primary goal of the 
development plan for QR -110 is to provide a treatment to overcome the genetic defect in patients 
with at least one CEP290  allele containing the CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation, resulting in 
functional vision restoration or preservation . The intended route of administration is intravitreal 
(IVT) injection.  
2.1 Leber ’s Congenital Amaurosis  
Leber ’s congenital amaurosis is a non -syndromic retinopathy  that affects both cone an d rod 
photoreceptor cells of the retina. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, reported to be the most 
severe and one of the earliest onset form s of vision loss in children, with detection of disease 
symptoms as early as  the first year of life. The symptoms and signs include severe and early 
vision loss, sensory nystagmus (involuntary eye movement s), abnormalities of  pupil  reactions , 
oculo -digital sign, and nondetectable photoreceptor electrical signals on electroretinogram 
(ERG). There are  approximately 20 genes identified to date in which mutations are causative for 
LCA (den Hollander 2008 , Estrada -Cuzcano 2011 , Kmoch 2015 ), and the LCA classification is 
based on the disease causing gene . The most frequently mutated LCA gene is CEP290 , with 
mutations accounting for about 15% to 30% of LCA cas es (Coppieters 2010 , den Hollander 
2008 , den Hollander 2006 , Perrault 2007 , Stone 2007 ).  
The CEP290  gene is located on the long ( Q) arm of chromosome 12 and codes for CEP290 
protein , which has an important role in centrosome and cilia development. The most frequently 
occurring CEP290  mutation associated with retinal dystrophy  in Caucasians , especially in 
European countries and the United States (US), is a change in intron 26 of the CEP290  gene 
(p.Cys998X) ( Stone 2007 , den Hollander 2006 , Perrault 2007 , Littink 2010 ). This mutation 
creates a cryptic splice donor site in intron 26 which results in the inclusion of an aberrant exon 
(exon -X) of 128 base s in the mutant CEP290  messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). This cryptic 
exon introduces a premature stop codon, predicted to render CEP290 a truncated protein. The 
mutation has been found in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity in patients with CEP290  
LCA ( Cideciyan 2007 , den Hollander 2006 , Perrault 2007 ). Both the homozygous and 
heterozygous genotypes result in a similar clinical presentation. The CEP290  p.Cys998X

 mutation appears to be hypomorphic in nature, with wild -type transcripts present in peripheral 
tissues, explaining the non -syndromic nature of th e CEP290  p.Cys998X  mutation ( Parfitt 2016 ).  
2.2 QR-110 for the Treatment of Leber ’s Congenital Amaurosis due to CEP290  
p.Cys998X Mutation  
The primary goal of the development plan for QR -110 is to provide a treatment to overcome the 
genetic defect in patients with at least one CEP290  allele containing the p.Cys998X  mutation . 
QR-110 is an AON designed as a disease modifying therapy for LCA due to the CEP290  
p.Cys998X  mutation . QR -110 targets the splicing mutation of the CEP290 protein through a 
mechanism of RNA modulation  that skips the inclusion of the cryptic exon -X. The exclusion of 
this cryptic exon results in restoration of the open reading frame of CEP290  and excludes the 
premature stop codon present in exon -X.

 2.2.2 Clinical Experience  
No clinical studi es have been conducted with QR -110 Solution for IVT Injection . 
2.3 Study Rationale  
There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of LCA due to the CEP290  
p.Cys998X mutation and a large unmet medical need exists. QR -110 is designed to target the 
splicing mutation in the CEP290 protein. The hybridization of the QR -110 oligonucleotide 
modulates the RNA splicing process, blocking access to the active cryptic splice site and 
restoring preference for the wild -type splice sites, skipping the inclusion of the cryptic exon -X in 
CEP290 , and resulting in a functional CEP290 p rotein.  
This first-in-human study of QR -110 is an open -label, multiple dose, dose escalation study to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -110 administered  via IVT injection in subjects with 
LCA due to the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation. It is anticipated that repair of the splicing defect 
may be possible in patients with preservation of at least detectable ONL . Patients with LCA due 
to the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutat ion exhibit progressive retinal degeneration and substantial loss 
of rod photoreceptors in the peripheral retina; however, sparing of foveal /macular  cone 
photoreceptors has been observed.  Such cone photoreceptor sparing is noted in some patients by 
the pre sence of an almost normal retinal ONL  thickness at the foveal region and retained cone -
specific retinal function. Importantly, age does not seem to be strictly associated with disease 
severity ( Cideciyan 2007 , Cideciyan 2011 , Pasadhika 2010 ).  
The phenotype of LCA due to  mutations in CEP290  is severe . However, in a cohort of Dutch 
patients, Yzer et al (2012 ) concluded that patients usually have a relatively normal optic disc, 
mild or moderate attenuation of vessels and a relatively preserved posterior pole, suggesting that 
anatomy i s preserved. There is evidence of sparing of some photoreceptors in the macula of 
individuals with LCA carrying CEP290  mutations, which may allow for therapeutic intervention.

 Restoration of protein expression to wild -type levels has the potential to delay , cease , or possibly 
to reverse disease progression ( Chacon -Camacho 2015 ). 
2.3.1 Rationale for Open -label Design in Patients  
Intravitreal injection is a well -established route of administration wit hin ophthalmic indications; 
however, rare but potentially serious complications to IVT injections exist, including acute onset 
endophthalmitis, pseudo -endophthalmitis, cataract  and retinal detachment. Although the risk of 
serious complications is small, it  is well -documented ( Artunay 2009 , Fagan 2013 , Falavarjani 
2013 ). Therefore, placebo injections will not be administered in this study to preserve subject 
safety.  
Use of sham injections to mask su bjects to treatment assignment in studies of products 
administered via IVT injection eliminates the risk of complications due to injection in the 
contralateral eye. Sham injections that closely mimic the active injection can effectively mask 
participants t o treatment assignment; however, the masking effect is less pronounced in the case 
where a single subject would receive both the real and sham injections, one in each of their eyes 
(Glassman 2012 ), as would be required in LCA due to the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation.  
This study will be an open -label study and sham injections will not be used. Masking of 
participating subjects is of particular importance when subject effort or perception could bi as 
evaluation of study endpoints; this is true for the assessment of subjective endpoints such as 
visual acuity ( Glassman  2012 ). However, many assessments are objective tests ( Pupillary Light 
Reflex [PLR], OCT, oculomotor instability  [OCI] , ERG , and infrared  imaging ) which are not 
related to subject responses. A central reading center will be used for several of the 
ophthalmologic assessments, including PLR, OCI, Full Field Stimul us Testing ( FST), ERG, 
OCT and infrared imaging, which will be reviewed and interpreted by an independent masked 
evaluator. Mobility course scoring will also be reviewed and calculated by a masked evaluator. 
Furthermore, this study will evaluate safety and  tolerability as the primary endpoint. Measures of 
safety will be monitored and severity and causality determined by the Investigator. Taken  
together, the risk of the introduction of bias to the determination of safety from the participant is 
low and sham injections will not reduce bias introduced by Investigators.  
Subjects will receive QR -110 as a unilateral IVT injection in their worse eye (see  
Section  4.2.1.2 ). Treatment of the worse eye is common practice in the development of 
ophthalmic products ( Bainbridge 2008 , Ghazi 2016 , Jacobson 2012 , Maguire 2009 ). Unilateral 
injection serves as an additional means to ensure safety, as visual function is driven by a 
subject´s better eye.  Unless other wise specified, both safety and efficacy evaluations 
 will be based on the assessment of the treat ment  eye 
in comparison to baseline measures and to the untreated  eye (referred to hereafter as the 
contralateral eye) . As there is no approved therapy for the treatment of LCA due to the CEP290  
p.Cys998X mutation, no suitable comparator currently exists. The contralateral  eye, therefore, 
serves as a control and removes the biases due to the absence of a relevant comparat or, or the

 administration of placebo by IVT injection, which is considered unethical in this population. 
Assessments based on both the comparison of the treat ment  eye to the contralateral eye, and 
changes from baseline in the treat ment  eye will provide the  strongest comparisons from which to 
evaluate safety and efficacy data.  
2.4 Route of Administration, Dosage, Dosage Regimen and Treatment Period  
Intravitreal injection is a well -established route of administration within ophthalmic indications. 
Systemic exposu re to drugs administered via IVT injection is generally low and the technique 
enables targeting of the product to the intraocular tissues of the eye ( AAO 2015 ). Intravitreal 
injection is used in several products for the  chronic treatment of ophthalmic diseases (eg, 
Lucentis®, Eylea ™, Macugen®) and the risk of complications is low when injections are 
performed by trained ophthalmologists ( AAO 2015 ). 
Since IVT injections themselves carry a low risk of serious complications , independent of the 
product administered , dose levels to be investigated in the study are calculated to be 
pharmacologically efficacious doses. Evaluation of up to 3 dose levels of QR -110 is planned. 
Inclusion of up to 3 dose levels enables investigation of a potential dose response relationship for 
QR-110. Based on the chemistry of the molecule, PK data from toxicology studies, and what is 
known of other oligonucleotides approved for IVT injection (Macugen®, Vitravene®), systemic 
absorption is anticipated to be low.  
Each subject  will receive up to 4 doses of QR -110 at 3 month intervals and will be monitored for 
3 months following their last dose of study drug. The dosing interval of 3 months and the 
12-month  duration of dosing  is expected to be in the efficacious range for QR -110. 
Administration of 4 doses has been selected to enable evaluation of the safety of rep eat dosing of 
QR-110 and to evaluate potential efficacy  parameters . The multiple dose design  provides 
subject s with the potential opportunity for efficacy . A single dose design is not considered 
acceptable in this population because subjects would be exposed to the risks associated with IVT 
injection without the possibility of being able to derive any (sustained) benefit. To ensure subject 
safety in this multiple dose design, an independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) will 
review all available safety data prior to each dose escalation , prior to inclusion of pediatric 
subjects,  and prior to the first subject receiving each subsequent dose of QR -110 (doses 2, 3, and 
4). Therefore, the study consists of a single initial dose, with DMC  review of cumulative study 
data and a positive DMC recommendation prior to continuing to each subsequent dose.

 Details on the dose selection are provided in the QR -110 IB. 
2.5 Study Population  
The study drug will be administered by IVT injection which carries a risk of serious 
complications, making the inclusion of healthy volunteers unethical. Furthermore, QR-110 is 
designed to exert the specific effect of masking the cryptic splice site in pat ients with the 
CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation , which is not present in healthy volunteers . It is, therefore, 
unknown  if safety data obtained from healthy volunteers, would be similar to that of patients 
with the target mutation. Evalu ation of patients with LCA due to the CEP290  p.Cys998X 
mutation is therefore necessary to evaluate the safety of QR -110.  
Eligible subjects will have LCA due to homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for the 
CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation, residual vision and detectable ONL in the area of the macula as 
determined by OCT. Preservation of at least some retained photoreceptor ONL is a prerequisite 
for restoration of the splicing defect and consequent impact on disease. Due to severe nystagmus 
in many subjects with LCA due to the  CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation, it is anticipated that 
consistent, quantitative calculation of the volume of retained ONL across subjects may be a 
challenge in this population ; therefore, eligibility will be determined by the existence of any 
detectable ONL  on OCT, in the opinion of the I nvestigator.  
Since disease severity does not seem to clearly correlate with age, inclusion of subjects in the 
first-in-human trial should be guided by disease status and potential for obtaining a therapeutic 
benefit. The high u nmet medical need warrants early therapeutic intervention in those patients 
with sufficient preserved vision and retinal anatomy in which a major clinical benefit (restoration 
or improvement of vision or delay in visual loss) could potentially be expected.  Therefore, 
treatment with QR -110 is justified in those patients with LCA due to the CEP290  p.Cys998X 
mutation who present detectable ONL, irrespective of age.   
2.5.1 Inclusion of Pediatric Subjects  
Symptoms of LCA due to the  CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation occur in young pediatric patients; 
symptoms are usually detected before 1 year of age  and patients show  severe vision disturbances . 
Pediatric patient s could benefit from treatment with a therapy for LCA due to the  CEP290  
p.Cys998X mutat ion beginning at a very young age. Given the timing of symptom onset and 
substantial vision loss in young children, it is possible that early initiation of treatment may result 
in improved clinical outcomes for patients.  While the potential to at least cea se progression can

 be assumed to be most beneficial to younger patients, the target patient population for the 
first-in-human study of QR -110 will only include pediatric patients at least 6 years of age to 
ensure subject safety and due to the complexity of  study assessments. A  staggered approach has 
been selected such that pediatric subjects  (pediatric patients include those 6 to less than 18 years 
of age) will only start treatment following review of safety and tolerability data from adult 
subjects  (adult subjects include those ≥18 years of age) . 
In pediatric subjects at least  6 years  of age , the average volume of vitreous is similar to that of 
adult subjects , as referred in Bhardwaj et al (2013)  and Zadnik et al (2004) . Intravitreal 
administration of anti -Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A agents is used to treat newborns in 
cases of Retinopathy of Prematurity and no i ssues  specific to the pediatric population  have been 
identified  in connection to the IVT injection (Mintz -Hittner 2008 , Nazari 2010 ). For a product 
given via IVT injection, there is no evidence to suggest that the safety profile would differ in 
adult patients as compared to  pediatric patients at least 6 years of age. Toxicity studies in 
juvenile animals are summarized in the  QR-110 IB, Nonclinical Studies . 
For the purposes of an early phase clinical study  such as PQ -110-001, it is essential that 
participating subjects be able to complete all necessary safety and efficacy assessments; 
therefore, specifying a minimum age for subject eligibility  is appropriate. The psychophysical 
tests used in low vision popu lations are difficult for children younger than 6  years of age to 
complete due to complexity and the level of focus required. In practice, the ability to complete 
these tests , based on the individual child and the suitability of patients of any age to comp lete all 
required assessments , will be determined by the Investigator . Furthermore, the visit frequency 
for this first -in-human trial will be high and visit duration lengthy due to the large number of 
measures required to assess safety. Therefore, t he targ et patient population for the PQ -110-001 
study will be patients at least 6 years of age  who are able to complete all study assessments, in 
the opinion of the Investigator .  
2.5.2 Pediatric Considerations  
In accordance with best practices, the parent or legal rep resentative of a participating pediatric 
subject must be informed as to procedures that are part of usual care and those specific to 
participation in this clinical study. Age appropriate explanations of procedures should be given to 
all pediatric subjects.  Investigators, staff and facilities should be experienced in the care of 
pediatric subjects, in order to minimize pain, distress and fear. Separation of the pediatric subject 
from their parent or legal representative should be minimized and when necessary , the pediatric 
subject should be accompanied by a study staff member. Pain should be minimized (eg, use of 
indwelling catheters for blood draws or use of topical anesthetic agents ), in accordance with 
local institutional practices  (Directive 2001/20/EC ).

 The study is not designed to have sufficient statistical power  to assess efficacy of QR -110 in the 
treatment of LCA  due to the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation . However, changes in clinical 
outcome measures associated with LCA  due to the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation will be 
monitored over the course of the  study . 
4.2 Study Design  
The first -in-human study of QR -110 will be an open -label, multiple dose, dose  escalation study 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR -110 administered  via IVT injection in subjects with 
LCA due to  the CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation. Subjects will be assigned to receive a specified 
dose level (loading dose and maintenance dose) of QR -110. No intrasubject dose escalation is 
planned. Up to 3 dose levels of QR -110 will be evaluated. Dose escalation decisions and 
initiation of dosing in pediatric subjects will be determined by the DMC  and Sponsor Medical 
Monitor  review of safety and tolerability data. 
4.2.1 Study Plan  
4.2.1.1  Screening  
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed according to the eligibility criteria.  
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study . On Day 1, subjects will 
undergo a second set of predose baseline measures as specified in the SOE   and will 
subsequently  receive their first dose of study drug. The data obtained from these two predose 
measures will serve to inform the level of intrasubject variability in study assessments (see 
Section  7.2 for more details on the screening process).  
4.2.1.2  Study Drug Administration  
Subjects will receive study drug via unilateral IVT injection in accordance with the procedures 
outlined by the curr ent international guidelines ( Avery 2014 ) in their worse  eye as defined by 
visual acuity (subsequently referred to as treatment eye) and will be assessed for safety and 
tolerability at follow u p visits. If both eyes have the same visual acuity , the Investigator should 
determine the eye with the worse visual function, according to other measures of ophthalmic 
function  at Screening (FST  or mobility course score) , as the  treatment eye . If the visual function 
is the same per the I nvestigator’s assessment, then the treatment eye will be determined at 
Investigator discretion .

 Specific study drug administration procedures can be found in the  Study Reference Manual . 
4.2.1.3  Assessment  and Follow -up  
To clos ely monitor subject safety, subjects will be evaluated by the Investigator following each 
IVT injection and the following day, as well as 7 days , 14 days  (first dose only , visit to be done 
via phone call ), 1 month, 2  months  (doses 1 and 2 only)  and 3 month s post dose. These frequent 
in-clinic visits are designed to ensure any untoward events in study subjects are quickly 
identified under the oversight of the Investigator  and can be treated promptly.  
Efficacy assessments  will be performed according to the SOE. (See Section  7.3 for details on 
dosing and follow -up visit procedures.)  
All study assessments will be performed for both the treatment and contralateral eyes.  
4.2.1.4  Study Cohorts  
QR-110 will be administered at up to 3 escalating dose levels. The study will include  up to 6 
cohorts  (up to 3 adult cohorts and up to 3 pediatric cohorts). Each cohort will have at least 2 
subjects and each dose level will be tested in 1 adult cohort and 1 pediatric cohort  (Table  2). 
Dose escalation will proceed as described in Section  4.2.1.5 . QR-110 will be administered via 
unilateral IVT injection  in the subject’s wors e eye (Section  4.2.1.2 ) every 3 months and e ach 
subject will receive up to 4  doses of study drug.

The study will test loading and maintenance doses of QR -110 from an initial dose of 
160 µg/80  µg (loading dose/maintenance dose) to a maximum dose of 500  µg/270  µg (loading 
dose/maintenance dose) given by IVT injection every 3 months for a total of 12 months 
(4 doses).  At eac h dose level, safety and tolerability data for at least 4 weeks post dose for the 
current cohort will be reviewed by the DMC and Sponsor Medical Monitor.

 4.2.2 Stopping Criteria  
4.2.2.1  Stopping Criteria for Individual Subjects  
The Investigator, the DMC  or the Sponsor Medical Monitor  may stop treatment for an individual 
subject due to an AE  (see Section  9.0). The severity of the event(s), as well as the temporal 
relationship to study drug administration, potential for worsening of the event(s) with continued 
QR-110 treatment and association with other safety signals or laboratory values should be 
considered in the decision to stop treatment.  The Spons or Medical Monitor and DMC must be 
notified of any subject who stops treatment due to an AE.  
The DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor may decide to de -escalate the dose, hold the dose 
(delay or skip), or discontinue study drug for an individual subject, in consultation with the 
Investigator.

Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 38 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 Subjects who discontinue study drug will be encouraged to remain in the study for observation. 
Subjects who discontinue study drug, but do not withdraw consent will continue to be followed 
for safety  through the End of Study (EOS) visit  at Month 12 . These subjects should complete: 1) 
all study visits until the time of their next scheduled dose, and 2) the remaining of Visits 8 
(Month 3), 13 (Month 6), 17 (Month 9) and 21 (Month 12/EOS).  
The DMC  and the Sponsor Medical Monitor will perform ongoing safety re views of systemic 
and ophthalmic safety data and AEs for safety signal.
  
 
 
Subjects who do not meet stopping criteria prior to their next scheduled injection will receive 
their planned dose  of study drug . If in the interim a subject mee ts stopping criteria as identified 
by the Investigator, the Investigator will notify the DMC  and an ad hoc meeting will be 
convened.  
4.2.2.2  Stopping Criteria for Cohort  
The DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  should evaluate the totality of safety data from all 
subjects receiving the same dose level of QR -110 and cumulative data of previous cohort(s) , to 
evaluate whether a safety signal may be present.

 Dose escalation may be stopped if it is determined that the limits of safety and/or tolerability 
have been reached. This decision will be made after a discussion between the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor  and the DMC . 
In all cases , the decision to proceed to the n ext dose le vel will be made jointly by the  DMC  and 
Sponsor Medical Monitor , based on a review and consideration of all available safety  and 
tolerability  information for the study subject s.  
4.2.3 Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time ( ie, discontinue study drug and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. A subject who withdraws consent will 
always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The Investigator should follow 
up on AEs outside o f the clinical study  to ensure subject safety; however, no data on such events 
will be collected for study purposes . 
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her subject number  cannot be 
reused. Withdrawn subjects may be replaced (s ee Section  10.2.2 ). 
4.2.4 Discontinuation of  the Study  
The DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  will evaluate the safety and tolerability data as 
described in Section  4.2.2  and Table 3 and thereafter on an ongoing basis to recommend if the 
study should continue or cease, or if any modifications should be made as to how subjects are 
treated or managed.   
In the case of overwhelming efficacy  as determined by ongoing analysis of efficacy  (see 
Section  10.9), the DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  may make a recommendation to 
discontinue the study.  
5.0 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION

control from the list below (define d as those, alone or in combination, tha t result in a failure rate  
of less than 1% per year  when used consistently and correctly ). Double barrier methods (a 
combination of condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide) are not considered 
highly eff ective. Childbearing potential is defined as menarche  and until post -menopausal  for ≥ 1 
year, unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy . Highly effective methods of birth control include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)

 7.0 STUDY V ISITS  
All study visits, assessments and procedures should be completed as indicated per the SOE 
7.1 Visit and Assessment Windows  
The timing of assessments, procedures and sample collections are outlined in t he protocol . For 
those procedures for which a specific time point post dose is required (eg, PK blood draws), the 
protocol refers to  nominal times. Actual times for  such assessments are to be recorded in the 
source documentation  and in the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) , and if any time point s 
are missed, the reasons are also to be recorded.  Recording of actual times is not required for 
assessments for which only a study visit and not a specific time is stated in the protocol.  
Each s tudy visit may take up to 1 d ay, or may be conducted in multiple  consecutive days instead 
of 1 full day , at the discretion of the I nvestigator.  
Visits 7 days  post injection s have a visit window of +/ - 3 days. Visits 1  month and 2 months post 
injections have a visit window of +/ - 7 days, and dosing visits have a visit window of +/ - 10 
days.  The visit 14 days post -dose 1 is conducted by telephone and has a visit window of +/ - 3 
days.  
7.2 Screening  
Subject screening should be conducted ≤  28 days prior to study drug dosing (Day 1). A screen ing 
log of all consented subjects  will be kept at each study center .  
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed according to the eligibility criteria  and 
specified assessments conducted, as presented in the SOE  . At the discretion of the 
Investigator, the feasibility of performing an IVT injection on the subject may be assessed using 
noninvasive methods, as outlined in the Study Reference Manual.  Historic genotyping results 
from a certified laboratory are acceptab le with Sponsor approval. For subjects without a historic 
genotyping result, genotyping and gene  sequencing  analysis to determine the presence of the  
CEP290  p.Cys998X mutation will be performed. For all subjects, screening should be conducted 
in a stepwise  manner so that eligibility is confirmed first with less intensive assessments. More 
intensive assessments or any assessments requiring sedation or anesthesia for a specific subject 
are to be conducted once eligibility by other criteria have been confirmed  to minimize risk.   
7.3 Dosing and Follow -up Visits  
Dosing visits occur on Day 1 (Visit 2), Month 3 (Visit 8), Month 6  (Visit 13), and Month 9  
(Visit  17). Study drug will be administered by qualified ophthalmologists via IVT injection. If

 according to local institutional guidelines . 
 
All follow -up study visits, assessments and procedures should be completed as indicated per the 
SOE  
7.4 End of Study Visit  
The EOS  visit occurs  3 months after the 4th dose of study drug,  Month 12  (Visit  21) for subjects  
who have not discontinued study drug . Subjects  who discontinue study drug  but do not withdraw 
study consent  will continue to be followed for safety through the EOS visit (see Section  4.2.2.1 ). 
Subjects who discontinue study drug should complete: 1) study visits until the time of their next 
scheduled dose, and 2) the remaining visits of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.  All EOS assessments and 
procedures should be completed  as indicated per the SOE   
Subjects who discontinue the study (eg, withdraw consent ) should have all assessments 
conducted at the EOS visit at the time of withdrawal, for safety monitoring purposes.  
7.5 Follow -up Extension Study  
An extension study , which would permit continued dosing of eligible subjects who complete 
PQ-110-001, do not meet stopping criteria  in PQ-110-001 and derive therapeutic benefit , is 
planned. The sponsor will base the decision to open an extension study on the safety and efficacy 
data obtained during PQ -110-001 and the risk /benefit analysis for subjects.  
8.0 STUDY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES  
Safety parameters will be assessed by monitoring AEs, vital signs , physical examinations, 
ophthalmic exams, OCTs, infrared imaging, ECGs and laboratory data ( serum chemistr y 
hematology , and inflammatory markers ). Assessments will be conducted as indicated by the SOE 
. 
8.1 Adverse Events  
Information regarding  occurrence of AEs will be captured throughout the study. Duration (start 
and stop dates ), severity/grade, outcome, treatment and relation ship to study drug will be 
recorded. Refer to Section  9.0, Assessment of Safety or Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events.  
8.2 Vital Signs  
Blood pressure, heart rate  and temperature will be measured after the subject has been at  rest in a 
sitting  position for a minimum of 5 minutes.

 8.3 Laboratory Evaluations  
All laboratory evaluations will be conducted at a central laboratory, except Erythrocyte 
Sedimentation Rate (ESR), which will be conducted locally. Reference ranges for all laboratory 
parameters are provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Serum chemistries will include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarb onate  (or serum carbon 
dioxide) , blood urea nitrogen (BUN) , creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, ALT, AST, 
gamma -glutamyl transferase ( GGT ), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin , uric acid, lactic 
dehydrogenas e (LDH) , albumin, total  protein, triglycerides, and cholesterol . Estimat ed 
Glomerular Fil tration Rate  (eGFR)  is to be calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaborat ion (CKD -EPI) Creatinine Equation 2009 calculation  for adult subjects 
and Schwartz equation, according to the recommendation from National Institutes of 
Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  (NIH/ NIDDK), for 
pediatric subjects .  
Hematolog y will include a complete blood count  (CBC):  CBC with absolute differential 
(hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood count, red blood cell count, neutrophils, granulocytes, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelet count) . Urinalysis  (by visual inspection 
and dipstick)  will include color and appearance, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, blood, 
ketones, bilirubin, leukocyte, nitrite, and urobilinogen. In addition, microscopic analyses will be 
performed on sample s with abnormal dipstick results .  
C4, Hemolytic compl ement 50 (CH50), INR, ESR and C Reactive Protein (CRP) will also be 
assessed.  
For female subjects  of child bearing potential , a serum pregnancy test is required at Screening. 
Urine pregnancy tests are acceptable for subsequent time points.  
Subject eligibi lity is determined based on Screening laboratory values. If any relevant changes in 
the subject’s medical history occur between Screening and Day 1, the Investigator should repeat 
laboratory assessments prior to the subject’s first dose of study drug to co nfirm eligibility.  
Repeat l aboratory tests are permitted to confirm potentially spurious values  or false positive 
results , at the discretion of the Investigator. Repeat analysis results for any laboratory 
assessments that are eligibility criteria should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor 
prior to subject inclusion.  
8.4 Pharmacokinetic  Evaluations  
Samples for PK analysis will be collected as indicated per the SOE   
Investigational Product: QR -110 
Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 49 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects to assess PK parameters of QR -110 ( AUC 0-∞, 
AUC 0-tlast, Cmax, C0, Tmax, T1/2, CL, V d) pre- and post -dosing as indicated per the SOE  
(Appendix  1). T1/2  and  Vd will only be evaluated if measurable serum levels are obtained.  
8.5 Electrocardiogram  
Twelve -lead ECG will be obtained as indicated per the SOE   Electrocardiograms 
should be done in triplicate after the subject has been resting comfortably in a supine position  for 
a minimum of 8 minutes. The mean of triplicate  results will be captured in the  eCRF.  
A repeat of ECGs (in triplicate) is permitted to confirm potentially spurious results, at the 
discretion of the Investigator. Repeat analysis results should be discussed with the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor.  Details on t he conduct of ECGs is provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
8.6 Physical Examination  
Complete and symptom -directed physical examinations (urogenital exams not required)  will be 
performed as indicated per the SOE    
8.7 Height and Weight  
Height will be measured using a calibrated, wall -mounted stadiometer and will be documented as 
indicated per the SOE . Body weight will be measured using a calibrated scale as indicated per 
the SOE    
8.8 Ophthalmic Exams  
Ophthalmic examinations will be performed at all study visits. BCVA will also be assessed at 
specified time  points as indicated per the SOE  . The ophthalmic exam is comprised 
of: BCVA ; anterior segment examination , including grading of anterior chamber inflammation 
according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature ( SUN ) Working Group Grading 
Scheme for Anterior Chamber Flare; IOP;  clinical lens grading using the Age -Related Eye 
Diseases Study (AREDS) Clinical Lens Grading System (ARLNS) ; posterior segment/fundus 
examination  including grading inflammatio n in the vitreous using the  National Institute of Health 
(NIH)  Grading Scale for Vitreous Haze.  
The procedures for ophthalmic exams are outlined in the Study Reference Manual .  
8.9 Optical Coherence Tomography  
Changes in OCT findings are of relevance to the s afety profile of QR -110. Optical Coherence 
Tomography  images will be evaluated for changes in the remaining volume of ONL and foveal 
thickness as safety parameters . All OCT  scans  should be performed in accordance with the 
procedures outlined in the Image A cquisition and Submission Protocol .

Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 50 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 The DMC and Sponsor Medical Monitor should review all OCT scans, with particular attention 
to identifying changes including, remaining volume of ONL, foveal thickness, appearance of 
cystoid macular edema, or macular ede ma as compared to baseline.  
8.10 Leber ’s Congenital Amaurosis Gene tic Analysis  
Genotyping results (either historic or at screening) are required for eligibility. For subjects 
without an acceptable historic genotyping result, genotyping and sequencing of genes a ssociated 
with inherited retinal dystrophies will be performed at Screening . Separate informed consent 
may need  to be obtained per local requirements.  A blood sample for genotyping and gene 
sequencing  should be obtained at the Screening Visit.  
8.11 Biomarkers  
 
 
 and stored for later quantification. In addition, blood 
samples for biomarkers may be collected at any study visit at which inflammation, pain o r 
redness of the eye is present, including any unscheduled visits.   
8.12 Efficacy Assessments   
Subjects must perform  all Screening examinations. If a subject is unable to perform a specific 
assessment at a subsequent visit, this should be recorded in the eCRF and the subject’s ability 
reassessed at the next specified visit. All attempts at performing assessments should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  
Most measures of visual function (BC VA, FST, mobility course,  oculomotor instability, PLR ) 
will be measured a minimum of 2 times prior to the subject’s first dose of study drug to evaluate 
intrasubjec t variability  (Screening and pr edose on Day 1) . Measures of retinal anatomy (infrared 
imaging and OCT) and ERG  will be measured a minimum of 1 time prior to the subject’s first 
dose of study drug. Any predose a ssessment may be  repeated if the results are considered 
unreliable or o f unacceptable quality by the Investigator or if the assessment could not  be 
complete d. In the case of repeat assessments, the measure reflecting the average of the measures 
will be considered the Baseline value.  
If possible, photoreceptor  outer segment layer thickness will be calculated from OCT images as 
an exploratory efficacy parameter.  This assessment will be conducted for those subjects for 
whom high quality imaging to evaluate this parameter can be obtained, as determined by the 
investigator.

 Narratives will be written for all participating subjects on an ongoing basis.  
Exploratory efficacy response criteria will be obtained as indicated per the SOE    
9.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY OR ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
All subjects  who receive study dru g will be assessed for safety.  
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects  who have entered this study 
and for alerting the Sponsor regarding any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unanticipated benef it to the subject . The Investigator is responsible for appropriate 
medical care of subjects  during the study.  
9.1 Data Monitoring  Committee  
An independent  DMC  will provide s afety oversight for the study. A DMC  operational charter 
will be finalized and an initi al organizational meeting held prior to screening of the first subject .  
Once the first 2 adult subject s have been dosed  and safety and tolerability data for at least 
4 weeks post dose are available , the DMC  will review safety  and tolerability  data, and pr ovide 
their recommendation for proceeding to the next dosing cohort, as described in Section  4.2.2  and 
the DMC Charter .

 9.2 Definitions of Adverse Event , Serious Adverse Event, and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Event  
9.2.1 Adverse Event s  
An AE is any  untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
considered drug related  or not . Adverse events can include any  unfavorable, noxious, unintended 
sign, symptom, or disease tempor ally associated with use of a study drug  or other protocol -
imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. Adverse events may be spontaneously reported 
by the subject , discovered by Investigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, 
laboratory test, or other means.  
Adverse event s include:  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by the Investigator to have worsened in severity 
or frequency or changed in character during the protocol -specified AE reporting period  
(as specifi ed in Section  9.4.1 ) 
• Adverse event s not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the 
protocol -specified AE reporting period  (as specified in Section  9.4.1 )  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions ( eg, invasive 
procedures such as IVT injections ) 
• Adverse event s that occur prior to study treatment that are related to a protocol -mandated 
intervention ( eg, invasive procedures such as blood draw s, anesthesia prior to IVT 
injection ) 
9.2.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
An SAE is any AE that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution 
regardless  of the relationship to study drug. An SAE is any AE that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE. This definition implies that the subject, in the view of the 
Investigator, is at immediate risk of death from the event as it oc curred. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Inpatien t hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization, except for hospitalization 
for planned post dose sample collections   
Investigational Product: QR -110 
Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 53 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 • Persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity ( ie, the AE results in substantial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. This serious criterion applies if a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect is diagnosed in a child born to a female subject, or a female partner 
of a male subject exposed to the study drug  
• Other important medical events. Medical and scientific judgment should determine 
whether an AE should be classified as serious in other situations, such as im portant 
medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in the definition above.  
All AEs that do not meet any o f the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious AEs.  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache)  (See Section  9.3.1 ). “Serious” is a regulatory definition 
and is based on subject or event outcome or action criteria usuall y associated with events that 
pose a threat to a subject’s life or vital functions. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs a nd SAEs on the 
AE eCRF and SAE form.  
9.2.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Definition  
An SUSAR is a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction. In order to be qualified as a 
SUSAR, the AE must meet 3 criteria:  the event is serious, there is a c ertain degree of probability 
that the event is a reaction to the study drug  being researched and the nature and severity of the 
reaction are not in agreement with the product information (ie, the reaction is unexpected as per 
the reference safety informati on). All SUSARs will be reported as required to the Competent 
Authorities and to the Ethics Committee  (EC) /Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ) of the 
countries and centers  concerned.

 9.3 Assessment of Adverse Events   
The Investigator is responsible for assessing the severity and causality of A Es. 
9.3.1 Assessment of Severity (Intensity) of Adverse Events  
On the AE eCRF , the Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to 
describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades 
are defined as follows:  
• MILD: Does not interfere with subject's usual function.  
• MODERATE:  Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.  
• SEVERE: Interferes significantly with subject's usual function.  
As described previously in  Section  9.2.2 , note the distinction between the severity and the 
seriousness of AE. A severe event is not necessarily a  serious event.  For example, a headache 
may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified 
as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs , listed above in Section  9.2.2 .

   02-Aug-2018  
 9.3.2 Assessment of the Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will make a ca usality assessment about the relationship of each AE to study 
drug. To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, Investigators should apply 
the following general guideline:  
Not Related:   The AE has an etiology other than the study drug ( eg, preexisting medical 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has 
no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study drug ( eg, cancer diagnosed 
2 days af ter first dose of study drug).  
Possibly Related:   An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug, follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drug, but that could 
readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Probably Relat ed:  An AE that is clearly related to the study drug or its administration (ie, an 
event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention, 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is confirmed by 
improvement on stopping and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure and that could not 
be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state) . 
Definitely Related: The AE is clearly related to the study drug ; a re -challenge confirms the 
association (not required or desirable in some circumstances but provides strong evidence when 
it happens).  
For all AEs and SAEs, Investigators will make separate assessments of causality about the 
relationship of the  event to study drug and to drug administration (ie, IVT  injection ). 
Note:  The Investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process and will be recorded in the subject ’s medical record, AE eCRF, and SA E 
form if applicable. Adverse events recorded without the Investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship to study drug will be followed up until causality is assigned.  
9.3.3 Assessment of the Outcome of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will record the outcome of AEs and SAEs using the following criteria:  
• Recovered/resolved:  The subject  has fully recovered from the event, with no residual 
effects observable.  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The subject  has recovered from the event, but with 
residual seq uelae effects observable.  
• Not recovered/resolved:  Effects of the event are still present.

Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 56 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 • Recovering/resolving:  The subject  has improved, but has not fully recovered from the 
event . 
• Fatal:  The death is related to the event . 
• Unknown:  The outcome of the even t is unknown to the reporter ( eg, subject  was lost to 
follow -up). 
9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the subject’s 
medical record , AE eCRF, and/or SAE form, and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with 
protocol instructions.  
9.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
All significant medical conditions including signs/symptoms of the underlying diagnosis found 
during the screening  period and up to initiation of dosing (Visit 2) will be captured as medical 
history.  Any event/condition related to participation in the study  or study procedures  but not 
related to underlying or concomitant disease  that is  noted after Screening  up to the date of first 
dose will be captured as a non -treatment emergent AE. 
Any event/condition noted once the subject  receives their first dose of study drug will be 
captured as an AE. All AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution will be collected until at least 
90 days following t he last administration of study drug or the subject’s EOS visit , whichever is 
later. At the last scheduled visit, the Investigator should instruct each subject  to report to the 
Investigator any subsequent AEs /SAEs  that the subject ’s personal physician believes could be 
related to prior study treatment.   
Adverse event s and SAEs related to study drug that persist >  90 days after the last study drug  
dose should be followed until resolution or until they return to baseline , stabilize, the subject  is 
lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study drug or participation is not the cause of 
the AE/SAE.  Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the AE eCRF 
and SAE form (if applicable) and in the subject ’s medical recor d to facilitat e source data 
verification. For some SAEs, the Sponsor or its designee may follow up by telephone, facsimile, 
electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to 
appropriately evaluate the SAE repo rt (eg, hospital discharge summary, consultant report, or 
autopsy report).   
9.4.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all subject  evaluation 
time points should be adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
Investigational Product: QR -110 
Protocol No. PQ -110-001 (Version 6.0) 
 
ProQR Therapeutics   Page 57 of 80 
   02-Aug-2018  
 “How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”  
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
Age appropriate non -directive questions should be employed for eliciting AEs from pediatric 
subjects. Non-directive questions may also be used to elicit AEs from parents/caregivers of 
pediatric subjects, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
9.4.3 Recording Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when re cording AEs or SAEs on 
the eCRF and/or SAE form . Colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided . Serious 
adverse events must also be recorded on the AE eCRF . Only one medical concept should be 
recorded in the event field on the AE eCRF and SAE form (if applicable).  
a. Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events ( eg, cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should also be entered as separate AEs. For example, if  severe diarrhea is known to have resulted 
in dehydration, both diarrhea and dehydration should be entered as AEs on the eCRF , and if also 
serious , on the SAE form.  
b. Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between subject  evaluation 
time poi nts. Such events should only be recorded once in the eCRF un less their severity 
increases. If a persistent AE becomes more severe  or occurs more freque ntly, it should be 
recorded again on the AE eCRF  with the increased severity grading .  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject  evaluation time p oints and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded individually on the A E eCRF.  
c. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be recorded as AEs on the  eCRF and 
SAE form  (if applicable) .  
If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term 
should  be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an  elevated serum potassium level of 
7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia” . 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recor ded as AEs on the eCRF and SAE form (if applicable), unless their 
severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.

   02-Aug-2018  
 d. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Secti on 9.4.1 ), 
regardless of attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF and SAE form and reported to the 
Sponsor w ithin 24 hours of event knowledge .  
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be recorded as a single medical concept. For example, if death resulted from respiratory 
failure, the AE recorded shou ld be “Respiratory Failure”, and the outcome of the AE would be 
“Death”.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
record “unexplained death” on the AE eCRF and SAE form.  
e. Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisti ng medical condition is one that is pres ent at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or chara cter of  the condition worsen s during the study. When recording such events on 
an AE eCRF and SAE form (if applicable), it is important to convey the concept that the 
preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors ( eg, “more frequent 
headaches”).  
f. Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as an SAE unless specifically instruct ed otherwise in this protocol.  
g. Pregnanc y 
If a female subject or a female partner of a male subject  becomes pregnant while the female 
subject or the male partner is receiving study drug  or within  6 months after the last dose of study  
drug, a Pregnancy Report form should be completed and faxed to  the Drug Safety designee 
within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy, using the fax numbers listed in the Study 
Reference Manual . 
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, will be reported on a Pregnancy Report form and 
faxed to the Sponsor according to the instructions in the Study Reference Manual . If the abortion 
meets seriousness criteria (see Section  9.2.2 , Serious Adverse Event Definition), this information 
will be captured on the AE eCRF  and SAE form.  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject or to a female partner of 
a male subject  exposed to the study drug  should be recorded and reported as an SAE.

   02-Aug-2018  
 h. Overdose Reporting  
Overdoses must be reported to the Sponsor on an AE eCRF  and an SAE form for tracking 
purposes and will be considered a protocol deviati on. Overdose is defined as any study drug  dose 
administered above the intended dose for the cohort assignment . Additional instructions 
for reporting overdose information will be provided by the Sponsor at the time of notification.  
9.5 Serious Adverse Event s Notification  
For all SAEs, regardless of suspected causality, an SAE form must be completed (or faxed if 
using paper form) within 24  hours of discovery of the event to:  
DRUG SAFETY  
Fax toll free:  See Study Reference Manual  for Fax Number  
Any fatal or life -threatening ( ie, imminent risk of death) event that is attributed by the 
Investigator to the study drug  must be immediately  telephoned to : 
DRUG SAFETY   
Phone toll free: S ee Study Reference Manual  for Phone N umber   
followed by submission of written case details on an SAE form within 24 hours.  
Serious adverse events occurring any time after study participation that are considered 
by the Investigator to be possibly related to stu dy drug must also be reported. The following are 
important points to remember w hen completing the SAE form:  
• If complete information is not available, at a minimum, subject identifier, suspect drug, 
study center identifier, event or outcome, and Investigator assessment of causal 
relationship to study drug should be provided.  
• A rationa le for the causality assessment of an SAE should always be included, so that a 
better understanding of the event can be compiled.  
• Follow -up information, such as laboratory reports, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, 
and information concerning outcome of  the event should be submitted by revising the 
SAE form as soon as the information becomes available. Copies of source documents , 
with subject  identifiers redacted , should be submitted only when they are written in 
English. If source documents are not in English, the Investigator must summarize the 
source documents, providing a complete English narrative that includes a description of 
the events as it evolved , the re sults of all diagnostic procedures performed, treatments

 administered,  and outcome of the event. A query regarding a follow -up report should be 
answered within 5 working days from receipt of the query.  
• Appropriate diagnostic tests and therapeutic measures are to be performed as necessary 
and reported on the SAE form.  
• All SAEs must be reported to the IRB/ EC, if applicable. See the International Council for 
Harmonisation ( ICH) GCP E6, Section  4.11.1  (ICH 1996) . 
9.6 Expedited Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
• The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for notifying the study centers  of all expedited 
SAEs ( ie, 7/15 Day SUSARs) that occur during any clinical studies that are using the 
study drug . The Sponsor or its designee shall also notify Central ECs and Central IRB of 
SUSARs or significant risks to subjects, per country requirements. All SUSARs will be 
repor ted as required to the Competent Authorities of all involved European member 
states.  
• The Investigator will notify local IRB /EC of SUSARs or significant risks to subjects, per 
local country requirements. The Investigator must keep copies of all AE information, 
including correspondence with the Sponsor or local IRB/EC on file.  
• All studies that are conducted within any European c ountry will comply with the 
European Clinical Trial Directive 2005/28/EC , the Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC  
and the Detailed Guidance CT -3 (2011/C 172/01).  
10.0 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
10.1 General Considerations  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP)  specifies the statistical methodology, and table, 
listing and f igure  (TLF) formats for all aspects of the planned analyses. The SAP supports the 
completion of the Clinical Study Report (CSR) for this protocol. As the risk profile of QR -110 in 
humans is unknown and this is a first -in-human trial, all AEs will be considered in determ ining 
the safety profile  of QR -110 unless obviously unrelated. As an early phase clinical study, 
exploratory analyses not necessarily identified in the SAP may be performed to support the 
clinical development program. Any p values that will be calculated according to the analysis plan 
will be interpreted in view of the exploratory nature of the study. Any post -hoc, or unplanned, 
analyses not identified in the SAP will be clearly identified in the CSR, in accordance with 
applicable Standa rd Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the sponsor.

 10.2 Determination of Sample Size  
This is a Phase 1 b/2 safety study designed to evaluate the safety , tolerability and PK  of QR-110. 
The sample size is not based on power calculations. It is chosen based on  clinica l experience  and 
considered to be adequate to fulfil l the objectives of the study.  
Twelve subject s are planned to be enrolled in the study . However, depending upon observed 
results, the DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor  may add subject s as indicated in  Table 3  
(Section  4.2.2.2 ), for a maximum number of subject s up to a total of N=18. The decision to add 
subject s is based on DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor review of safety and tolerability and not 
based on efficacy; hence, exploratory efficacy analyses will not impact the DMC  and Sponsor 
Medical Monitor review of accumulating safety data and the potential for additional subjects 
above 12.  
10.2.1  Randomization and Blinding  
No random ization or blinding is required for this study.  
10.2.2  Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who discontinue from the study without receiving a ny study drug will be replaced. 
Subjects discontinuing the study before the full course of study drug may be replaced by a 
subject who will be assigned the same dose  as the subject being replaced.  The decision for 
replacement will be made by the Sponsor based on available data and perceived need for 
additional data.   
10.3 Analysis of  Populations  
Safety Population : the population for safety analysis will consist of all subjects  who receive any 
QR-110 or pre -medications required for the study.  
Efficacy  Evaluable  Population : the population for efficacy (clinical activity) analysis will consist 
of all subjects  who receive any QR-110 with at least one baseline  and one post baseline  efficacy 
observation or measurement . 
Per Protocol Efficacy Population : this population will cons ist of all subjects in the Efficacy 
Evaluable Population  with the except ion of  subjects with major protocol deviations who will be 
excluded. The list of major protocol deviations for exclusion from this population will be 
completed prior to database lock.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) Population : the population for PK analyses will consist of all subjects  
who receive QR-110 and who have measurable drug concentrations in  blood samples.

 10.4 Subject  Disposition, Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics  
Subject  disposition will be summarized for the  safety population by dose group. The number and 
percentage of subjects  enrolled in each study center will be presented  by geographic region 
(North America and Europe) .  
The number and percentag e of subjects  who receive QR-110 will be tabulated by the number of 
doses and the QR-110 dose group.  
Subject  demographics and baseline  characteristics will be summarized for each dose group  and 
for all subjects combined . Subject  characteristics at baselin e include age, race,  body  weight, and 
height.  Baseline disease characteristics include  ophthalmic examinations, measurements and 
tests, as previously described.   The baseline  data is defined as the data most recently collected  
and/or the average of the measure s (eg, for ophthalmic assessments performed two or more 
times)  prior to the first dose.  
10.5 Treatment Compliance  
All doses are observed and admi nistered by study staff. Treatment compliance will be 
determined by source records documenting treatment observations  and summarized . 
10.6 Safety Analyses  
10.6.1  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an event that was not prese nt prior to 
administration of the first dose of study drug and present after the first dose or if it represents the 
exacerbation of an event that was present prior to the first dose.  
Adverse events  noted during the study will be coded to system organ class es (SOCs) and 
preferred terms (PTs)  using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) 
dictionary. The overall incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by dose group and classified by 
SOC  and PT. Deaths, AE severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug and study 
discontinuation due to AE will also be tabulated by dose group . An AE will be considered drug -
related if the Investigator indicated the event is at least “possibly” related or if the relationship is 
missing. Adverse events with missing  start dates, but with stop dates overlapping into the 
treatment period will be counted as treatment emergent. All AEs will be listed in subject  listing , 
and summarized by numbers  and percent ages of subjects by dose for each portion of the study 
separately . If a subject  reports the occurrence of a particular event more than once, the most 
severe of those events will be included in the summary tables of TEAE s, and the most severe of 
the treatment -related events will be included in the summary table s of TEAEs .

 10.6.2  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will consist of heart rate , blood pressure  and temperature . Descriptive 
summaries (number of subjects , mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) of 
actual values and changes from baseline  will b e presented for each time point . These summaries 
will be presented for the safety population and by dose group.  
10.6.3  Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory measurements (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis) obtained at baseline  and each 
study visit will be summariz ed by dose group  in the following ways:  
• Descriptive statistics of actual results (number of subjects , mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum) for the continuous data and frequencies and 
percentages for the categorical data, for each time po int 
• Descriptive statistics (number of subjects , mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum) of change from baseline  to each time point  
• Shift tables summarizing the frequencies of subjects  below, within and above the normal 
ranges at baseline  and at each time point  
10.6.4  Other Safety Assessments  
Other safety assessments, such as ophthalmic exams, OCT, infrared imaging, ECG s and  physical 
examination s will be summarized and listed as specified in the SAP . 
10.7 Pharmacokinetics Analyses  
To determine the PK profile of IVT injections at the different dose levels of QR-110, the 
following PK parameters will be calculated if sufficient data are available for each dose:  
• AUC 0-∞: Area under the curve to infinity will be calculated based on the last observed 
concentration (Clast (obs) ) using formula: AUC 0-∞=AUC last+Clast(obs)/λz, if feasible.  
• AUC 0-tlast: Area under the curve to the final sample with a concentration greater than 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be calculated based on the last observed 
concentration using the linear trapezoidal method . 
• Cmax, C0: The maximum and minimum serum conce ntrations will be taken directly 
from the data.  
• Tmax: Time to C max will be taken directly from the data.

   02-Aug-2018  
 • T1/2 (if measurable serum levels are obtained) : The terminal elimination half -life will 
be estimated by non -linear regression analysis of the terminal elimination slope, if 
feasible.  
• CL: Serum clearance will be estimated using the formula: CL = Dose/AUC 0-∞. 
• Vd (if measurable serum levels are obtained  and an elimination rate constant (λ z) is 
estimable ): Apparent volume of distribution at  steady state of the drug will be 
determined from trough levels.  
Serum concentration below LL OQ prior to dose for the assay will be set to zero for the PK 
analysis.  For other cases concentrations below LL OQ will be set for non -informative missing. 
Exact procedure for imputation of data will be described in the SAP.  
All samples obtained from all cohorts will be analyzed to avoid bias in data presentation.  
Sparse sampling analysis may be used to miti gate the risk of insufficient data to create individ ual 
profiles.   
Drug concentrations will be summarized by nominal time point if 3 or more values are available. 
Descriptive statistics for PK parameters will be performed if ≥ 50% of subjects have evaluable 
data and number of values to su mmarize is ≥ 3. 
Geometric means and coefficients of variation will be tabulated for C max, C0, AUC 0-tlast, AUC 0-∞, 
CL, and V d for each dose group  if possible . Tmax will be summarized by median, minimum and 
maximum. Mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum will be provide d for T ½. Exact 
details for statistical analysis of PK concentrations and derived PK parameters will be prese nted 
in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan . 
10.8 Efficacy Analyses

of subjects , mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, minimum , maximum  and 95% 
confidence interval s for the mean . Categorical endpoints will be summarized using: number of 
subjects , frequency, percentages and 95% confidence intervals . If data appear highly skewed, 
natural log or other transformation may be used to compute summary statistics.  
Continuous  efficacy endpoints will be summarized and may be analyzed using appropriate 
parametric or nonparametric inference tests.  
Details of the statistical analyses can be reviewed in the SAP. 
10.9 Interim Analysis  
Safety will be assessed prior to each dose escalatio n and prior to the enrollment of pediatric 
subjects by the DMC  and Sponsor Medical Monitor.  Efficacy exploratory reviews  will be  
planned on  a continuous basis .

 10.11  Subgroup Analyses  
Exploratory analyses may be carried out for subgroups based on age, baseline visual acuity and 
other factors identified in the SAP.  
11.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Data Collection and Study Monitoring  
An eCRF w ill be used for this study. Study center personnel will be trained and authorized to use 
the system in compliance with  the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  21CFR Part 11 , 
International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) and local 
regulations,  before recording data on eCRFs. All corrections to eCRFs will be made by 
authorized users, and the changes will be automatically logged in the audit trail of the system  
(time and date stamps and the user entering or updating data) . Electronic CRFs should be 
completed for every subject  screened or enrolled in the study . All subject s screened for the study 
who sign an Informed Consent Form or assent document will be assigned a subject s creening 
number that will be entered in the Screening and Enrollment Log. The subject s creening number 
will be a unique  4-digit subject identifier : a 2-digit site number and a consecutive 2 -digit subject 
screening number. This number will be used for the d uration of their participation in the study. 
The subject screening number cannot be re -used if a subject withdraws consent or is a screen 
fail. At the study’s conclusion, a Portable Document  Format file will be created for each study 
center containing thei r subjects ’ data submitted on eCRFs. In the event of an audit or regulatory 
authority inspection, copies of the eCRFs will be printed. The  Investigator will ensure that the 
eCRFs are accurate, complete, and completed in a timely fashion. The Investigator w ill ensure 
that source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
transcribed on the eCRFs are  retained according to storage guidelines ( Section  13.4). Separate 
source records are require d to support all eCRF entries. The eCRF is not to be used to document 
data without prior written or electronic records.  
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects  and study centers , a clinical data 
management review will be performed on subject  data. During this review, subject  data will be 
checked for consistency, omissions, a nd any apparent discrepancies. In addition, the data will be 
reviewed for adhe rence to the protocol and  ICH GCP. To resolve any questions arising from the 
clinical data management review process, data que ries will be sent to the study center . 
Corrections or updates to the data resulting from queries should be ma de on th e eCRF. All 
changes will be automatically documented in the software’s audit trail, including the reason for 
change.  
The Investigator will  electronically  sign and date the  indicated places on the eCRF. These 
signatures will indicate that the Investigator i nspected or reviewed the data on the eCRF and 
agrees with the content.

 A Sponsor representative (monitor) will contact the Investigator(s) at periodic intervals by 
telephone or on-site visit for the purpose of monitoring the facilities and assessing the pr ogress 
of the study. Electronic CRFs  and subject  records will be reviewed at on -site visits at regular 
intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulatio ns on the conduct of clinical research. 
The monitor should have access to subject  medical records and other study -related records 
needed to verify the entries on the eCRF.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected 
during  these monitoring visits, including delays in completing eCRF s, are resolved.  
Monitoring of study center facilities ( eg, pharmacy, drug storage areas, laborato ries) and review 
of study -related records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the 
protocol, ICH GCP, and appli cable regulatory requirements. Study drug dispensing and 
accountability will also be assessed.  
11.2 Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor , a regulatory authority, or an IRB/EC may perform 
audits or inspections at the study center , including source data verification. The purpose of an 
audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all  study -related activities and 
documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The Investigator will conta ct the Sponsor  immediately if contacted by a regulatory 
agency about an inspection at the study center .

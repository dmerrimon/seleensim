  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
  
Patient with pediatric sarcoma who have limited metastases are still potentially curable with 
aggressive local therapy. However, conventional moderate dose radiation is unlikely to provide 
durable local control. Given the recent technologic advances in rad iation delivery, it is now 
possible to deliver tumoricidal doses, using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) over a short 
time course with highly focal techniques. Stereotactic radiation has proven efficacious in the 
intracranial setting and in multiple e xtracranial sites in adults. It has not yet been well studied in 
the pediatrics population where there is a particularly strong rationale due to the ablative doses 
that can be delivered to tumor while simultaneously reducing high dose to normal tissues. Th e 
proposed trial is a single arm phase II study to determine the efficacy of SBRT in pediatric 
sarcomas with surgically unresectable metastatic disease. Metastatic sites eligible for treatment 
in this study include bony sites of disease. SBRT will be deliv ered to each eligible site to a total 
dose of 4000 cGy delivered in 5 fractions of 800 cGy per fractions each day. Following 
completion of SBRT, patients will undergo treatment response assessment with the use of 
diagnostic imaging, clinical examination, a nd completion of the Brief Pain Inventory to assess 
quality of life. The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of SBRT 
delivered to a dose of 4000 cGy in 5 fractions of 800 cGy each for patients greater than 3 years 
of age and < 40 years of age with metastatic disease of bone secondary to pediatric sarcoma. The 
secondary objectives of this study include describing the toxicity of SBRT with this regimen;  
assessing clinical response rate of each target lesion;  assessing long -term clinic al outcomes; and 
assessing  quality of life following completion of treatment.  For patients with potentially curable 
oligometastatic disease, surgical resection in conjunction with systemic therapy remains the 
standard of care. Patients on this study will be able to receive chemotherapy 2 weeks after 
completion of SBRT. Issues that may limit participation include our inability to assess late 
effects that may not develop till at least 10 years after therapy. For this reason, we will limit the 
population in t his study to patients who are surgically unresectable and would be otherwise 
incurable with current standard systemic therapies.

2. BACKGROUND  
  
 
  
  2.1 Oligometastatic Disease   
  
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, primarily due to an inability 
to control metastatic disease. The metastatic capacity of cancers behaves along a spectrum of 
disease progression, such that some tumors have spread widely befo re clinical detectability 
and others never metastasize. Contained within this spectrum, is an oligometastatic state 
where metastases are limited in number and location. The presence of an oligometastatic 
state was originally proposed by Hellman who suggest ed that these oligometastatic patients 
would benefit from effective local therapy in addition to systemic therapy (1). In agreement 
with this hypothesis, surgery and chemotherapy for isolated pulmonary metastases can result 
in long term disease -free period s (2). Additionally, some 25% of patients following resection 
and chemotherapy for colorectal cancer and isolated liver metastases can similarly have 
longterm disease free survival (3 -5). Patients who may benefit most from curative therapy 
are most likely those patients with limited systemic disease when metastatic disease is 
generally confined to a lesion state of five metastatic sites or fewer.   
  
2.2 Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)  
The treatment of metastases depends on multiple factors including  1) the location of the 
primary tumor, 2) the presence or absence of other metastatic foci, 3) the size, number and 
location of metastases, 4) the effectiveness of various forms of therapy, and 5) the patient’s 
functional status.  Conventional moderate dos e radiation for metastatic disease is given 
primarily for palliation. Recent advances in radiation delivery now make it possible to image 
and treat precisely within any anatomical region of the body. As a result, the capacity to 
deliver tumoricidal doses i n a single or few (1 -10) outpatient treatments is now possible. In 
addition, by minimizing the irradiation of surrounding healthy tissue, it should also be 
possible to decrease the rate of complications. Intracranial stereotactic radiation therapy has 
been  shown to be a highly effective treatment for brain metastases in both the adult and 
pediatrics population (6,7). This suggests that selective small extracranial tumors may be 
effectively controlled by similar focal high -dose stereotactic body radiotherapy  (SBRT). 
Local control in excess of 75% has been reported using extracranial SBRT for metastatic 
tumors of the spine, lung and liver, which is significantly higher than conventional moderate 
dose radiation (8 -24). Toxicity has been minimal in these reports  despite the use of very high 
biological equivalent doses (8 -24).   
  
2.3 Rationale  
  
    The SBRT literature focuses on clinical outcomes in the adult population. However, SBRT   
 has a particularly strong rationale for application in pediatrics given th at high biologically  
effective doses have been shown to increase control in histologies, such as sarcoma, which    are 
common in the pediatrics population (11,25). With stereotactic radiation therapy        
      techniques, a reduction in normal tissue d ose surrounding the target lesion of interest may  
also be accomplished resulting in lower toxicity. Given that pediatric patients with sarcomas,  
presenting with limited metastases  in lung and bone, are still considered to be a curable       
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
8  population w ith aggressive local therapy, SBRT could have a significant impact on outcomes  
in oligometastatic patients who may be otherwise unresectable (25 -28).

to the Coordinating Center:  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
10  • Signed patient consent form  
• HIPAA authorization form  
• Completed and signed eligibility checklist  
• De-identified copies of source documentation verifying eligibility  
  
The Coordinating Center will review the documents to confirm eligibility. To complete 
the registration process, the Coordinating Center will:  
• assign a patient study number  
• register the patient on the study with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer 
Center’s Clinical Research Office   
• fax or e -mail the patient study number to the participating site  
  
  
 5.  TREATMENT PLAN  
  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Expected toxicities and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 
6. No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below 
may be administered with the intent to treat the patient’s malignancy  concurrently.  
  
   5.1   Pre-Treatment P rocedures  
  
The following will be completed prior to radiation initiation:  
• Medical history and clinical examination  
• Pathologic confirmation of malignancy  
• CBC, chemistry panel   
• CT of treatment site (not required if MRI is obtained)  
• MRI of treatment site, optional depending on site (required for spinal  
lesions)  
• Positron Emission Tomography (FDG -PET) scan (optional)  
    
   5.2   Simulation  
  
Stereotactic radiation requires meticulous definition of the target, normal tissue 
structures, and visualization for localization during treatment delivery. Prior to 
treatment, a simulation CT scan will be performed for tumor localization using 
rigid immob ilization appropriate for stereotactic treatment. A separate FDG -
PETCT or MRI is optional for diagnostic purposes  and can be used for treatment 
planning with fusion -- this study would be done  identically if the patient were 
having standard fractionated radiation. These studies can assist with delineation 
of the target and visualization for stereotactic treatment. While MRIs are optional 
for diagnostic evaluation and treatment planning of non -spine bony sites, they are 
required for patients who will be tr eated to the spine.   
  
 
  
  Patients will be positioned in a reproducible treatment position with an 
appropriate immobilization device custom -made for each patient and specific to 
treatment site. A variety of immobilization systems can be used on study such as  
stereotactic frames which surround the patient on three sides or large rigid pillows 
that reference to a stereotactic coordinate system.   
  
CT simulation will be performed. The simulation study must include the target 
and all organs at risk for treatment  planning. Simulation scan length should be 
510 cm superior and inferior to the target. All organs at risk within the scan length 
should be contoured for dose -volume histogram analysis. For stereotactic 
treatment, tomographic slice thickness of 1 -3 mm thro ugh the target is 
recommended.   
  
Special consideration should be given to the analysis of internal organ motion if 
the target lesion is located in a site subject to motion such as the chest wall. 
Techniques to image moving targets such as active breath -hold techniques, 
accelerator gating with respiratory cycle, tumor tracking, 4D CT scan acquisition 
in conjunction with maximum intensity projection (MIP), will be considered 
acceptable maneuvers to account for organ motion. If the target cannot be 
visualize d or localized on the planning imaging modality as a result of motion or 
metal artifact, stereotactic treatment should not be used.      
  
The treating radiation oncologist will identify the location of the tumor.  Gross 
tumor volume (GTV) delineation will  be performed with a diagnostic radiologist 
on sequential axial computed tomography images. A radiosurgical treatment plan 
will be developed based on tumor geometry and location. Adjacent normal 
structures including but not limited to the heart, esophagus,  aorta, spinal cord, 
kidneys, rectum, bowel, liver, and stomach within 5 cm of the GTV will be 
identified for the purpose of limiting incidental radiation to these structures 
(please see Appendix D for a list of normal tissue dose constraints to be used on  
protocol as well as constraints for high and low -dose spillage).  
We plan to deliver 800 cGy at each fraction for five fractions every day for a total   
            dose of 4000 cGy, over a treatment duration at a maximum of 2 weeks. For 
bony          sites aside from spine, the GTV will be expanded uniformly to 
the PTV by 2 mm          and treated to 4000 cGy to cover at least 90% of 
the defined target volume. For          patients with spinal metastases 
undergoing treatment          on protocol, the vert ebral body will be 
contoured as a separate clinical target             volume (CTV) encompassing the GTV. 
The CTV vertebral body will be          expanded by 2 mm to create a 
PTV. The GTV will be treated to 4000 cGy and the          PTV treated to 
3000 cGy  in 5 fractions..   
  
        The main criteria for dose prescription will be the achievement of the spinal 
cord                      dose constraint (see table below):  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018

Normal 
Tissue  Volume  Volume

<1.2 cc  1550cGy   
1000cGy   2000cGy (400cGy  
/fx)  Myelitis  
  
The spinal cord will be contoured as the true cord with use of MRI for fusion.       
Spinal cord volume will be defined as 6 mm above and below the radiosurgery target 
volume.  The spinal cord can move within the thecal sac.  The thecal sac will be 
contoured based on T2 MRI or bony limit of spinal canal and will serve as a PRV 
(planning org an at risk volume) for the spinal cord. Thecal sac volume will be defined 
as 6 mm above and below the radiosurgery target volume.  The skin will be defined as 
the outer 0.5 cm of the body surface. The skin is essentially a rind of 0.5 cm 
enveloping the enti re body in axial planes. The cranial and caudal surface of the 
superior and inferior limits of the planning CT should not be contoured as skin unless 
skin is actually present in these locations. Ribs within 5 cm of the PTV should be 
contoured by outlining bone and bone marrow. The intercostal spaces should not be 
included as part of the ribs.  The minimum, mean, and maximum dose to the PTV will 
be reported. Only < 1 cc or < 1-5% of unspecified tissue outside of the PTV can 
receive > 100-110% of the prescribed dose.   
  
   5.3  SBRT Treatment Delivery  
  
All patients should receive 5 fractions of 800 cGy over a five -day period (See Section 
6 for dose modification). Ideally all 5 fractions should be delivered Monday through 
Friday, however it may be delivered over two weeks.  
  
Within three weeks of the initial treatment planning imaging study, SBRT will be 
administered using image -guidance. This protocol allows conventional linear 
accelerators and specialized linear accelerators with image guidance (e.g. Novalis, 
Trilogy, Synergy, Artiste) capable of conformal dose delivery and IMRT. Specialized 
accelerators (e.g. Cyberknife or Tomotherapy) are also allowed.   
  
During treatment, real time cone beam CT images of the patient’s body site of in terest 
will be obtained. Cone beam CT scan will be obtained immediately prior to treatment 
and will be repeated until the treatment shift, required to align the CT planning scan 
and the cone beam CT scan performed on the day of treatment, is within 2 mm.    
  
Anesthesia or sedation may be required in certain patients, such as very young 
patients, to prevent movement during simulation and daily treatments. Anesthesia will 
be delivered by a dedicated pediatric anesthesiologist.  
  
 5.4  General Concomitant Me dication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
  
 
  
  There are no known potential interactions between SBRT and concomitant 
medications.  
  
 5.5  Duration of Therapy  
  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
for 2 weeks or until one of the following criteria applies:  
    
• Disease progression,  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Patient or parent/guardian (for minors) decides to withdraw from the study, or  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
  
 5.6   Post-SBRT Follow -up  
  
Subsequent to SBRT, patients will be monitored as follows: 5.6.1 
 4 Weeks  Post-SBRT  
 5.6.2  At 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months Post -SBRT  
  
 5.7   Duration of Follow -Up  
  
It is anticipated the patients that remain on -study will be followed for 3 years.  
Patients will remain enrolled on this protocol until there is evidence that their disease 
has progressed either locally or distally, at which case they will be removed from the 
protocol and be followed for survival only.  Patients removed from study for 
unacceptable adverse events will be followed per protocol until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event and then followed for survival only.  
  
 5.8  Criteria for Removal from Study  
  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria lis ted in Section 5.5 
applies.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be 
documented in the Case Report Form.  
  
  
 6.  DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
In young children less than 10 years of age where the study dose is not considered safe to 
deliver as a result of the radiation dose that will be delivered to surrounding normal tissues, a 
dose of 3500 cGy delivered in 700 cGy fractions in 5 fractions every day to the GTV, will be 
allowed as a presc ription dose. A dose modification may be made at the discretion of the 
treating physician but the Principal Investigator must be informed and approve this change.

 7.  ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
  
   7.1  Adverse Events and Pote ntial Risks  
  
Because patients are receiving standard treatments, which are not part of this study, 
their treating physician will be counseling them on the risk of their treatments, 
including the risk of surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, wh ichever is 
appropriate for the type and the stage of their cancer. Clinically significant toxicities 
in the study will include Grade 3, 4, and 5 non hematologic toxicities. The procedures 
related to the study are phlebotomy, CT imaging, MRI imaging, and SB RT. 
Recording and reporting requirements are discussed in Section 7.3.  
  
Risks associated with blood draw:  
Phlebotomy can cause pain, bleeding, and rare needle site infection. CT imaging 
results in low dose radiation exposure, which has an extremely smal l risk of causing a 
secondary cancer.   
    
Risks associated with SBRT:  
It is difficult at this time to predict with confidence the complication rate from the 
proposed SBRT. However, it is reasonable to extrapolate from the current experience 
with SBRT to  the spine, lung and pancreas in adults.    
  
Toxicities commonly associated with such treatment will depend on the location of 
the treated metastasis. These toxicities can include skin erythema and desquamation, 
pain, neuropathy, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss.  Some of 
these symptoms can also be due to tumor progression. One significant toxicity is 
radiation pneumonitis, which can be manifested as fever, increased excertional 
dypsnea, pleuritic chest pain, and peritumoral infiltrate on chest imaging.  It generally 
occurs betwe en 1 to 3 months of completion of radiotherapy.  The risk of grade 2 -4 
radiation pneumonitis is aproximately 10 -15% in patients treated with standard 
fractionated large field radiotherapy and higher in patients treated with combined 
chemoradiotherapy.  It is highly dependent on the volume of the lung treated to high 
dose and the mean lung dose.  At this point, the incidence of RT pneumonitis from 
stereotactic radiosurgery for small pulmonary tumors is unknown.  However, if the 
treated tumor volume is kept ≤  65 cc, the risk should be < 10 -15% with the proposed 
dose level. Also, given that this protocol focuses on SBRT to bone and spine, rather 
than lung, the risk of pneumonitis is expected to be low. Fracture is also a potential 
risk of radiotherapy to bone a nd spine, although doses in this study will be lower than 
the radiosurgery doses thought to put patients at high risk for fracture as reported in 
the literature (29).   
    
Growth delay or arrest is a potential late effect of radiotherapy to bone for child ren 
who have not completed puberty. For this reason, patients in this protocol are limited 
 
  
  to those who have surgically unresectable disease or to those patients whose families 
refuse surgery. Given the data that demonstrates the improvement in clinical 
outcomes associated with aggressive local therapy in properly selected metastatic 
patients, the potential benefit of delivering a therapeutic dose of radiation likely 
outweighs the risks. The alternative treatment in this scenario is the delivery of 
subthera peutic doses of radiation with palliative rather than curative intent.  
  
Clinical and radiographic assessments will be performed as indicated to identify all 
adverse effects, ascertain their etiology, and provide the most appropriate palliative 
measures.  Complications other than radiation pneumonitis, if any, will be graded 
according to the CTCAE version 4.0  
  
   7.2  Definitions  
  
   7.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience t hat develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of 
study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not 
considered to be related to the study.   
  
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further 
diagnostic tests.  
  
   7.2.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that:   
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e ., it does not 
include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it 
occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalizatio n beyond the 
expected length of stay). Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to 
study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the person was enroll ed in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than 
planned).  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
16  • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of  a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or th e 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
  
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious 
criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• respite care  
    
 7.2.3  Expectedness  
  
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'   
  
   7.2.3.1 Expected adverse event  
  
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this  study, 
an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Inve stigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is 
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.     
  
Refer to Section 7.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated 
with the study agent(s).  
  
   7.2.3.2 Unexpected adverse event  
    
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information 
provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, 
the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent 
document as a potential risk.    
  
 
  
     7.2.4  Attribution  
  
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.   
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
  
 7.3  Recording and Reporting of Adverse Even ts  
  
Participating investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all participant 
evaluation time points during the study.   
  
All AEs and SAEs whether reported by the participant, discovered during questioning, 
directly observed, or detected by physical examination, laboratory test or other means, 
will be recorded in the participant’s medical record.  Low grade toxicities are to be 
expected given the disease profile. Any toxicity below CTCAE v4.0 grade 3 will not be 
reported on the Master AE Log or Case Report Forms. However, this information will 
be monitored and retained in patient charts.   
  
Hematologic toxicity will be assessed an d monitored but not reported.  
  
Hospitalization events occur within this patient population. Hospitalizations that occur 
greater than 30 days from completion of SBRT and that are not attributable to research 
intervention will be recorded on the Master AE Log and reported at the time of 
continuing review and SMC monitoring.  
  
These parameters are drafted in accordance with CFR21, though provide realistic 
expectations based on the sickness of this patient population.  
  
The descriptions and grading scales f ound in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  
A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be dow nloaded from the CTEP website at:  
 http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolD evelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .   
    
     7.3.1  Reporting Requirements  
  
 7.3.1.1  Adverse Events Reports  
  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
18  The Coordinating Center is the central location for the collection and 
maintenance of documentation of adverse events and is responsible for 
submitting adverse event reports to the Protocol Chair promptly.  The 
Coordinating Center will maintain documentati on of all adverse event reports 
for each participating site.  Adverse event reports submitted to the 
Coordinating Center must be signed and dated by the participating site’s 
Principal Investigator.  The Coordinating Center will provide appropriate 
forms to  be used by all participating sites for reporting adverse events.   
Information to be provided must include:  
• Subject ID number, and initials  
• Date of the event  
• Description of the event  
• Description of site's response to the event  
• Assessment of the subje ct's condition  
• Subject's status on the study (on study, off study, etc.)  
• Attribution of event to study treatment  
  
 7.3.1.2  Participating Sites  
  
Participating sites are responsible for reporting adverse events to their IRB 
according to its specific r equirements and to the Coordinating Center as 
follows:  
  
Fatal Events  whether anticipated or unanticipated, and whether or not related 
to the study must be reported to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours  of 
the participating site Principal Investigator's learning of the event.  
  
Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Events  as defined above must be 
reported to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours  of the participating site 
Principal Investigator's learning o f the event.   
  
Other Serious Adverse Events  which may result in a change to the protocol, 
informed consent, or risk to subjects as specified in the protocol must be 
reported within three (3) working days  of the participating site Principal 
Investigator's  learning of the event.   
  
Adverse Events which result in no change to protocol, informed consent, or 
risk to subjects must be reported to the Coordinating Center on a monthly 
basis.   
  
Adverse event reports are to be faxed or e -mailed to the Coordinatin g Center 
Study Coordinator. Follow -up reports are faxed, mailed, or sent electronically 
to the Coordinating Center as necessary.  
  
 
  
  The investigator must also report follow -up information about SAEs within 
the same time frames.  
  
If a non -serious AE becom es serious, this and other relevant follow -up 
information must also be provided within the same time frames described 
above.  
  
All SAEs must be collected whether or not they are considered causally 
related to the investigational product.  Investigators an d other site personnel 
are responsible for reporting all casually related SAEs to their IRB and the 
Protocol Chair.

J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
22   9.  MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 9.1  Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response 4 weeks 
after the initial treatment, every 3 months for the first year, and every 6 months for 
the second and third year.    
  
     9.1.1  Definitions   
  
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the t ime of 
their first treatment with SBRT.  
  
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have completed all fractions of SBRT, and have had 
their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These 
patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated 
below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end 
of SBRT will also be considered  evaluable.) Evaluable patients will also be those 
who received the protocol -specified dose.   
  
   9.1.2  Disease Parameters   
  
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be  
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longes t diameter to be recorded) as 
>10 mm with diagnostic techniques (CT, FDG -PET/CT, or MRI). All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).   
  
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), in cluding small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm with diagnostic techniques), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal 
masses (n ot followed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
  
Target lesions.   Target lesions in this study will be considered metastatic sites up 
to a maximum of 5 lesions per patient. They should be recorded and measured at 
baseline. Target le sions should be larger than 10 mm in the smallest 
crosssectional diameter on CT or MRI and/or any lesion that shows increase 
metabolic uptake on FDG -PET/CT scans.   
  
Non-target lesions .  N/A  
  
   9.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
 23  
    
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to 
the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of 
the treatment .  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when 
both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
  
Conventional CT, FDG -PET/CT, and MRI  These techniques should be performed 
with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT should be 
performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconst ruction algorithm.  This applies to 
tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of 
extremities usually require specific protocols.  
  
   9.1.4  Response Criteria  
  
9.1.4.1 Response Assessment of Bone Metastases  
  
Radiographi c assessment of bone metastasis can be difficult as remodeling bone 
may lead to residual abnormalities on bone scan, CT scan, and MRI scan. This 
leads to inherent difficulties in using RECIST 1.1 criteria for response 
assessment. For the purposes of the cu rrent protocol, response at bone metastasis 
will be graded as follows:  
  
Complete response (CR)  = A negative FDG -PET at the irradiated lesion in 
patients who have a positive FDG -PET at the time of SBRT at the target lesion. 
FDG -PET is optional on study. T herefore, CR will be recorded but not required to 
constitute a response.  
  
Progressive disease (PD)  = Any of the following will constitute PD:  
  
• Development of a new soft tissue mass > 1 cm in maximum axial dimension at 
a previous site of bone metastasis without a soft tissue component or with a soft 
tissue component < 1 cm in maximum axial dimension on previous evaluations.  
  
• For bone metastasis with a soft tissue component > 1 cm in m aximum axial 
dimension on previous evaluations, an increase in the longest axial diameter of 
the soft tissue component by > 20%.   
  
• A previous bone metastasis that was positive on FDG -PET, became negative 
with protocol therapy, and then becomes positive a gain should prompt concern 
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
 24  
  for progression at that site. Confirmatory testing is required to document 
progression at a previous site of bone metastasis. Together with return of FDG -
PET uptake, MRI scan with documentation of an enhancing bone lesion will 
constitute adequate evidence to support progression at that site. Biopsy is 
strongly encouraged, but not required to confirm progression at a previous site 
of bone metastasis.   
  
• Biopsy evidence of viable sarcoma at a previously radiated bone metastasis.  
Stable disease (SD)  = Patients not meeting either CR or PD criteria.  
  
   9.1.4.2  Evaluation of Best Overall Response   
  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as  reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started).  Best overall response will be based on the overall 
response of the target lesions.  
  
   9.1.5  Duration of Response  
  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.   
  
   9.1.6  Clinical Response Parameters  
  
Progression -free survival (PFS)  is defined is the time from starting treatment to 
the time of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first. Death is considered as an event here. For subjects whose 
disease does not pr ogress or who do not die, PFS will be censored at the time of 
the last visit.   
Time to progression (TTP)  is defined as the time from starting treatment to the 
time of first documented tumor progression. Subjects who do not progress will be 
censored at the time of the last contact. In addition, death from any cause will also 
be censored.    
Overall survival (OS)  is defined as the time from starting treatment until death 
due to any cause. For subjects who do not die, time to death will be censored at 
the time  of last contact.  
Local Control (LC)  is defined as the time from starting treatment until local 
relapse is documented. The target lesion will be considered locally controlled if 
criteria for progression are not met, taking as reference the smallest measur ements 
recorded since the treatment started.

11.  DATA SAFETY MONITORING  
  
   11.1   Monitoring Plan  
  
This is a Level I  study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan.  Data Monitoring 
of this protocol will occur on a regular basis with the frequency dependent on the rate of 
subject accrual and the progress of the study.  The protocol will be monitored internally 
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
 26  
  at SKCC C by Matthew Ladra, MD and externally by the SKCCC CRO in accordance 
with SKCCC guidelines.  Trial monitoring and reporting will be done through the Safety 
Monitoring Committee at SKCCC.  
  
Authorized representatives of the Coordinating Center may visit pa rticipating sites to 
perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of these 
audits or inspections is to systematically and independently examine all trial related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activit ies were conducted and data 
were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
  
11.2 Stopping Rules  
  
The study will enroll 20 patients and toxicity will be monitored continuously throughout. 
Any Grade 5 toxicity that is possibly related to radiation will suspend accrual until the 
study chair reviews the case. The criteria for severe adverse events to be considered 
clinically significant toxicities are pres ented in Section 7.1. We established a safety 
monitoring rule that will recommend stopping the study if there appears to be high 
probability that the adverse event (AE) rate is convincingly above 30%. Specifically, if 
the posterior probability of the AE ra te exceeding 30% is 65% or greater, we will 
consider stopping the study for safety consultation. The prior distribution for the risk of 
AE is beta (0.5, 3.5), representing our prior guess at the AE rate is 12.5% on average and 
there is 90% certainty that i t is between 0.05% and 45%. The stopping rules and 
corresponding operating characteristics based on 5000 simulations are shown in the 
tables below.

 13.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
  
 13.1   Study Design/Endpoints  
  
13.1.1 Definition of primary outcome/endpoint  
  
The efficacy of SBRT delivered with a dose of 4000 cGy in 5 fractions on 800 cGy each 
to pediatric nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma patients who are 
greater than 3 years of age and < 40 years of age with metastatic disease will be 
determined by measuring local control at 6 months.   
  
13.1.2 Analysis plan for primary e ndpoint  
  
The primary endpoint of this study will be local control at 6 months of the patient treated  
with SBRT. Given the inherent difficulties in defining response in bony lesions after 
radiotherapy by RECIST 1.1 criteria, local control at the radiated  site will be defined as 
the absence of progression of disease as defined in Section 9.1.4.1.  Thus, CR and SD 
will constitute local control. Local control assessment will start at one month following 
completion of protocol treatment and continuous assessm ent will be pursued during the 
follow -up period. The reference response probability for comparison will be 70%. This is 
based on the study by Kepka et al. (31)  
  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
 30  
   13.2  Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
  
The primary endpoint of this trial is to  estimate the loca l control of SBRT at 6 months.  
We anticipate that the local control rate will be roughly 90% as opposed to a 70% 
historical response with conventional moderate dose radiation. With 20 subjects 
participated, we will be able to estimate the local control ra te to within 20% (i.e., 
maximum width of the 90% confidence interval reached is when the observed rate is 
50%). If we observe a 6 -month local control rate of 90%, we will be 90% certain that the 
true rate is greater than 70%. The associated exact 90% confi dence interval will be (0.72, 
0.98).     
  
Using a Simon optimal two -stage design with a type I error of 10% and a type II error of 
20%, the first stage would consist of 6 patients. A responder is considered to have local 
disease control at 6 months. If 4 or fewer patients respond, the study would terminate 
after the first stage.  Otherwise, accrual would continue to a total of 20 patients. If 17 or 
more patients respond at the end of the second stage, the regimen with SBRT is 
considered promising (i.e ., local control at 6 months is greater than 70%).  This design 
has a 58% chance of early stopping when the true probability of response is 70% (the null 
hypothesis) and 11% chance of early stopping when the true probability of response is 
90%.  
  
The goal  of enrollment is 20 patients. Based on the current institutional referral base, we 
expect that 12 patients will be eligible each year. Of these patients, we expect that two 
thirds will enroll on protocol. With this projection, we plan to complete accrual to the 
study in 3 years.    
  
The proportion of patients with local control at six months will be reported with an exact 
binomial 90% confidence interval.  
  
 13.3   Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
  
13.3.1 Definition of secondary outcomes/endpoints:  
• To describe the toxicity of SBRT delivered to a dose of 4000 cGy in 5 fractions of  
800 cGy each for the population enrolled using grading with CTCAE v. 4.0  
• The clinical response rate of each lesion will be assessed by serial CT assessment 
(FDG -PET/CT is opt ional for assessment) and defined by criteria as defined 
above. The absence of progression will constitute a response. Therefore, 
lesionspecific CR or SD will be measured as a response.   
• To assess long -term clinical outcomes of this patient population aft er completion 
of SBRT by measuring relapse -free survival and overall survival. Relapse -free 
survival will be measured from time of enrollment to date of disease progression 
or death. Patients who are lost to follow -up will be censored for determination of 
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
 31  
  progression -free survival on the date of their last evaluation. Overall survival is 
defined as time from enrollment to death due to any cause.   
• To assess quality of life following completion of SBRT using pre - and post -SBRT 
completion of the Brief Pain In ventory form and 10 point Visual Analog Scale 
which will be filled out by the patient at the treatment response intervals outlined 
above.    
  
13.3.2  Analysis plan for secondary endpoints:  
• Toxicities will be graded and tabulated at the time of each follow -up assessment.  
The proportion of toxicities by type and grade will be reported with exact 95% 
confidence intervals.  
• Each metastatic lesion will be considered a target lesion and independently 
evaluated for response. The proportion of these lesions that have a stable or better 
response and the intra -cluster correlation will be estimated with an intercept only 
generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression.  This will be estimated directly 
with SAS Genmod by specifying binomial variation, the identity li nk function, 
and an exchangeable correlation structure.   
• Hazard rate estimates and 95% confidence intervals as well as Kaplan -Meier 
(KM) estimates will be used to summarize survival (OS), progression free 
survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and loco regional control (LRC) 
functions over time.  The median OS, PFS, TTP and LRC will be reported.  Cox 
proportional hazards models will be used to evaluate the impact of key covariates 
on these endpoints as the sample size permits.    
• Quality of life will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory form and 10 point 
Visual Analog Scale.  An overall score will be calculated pre -treatment and at the 
time of the 2nd radiologic reassessment. The change in score will be evaluated 
with a Wilcoxon signed -rank test.      
  
13.4 Reporting and Exclusions  
  
13.4.1 Evaluation of toxicity.  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the 
time of their first treatment with SBRT.  
  
13.4.2 Evaluation of response.   All patients included in the study must be assessed 
for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment 
deviations.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) 
complete response, 2) stable disease, 3) progressive d isease, 4) early death 
from malignant disease (defined as death prior to first evaluation after 
completion of SBRT), 5) early death from toxicity, 6) early death because of 
other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
arbitra ry convention, category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of 
any type of data in a clinical database.]  
  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
 32  
  All of the patients who were enrolled on the trial should be included in the 
main analysis of local control.    
  
All conclusions should be ba sed on all enrolled subjects. Sub -analyses may 
then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for 
whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to 
other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, majo r protocol violations, 
etc.).  However, these sub -analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing 
conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding 
patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.  The reason for 
performing sub set analyses would be to generate hypotheses for future 
prospective clinical trials.

Guidelines for Spillage   
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
–  
 40  
    
High Dose Spillage:  
1. Any dose > 105% of the prescription dose should occur primarily within the PTV itself and not 
within the normal tissues outside the PTV. Therefore, the cumulative volume of all tissue outside 
the PTV receiving a dose > 105% of prescription dose should not be more than 15% of the PTV 
volume.  
2. Conformality of PTV coverage will be j udged such that the ratio of the volume of the prescription 
isodose meeting criteria 1 through 4 to the volume of the PTV is ideally < 1.2 (see table below). 
These criteria will not be required to be met in treating very small tumors (< 2.5 cm axial GTV 
dimension or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV dimension) in which the required minimum field size of 
3.5 cm results in the inability to meet a conformality ratio of 1.2.  
  
Low Dose Spillage  
  
1. The falloff gradient beyond the PTV extending into normal tissue structures must be rapid in all 
directions and meet the following criteria:  
a. The maximum total dose over all fractions in Gray (Gy) to any point 2 cm or greater away from 
the PTV in any direction must be no greater than D2cm where D2cm is given by the t able below.

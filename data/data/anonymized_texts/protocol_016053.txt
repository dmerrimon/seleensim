 Page 4 of 16 Revised: September 30, 2017 2.0  Objectives* 
 
The primary objective is to test the effect of  an individualized exercise oncology program 
on healthcare utilization, 30 -day hospital readmission, pain, and cancer treatment 
tolerance.  
H1: Among women newly diagnosed with stage 0, 1 or 2 breast cancer, those 
enrolled in an individualized exercise onc ology program will have fewer 
emergency room (ER) visits, fewer hospital encounters, fewer 30-day hospital 
readmissions, fewer breaks in cancer treatment, less pain, and better cancer 
treatment tolerance than those in the control group  over 3 months.  
The secondary objective is to examine the feasibility of an individualized exercise 
oncology program via adherence and attrition rates.  
H2: Among women  newly diagnosed with stage 0, 1 or 2 breast cancer and 
enrolled in an individualized exercise oncology progr am, adherence to scheduled 
exercise sessions will average 70% or more, and program attrition will average 
70% or less over 3 months. 
3.0  Background* 
 
In 2018, it was estimated that there were 1.7 million new cancer diagnoses in the 
U.S.1 For all types of cance r, mortality rates are on the decline1, and patients are 
living longer with the chronic and late effects of treatment. This often results in 
costly hospital readmissions and emergency department (ED) visits, leading to 
increased costs, lowered health outco mes, and lengthened stays for patients.2  
 
Several meta-analyses report that exercise interventions are beneficial for patients 
undergoing cancer treatment, in that they reduce symptom severity3 and improve 
cancer-related fatigue4-6, cardiac function7, muscle weakness8, and overall quality 
of life9. Yet, it still remains that less than 5% of patients are ever referred to an 
exercise oncology program during treatment10. Therefore, economic evaluations 
of exercise oncology are warranted, in attempt to evaluate the integration of 
exercise oncology as a standard part of clinical practice.  
 
Maple Tree Cancer Alliance11 has developed an oncology exercise program, 
which results in improved health outcomes, and also cost -saving for facilities and 
payers. Our retros pective data demonstrate d that individualized exercise during 
cancer treatment significantly reduced ED visits, 30 -day readmissions, and length 
of hospital stays12 resulting in a payer benefit of $3,000/patient over the first 6 
months of enrollment into th e Maple Tree Exercise Oncology program2.  As a 
follow up to this research, the purpose of the present study is to prospectively 
analyze the cost savings of an individualized exercise oncology program when 
under a rigorous, randomized, controlled design . We hypothesize that 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized, Controlled Trial of an Individualized Exercise 
Oncology Program for Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients  
 Page 5 of 16 Revised: September 30, 2017 individualized exercise training during cancer treatment will improve treatment 
outcome, lending to a decrease in healthcare -related expenditure.

5.0  Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
 
Exercise Group  
 
The study intervention is a supervised, individualized exercise oncology program 
described in previous  literature2,3,12 and provided by Maple Tree Cancer Alliance, a non -
profit organization providing exercise training to individuals with cancer 
(https://www.mapletreecanceralliance.org/).  This organization was founded in 2011 and 
currently operates in 9 hospitals serving Ohio and Pennsylvania, offering free exercise 
programs and nutritional guidance to approximately 500 patients annually to help relieve 
side effects related to cancer treat ment.  
 
Patients in the supervised, individualized exercise oncology program ( Exercise Group ) 
will complete a 60-minute exercise session  once per week for 12 weeks  at Maple Tree 
Cancer Alliance . The exercise sessions will be individualized to the patient’s  needs and 
fitness level by a trainer with a bachelor’s degree in exercise science and a national 
certification for exercise oncology . A patient will work with the same trainer throughout 
the study, who will plan the patient’s individualized exercise regim en, and who will 
provide one-on-one supervision for the duration of each 60 -minute session.  Each 60-
minute session  will include cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility training. 
Cardiovascular exercise will be performed on a treadmill. The intensity leve l for the 
aerobic exercise ranges from 30 -45% of the individual’s predicted VO 2max, controlled by 
heart monitors (model S810i; Polar Electro) and lasting 30 min. Strength training will 
involve a full body workout, with emphasis on all major muscle groups a nd employing 
machines, free weights, and  resistance tubing. Patients will complete 3 sets of 10 
repetitions for each strength exercise. Flexibility training will involve static stretching of 
all major muscle groups for 15-20 seconds at the completion of ea ch workout.  
 
Control Group  
The control group will receive the current standard of care, which includes a resource 
guide with various options available to the cancer survivor. Within this guide are tips for 
healthy eating and pictures of standard exercises to improve fitness.    
 
 
6.0  Procedures Involved*  
 
The study design is an open-label, randomized, controlled , parallel-group trial. Women 
age 30-80 with a recent diagnosis of stage  0, 1 or 2 breast cancer who meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be invited to participate. As is typical and customary, a diagnos is 
within the last 12 weeks will be considered a recent diagnosis. Upon study enrollment 
and informed consent , patients will be randomly assigned to the Exercise Group  or the 
Control Group . Random assignment will be conducted in blocks of 10 to ensure equa l 
groups (See Appendix A) . Participants will be enrolled in the study for 12 weeks.

7.0  Data and Specimen Banking* 
 
N/A 
 
8.0  Sharing of Results with Subjects* 
 
Most study parameters come from the EMR; patients have ready access to these data. The 
information collected outside the EMR includes quality of life (all patients) and exercise 
session adherence rate ( Exercise Group ). The Exercise Group  will also receive reports on 
their cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility assessments.  
 
9.0  Study Timelines*  
Patient recruitment will begin after IRB approval is obtained. Each p atient will be 
enrolled in the study for 12 weeks . Study enrollment is expected to take place 
over approximately  6 months, until 70 patients are enrolled. When 70 patients 
have been enrolled, enrollment will close, and active subjects will be followed for 
the remainder of their 12 week  participation. Once all patients have completed the 
study, data will be abstracted from the EMR and analyzed within 12 months.  
10.0  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*  
Patients will be selected according to the Consolidated Standard of Reporting 
Trials criteria.  Criteria not determined via EMR are determined via the form in 
Appendix B. Inclusion criteria are:  
• Female; determined from electronic medical record  
• Initial stage 0, 1 or 2 breast cancer diagnosis within the past 12 weeks 
determined from electronic medic al record 
• Age 30-80; determined from electronic medical record   
• Physician clearance to participate in exercise  
 
Exclusion criteria are : 
• Participation in supervised physical exercise within 6 months prior to 
study enrollment  
• Currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant  
• Non-English speaking  
• Unable to make own medical decisions and/or to follow verbal 
instructions 
 
11.0  Vulnerable Populations* 
N/A 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized, Controlled Trial of an Individualized Exercise 
Oncology Program for Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients  
 Page 8 of 16 Revised: September 30, 2017  
 
 
 
12.0  Local Number of Subjects 
A total of 70 subjects will be enrolled (35 in each study group). This sample size 
provides 80% power to detect a medium effect size in number of missed treatment 
fractions between study groups.  Only subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be 
enrolled.  
 
13.0  Recruitment Methods 
13.1  Eligible patients will be contacted in person when they are at KMC 
or Soin MC for regular appointments . If in-person appointments are 
not convenient times, patients may be contacted by phone by the 
research coordinator.  
13.2  The research coordinator will attend breast tumor conferences to 
identify eligible patients and seek physician approval to approach the 
patients about study participation.  
13.3  A printed Interest Form will be provided to patients in their initial 
Breast Cancer Journey packets and during the Breast Cancer Class.  
13.4  The subjects will not receive compensation for their participation in 
the study. 
14.0  Withdrawal of Subjects*  
 
Any study patient who experiences a safety endpoint under section 4.0, including 
recommendation to stop physical activity by treating oncologist , will be withdrawn from 
the study. Final, non-physical activity measures will be collected on patients who are 
withdrawn.  
 
As Maple Tree provides free services to patients undergoing cancer treatment, a patient 
withdrawn from the study for safety reasons could, at a later date and when it is deemed 
safe by her physician, again receive exercise services at Maple Tree (outside the study 
context). 
 
15.0  Risks to Subjects* 
The risks associated with the study intervention are commensurate with light to 
moderate physical activity , such as muscle soreness . Given the low-impact nature 
of the exercise and the one-on-one supervision  during exercise sessions , the risk 
of injury or another adverse outcome is very low. Participants in the Exercise 
Group will have an exercise program individualized to their needs and physi cal 
abilities, and participants will be closely monitored during exercise sessions.  The 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized, Controlled Trial of an Individualized Exercise 
Oncology Program for Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients  
 Page 9 of 16 Revised: September 30, 2017 study will not be blinded; patients and treating physicians will be aware of group 
status and if the treating oncologist recommends the subject  stop physical activity , 
the subject will be withdrawn from the study.  
The Exercise Group  may incur some travel costs to attend exercise sessions.  
No psychological, social, or legal risks are anticipated.  
16.0  Potential Benefits to Subjects* 
Participants in the exercise intervention  may experience reduced pain and relief 
from other effects of cancer treatment, thus reducing breaks in treatment and 
hospital or ER visits. Participants may also experience improved energy and 
mood and may establish a positive behavioral pattern of physic al activity that will 
extend beyond the study.  
 
17.0  Data Management* and Confidentiality  
 
Data Management:  
All study parameters from the EMR will be downloaded by an EMR specialist via a 
report, de-identified, and housed in a Microsoft Excel database. Patient forms, including 
consent forms, will be stored in a locked file cabinet at Maple Tree Cancer Alliance. All 
patients will be assigned a Study ID number and a list linking patient names to Study ID 
number will be kept separately from the study data, on a password-protected computer . 
Data from patient forms will be entered into the master Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. 
Only Study ID will be used to identify patients in the spreadsheet.  
 
Data Analysis Plan:  
Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.0. Continuous variables will 
be described using mean, median, standard deviation, and range. Nominal variables will 
be described using frequency and percentage.  
 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be compared between treatment 
and control groups to establish equivalence ; any statistically significant differences 
between study groups will be controlled statistically . Continuous endpoints will be tested 
for normality using Shapiro -Wilk tests. Differences between study groups on continuous 
endpoints will be evaluated using independent samples t-tests for normally distributed 
endpoints and Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed endpoints . Nominal 
endpoints will be compared between groups using chi -square tests. Alpha will be set to 
.05, two-tailed for all tests.  
 
18.0  Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects* 
 
N/A; The probability of harm or discomfort anticipated in this  study are no greater than 
those encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical  or 
psychological tests .  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized, Controlled Trial of an Individualized Exercise 
Oncology Program for Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients  
 Page 10 of 16 Revised: September 30, 2017  
 
 
19.0  Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
 
Subject identifiers will only be included in the master list linki ng subjects to their Study 
ID (Appendix C). Subjects in the Control Group will receive standard care, including 
usual privacy standards. Subjects in the Exercise Group will interact with the same trainer 
throughout the study, so that rapport can be develop ed, putting the subject at ease. All 
exercise activities will be individually tailored to the subject’s needs.  
To access data from the subjects’ electronic medical records, a request will be sent to  
Information Systems (IS).  Once received, identifiers wil l be replaced with Study ID 
number. 
 
20.0  Compensation for Research -Related Injury 
 
N/A; The study does not involve more than minimal risk.  
 
21.0  Economic Burden to Subjects 
 
Subjects in the Exercise Group may incur costs associated with once weekly travel to 
Maple Tree Cancer Alliance. No other study -related costs to subjects are expected.  
 
22.0  Consent Process 
All patients will be fully informed about the study and will have time to ask 
questions and consider their decision to participate. A research intern for Maple 
Tree Cancer Alliance, Kara Gnau, will provide a written informed consent form to 
eligible patients and meet with them in person to discuss the study in a private 
room at the Kettering Cancer Center or the Soin Cancer Center . Patients will be 
provided with the informed consent form and the intern will go through the 
information in the form with the patient. Patients wi ll be invited to take the form 
home and talk with family and friends before deciding if they would like to 
participate. If patients wish to take some time to make the decision, they may 
inform the intern about their decision to participate or decline parti cipation via 
phone. 
23.0  Process to Document Consent in Writing  
 
Participants will document consent to participate using the consent form in Appendix D. 
 
24.0  Setting 
 
Subjects will be recruited from  patient populations at Kettering and Soin Cancer Centers 
and identified through presentation at breast tumor conferences held at these facilities 
(see Section 13.0). For the Exercise Group, exercise will occur at Maple Tree Cancer 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized, Controlled Trial of an Individualized Exercise 
Oncology Program for Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients  
 Page 11 of 16 Revised: September 30, 2017 Alliance as described in Section 5.0. For the Control Group, all research activities will 
entail usual care at standard treatment locations. Treatment decisions for both groups are 
independent of study participation.

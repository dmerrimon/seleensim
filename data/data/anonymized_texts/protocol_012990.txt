CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Amendment 4  
The purpose of this amendment is to update the exclusion criteria to improve patient safety. 
Additional changes have been made to improve clarity, ensure consistency across the fasinumab 
program, and to make minor cor rections. The following table outlines the changes made to the 
protocol and the rationale:  
Change and Rationale  Sections Changed  
Main changes to improve patient safety:  
The exclusion criterion #22 regarding adverse cardiac events 
within the past 12 month s prior to the screening visit has been 
updated to exclude patients with a history  of adverse cardiac 
events, per Ethics Committee request.  In addition, acute 
coronary syndrome has been removed from this criterion 
because this is covered by exclusion crit erion #10 . Section  6.2.2  Exclusion Criteria, #22  
 
In exclusion criterion #10 regarding NSAID use, the general 
statement regarding the use of concomitant medications for 
which NSAIDs are contraindicated has been removed.  Specific  
medications that are not to be taken concomitantly with NSAIDs 
are listed in the prohibited medications section. In addition, 
patients with conditions requiring use of anti -platelet therapy has 
been added to this criterion.  Section  6.2.2  Exclusion Criteria, #10  
A new exclusion criterion has been added to exclude patients at 
the highest risk of renal complications due to NSAID use, as 
follows:  
‘Patie nts taking concomitant ACE inhibitors/ARBs and 
diuretics, or presence of an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) <30 mL/minute/1.73m2’ Section  6.2.2  Exclusion Criteria, #40  
The reasons for permanent discontinuation of study d rug have 
been updated to ensure that patients enrolled under an earlier 
version of the protocol are immediately discontinued from study 
drug and moved to the follow up period if they meet either of the 
updated exclusion criteria described above, or are tak ing the 
newly added prohibited medications described above 
(combination therapy of diuretics with either an ACE inhibitor 
or ARB).  Section  7.3.2.1  Reasons for Permanent 
Discontinuation of Study Drug  
All other changes:  
The rescreening text has been updated for clarity and to be 
consistent across the fasinumab program  Section  5.1.2  Rescreening  
The sample size has been revised from 2700 patients to 
approximately 1620 patients due to the discontinuation of the 
3 mg Q4W and 6 mg Q8W dose regimens.  Clinical Stu dy Protocol Synopsis: Population  
Section  6.1 Number of Patients Planned  
Clarified that fasinumab and fasinumab -matching placebo are 
referred to as ‘SC study drug’ and that NSAIDs (diclofenac and 
celecoxib) and NSAID -matching placebo are referred to as ‘oral 
study drug’.  Throughout the document

CONFIDENTIAL  Change and Rationale  Sections Changed  
The rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol) text has 
been updated to be consistent across the fasinumab program:  
 Clarified that acetaminophen/paracetamol may be taken 
for inadequate pain relief for OA and for other 
acceptable reasons (eg, headache, fever);  
 Added text to clarify the dosing instructions;  
 Added text to caution against consumption of  alcoholic 
beverages while on acetaminophen/paracetamol  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Rescue 
Treatment  
Section  7.2 Rescue Medication  
Section  7.7.2  Permitted Medications and 
Procedures   
The section on Prohibited Medications and Procedures has been 
updated : 
 To include methotrexate, which should be used with 
caution in patients taking NSAIDs and because 
methotrexate clearance can be decreased with concurrent 
NSAIDs, leading to potential increases in methotrexate 
levels;  
 To include anticoagulants and anti -platelet therapy (eg, 
warfarin, heparins, factor Xa inhibitors, thrombin 
inhibitors, aspirin/5 -aminosalicylic acid (aspirin/5 -ASA) 
>150 mg daily, clopidogrel ), which should be used with 
caution in patients taking NSAIDs;  
 To include recreational use of marijua na in addition to 
medical marijuana, as both have the potential to impact 
efficacy assessments;  
 To include combination therapy of diuretics with either an 
ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB);  
 To clarify that cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, orphenadrine 
and tizanidine are muscle relaxants  
 To make minor corrections   Section  7.7.1  Prohibited Medications  
Text has been added or updated to align with current Regeneron 
best practices  Section  7.4.2  Local Injection Site Reactions  
Section  7.5.2  Emergency Unblinding  
Section  12.1 Monitoring of Study Sites  
Changes have been made  to the Schedule of Events table and 
footnotes for clarity, to make minor corrections , and for 
consistency across the fasinumab program:  
 Added a separate row to the Schedule of Events table 
for high -sensitivity C -reactive protein  
 Clarified that the Early Termination/Joint Replacement 
(ET/JR) visit is also the pre -operative visit for patients 
who undergo JR.  
 Added event -triggered imaging to the follow -up period 
and Early Termination Visit during the follow -up 
period in the Schedule of Events Table  
 Removed t he footnote from the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) row of the Schedule of Events 
table that states the ESR sample will be analyzed by the 
central laboratory (ESR samples will be analyzed 
locally using kits provided by the central lab, see row 
below)  Table  1 Schedule of Events

 Clarified in footnote #4 that patients will review a 
“Participating in a Research Study: What You Need to 
Know” brochure and a “Reporting Your Pain’ brochure 
at the screening and pre -randomization visits  
 Added a urine pregnancy test at week 28  
 Added a fo otnote to state that HIV and/or hepatitis 
testing with be performed on a country -by-country 
basis, according to local guidelines if required by 
regulatory authorities or ethics boards  
 Clarified that walking index joint pain NRS scores are 
recorded by the p atient at home and not onsite at the 
pre-randomization visit  
The laboratory Testing text has bee n corrected to state that ESR 
testing will be performed at the site using kits provided by the 
central laboratory  
Drugs included in the urine drug test have been listed.  Section  8.2.3.11  Laboratory Testing  
Corrected the text describing the Healthcare Resource 
Utilization Questionnaire to state that the sites (not the patients) 
will complete the questionnaire.  Section  8.2.2.7  Healthcare Resource

CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3 Global  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to incorporate an urgent safety measure, which 
requires discontinuing the 3 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) and 6 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) dose 
regimens. The recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to 
discontinue these dose regimens was made following a review of unblinded data from an ongoing 
study in the fasinumab phase 3 osteoarthritis pro gram (R475 -PN-1523) and was based on an 
imbalance in clinically relevant adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral 
edema, arthralgia and a trend towards early fractures in the 6 mg Q8W group.  Based on the 
independent DMC review,  study of lower dose levels (eg, 1 mg Q4W) may continue to be 
evaluated in this population. With this amendment, patients randomized to the 3  mg Q4W or 6  mg 
Q8W dose regimens will be permanently discontinued from study drug but encouraged to 
otherwise comp lete all remaining study visits and study procedures in the follow up period and the 
end of study phone call.   
Amendment 2CA (obsolete)  
The purpose of this amendment was to incorporate health authority feedback.  This amendment 
was not implemented.  
Amendm ent 2 (obsolete)  
The purpose of this amendment was to incorporate Ethics Committee feedback, to make edits for 
clarity and to ensure consistency across the program, and to make minor corrections. This 
amendment was not implemented.  
Amendment 1  
The purpose of this amendment was to incorporate health authority feedback, to make minor edits 
to the text to improve clarity, remove redundant text and to correct typos.

CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 3 Randomized, Double -Blind, Multi -Dose, Placebo And 
NSAID -Controlled Study To Evaluate The Efficacy And Safety Of 
Fasinumab In Patients With Pain Due To Osteoarthritis Of The Knee Or Hip  
Site Location(s)  
 Principal Investigator  To be determined  
Objective(s)  Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab 
compared to placebo, when administered for up to 24 weeks in patients with 
pain due to osteoarthritis (OA)  of the knee or hip . 
Secondary Objective(s)  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
 To evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab compared to non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)s, when administered for up to 
24 weeks in patients with  pain due to OA of the knee or hip  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of fasinumab compared to placebo 
and compared to NSAIDs, when administered for up to 24 weeks in 
patients with pain due to OA of the knee or hip  
 To characterize the concentrations of fasinumab over tim e when 
administered for up to 24 weeks in patients with pain due to OA of the 
knee or hip  
 To evaluate the immunogenicity of fasinumab administered for up to 
24 weeks in patients with pain due to OA of the knee or hip  
Exploratory Objectives  
 To evaluate pat ient-reported outcome measures in patients with pain 
due to OA of the knee or hip treated for up to 24  weeks with fasinumab 
compared to placebo and compared to NSAIDs  
 To evaluate the use of rescue medication in patients with pain due to 
OA of the knee or h ip treated for up to 24  weeks with fasinumab 
compared to placebo and compared to NSAIDs  
Study Design  This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo - and NSAID -controlled 
study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fasinumab in patients 
with OA of the knee or hip who have a history of inadequate pain relief with 
acetaminophen/paracetamol and a history of intolerance to or inadequate 
pain relief with opioids (or are unwilling to take opioids or have lack of 
access to opioids). The study consist s of a screening period of up to 30 days, 
a 7 to 10 day pre -randomization/washout period (7 days with a +3 day 
window), a 24 -week treatment period, a 20 -week follow -up period, and a 
final phone call approximately 52  weeks after the last subcutaneous (SC) 
dose of study drug.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 15 of 93 
CONFIDENTIAL  Prior to randomization, patients will undergo screening procedures, 
including X -ray of the shoulders, hips, and knees, and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the index and contralateral joints must be performed and 
assessed by the central imaging vendor.  In addition, any knee or hip joint 
with a K -L score of ≥3 will have MRI completed during the screening 
period.  During the screening period, all patients will continue to take their 
current treatment regimen for OA pain, which must include use of an oral 
NSAID on a regular basis, defined as approximately 4 days per week over 
the last 4 weeks.  
Patients eligible for the study will complete a pre -randomization period. The 
pre-randomization visit will be 7  to 10 days before randomization. During 
the pre -random ization visit patients will discontinue and/or undergo a 
washout of their standard -of-care pain medications for OA.  All pain 
medications, except for the study -provided rescue medication 
(acetaminophen/paracetamol), will be discontinued.  
Randomization  
Patients will be randomized on day 1 (baseline) in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to receive 
1 of the following:  
 Fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W  
 Diclofenac 75 mg oral, twice daily  
 Celecoxib 200  mg oral once daily  
 Placebo  
Randomization will be stratified according to the affected index  joint (hip 
or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3, or 4) at the screening visit, and geographical 
region.  
Treatment  
During the treatment period (day  1 through week  24), patients will be 
permitted to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol as rescue medication.  
Patie nts will record their use of acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary.  
The study visits during the treatment period will include 1 phone visit on 
day 15 (±3  day).  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed and potential events of 
adjudicated arthropathy  (AA) and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction 
will be monitored.  
Follow -up 
After the end of treatment, follow -up of patients will continue for an 
additional 20 weeks after the last visit.  Safety and efficacy assessments will 
be performed similarly to t hose of the treatment period.  
If a patient must undergo joint replacement (JR) surgery during the study, 
he or she will be asked to complete pre -operative imaging and to undergo 
post-surgery follow -up. 
End of study Phone Contact  
A phone contact questionnai re will be conducted at approximately 52  weeks 
after administration of the last dose of SC study drug to document patient 
status with regard to JR surgery (if patient underwent, is scheduled for, or is 
on a wait list for JR surgery).  Patients who had an A A will have an MRI 
performed of the affected joint(s).

CONFIDENTIAL  Study Duration  The duration of the study is up to 72 weeks excluding the screening and 
pre-randomization periods. Patients who discontinue study drug will be 
requested to return for all scheduled study visits and to complete all planned 
assessments, including phone contacts.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  The sample size has been revised from 2700 patients in the previous

CONFIDENTIAL   Rescue Treatment:  During the 24 -week treatment period, acetaminophen/paracetamol will be 
the only study -provided rescue medication.  In the event that pain relief for 
OA pain is inadequate, or in the event of other pain (eg, headache) or fever, 
1 to 2 tablets/capsules of acetaminophen/paracetamol may be taken no less 
than 4 hours apart as needed according to local standard of care.  The 
maximum daily dose during the treatment and follow -up periods is 2 500 mg 
(500 mg x 5 tablets/capsules) in countries where 500  mg strength 
tablets/capsules are available, or 2600  mg (325 mg x 8 tablets/capsules) in 
countries where 325  mg strength tablets/capsules are available.  
Endpoint(s)   
 Primary:  The co -primary endpoints are:  
1. Change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale scores from baseline 
to week  24 in patients treated with fasinumab compared to patients 
treated with placebo.  
2. Change in the WOMAC physical fun ction subscale scores from 
baseline to week 24 in patients treated with fasinumab compared 
to patients treated with placebo.  
 Secondary:  The key secondary endpoints of the study are:  
1. Change from baseline to week 24 in Patient Global Assessment 
(PGA) in patients treated with fasinumab  compared to patients 
treated with placebo  
2. Percentage of patients treated with fasinumab, compared to 
patients treated with placebo, who had a response at week 24, with 
response defined as an improvement by ≥30% in WOMAC pain  
sub scale score  
3. Change from baseline to week 24 in WOMAC pain subscale scores 
in patients treated with fasinumab  compared to patients treated 
with NSAIDs (pooled celecoxib and diclofenac arms)  
4. Change from baseline to week 24 in WOMAC physical function 
subscale scores in patients treated with fasinumab  compared to 
patients treated with NSAIDs (pooled celecoxib and diclofenac 
arms)  
5. Change from baseline to week 24 in PGA score in patients treated 
with fasinumab  compared to patients treated with NSAIDs (pooled 
celecoxib and diclofenac arms)  
Safety:  The safety endpoints in this study are:  
1. Incidence of AA (as confirmed by independent adjudication)  
2. Incidence of destructive arthropathy (DA) (as confirmed by 
independent adjudication)  
3. Incidence of TEAEs  
4. Incidence of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction (as 
diagnosed after consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as 
a neurologist and/or card iologist)

CONFIDENTIAL  7. Incidence of JR at telephone survey 52 weeks after completion of 
study drug  
Procedures and Assessments  At the screening visit, patients will provide informed consent, medical 
history, and medication history.  Determination of the K -L score of the knee 
or hip will be performed to establish a diagnosis of OA based on the 
American College of Rheumatology criteria using a K -L score cutoff of ≥2.  
Patients will be assessed for childbearing potential and complete a 
self-reported assessment of peripheral or central pain.  
Efficacy will be assessed by the change from baseline in the WOMAC pain 
and physical function subscale scores, the PGA, the Numeric Rating Scale 
of the average walking index joint pain, the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Level 
Questionnaire, the 36-item Short Form Survey , the Healthcare Resource 
Utilization Questionnair e, the Work Productivity and Activity 
Impairment -Osteoarthritis, and the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for 
Medication.  The WOMAC total and stiffness scores will also be evaluated.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit during trea tment 
period and upon occurrence of any joint adverse events (AEs) .  Potential 
events of AA will be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of 
worsening joint pain during the study and adjudication of pre -operative 
imaging for patients who undergo JR dur ing the conduct of the study.  
Potential events of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will be 
monitored throughout the study through physical examination, AE 
reporting, assessment of orthostatic hypotension, and the Survey of 
Autonomic Symptoms.  
Approx imately 52 weeks after administration of the last dose of SC study 
drug, a phone contact questionnaire will be conducted to document patient 
status with regard to JR surgery (if patient underwent, is scheduled for, or is 
on a wait list for JR surgery). Pat ients who had an AA will have an MRI 
performed of the affected joint(s).  
Statistical Plan  Statistical Hypothesis  
There are 6 hypotheses for the primary and key secondary endpoints.  The 
primary treatment comparison for the WOMAC pain and physical function  
subscale scores will be declared superior only if the comparisons are 
significant for both WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores.  A 
sequentially rejective multiple test procedure will be applied to control for 
multiplicity and to maintain stud y-wise Type I error rate at two -sided 0.05 
level for the hypotheses (Hi, i=1,…, 6 for fasinumab 1 mg Q4W) for the 
primary and key secondary endpoints.  
Justification of Sample Size  
Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate up to week  24, 
an enrollment of 600 patients in the fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W group and 
300 patients in the placebo group will provide at least 99% power to detect 
an effect size of 0.46 in the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale 
scores (ie, absolute treatment difference  of 1.1 between fasinumab and 
placebo with a SD of 2.4). The assumed treatment difference and SD are 
based on results from study R475 -PN-1227.  The sample size will provide 
99% power to detect an effect size of 0.36 in PGA (ie, absolute treatment 
differenc e of 0.4 with a SD of 1.1, R475 -PN-1227).

CONFIDENTIAL  Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate up to week 24, 
an enrollment of 600 patients per arm in the fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W group 
and pooled NSAIDs group will provide approximately 92% power to det ect 
an effect size of 0.22 in the WOMAC pain subscale (ie, absolute treatment 
difference of 0.51 with a SD of 2.3).  The sample size will provide 
95% power to detect an effect size of 0.24 in WOMAC physical function 
subscale (ie, absolute treatment differe nce of 0.50 with a SD of 2.1) and 
79% power to detect an effect size of 0.18 in PGA (ie, absolute treatment 
difference of 0.18 with a SD of 1.0).  
Statistical Methods  
Baseline demographic disease characteristics, including medical history  and 
exposure to st udy drug, will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics.  Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical or 
ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displa yed for each 
category.  
The primary efficacy variables will be analyzed using multiple imputation 
approach with mixed -effect model for repeated measure (MMRM) based on 
the FAS with adjustment for missing data due to lack of efficacy or adverse 
events assumi ng the WOMAC scores would on average return to baseline 
values. The imputed data for patients discontinued from the study treatment 
due to lack of efficacy or AEs will be centered at the mean baseline value. 
The missing data for patients who discontinued t reatment due to other 
reasons will be imputed under missing -at-random assumption. Sensitivity 
analysis using tipping point approach with multiple imputation will be 
performed to assess the robustness of the results due to data that may be 
missing not -at-random.  
For analysis of continuous secondary endpoints, the analysis method will be 
the same as that used for the primary variables.  For analysis of categorical 
variables in secondary endpoints, eg, proportions of patients with ≥30% 
improvement in the WOMAC  pain subscale scores at week 24, the Cochran 
Mantel Haenszel approach stratified by the randomization strata will be used  
with missing data considered as non -response . 
Safety data including treatment -emergent adverse events  and 
treatment -emergent adverse events of special interest, vital signs, physical 
examinations, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and anti -drug antibody 
formation will be listed and summarized by treatment group.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Chronic musculoskeletal pain  affects a large portion of the global population.  A significant cause 
of chronic musculoskeletal pain is due to osteoarthritis (OA).  Osteoarthritis is a progressive, 
chronic disease caused by the breakdown and loss of cartilage of the joints, which lead s to pain in 
the hips, knees, hands, feet, and spine.  It is characterized by focal areas of loss of articular cartilage 
in synovial joints accompanied by subchondral bone changes, osteophyte formation at the joint 
margins, thickening of the joint capsule and mild synovitis.  Symptoms and disability increase 
with increasing age.  The prevalence of OA in patients aged 65 and older is 60% in men and 70% 
in women, and continually rising ( Sarzi -Puttini  2005). 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of treatment in patients with 
mild-to-moderate OA.  The efficacy of NSAIDs is well -documented, albeit modest, but their use 
is associated with a number of risks ( Bingham  2007 ) (Bjordal  2004 ) (Makarowski  2002 ) 
(Silverstein  2000 ).  The risks associated with long -term therapy with NSAIDs, in particular, have 
been well -characterized and include gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and increased risk of 
cardiovascular events ( Lanas  2011 ) (Trelle  2011 ).  Non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs have 
limited efficacy in many OA patients; those with advanced OA typically try several NSAIDs and 
must often move to other therapies such as opioids.  
Treatment guidelines for OA suggest that opioid s may be used in OA only if management with 
NSAIDs is ineffective, intolerable, or otherwise contraindicated ( American College of 
Rheumatology Subcommittee on Osteoarthritis Guidelines  2000 ).  Howev er, the use of opioids is 
limited by central nervous system effects, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and potential for 
abuse and dependence.  In addition, opioid use may be associated with both acute and chronic side 
effects, including drowsiness, dizzi ness, gastrointestinal intolerability, motor imbalance, 
respiratory depression, and even death. Opioid use must be closely monitored in patients who are 
vulnerable or are potentially vulnerable to abuse or addiction. Moreover, there is no evidence to 
suppo rt superiority of opioids over other available pain medications. While the efficacy of opioids 
in treating pain over a short duration is supported by research data ( Smith  2016 ), long -term 
efficacy h as not been evaluated.  
Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for alternative treatment options to opioids that have 
a more effective analgesic effect, particularly since there are a significant number of patients who 
are intolerant to or do not get ade quate pain relief from the currently available treatment options.  
Inadequate pain relief has a profound impact on the quality of life for millions of people worldwide 
with an associated substantial cost to society, including healthcare cost ( Salmon  2016 ) and loss of 
productivity ( Dibonaventura  2011 ). 
Neurotrophins are a family of peptide growth factors that play a role in the development, 
differentiation, survival and death of neuronal and non -neuronal cells ( Chao  2006 ).  Nerve growth 
factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and its role in the development and 
survival of both peripheral and central neurons during the development of the nervous system is 
well characterized ( Crowley  1994 ) (Smeyne  1994 ).  In the  adult, NGF is not required as a survival 
factor but acts as a pain mediator that sensitizes neurons ( Pezet  2006 ).  Nerve growth factor activity 
is mediated through 2 different membrane -bound receptors, the high -affinity tyrosine kinase type 
1 (TrkA) and the low -affinity p75 neurotrophin receptors.

CONFIDENTIAL  By acting upstream of several relevant molecular pathways, the NGF/TrkA system appears to play 
a major role in the control of pain.  Administration of NGF has been show n to provoke pain in 
both rodents ( Lewin  1994 ) and humans ( McArthur  2000 ), while NGF antagonists have been 
shown to prevent hyperalgesia and allodynia in animal mode ls of neuropathic and chronic 
inflammatory pain ( Ramer  1999 ).  Humans with mutations in TrkA (hereditary sensory and 
autonomic neuropathy IV) or NGF (hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy V) h ave been 
identified with a loss of deep pain perception ( Einarsdottir  2004 ) (Indo 1996 ).  In addition, NGF 
is known to be elevated in the sy novial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other types 
of arthritis ( Aloe  1992 ) (Halliday  1998 ), and to be up -regulated in injured and inflamed tissues in 
conditions such as cystitis, prostatitis, and chronic headache ( Lowe  1997 ) (Miller  2002 ) 
(Sarchielli  2001 ). 
Fasinumab (also known as REGN475) is a fully -human high -affinity monoclonal antibody 
directed against NGF.  By selectively blocking NGF, fasinumab has the po tential to be effective 
in modulating NGF -associated pain without some of the adverse side effects of other analgesic 
medications, such as opioids and NSAIDs.  Following an evaluation of the safety and tolerability 
of the antibody in a single -ascending -dose first -in-human study (study  R475 -PN-0817), a 
proof -of-concept study evaluating the effect of fasinumab on pain in 217  patients with OA of the 
knee was completed (study R475 -PN-0901, see current edition of Fasinumab Investigator’s 
Brochure).  Three intrav enous (IV) doses of fasinumab were evaluated (0.03,  0.1, 0.3 mg/kg every 
8 weeks [Q8W]).  All  three doses, compared with placebo, were associated with statistically 
significant improvement in pain as evaluated by walking knee pain, the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Patient’s Global Impression of 
Change questionnaire.  Additionally, the R475 -PN-1227 study in patients with OA revealed 
significant efficacy in the WOMAC pain subscale score for each of the doses of fasinumab 
evaluated (1 mg, 3 mg, 6  mg, and 9  mg given every 4 weeks [Q4W]) compared with placebo (see 
current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure).   Results from recent clinical studies with other anti -
NGF antibodies, tanezumab (Pfizer) and fulranuma b (Janssen), also support the role of NGF in 
pain modulation in patients with pain due to OA of the knee and hip ( Brown  2012 ) (Hefti  2006 ) 
(Lane  2010 ) and in patients with chronic low back pain ( Katz  2011 ) (Kivitz  2013 ). 
In all clinical studies completed to date, fasinumab was generally well tolerated.  Arthralgia, joint 
swelling, peripheral edema, hypoesthesia, and myalgia were more frequently reported in 
fasinumab -treated patients than in placebo -treated patients.  In ne urological evaluations, 
abnormalities in vibration sense were more frequent in the fasinumab patients than in the placebo 
patients.  These adverse events (AEs) or physical examination abnormalities associated with 
fasinumab were generally mild to moderate in intensity and were transient (see current version of 
the Investigator’s Brochure).  
Data from studies of tanezumab and fulranumab demonstrated these molecules were associated 
with an increased risk of destructive arthropathy (DA), a unique clinical form of rapidly 
progressive arthropathy over and above that seen in the normal progression of osteoarthritis.  
Analyses of the tanezumab data by its sponsor, defined by anatomic pathological criteria on 
specimens obtained on joint replacement (JR), revealed tha t the risk of DA increases with 
tanezumab dose and is further increased with the concomitant use of chronic NSAIDs (>90  days) 
(Lane  2010 ).  Most cases of DA occurred in joints with a documented history of OA.

CONFIDENTIAL  Based on the potential risk of DA identified in tanezumab and fulranumab, the United States (US) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed this class of anti -NGF antibodies on clinical hold in 
2010.  Following a review of anti -NGF antibody clinical data in March 2012, the FDA de termined 
that clinical studies of anti -NGF therapies could resume if mitigation strategies are implemented 
to minimize the risk of DA.  To address concerns about potential events of DA, a risk -mitigation 
approach is also being implemented for all fasinumab  studies, as outlined in Section  9.6.1.1 .  This 
approach includes sensitive, prospective, and rigorous radiologic screening for select changes in 
joint structure.  The patients who develop these changes, which are referred to throughout this 
document as adjudicated arthropathy (AA), are required to discontinue study therapy.  
Since the removal of the FDA clinical hold, Regeneron has conducted or initia ted several clinical 
trials of fasinumab. In all clinical studies to date, fasinumab was associated with a low rate of 
discontinuations due to adverse events. Patients treated with fasinumab generally had more 
frequent events than did placebo -treated patie nts of arthralgia, joint swelling, peripheral edema, 
altered peripheral sensation (eg, paresthesia, dysesthesia), and myalgia.  
In 2012, studies of other anti -NGF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified adverse changes in 
the sympathetic nervous system of m ature animals of several species (rat and non -human primate).  
These effects include a reversible decrease in neuron volume.  To date, no statistically significant 
or consistent effects of fasinumab on the sympathetic nervous system have been detected in animal  
studies with up to 6 -months of treatment.  Nonetheless, based on the potential risk of sympathetic 
nervous system toxicity associated with these other anti -NGF mAbs in animal studies, a risk 
mitigation  approach is being implemented for all fasinumab studies, as outlined in Section  9.6.1.2 . 
In the phase 2/3 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the knee or hip 
(R475 -PN-1227), 26 AA  events occurred in 24  patients. There was an increase in AA events that 
appeared to be related to greater fasinumab dose. Although these events were milder than the 
severe DA events presented at the 2012 FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee, in consideration of 
the lack of an observed dose response for efficacy in OA, the benefit -risk ratio was deemed 
unfavorable for the fasinumab 6  mg Q4W and 9  mg Q4W doses in patients with OA, in comparison 
to the other fasinumab doses that were studied, (ie, 1  mg Q4W and 3  mg Q4W).  The dose regimens 
that were being evaluated in the phase 3 studies for OA pain in the knee or hip included 1 mg 
Q8W, 1 mg Q4W, 3 mg Q4W, and 6  mg Q8W.  In April 2018, the independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) recommended discontinuing 6  mg Q8W and 3 mg Q4W (expected to have 
similar exposure to 6 mg Q8W) based on a review of unblinded data in an on -going study in the 
fasinumab phase 3 OA program (R475 -PN-1523). Subsequently a small Regeneron team reviewed 
the data and agreed with this recomme ndation.  The DMC noted imbalances in clinically relevant 
adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia and a trend 
towards early fractures.  The phase 3 program for OA pain in the hip or knee will continue to 
evalu ate fasinumab 1 mg with the highest dose regimen of 1 mg Q4W, which is supported by the 
independent DMC as having a favorable benefit -risk profile.  
Fasinumab is currently being evaluated in 2 phase 3 studies in patients with pain due to OA. Study 
R475 -PN-1523 is currently ongoing and is designed to assess the long -term safety and efficacy of 
multiple doses of fasinumab compared to placebo in patients with OA of the hip or knee. Study 
R475 -OA-1611 is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of fasinumab to placebo and to 
naproxen, a standard -of-care NSAID for moderate -to-severe pain due to OA of the hip or knee.

3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypothesis

expected to provide effective pain relief based on an improvement in the WOMAC pain sub -scale 
score and improved functionality based on the WOMAC physical function sub -scale.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
The present study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo - and NSAID -controlled study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of fasinumab in patients w ith OA of the knee or hip who have a history of 
inadequate pain relief from acetaminophen/paracetamol and a history of intolerance to or 
inadequate pain relief from opioids (or are unwilling to take opioids) for OA pain management. 
This study will compare the efficacy and safety of fasinumab to placebo and to a pooled NSAID 
group of celecoxib or diclofenac, which are members of the class of NSAID medications 
commonly used for moderate -to-severe pain due to OA.  
The target study population was chosen because they currently have unmet medical needs with 
respect to incomplete pain control, in spite of the availability of NSAIDs.  This study will provide 
efficacy and safety data for OA patients exposed for up to 24 weeks to fasinumab, a pooled NSAID 
comparator gr oup (celecoxib or diclofenac), or placebo.  The study will be conducted with 
appropriate eligibility criteria to exclude patients who may be at risk for events of joint damage 
and sympathetic nervous system effects.  
Rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracet amol) will be made available for any patient with 
breakthrough pain.  Specific questionnaires and physical examinations will be employed to 
monitor for any events of arthralgia, worsening joint pain, altered peripheral sensation, AA, and 
sympathetic nervou s system effects.  
This study will enroll patients who have failed or are intolerant to opioids and have failed 
acetaminophen/paracetamol.  As there are currently a limited number of therapeutic options 
available, enrollment of this study population support s equipoise with respect to randomization of 
patients to fasinumab or to placebo.  
The inclusion of a placebo treatment group is important to accurately determine the efficacy of 
fasinumab. Non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs are the most common medicatio ns used to treat 
pain due to OA. Therefore, comparison of fasinumab to the NSAIDs treatment group will aid in 
determining the efficacy of fasinumab compared to a frequently used and effective standard of 
care class of medications for OA, but that have asso ciated clinically significant AEs.  As celecoxib 
and diclofenac are commonly used and highly effective NSAIDs ( Ong 2007 ), they have been 
selected as comparator drugs for this study. As a widely studied, standard of care therapy for OA, 
NSAIDs will serve as an effective calibrator to best understand the potent ial therapeutic benefit of 
fasinumab in this study population.  
Inclusion of both the placebo group and the active treatment comparator group will be important 
to accurately estimate the risk of AEs, including the AEs of special interest of adjudicated 
arthropathy and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. All patients included in the study will 
have regular study visits and receive diagnostic procedures (ie, X -rays, magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI]) to evaluate their ongoing OA. Adverse event monitoring w ill be ongoing 
throughout the trial. A patient or investigator can choose to end participation at any time. Patients 
will have access to rescue medication, as appropriate. Therefore, the use of a placebo group is 
justified, as placebo -treated patients will  not be placed at significant risk.  
The patients will be stratified by the affected index joint (hip or knee), by Kellgren -Lawrence 
(K-L) score (2 to 3, or 4), and by geographic region to enable analysis of efficacy and safety.  The

3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Previous versions of this protocol randomized patients to receive fixed -dose, s ubcutaneous (SC) 
injections of 1  mg of fasinumab Q4W, 3  mg fasinumab Q4W, 6  mg fasinumab every 8  weeks 
(Q8W with alternating placebo injections at the monthly visits where fasinumab will not be given, 
to maintain the blind), celecoxib active comparator, di clofenac active comparator, or matching 
placebo. Based on April 2018 recommendations from an independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) that reviewed unblinded data from a different ongoing phase 3 study of fasinumab 
(R475 -PN-1523), the decision was made to discontinue further evaluation of fasinumab at 3 mg 
Q4W or 6 mg Q8W in the phase 3 program. This recommendation was based on an imbalance in 
clinically relevant adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, 
arthralgia and a  trend towards fractures.   Under amendment 3  global , all patients previously 
randomized to 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W under an earlier version of the protocol were discontinued 
from study drug but encouraged to otherwise continue all protocol visits and study procedures in 
the follow -up period and the end of study phone call.  
Clinical trial data, including PK data, that support selection of these fasinumab doses include those 
from the phase  1 studies in healthy volunteers (R475 -PN-0817 and TDU -11480), the R475 -PN-
0901 phase 2 proof -of-concept study in patients with pain due to OA of the knee, the R475 -PN-
1227  phase 2/3 study in patients with OA of the hip or knee, and the R475 -PN-0908 single -dose, 
proof -of-concept study in patients with sciatic pain.  
Single SC doses of fasinumab of up to 30  mg were well -tolerated in healthy male and female 
subjects in the TDU -11480 study.  All single IV doses of fasinumab in the R475 -PN-0817 study 
in healthy male and female subjects were generally well tolerated at all but the h ighest IV dose 
(1 mg/kg).  The occurrence of neurosensory AEs, which were transient and non -severe, led to the 
decision to refrain from escalating above the 1  mg/kg IV dose and instead, to expand enrollment 
of the 1  mg/kg IV cohort.  
In the R475 -PN-0901 pha se 2 proof -of-concept study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to 
OA of the knee, multiple IV doses of up to 0.3  mg/kg administered Q8W demonstrated efficacy 
with regard to pain relief and were well tolerated in Caucasian subjects.  All 3  doses of fasi numab 
(0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/kg IV Q8W) were associated with greater improvement 
compared with placebo in walking index knee pain, standardized total WOMAC score, WOMAC 
subscales (pain, function, and stiffness) and Patient’s Global Impression o f Change.  However, it 
was noted that pain relief had the slowest onset with the lowest (0.03  mg/kg) dose.  
In the R475 -PN-1227 phase  2/3 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the hip or 
knee, all SC doses (1  mg, 3  mg, 6 mg, and 9  mg Q4W) demonstrated efficacy in pain relief and 
physical function measures, based upon WOMAC pain and physical funct ion scales assessed after 
16 weeks of treatment. Considering the relative lack of an observed dose response for efficacy and 
the increased risk of AA with both the 9  mg and 6  mg Q4W doses, the latter doses are no longer 
being studied. Neuromuscular AEs, su ch as arthralgia and paresthesia, were reported more 
frequently in fasinumab treated patients than in placebo -treated patients, though these events were 
typically mild or moderate in intensity. The efficacy and safety data from the 1  mg and 3 mg Q4W 
dose r egimens in R475 -PN-1227 supported the previous dose selection of 1  mg and 3 mg Q4W

regimens due to emerging safety information, the 1 mg Q4W dose regimen will contin ue to be 
evaluated in this study and is deemed to have a favorable benefit -risk profile.  
All randomized patients in this study will receive an orally administered NSAID or matching 
NSAID placebo.  The dose of diclofenac will be 75 mg twice daily.  The dose  of celecoxib will be 
200 mg once daily.  These NSAID doses reflect the recommendations in the US label for treatment 
of pain associated with OA. In order to preserve the blind, patients randomized to celecoxib will 
receive celecoxib 200 mg once daily in t he morning and a matching celecoxib placebo in the 
afternoon. Patients randomized to matching NSAID placebo will receive the placebo twice daily.  
All NSAIDs and matching NSAID placebo will be over -encapsulated to preserve the blind.

CONFIDENTIAL  5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1. Study Description and Duration  
This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo - and NSAID -controlled study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of fasinumab i n patients with OA of the knee or hip who have a 
history of inadequate pain relief with acetaminophen/paracetamol and a history of intolerance to 
or inadequate pain relief with opioids (or are unwilling to take opioids or have lack of access to 
opioids). T he study consists of a screening period of up to 30 days, a 7 to 10 day 
pre-randomization/washout period (7 days with a +3 day window), a 24 -week treatment period 
(with the last Q4W dose of study drug administered at week 20), a 20 -week follow -up period, a nd 
a final phone call approximately 52 weeks after the last SC dose of study drug ( Figure  1).

5.1.1.  Screening and Pre -Randomization  
Prior to randomization, patients will undergo screening procedures, including X -ray of the 
shoulders, hips, and knees. Magnetic resonance imaging of the index and contralateral joint must 
be performed at screening and the results assessed by the central imaging vendor.  In addition, an 
MRI will be performed on any knee or hip joint with a K -L score of ≥3.  Randomization visits 
cannot occur until there is c onfirmation from the central imaging vendor that there are no 
exclusionary findings on the X -rays and any required MRIs. During the screening period, all 
patients will continue to take their current treatment regimen for OA pain, which must include use 
of an oral NSAID on a regular basis, defined as approximately 4 days per week over the last 
4 weeks.  
Patients eligible for the study will complete a pre -randomization period, during which all pain 
medication, except for the study -provided rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol), will 
be discontinued.  The pre -randomization visit will be 7  to 10 days  (7 days with a +3 day window) 
before randomization.  Patients will discontinue and/or undergo a washout of, their standard -of-
care pain medications for OA during the pre -randomization period.  As needed, patients may take 
acetaminophen/paracetamol for pai n relief according to the regional standard -of-care (see 
Section  7.2 for details).  Acetaminophen/paracetamol must not be taken within 24 hours prior to 
the randomization visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  5.1.2.  Rescreening  
Re-testing During Screening or Pre -randomization  
An assessment that fails to meet eligibility criteria may be repeated once within the  screening or 
pre-randomization period when approved by the sponsor or designated Medical Monitor under 
either of the following conditions: 1) the failure is believed by the investigator to be due to a 
condition that would resolve or could be treated, or 2 ) a laboratory value minimally exceeds the 
cut-off value and is not clinically relevant. Only the assessments that did not meet the eligibility 
criteria require repetition, if done within the screening period or pre -randomization period. Patients 
may not r epeat any assessments if they do not meet the WOMAC criteria or have orthostatic 
hypotension (defined in Section  8.2.3.3 ) during the screening or pr e-randomization visit.  
Rescreening Due to Screen Failure  
Rescreening can be completed for patients who fail to meet the screening visit window 
requirements or who are unable to complete all imaging assessments within the specified screening 
period.  Patien ts who are rescreened after the pre -randomization window must be declared screen 
failures, be registered in the interactive web response system (IWRS) as a new patient with a new 
identification number, and then repeat all screening procedures, with the exc eption of imaging 
assessments. Any imaging assessments would need to be repeated only if they were taken more 
than 60 days from completion of the previous screening X -rays and MRI assessments. Patients 
cannot rescreen if they have screen failed due to not meeting the WOMAC criteria or have 
orthostatic hypotension (defined in Section  8.2.3.3 ) during the screening or pre -randomization 
visit.  
5.1.3.  Randomizati on 
Patients will be randomized on day 1 (baseline) to 1 of the following treatment groups:  
 Fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W and NSAID -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and diclofenac 75 mg oral, twice daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placeb o SC Q4W, celecoxib 200  mg oral once daily, and NSAID -
matching placebo oral once daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and NSAID -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
Patients will receive treatment as described in Section  7.1.  The method of treatment assignment 
is described in Section  7.5. 
5.1.4.  Treatment Period  
During the treatment period (day  1 through week  24), patients will be permitted to use only 
acetaminophen/paracetamol as rescue medication. The study visits during the treatment period will 
include 1 phone visit on day  15 (±3  days). Patien ts will record their use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary. Patients should discontinue use of acetaminophen/ 
paracetamol at least 24 hours prior to the start of study visits in order to minimize the confounding 
effects of the rescue medication on ef ficacy measurements.  
Efficacy will be assessed by the change from baseline in the WOMAC pain and physical function 
subscale scores, the PGA, the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of the average walking index joint

Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) questionnaire, and the Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM).  T he WOMAC total and stiffness scores will also be 
evaluated.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit during treatment period, as outlined in 
Table  1. 
5.1.5.  Follow -up Period  
After the end of treatment, follow up of patients will continue for an additional 20 weeks after the 
last treatment period visit.   Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed according to the 
schedule outlined in Table  1.  
If a patient must undergo JR surgery during the study, he or she will be asked to complete 
pre-operative imaging and to undergo post -surgery follow -up as outlined in Table  2. 
5.1.6.  End of Study Phone Contact  
A phone contact questionnaire will be conducted at approximately 52 weeks after administration 
of the last dose of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo to document patient status with 
regard to JR surgery (if patient underwent, is scheduled for, or is on a wait list for JR surgery). 
Patients who had an AA will have an MRI performed of the affected joint(s).  If the affected joint 
has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted for an MRI.  
5.1.7.  Study Stopping Rules  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor unblinded data on an ongoing 
basis to assess the risk -benefit profile of fasinumab.  Based on these reviews, in the context of the 
totality of evidence, if the DMC has significant concerns at any time regarding a meaningful 
imbalance between treatment groups in joint -related AEs, sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction, neurosensory disturb ances, or any other safety issues, the DMC may make a 
recommendation to temporarily halt, alter, or terminate:  
 individual dose groups within the study or across studies  
 the full study (screening, randomization, dosing of study drug)  
 the fasinumab program  
for additional review and communication to regulatory authorities.  Based on the outcome of the 
review and discussions with the appropriate regulatory authorities, the study may be suspended, 
restarted, or terminated.  
Formal program -wide statistical study stopping criteria for clinical studies involving fasinumab 
may be added to the DMC charter as deemed necessary by the sponsor, DMC and/or 
Health  Authorities.  
5.1.8.  End of Study Definition

CONFIDENTIAL  5.2. Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis of efficacy is planned for this study. The primary efficacy analysis may be 
conducted when 24 week data are available for all randomized patients. No alpha adjustment is 
necessary, as the week 24 efficacy analysis will be the final primary analysis for efficacy.  The 
results will not be disclosed to any site -facing personnel or to any personnel directly involved with 
the conduct of the study.  
5.3. Study Committees  
5.3.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An indepe ndent DMC will meet periodically to review unblinded data as the study progresses, and 
based on the findings, will make recommendations to the sponsor about the conduct of the study.  
The DMC will be comprised of independent statistical and medical experts . Further details will be 
defined in the DMC charter.  Additional safety monitoring will occur on an ongoing basis by the 
Regeneron Safety Team.  
5.3.2.  Arthropathy Adjudication Committee  
An independent, expert, blinded adjudication committee, composed of radiolog ists, will adjudicate 
all potential joint AEs of AA (defined in Section  9.6.1.1 ) as well as pre -operative images in 
patients undergoing JR.

in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render  the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as described in Section  8.1.3 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) are discussed in  
Section  7.3.2 .

 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W, celecoxib 200  mg oral on ce daily, and NSAID -
matching placebo oral once daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and NSAID -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
All patients will receive SC injections of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo.  All SC 
injections will be in the abdome n, thigh or upper arm.  Patients will be observed in the clinic for 
approximately 1 hour after study drug is administered. Patients randomized to earlier versions of 
the protocol with 3 mg SC Q4W or 6 mg SC Q8W fasinumab must be discontinued from study 
drug for the remainder of the study and will move directly into the follow -up period.  
NSAIDs or NSAID -matching placebo will be administered orally .  A proton pump inhibitor or 
other gastric protective medication may be prescribed if deemed medically necessary  by the 
investigator or sub -investigator . 
Doses of SC study drug must be given within ±7 days from the scheduled dose date.  If the window 
is missed, the SC dose of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo should not be administered, 
however, the oral dose of NSAID or NSAID -matching placebo should be dispensed.  The next SC 
dose of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo should be administered at the next scheduled 
dosing date.  
Detailed instructions for study drug dose administration are provided in the phar macy manual.  
7.2. Rescue Treatment  
During the 24 -week treatment period, acetaminophen/paracetamol will be the only study -provided 
rescue medication.  In the event that pain relief for OA pain is inadequate, or in the event of other 
pain (eg, headache) or fever , 1 to 2 tablets/capsules of acetaminophen/paracetamol may be taken

CONFIDENTIAL  no less than 4 hours apart, as needed, according to local standard of care.  The maximum daily 
dose during the treatment and follow -up periods is 2500  mg (500 mg x 5 tablets/capsules) in 
countries where 500  mg strength tablets/capsules are available, or 2600  mg (325  mg x 8 
tablets/capsules) in countries where 325  mg strength tablets/capsules are available (eg, North 
America).  Where 500  mg strength tablets/capsules are available, the highes t individual single dose 
is 1 gram. Where 325 mg tablets/capsules are available, the highest individual single dose is 
650 mg.  
In order to prevent severe liver damage, patients should be cautioned to avoid consumption of 
alcoholic beverages while on aceta minophen/paracetamol. Patients should also be cautioned not 
to take rescue medication at intervals of fewer than 4 hours and to take no more than the maximum 
allowable single dose (1 to 2 tablets/capsules) or maximum allowable total daily dose.  
Acetaminop hen/paracetamol must not be taken within 24 hours prior to scheduled study visits 
during the treatment period in order to minimize the confounding effects of rescue medication on 
efficacy assessments. Use of acetaminophen/paracetamol as study -provided resc ue medication 
during the treatment period will be reported daily by patients using diaries. During the treatment 
period, the acetaminophen/paracetamol will be sourced by the study sites and dispensed to the 
patient at each visit where SC study drug is admi nistered. Acetaminophen/paracetamol 
accountability will be conducted at each study visit starting at the baseline visit and continuing 
through the week 24 visit.  
During the 20 -week follow -up period, acetaminophen/paracetamol will not be provided by the 
sites to the patients.  If acetaminophen/paracetamol is used, dosing instructions will be the same 
as during the treatment period including the maximum allowed daily dose. Use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol will be captured as a concomitant medication during t he follow -up 
period.  
7.3. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.3.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed.  
7.3.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Study drug may be temporarily or permanently discontinued due to medical need, as determined 
by the investigator, medical monitor, or the sponsor and according to the study stopping rules 
(Section  5.1.7 ). 
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug will be encouraged to remain in the study 
and to complete all study assessments.  Patients who agree and thus do not withdraw from the 
study will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per Table  1. 
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt  to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete an early termination visit (Section  8.1.3 ). 
Patients who discontinue from study drug prior to s tudy completion due to an AA (see 
Section  9.6.1.1 ) should return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.

CONFIDENTIAL  In the event t hat a patient must undergo JR surgery during the treatment or follow -up periods, 
he/she will be discontinued from study drug and asked to return to the study site for a pre -operative 
visit and for follow -up safety evaluations (as described in Section  8.2.3.10 ).  Preoperative imaging 
(X-ray and MRI) will be obtained and submitted to the independent adjudication committee for 
review to ensure that an AA event is not in occurrence.  Instructions for the submission process 
are provided in the study manual.  
7.3.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of any of the following : 
 A patient who is currently enrolled under an earlier version of this protocol must be 
immediately discontinued from study drug, undergo all end  of treatment visit 
assessments and move directly into the 20 -week safety follow -up period under this 
version of the protocol, if they meet any of the following conditions that were excluded 
after re -evaluating the safety profile of NSAIDs:  
a) They have a known medical history (at any time) of peripheral vascular disease, 
transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina, or documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; or  
b) They have a known GFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or, 
c) They are currently taking combination therapy of a diuretic with either an ACE 
inhibitor or ARB  (Note: Patients may remain  in the study if they are willing and 
able to change their antihypertensive regimen such that they are no longer on a 
combination of a diuretic with either an angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)  
 A patient who  was randomized under an earlier version of the protocol to 3  mg SC 
Q4W or 6 mg SC Q8W fasinumab  
 A patient developing clinically significant peripheral sensory or motor neurologic 
events confirmed by a neurologist’s examination and graded by the neurologis t as at 
least moderate peripheral neuropathy  limiting activities of daily living,  ie, grade ≥2 
according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4; study 
sites should use CTCAE v.4 criteria throughout the study for consistency  
 Evidence  of pregnancy  
 A patient developing new or worsening signs and symptoms indicative of carpal tunnel 
syndrome  
 Continued non -compliance with protocol -defined maximum  
acetaminophen/paracetamol use (with a maximum daily dose of 2500  mg [countries 
where 500  mg s trength tablets/capsules are available] or 2600  mg [countries where 
325 mg strength tablets/capsules are available]) during the treatment and follow -up 
periods, after appropriate counseling  
 Continued non -compliance with the protocol, including usage of NSA IDs that are not 
permitted in the study, after appropriate counseling  
 Joint replacement surgery

CONFIDENTIAL   Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) of:  
- Adjudicated arthropathy, as described in Section  9.6.1.1  
- Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction , as described in Section  9.6.1.2  
 Hepatotoxicity.  Study dr ug should be discontinued if the following are observed:  
1. Total bilirubin (TBL) >2x ULN or international normalized ratio >1.5, and  
2. ALT or AST >3x  ULN, and  
3. No other cause for 1 and 2 is readily apparent  
Other causes of ALT, AST, and TBL elevations may include alcoholic hepatitis, 
autoimmune hepatitis, non -alcoholic hepatitis, heritable diseases (Gilbert's 
Syndrome), heart failure, and viral hepatitis.  
NOTE:  Study drug may be withheld in patients who do not meet criteria for 
permanently discontinuing st udy drug, until an alternative cause for drug -induced 
liver injury can be determined.  The patient may be re -challenged if an alternative 
cause for elevated liver function tests is found and the liver function tests return to 
baseline, but only after discu ssion with the sponsor.  
 Systemic hypersensitivity reaction deemed by the investigator to be related to study 
drug 
 Gastrointestinal bleeding, acute coronary syndrome  
 Any other medical need, as determined by the investigator  
 Sponsor decision  
 Patient decision  
7.3.2.2.  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug may be temporarily discontinued due to medical need, as determined by the 
investigator. Subcutaneous study drug (fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo) will be 
temporarily w ithheld while awaiting imaging adjudication for worsening joint pain or when 
routine imaging suggests adjudicated arthropathy and prompts the need for additional imaging (see 
Section  9.6.1.1 ), or for patients who are determined to have orthostatic hypotension or determined 
to have new or worsening symptoms suggestive of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction while 
awaiting evaluation by a specialist ( see Section  9.6.1.2 ). Patients may continue to take NSAID or 
NSAID -matching placebo during this time. Subcutaneous study drug (fasinumab or 
fasinumab -matching placebo) should not be re -started until the next study visit unless 
imaging/evaluation results are available within the current visit window. If oral study drug is 
temporarily discontinued by the investigator, patients may continue to take SC stu dy drug during 
this time.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.4. Management of Acute Reactions  
7.4.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be available 
for immediate use for injections performed at the study site.  All injection reactions must be 
reported as AEs (as defined in Section  9.3.1 ) and graded using the grading scales as instructed in 
Section  9.5.1 . 
Acute systemic reactions following  injection of SC study drug should be treated using clinical 
judgment to determine the appropriate response according to typical c linical practice.  
7.4.2.  Local Injection Site Reactions  
Local injection site reactions must be reported as AEs and grade according to Section  9.5.1 . 
7.5. Method  of Treatment Assignment  
Approximately 1500 patients will be randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to receive fasinumab 
(1 mg Q4W), diclofenac, celecoxib, or placebo according to a central randomization scheme 
provided by an IWRS to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee).  Randomization 
will be stratified according to the affected index joint (hip or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3, or 4) at 
the screening visit, and geographical region.  
Prior to amendment 3  global  (urgent safety measure), ap proximately 60 patients each were 
enrolled in the fasinumab 3  mg Q4W and 6 mg Q8W groups.  However, dosing of these patients 
was discontinued, as recommended by the independent DMC in April 2018. Overall, a total of 
approximately 1620  patients are planned for this study.  
7.5.1.  Blinding  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study.  The Regeneron study medical director, study 
monitor, and any other Regeneron and cont ract research organization (CRO) personnel who are in 
regular contact with the study site will remain blinded to all patient randomization assignments.  
Blinded study drug kits coded with a drug numbering system will be used.  In order to maintain 
the blind , lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to individuals 
involved in study conduct.  
Anti-drug antibody results will not be communicated to the sites before the end of the study, and 
the sponsor operational team will not ha ve access to results associated with patient identification 
until after the final database lock.  
No study personnel involved in the day -to-day conduct of the study will have access to unblinded 
data before the final database is locked for this study.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.1.  Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table  
1. Patients who discontinue study medication before week 24 will be encouraged to follow 
the visit schedule through the remainder of the study. If a p atient chooses to end study 
participation, he or she will be asked to return to the clinic as soon as possible for an early 
termination visit. Imaging assessments need to be repeated if it has been >30 days since 
the joints were last imaged. If it has been  ≤30 days since imaging assessments were 
completed, imaging assessments may be completed at the discretion of the investigator.  
2. HIV and/or hepatitis testing will be performed on a country -by-country basis, according to 
local guidelines if required by regul atory authorities or ethics boards  
3. Only for patients who provide written informed consent for the optional genomics 
sub-study.  The sample should be collected at the day 1 (baseline/randomization) visit, but 
may be collected at any visit during the study a fter a patient has been randomized.  
4. At the screening and pre -randomization visits, study staff will review the “Participating in 
a Research Study: What You Need to Know” brochure and the “Reporting Your Pain” 
brochure with patients to ensure they understan d what a clinical study is and how to report 
their pain accurately. At subsequent visits, patients will be asked to review the “Reporting 
Your Pain ” brochure themselves.  At any time during the conduct of the study, patients 
may require retraining by study staff . 
5. Subcutaneous study drug administration will be the last procedure at each dosing visit, and 
will be done after all laboratory, PK, ADA and r esearch samples have been collected and 
all study assessments performed. Patients will be observed in the clinic for approximately 
1 hour after SC study drug is administered.  
6. Use of study -provided rescue medication will be recorded daily using diaries. 
Acetaminophen/paracetamol use will be reported from pre -randomization visit to week  24. 
7. Patients will complete the WOMAC pain subscale for both hips and knees at the screening 
visit. Then, the WOMAC Full Survey will be completed only for the index joint at 
subsequent visits.  
8. Walking index joint pain NRS score will be recorded by the patient each day using their 
diary, starting during the pre -randomization period through week 24. Walking index joint 
pain NRS score will be recorded by the patient at the site at the week 24 visit.  
9. If the pulse is less than 45 bpm, an ECG with rhythm strip will be obtained to confirm the 
heart rate and rhythm.  
10. Blood pressure measurements to assess orthostatic hypotension may be discontinued 
following regulatory approval if the safe ty database does not reveal an imbalance for the 
fasinumab treated patients.  
11. If screening radiographs are inconclusive for potential joint related findings, an MRI must 
be performed.  Confirmation from the central reader that there are no exclusionary find ings 
on the MRI must be received before a patient can be randomized.

CONFIDENTIAL  12. Imaging (X -ray and possibly MRI) will be performed at the investigator's discretion on any 
joint with worsening or exacerbation of pain beyond the fluctuations in pain typical for that 
patient's OA. This imaging will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review.  
13. In the event that a patient must undergo joint arthroplasty during the study, the patient will 
complete the pre -operative JR study visit ( Table  1) and the procedures outlined in the 
schedule of events for joint arthroplasty follow -up ( Table  2).  The pre -operative 
questionnaire would be the Knee Society for knee replacements and the Harris Hip Score 
questionnaire for hip replacements.  The pre -operative visit should be completed before 
joint arthroplasty if at all possib le.  Pre -operative imaging will be performed and submitted 
to the adjudication committee.  
14. The purpose of this phone contact is to ask the patient if they have had or are scheduled (or 
on a waiting list) to have a JR.  Pre -operative images will be submitted  to the central reader 
for adjudication, if available.  
15. If the affected joint has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted for an MRI.  
16. Samples will be analyzed by the central laboratory and results evaluated by the 
investigator.  
17. Only to be performed if postmenopausal status has to be assessed for female patients who 
are ≤59 years of age.  
18. In the event of a positive urine pregnancy test result, the patient should have a serum 
pregnancy test with a negative result in order to continue study participation.  If the serum 
pregnancy test is positive, the patient should be withdrawn from study drug and should be 
asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
19. Collection of samples for PK, ADA, high sensitivity C -reactive prote in (hs -CRP)  and 
research are mandatory at the time points specified above. In addition, PK, ADA, hs -CRP 
and research samples may be drawn at any scheduled visit or unscheduled visit if a patient 
experiences a treatment -related safety TEAE. Samples should b e collected prior to SC 
study drug administration on SC study drug dosing days.  
20. Research samples should be collected after the patients have been fasting overnight or for 
8 hours (in the event of an afternoon visit).

8.2.2.5.  36-Item Short Form Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Version 2  
The SF -36 version 2 standard is a health status measure with a 4 -week recall period.  The SF -36 
measures eight concepts: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodil y pain, 
general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, 
and general mental health.  Two summary measures of physical and mental health are constructed 
from the eight scales.  Patients will complete the questionnaire at time points indicated in Table  1.  
Higher scores on the scales and summary measures indicate better health status.  
A copy of the asses sment is provided in the study reference manual  
8.2.2.6.  EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Level Questionnaire  
The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQoL Group to 
provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic app raisal.  The EQ-5D-5L, 
as a measure of health -related quality of life, defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  
Each dimension has 5 ordinal levels of severity:  “no problems” (1), “slight problems” (2), 
“moderate problems” (3), “severe problems” (4), and “unable to” (5).   Overall health state is 
defined as a 5 -digit number .  Health states defined by the 5 -dimensional classification can be  
converted into corresponding index scor es that quantify health status, which ranges from <0 for 
states worse than dead to 1 (full health), anchoring dead at 0.   Patients will complete the 
questionnaire at time points indicated in Table  1. 
A copy of the assessment is provided in the study reference manual.  
8.2.2.7.  Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire

healthcare utilization events that are not collected as part of the safety assessments in the current 
study. Examples of these types of events include a patient's use of walking aid, emergency room 
visits, and unscheduled physician office visits.  Sites will  complete the questionnaire at time points 
indicated in Table  1.  The overall healthcare resource use will be computed based on responses to 
the healthcare resource utilization questionnaire as well as any hospital visits that are captured in 
the safety database.  
A copy of the assessment is provided in the study reference manual.  
8.2.2.8.  Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.3.5.  Survey of Autonomic Symptoms  
Signs and symptoms of autonom ic dysfunction will be assessed by the investigator at time points 
indicated in Table  1.  If possible, the assessment should be completed by the same p erson 
throughout the study.  A patient report of having experienced symptoms of autonomic dysfunction 
will serve as a tool to prompt further evaluations as deemed necessary by the investigator.  
A copy of the survey is provided in the study reference manual . 
8.2.3.6.  Neurologic Examination  
A full or a brief neurological examination will be performed at the time points indicated in Table  1.  
Neurological findings a t baseline that are not exclusionary should be recorded in the medical 
history.  Findings at subsequent visits will be assessed by the investigator to determine if these 
should be recorded as an AE.  
The neurological examination will cover the following dom ains:  motor, sensory, cranial nerves, 
reflexes, and coordination/balance and assessment for presence/absence of signs of carpal tunnel 
syndrome and may be conducted by any clinician at the site qualified to do so.  Whenever possible, 
the same clinician wh o conducts the baseline neurological examination should continue to conduct 
the examinations on a given patient.  The investigator may refer patients with persistent or 
worsening neurologic symptoms for a neurologic consultation, if clinically indicated.  Additional 
neurologic assessments will include nerve conduction studies and other tests as deemed clinically 
necessary in the judgement of the neurologist.  
Complete guidance on how to conduct the full and the brief neurologic examination is provided in 
the study reference manual.  
8.2.3.7.  Imaging  
Radiographs of the large joints (knees, hips, and shoulders) will be taken using a standard approach 
at the time points indicated in Table  1.  An MRI of the index and contralateral joint must be 
performed at screening. MRIs will also be performed on any hip or knee joint with a K˗L score of 
≥3.  Radiographs and possibly an MRI wil l be performed on any joint following a report of 
clinically significant worsening or exacerbation of pain in that joint.  An X˗ray and an MRI should 
also be performed pre -operatively if a patient is to have a JR during the study.  Event based and 
pre-operative images will be submitted for adjudication.  Detailed procedures will be provided in 
a separate manual provided by the central imaging center. Radiograph or MRI will be sent to  a 
central reader, where the images will be digitized.  
Radiographs  
Weight -bearing (standing) posterior -anterior radiographs of both knees in the semi -flexed 
position, and anterior -posterior radiographs of both hips and both shoulders, will be conducted at 
these visits.  Additional instructions for positioning of joints are provi ded in the study reference 
manual.  
Radiographs of the knees, hips, and shoulders will be sent to a central reader and evaluated to 
confirm no evidence of AA such as rapidly progressive osteoarthritis type 1 or 2, subchondral 
insufficiency fracture, or oste onecrosis.

CONFIDENTIAL  During screening, MRIs of the index and contralateral joint as well as joints with a K -L score ≥3 
will be sent to a central reader to confirm that there is no evidence of an exclusionary feature. 
Confirmation that there are no exclusionary f indings on MRI must be received before a patient can 
be randomized. An MRI of any joint will be considered if radiographs taken after randomization 
suggest the presence of an abnormal process inconsistent with normal progression of OA, as 
determined by the  investigator or central reader.  
At the end of study phone contact, patients who had an AA will have an MRI performed of the 
affected joint(s).  If the affected joint has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted for an MRI.  
Refer to the supplemental imagi ng manuals for data collection and management procedures.  
8.2.3.8.  Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the time points indicated in Table  1, with the patient 
in the supine position for approximately 5 minutes and prior to blood samples being drawn.  Heart 
rate will be recorded from the ventricular rate, and the PR, QRS, and the QT and QTc intervals 
will be recorded.  The ECG data will be read by a central reading center.  Detailed procedures will 
be provided in a separate manual provided by the central reading center.  
8.2.3.9.  End of Study Phone Contact  
An end of study phone contact will be conducted at 52 weeks following the last dose of SC study 
drug.  Patients will be asked whether they underwent JR surgery following the last in -clinic visit 
of the follow -up period or whether they are scheduled (or on a waiting list) for JR surgery.  Patients 
who had JR surgery will also be asked to submit pre -operative imaging (X -ray and MRI, if 
available) for adjudication. Patients who had an AA will have an MRI  performed of the affected 
joint(s). If the affected joint has undergone JR an X -ray may be substituted for an MRI.  
8.2.3.10.  Procedures to be Performed Only in th e Event of a Joint Replacement Surgery  
In the event that a patient must undergo JR surgery during the treatment or follow -up periods, the 
patient will be discontinued from study drug and asked to return for a pre -operative visit.  The 
pre-operative visit should be completed before JR surgery if possible and pre -operative images 
will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review. Following the JR surgery, the patient 
will complete follow -up safety evaluations at 4 weeks and 20 weeks after surgery (s ee Table  2). 
In the event that the pre -operative visit is not performed, standard -of-care pre -operative images of 
the joint with JR must be obtained and  submitted to the central imaging vendor's adjudication 
committee for review.   Imaging of all other joints per the pre -operative visit procedures will be 
done post -operatively at the first JR follow -up study visit (4 weeks after surgery) if not done before  
surgery.  
All available medical history/information for patients who undergo JR surgery must be collected, 
including placement of prosthesis, healing of the surgical wound and the results of histopathologic 
examination.  
Full details of these assessments ar e provided in the study reference manual.

9. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING  
9.1. Obligations of Investigator  
The investigator must promptly report to the IRB/EC all unanticipated problems involving risks to 
patient.  This includes death from any cau se and all SAEs related to the use of the study drug.  It 
is recommended that all SAEs be reported to the IRB/EC, regardless of assessed  causality.  
9.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SA Es that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (SUSAR), to the health 
authorities, IRBs/ECs as appropriate, and to the investigators.  
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol will be 
considered as unexpected.  Any worsening of or new onset of symptoms related to OA, which 
occur during the screening/washout period prior to study drug administration will be considered 
expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report in an expedited  manner all SAEs that are expected and at least 
reasonably related to the study drug to the health authorities, according to local regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the t rial in the clinical study report to health authorities and IRBs/ECs as appropriate.  
9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study dr ug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient  is a passenger).  
                                        VV-RIM-00048600-1.0 Approved - 11 Jul 2018 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol  R475 -OA-1688 Amendment 4  
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 68 of 93 
CONFIDENTIAL   Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death  at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
In-patient hospitalization is defined as admissio n to a hospital or an emergency room 
for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a 
hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged 
due to the development of a new AE as deter mined by the investigator or treating 
physician.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient  or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above. 
Examples of these include intens ive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
9.3.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator 
to the sponsor can be appropriate.  Such an event might warrant further investigation in or der to 
characterize and understand it.  Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by the 
trial sponsor to other parties (eg, regulators) might also be warranted (Section  9.4.3 ). 
Adverse events of special interest are described in Section  9.4.3 . 
9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Even ts  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the end of the follow -up period (week 44).  Refer to the study reference manual for 
the procedures to be followed.  
Informati on on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.6 .  Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Sectio n 9.4.5 .

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 69 of 93 
CONFIDENTIAL  9.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee ) within 24 hours.  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedure to 
be followed.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report.  
Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical record s and diagnostic test reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the follow -up period 
(week 44)/early termination visit, the following will apply:  
 SAE with an onset within 30 days of the e nd of the follow -up period (week 44)/early 
termination visit - the SAE will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should 
make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
 SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of the follow -up period (week 
44)/early termination visit - only SAEs deemed by the investigator to be drug -related 
will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
 SAE reported by the patient at the end of study phone call and deemed by the 
investigator to be drug -related will be reported to the sponsor. The inves tigator should 
make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related 
SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if 
associated with an AE  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female during the  study or within 20 weeks of the last 
dose of study drug.  Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient 
and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an 
SAE.  Outcome for all pregnancies should b e reported to the sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest:   All AESI, serious and non -serious, must be reported within 
24 hours of identification using the same reporting process as for SAE reporting, 
per Section  9.4.2 .  Monitoring of AESIs is described in Section  9.6.1 .  Adverse 
events of s pecial interest for this study are:  
 Adjudicated arthropathy (as confirmed by adjudication)

CONFIDENTIAL   Joint replacement surgery (refer to Section  9.6.1.4  for when to report as an 
AESI)  
 Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction (as diagnosed after consultation with 
an appropriate specialist, such as a neurologist and/or cardiologist)  
 Peripheral se nsory AEs that require a neurolog y or other specialty  
consultation  
Refer to the study manual for the procedures to be followed.  
9.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be  reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days.  
Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed.  
9.4.5.  Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test  finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
 the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
 the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
 the test result leads to a change in dosing (outs ide of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding should 
be report ed as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting a s an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  even t information will be collected until the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
                                        VV-RIM-00048600-1.0 Approved - 11 Jul 2018 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL   Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning 
level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief 
of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient.  
 Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
 Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functionin g or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of grade):  
 Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort t o touch; ≤5 cm of 
erythema or induration that does not interfere with activity  
 Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or 
interferes with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or 
induration or induration that interferes with activity  
 Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily 
activity; significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily 
activity; requires emergency room visit  or hospitalization; necrosis or exfoliative 
dermatitis  
9.5.2.  Evaluation of Causality  
Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by the "blinded" investigator, and will be a 
clinical decision based on all  available information.  The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study drug?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study 
drug 
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study 
drug 
The investigator should justify the causality assessment of each SAE.

9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice  (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the  compound, but will be supported by other departments (eg, 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management).  Safety 
monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggr egate basis.  
9.6.1.  Monitoring Adverse Events of Special Interest  
9.6.1.1.  Adjudicated Arthropathy  
Adjudicated arthropathy is an umbrella term that encompasses the following conditions:  
 Rapidly progressive OA type 1 and 2  
 Subchondral insufficiency fractures  
 Primary osteon ecrosis  
In addition, AAs will be evaluated to determine if they meet the criteria for destructive arthropathy . 
Potential events of AA will be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of worsening joint pain 
during the course of the study (eg, by applying adverse experiences, the joint pain questionnaire 
and imaging) as well as scheduled imaging and pre -operative imaging, if a patient requires a joint 
replacement during the study.  
Clinically significant worsening of joint pain during the course of this stud y is defined as a 
worsening of pain in any joint that occurs in spite of treatment with analgesics, is in the opinion of 
the investigator inconsistent with the normal fluctuation of pain or progression of OA, and is at 
least 2 weeks duration (or less than 2 weeks if deemed clinically significant at the discretion of the 
investigator).  
If a patient reports an increase in pain as described above, study drug administration will be 
withheld while imaging of the affected joint, as well as any additional imaging deemed appropriate 
to understand the cause of the worsening pain, is performed (Section  8.2.3.7 ).  A decision to

CONFIDENTIAL  perform imaging after patient report ed worsening of joint pain will be documented in the 
respective case report form (CRF) page. Images, along with any other radiographic evaluation, 
will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee for review (Section  5.3.2 ).  The investigator may 
consider aspiration of synovial fluid for further analysis such as cell count and crystal analysis.  
If routine imaging suggests the presence of one of the types of AA, study drug administration will 
be withheld.  Any additional imaging deemed appropriate will be obtained.  The images, along 
with results of any other radiographic evaluation, will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee 
for review ( Section  5.3.2). 
If the adjudication does not confirm the presence of AA, according to the adjudication criteria, 
study drug may be restarted.  
Study drug dos ing will be permanently discontinued for patients with findings that suggest AA; 
the patients will be referred for orthopedic consultation. If presence of AA is confirmed by the 
Adjudication Committee, the case must be reported as an AESI (Section  9.3.3 , Section  9.4.3 ).  
Any patient whose study dr ug is discontinued due to an AA should be encouraged to return to the 
clinic for all remaining study visits.  Prior to the scheduled JR, the patient should complete the pre -
operative study visit and, after the JR, should complete the week  4 and week  20 pos t-operative 
study visits (Section  8.2.3.10 , Table  2).  Pre -operative images, along with any other radiographic 
evaluation will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee for review (Section  5.3.2 ). 
Details of data collection for adjudication of events will be provided in the adjudication charter.  
9.6.1.2.  Sympathetic Nervous System Dysfunction  
Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will be monitored throughout the study through physical 
examination, AE  reporting, assessment of orthostatic hypotension, and the Survey of Autonomic 
Symptoms (Section  8.2.3.5 ).  New onset or worsening of signs and symp toms of autonomic 
dysfunction will be evaluated by the investigator.  Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will 
only be diagnosed after consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as a neurologist and/or 
cardiologist.  
In cases where new or worsenin g symptoms consistent with sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction are moderate to severe or are clinically significant and do not resolve or return to 
baseline in 2  weeks (or less at the discretion of the investigator), study drug will be withheld and 
the patient will be referred to a specialist. If the evaluation by the appropriate specialist does not 
suggest sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, study drug may be restarted. If the specialist’s 
evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system dysfunctio n then study drug will be 
permanently discontinued and the case will be reported as an AESI (Section  9.4.3 ). 
Orthostatic hypotension may be a manife station of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.  If a 
patient is determined to have orthostatic hypotension, study drug should be withheld and the AE 
should be entered in the CRF.  The following procedures should be followed:  
 If the patient is symptomat ic and a clinical explanation for orthostatic hypotension is 
identified (such as a new medication or dehydration due to exercise or illness or 
excessive heat exposure), study drug will be withheld, and the patient should return to 
the study site for an uns cheduled visit in 1 to 10 days for an unscheduled assessment 
of orthostatic hypotension.

CONFIDENTIAL   If the orthostatic hypotension has resolved, study drug may be restarted.  
 If the orthostatic hypotension has not resolved, then study drug will be withheld, 
and the patient will be referred to a specialist (neurologist or a cardiologist) for 
evaluation of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.  
 If the specialist’s evaluation does not reveal new onset sympathetic nervous 
system dysfunction, including symptoms of bradyc ardia (lightheadedness), 
orthostatic hypotension (lightheadedness on standing), syncope, absence of 
sweating in conditions where sweating would be expected, or if the 
specialist’s evaluation identifies an alternative cause, such as initiation of a 
new medi cation known to cause orthostasis, then study drug may be given 
at the next visit.  
 If the specialist’s evaluation  does reveal sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction, then study drug will be permanently discontinued and the case 
reported as an AESI ( Section  9.4.3 ).

and the patient should return to the study site for a n unscheduled visit in 1 to 10 days 
for an unscheduled assessment of orthostatic hypotension.  
 If the unscheduled assessment does not reveal orthostatic hypotension then study 
drug may be continued.  
 If the unscheduled assessment demonstrates orthostatic hy potension then study 
drug will continue to be withheld until the patient has been evaluated by a specialist 
(neurologist or a cardiologist) for evidence of sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction.  
 If the specialist’s evaluation does not reveal new sympathe tic nervous 
system dysfunction including symptoms of bradycardia (lightheadedness), 
orthostatic hypotension (lightheadedness on standing), syncope, absence of 
sweating in conditions where sweating would be expected, or if the 
specialist’s evaluation identi fies an alternative cause such as initiation of a

 If the specialist’s evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction then study  drug will be permanently discontinue d and the case 
reported as an AESI ( Section  9.4.3 ). 
9.6.1.3.  Peripheral Sensory Adverse Events  
Altered peripheral sensation (eg, paraesthesia and hypoaesthesi a) is an important identified risk 
with fasinumab (see Investigator’s Brochure) and other anti -NGF compounds.  Any peripheral 
sensory AE that, per the investigator’s judgment, requires a neurology or other specialty 
consultation must be reported as an AESI .  If any peripheral sensory event persists for 2 months 
the patient must be referred for a neurology or other specialty consultation and the e vent must be 
reported as an AESI (Section  9.4.3 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  9.6.1.4.  Joint Replacement Surgery  
An end of study phone contact will be conducted at 52 weeks following the last dose of study drug 
to evaluate the number of patients who have undergone or are sche duled for JR surgery as 
described in Section  8.2.3.9 . Any elective JR surgery planned before completion of the ICF would 
be part of the exclusion cr iteria and would not be considered an AE.  
After signing of the ICF, report JR surgery as an AESI i f the JR surgery is an elective event that is 
not associated with a new/worsening AE.  
Do not report JR surgery as an AE/AESI if the JR surgery is for the trea tment of a new or worsening 
AE. In this case, the new or worsening AE should be the reported AE/AESI term.  
9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other c linical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s 
Brochure or this protocol, and has a reasonable suspected causal relat ionship to the 
medicinal/study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study.  The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make 
chan ges to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned 
analyses.  The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4. 
10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
There are 6 hypotheses for the primary and key secondary endpoints.  The primary treatment 
comparison for the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores is declared superi or only 
if the comparisons are significant for both WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores.  
The sequentially rejective multiple test procedure ( Bretz  2009 ) will  be applied to control for 
multiplicity and to maintain study -wise Type I error rate at two -sided 0.05 level for the hypotheses 
(Hi, i=1,…, 6 for fasinumab 1 mg Q4W) for the primary and key secondary endpoints.  The 
primary hypothesis will be tested at 0.05 level.  If the primary hypothesis is rejected, the alpha 
level will be reallocated to other hypotheses according to the pre -specified procedure.  The testing 
will stop when no hypothesis can be rejected at any step.  Details will be provided a priori in the 
SAP.  
 H1: There is no treatment difference between fasinum ab 1 mg Q4W and placebo in 
WOMAC pain or physical function subscale scores at week 24 versus there is treatment 
difference in WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores at week  24 
 H2: There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and pl acebo in 
Patient Global Assessment score at week 24 versus there is treatment difference in 
Patient Global Assessment score at week 24

CONFIDENTIAL   H3: There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and placebo in the 
proportion of patients with ≥30% improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale scores 
at week 24 versus there is treatment difference in proportion of patients with ≥30% 
improvement in WOMAC pain at week 24  
 H4: There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and NSAIDs in the 
WOMAC p ain subscale scores at week 24 versus there is treatment difference in 
WOMAC pain subscale scores at week 24  
 H5: There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and NSAIDs in the 
WOMAC physical function subscale scores at week 24 versus there i s treatment 
difference in WOMAC physical function subscale scores at week 24  
 H6: There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and NSAIDs in 
Patient Global Assessment score at week 24 versus there is treatment difference in 
Patient Global Ass essment score at week 24  
10.2. Justification of Sample Size  
Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate up to week 24, an enrollment of 
600 patients in the fasinumab 1 mg Q4W group and 300 patients in the placebo group will provide 
at least 99% po wer to detect an effect size of 0.46 in the WOMAC pain and physical function 
subscale scores (ie, absolute treatment difference of 1.1 between fasinumab and placebo with a SD 
of 2.4).  The assumed treatment difference and standard deviation (SD) are based on results from 
study R475 -PN-1227. The sample size will provide 99% power to detect an effect size of 0.36 in 
PGA (ie, absolute treatment difference of 0.4 with a SD of 1.1, R475 -PN-1227).  
Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate up to w eek 24, an enrollment of 
600 patients in the fasinumab 1 mg Q4W group and the pooled NSAIDs group will provide 
approximately 92% power to detect an effect size of 0.22 in the WOMAC pain subscale 
(ie, absolute treatment difference of 0.51 with a SD of 2.3, [Schnitzer  2015 ]).  The sample size 
will provide 95% power to detect an effect size of 0.24 in WOMAC physical function subscale 
(ie, absolute treatment difference of 0.50 with a SD of 2.1, [ Schnitzer  2015 ]), and 79% power to 
detect an effect size of 0.18 in PGA (ie, absolute treatment difference of 0.18 with a SD of 1.0 
[Ekman  2014 ]). 
10.3. Analysis Sets  
10.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients  and is based on the treatment allocated 
(as randomized).  Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the FAS including patients 
randomized to fasi numab 1 mg Q4W, NSAIDs, and placebo. Efficacy data from patients 
randomized to fasinumab 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W will not be included in the analysis, but will 
be summarized descriptively in separate tables.  
10.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) i ncludes all randomized patients who received any study drug; it is

CONFIDENTIAL  10.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
10.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy An alysis  
The primary efficacy variables will be analyzed using multiple imputation approach with 
mixed -effect model for repeated measure (MMRM) based on the FAS with adjustment for missing 
data due to lack of efficacy or AEs assuming the WOMAC scores would o n average return to 
baseline values. Data collected after discontinuing treatment up to week 24 will not be used in the 
primary efficacy analysis, but used in a treatment policy sensitivity analysis. The imputed data for 
patients discontinued from the stud y treatment due to lack of efficacy or AEs will be centered at 
the mean baseline value. The missing data for patients who discontinued treatment due to other 
reasons will be imputed under missing -at-random assumption.  
Missing data will be imputed 50 times to generate 50 complete data sets. Each imputed complete 
data set will be analyzed using the MMRM with terms for baseline score corresponding to the 
efficacy variable being analyzed, randomization strata (K -L category [2 to 3, or 4], index joint 
[knee, hip ], and geographical region), treatment (fasinumab 1 mg Q4W, NSAIDs or placebo), visit 
and treatment -by-visit interaction.  The MMRM will be performed using the MIXED procedure 
in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) with an unstructured covariance matrix to m odel the within -
patient errors.  Denominator degrees of freedom will be estimated using Kenward -Roger’s 
approximation.  The results from the 50 analyses will be combined using Rubin’s formulae (PROC 
MIANALYZE). The least -squares mean estimates for the mean  change from baseline to week 24, 
as well as the differences of the estimates between fasinumab 1  mg Q4W and placebo, and between 
fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and pooled NSAIDs group, with their corresponding standard errors, p 
values and associated 95% confidence i ntervals, will be provided.    
Sensitivity analysis of treatment policy estimand for the co -primary endpoints will be performed 
using a similar analysis method as the primary efficacy analysis, including data collected after 
discontinuing treatment up to w eek 24. Sensitivity analysis using tipping point approach with 
multiple imputation will be performed to assess the robustness of the results due to data that may 
be missing not -at-random. Multiple imputation will be based on monotone missing data structure  
of the change from baseline score using regression method. Monotone missing data structure will 
be achieved using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. After each imputation, a fasinumab 
patient's imputed data will subtract k (eg, 20%, 40%, 100%) times the tre atment effect at each 
corresponding time point. By progressively increasing coefficient k, the sensitivity analysis will 
explore the tipping point, ie, the upper bound on the critical value of coefficient k at which 
conclusion from the primary analysis wil l be overturned (p>0.05). Sensitivity analyses using PPS 
will also be performed for the primary and selected secondary endpoints.  
10.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For analysis of continuous secondary endpoints, the analysis method will be the same as that used 
for the primary variables.  For analysis of categorical variables in secondary endpoints, eg, 
proportions of patients with ≥30% improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale scores at week 24, 
the Cochran Mantel Haenszel approach stratified by the randomization s trata (K -L category [2 to 
3, or 4], index joint [knee, hip],  and geographical region) will be used with missing data considered 
as non -response .

Safety data including TEAEs  and treatment emergent AESIs, vital signs, physical examinations, 
laboratory tests, ECGs, and ADA formation will be listed and summarized by treatment group.  
Thresholds for potentially clinically significant values in laboratory parameters and vital signs will 
be defined by the sponsor and be in effect at the time of fina l SAP approval.  
The time interval to collect any AEs, including AESIs, is between the first dose of double -blinded 
study drug injection and the week  44 visit, as well as study drug -related SAEs occurring between 
the week 44 visit and the end of study.  
For safety variables, 3 observation periods are defined:  
 The pretreatment period is defined as the time from signing the ICF to before the first 
dose of study drug  
 The treatment period is defined as the day of the first dose of study drug through to the 
day of  the last dose of study drug (week  20) + 4 weeks.  
 The follow -up period is defined as from the end of the on -treatment period (week 24) 
to the week  44 visit.

exacerbation of a pre -existing condition during the on -treatment period.  
Analysis  
All AEs reported in this study will be coded using the currently available version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®).  Coding will be to lowest level terms.  The 
verbatim text, the preferred term (PT), and the primary system organ class (SOC) will be listed.  
The focus of AE reporting in the clinical study report will be on TEAEs.  Post -treatment AEs and 
all AEs during the  study will be summarized similarly as TEAEs.  
Summaries of all TEAEs by treatment group will include:  
 The number (n) and percentage (%) of patients with at least 1 TEAE by SOC and PT  
 TEAEs by severity (according to the grading scale outlined in Section  9.5.1 ), presented 
by SOC and PT  
 TEAEs by relationship to treatment (related, not related), presented by SOC and PT  
 Treatment -emergent AESIs (defined with a PT or a pre -specified grouping)  
Deaths and other SAEs will be listed and summarized by treatment group.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation will be listed 
and summarized by treatment group.  
In addition, A ESIs will be reported according to the adjudicated diagnosis.   Imaging data related 
to AA including change from baseline in joint space width will be summarized.

The following analysis and data conventions will be foll owed:  
General rules for handling missing data:  
 Rules for handling missing data for efficacy assessments due to missing individual item 
data will follow each questionnaire's instrument manual  
 If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is incomple te or missing, it will 
be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study drug, except if an 
incomplete date (eg, month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to 
treatment.  If the partial date indicates the same month or year of  the intake of study 
drug date, then the start date by the study drug intake date will be imputed; otherwise, 
the missing day or month by the first day or the first month will be imputed.  
 No imputations for missing laboratory data, ECG data, vital sign dat a, or physical 
examination data will be made.  
Visit windows:  
 Assessments taken outside of protocol allowable windows will be displayed according 
to the CRF assessment recorded by the investigator.  
Unscheduled assessments:  
 Extra assessments (laboratory data  or vital signs associated with non -protocol -specified 
clinical visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs) will be 
included in listings, but not summaries.  If more than 1 laboratory value is available for 
a given visit, the first o bservation will be used in summaries and all observations will 
be presented in listings.

of Helsinki, and that are consistent with the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
14.2. Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines f or GCP.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB or EC.  A copy of the IRB - or EC -approved ICF and 
documentation of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug w ill be shipped to 
the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient  prior to his/her participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to the patient in 
language that he/she can understand.  The ICF should be signed and dated by the patient and by 
the investigator or authorized designee who reviewed the ICF with the patient.  
 Patients who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
 Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have t he ICF read 
to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm 
that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF mu st be given to the patient.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF must 
be reviewed and updated appropriately.  All study patients must be informed of the new 
information and provide their written c onsent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original 
signed revised ICF must be maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to 
the patient.  
14.3. Patients Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate  measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
patient will be maintained.  Patients should be identified by their patient identification number, 
only, on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor.  Documents that will not be submitted 
to the sponsor (eg, signed ICF) must be kept in strict confidence.

Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  Decision has been made to terminate the Mosaico study
(VAC89220HPX3002/HVTN 706) prematurely by meeting the stopping rules for non-efficacy. Based on
the non-efficacy results of the Mosaico study as well as the outcome of immune correlates analysis in the
Imbokodo study (VAC89220HPX2008/HVTN 705), the immunogenicity analyses as specified in the
secondary endpoint of the Mosaico study are no longer relevant. The sponsor will continue to evaluate
immunogenicity as described under the exploratory endpoints. Additional changes are listed below.
The changes made to the clinical protocol VAC89220HPX3002/HVTN 706 Amendment 7 are listed below,

The mITT population was
specifically removed for the
analysis of vaccine
immunogenicity and immune
correlates.During the COVID-19 pandemic,
many participants received their
vaccination out-of-window. The
mITT-3 population includes
participants in the FAS population
who had a negative HIV test 4 weeks
post 3rd vaccination visit (ie, at the
Month 7 Visit), who received all
planned vaccinations at the first three
vaccination visits, even if these visits
were out-of-window. This population

eff
icacy analysis, and potentially for
immune correlates.
The mITT population includes
participants in the FAS population
(having received at least one
vaccination) who are HIV-1 negative
on the date of first vaccination. Since
immune responses are known to
increase substantially after multiple
vaccinations, it has no added value to
use this population for the analysis of
immunogenicity and immune
correlates.
TIM
E AND EVENTS
SCHEDULEClarified that the request for 
redraw is considered as the initial 
positive HIV test result. Changes were made to provide
confirmation that for the purposes of
the protocol, the request for redraw is
considered as the initial positive HIV
test. Due to the HIV testing algorithm
steps, a scheduled or exposure sample
that leads to a request for redraw is
very likely to be HIV positive. The
request for redraw is what triggers the
#.X visit of the time and events
schedule for participants who become
HIV-1 infected.
9.4 Saf
ety Evaluations Clarified that sexually transmitted
infection (STIs) detected from
study samples are considered
medically attended adverse events
(MAAEs).The protocol could be interpreted that
an STI diagnosed from a study
collected sample will not meet criteria
for a MAAE. However, even if the
STI is diagnosed from a study sample,
as soon as any follow-up (discussion
or treatment) is performed, the event
meets MAAE criteria.

Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  This amendment has been created to provide information and
guidance for investigators on signs and symptoms and on medical management should very rare events of
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) occur, as observed in another Ad26-based vaccine
program (Ad26.COV2.S, COVID-19 vaccine). The Ad26.Mos4.HIV vaccine uses the same Ad26 vector
as Ad26.COV2.S, but has different transgene inserts. To date, no cases of TTS have been reported in
Janssen’s Ad26.Mos4.HIV clinical studies nor in any other Ad26-based non-COVID-19 vaccine programs
from Janssen. Nonetheless, TTS will be followed in this protocol as adverse event of special interest (AESI)
that needs to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness. Additional changes are listed below.

lusion Criteria It has been clarified in inclusion 
criterion 3 that gender non- 
conforming individuals could have 
either receptive or insertive anal 
and
/or vaginal condomless 
intercourse. 
In addition, it is added that the 
potential participants could in the 
last 6 months, apart from any 
stimulant, also have used any other 
drug and/or substance which in the 
local context may be associated 
with increased HIV transmission in 
order to be eligible for the study Addition of "insertive" anal
intercourse allows for inclusion of
gender non-conforming individuals
with male genitalia. Previously,
these individuals could enter the
study but only if they consider
themselves transgender individuals
whereas the very definition of
‘gender non-conforming individual’
should allow for their entry also per
the criterion 3.
In addition to stimulants, several
other drugs and/or substances could
lead to behavior associated with
increased risk of HIV. Therefore,
the inclusion criterion has been
extended to include participants at
increased risk of HIV infection due
to the use of drugs, other than
stimulants and/or substances
associated with increased HIV
transmission.
1.1.1
Background on the Disease 
and Treatment The background section of the 
protocol has been updated with the 
recent information on the stop of 
study HVTN702 due to lack of 
efficacy of the investigational HIV 
vaccine. Recently, study HVTN 702 or
Uhambo, a Phase 2b/3 conducted in
South Africa was stopped as the
vaccine regimen did not
demonstrate efficacy. The study
evaluated an investigational prime-
boost vaccine regimen (ie,
ALVAC-HIV [vCP2438] +
Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59)
which is a regimen adapted from
the one that was used and
demonstrated modest efficacy in an
earlier study conducted in Thailand
(study RV144). The vaccine
regimen was adapted to the HIV
subtype Clade C most common in
southern Africa.

inpatient stay for longer than 24
hours or overnight stay) will lead to
exclusion of the potential
participant from the study. Potential
participants who had surgery

have fully recovered from surgery
requiring hospitalization or has
surgery requiring hospitalization
planned 28 days before or after
planned administration of the first
or subsequent study vaccination(s)
that would interfere with protocol
assessments (as per the
investigator’s judgement and after

will receive further information and 
counseling after each missed 
question, from their first attempt 
onwards, rather than after each 
failed attempt.To increase the likelihood of
potential participants passing the

provide information and counseling
after each missed question and not
wait until the participant did not
achieve the passing score.

indicated, to review reactogenicity
data. Participants who self-report any
postvaccination reaction greater than
mild is seen by a clinician within 48
hours after onset, unless the reaction is
improving and/or has resolved
completely. Participants should bring
their diary to the site at the next visit
to complete review of the diary and
document solicited adverse events into
the clinic note and subsequently into
the eCRF.Given the diary will be used as
a source document for the
recording of solicited AEs, it
is of the utmost importance
that the information included
is as accurate and detailed as
possible. Therefore, the
contact with the site following
the reactogenicity period has
been more clearly defined in
the protocol. Follow-up of
diary entries close to the diary
completion date, will allow for
accurate corrections of and
additions to the diary. In
addition, during these contacts
the participant may receive
further instructions/education
on how to complete the diary.
The contact will also allow for
close follow-up of safety and

CONCOMITANT THERAPYThe exclusion criteria have been
modified to exclude potential
participants who have used long
acting PrEP within 24 months prior to
Day 1. In addition, reference to ‘oral
PrEP’ has been replaced by ‘PrEP’Given the availability of long
acting PrEP (eg, cabotegravir)
which is administered as an
intramuscular injection and
has a long pharmacokinetic
tail, the use of long acting
PrEP will be disallowed from
24 months prior to Day 1. As
the use of PrEP is allowed
once participants received the
first vaccination, including
injectable long-acting PrEP, if
available, reference to ‘oral
PrEP’ has been replaced by
‘PrEP’.
4.2 Exc
lusion Criteria The exclusion criteria have been
modified to exclude potential
participants who share needles during
injection of drugs and other
substances instead of potential
participants with active or recent use
of any illicit IV drug.Drug substance use is linked
to risky sexual behaviors.
Given the target population of
men who have sex with men
(MSM) and transgender
individuals considered at
increased risk for HIV-1
infection and the fact that drug
use can add to sexual risk
behavior, potential
participants who use injection
drugs will be allowed in the
study. Due to the different
way of transmission,
individuals sharing needles
will be excluded from the
study.
4.2 Exc
lusion Criteria The window during which the use of
HIV-related mAb, whether licensed or
investigational, is disallowed has been
adjusted from within 24 months prior
to Day 1 to within 12 months prior to
Day 1.The time window from 24
months to 12 months prior to
Day 1 for the use of HIV-
related mAb was adjusted
based on more accurate
estimates of mAb washout
times including Fc-modified
versions currently in
development. The original
estimate was too conservative

have a sieving effect on any 
breakthrough infections and for the 
evaluation of any immune markers 
that are associated with post-infection 
control of HIV in participants if 
differences between active and 
placebo recipients are observed, 
potentially including immune
responses to all vaccine antigens.In the initial protocol it was
indicated that samples for the
determination of the immune
responses from participants
who become HIV infected
would be analyzed upon

Hypo
thesis
This study is designed to test the primary hypothesis of VE in the PP population:
Null hypothesis (H0): VE(7-x months) ≤20% versus the alternative hypothesis (H1): VE(7-x months)
>20%, with 24≤x≤30.
The timing of the primary analysis will be determined by when the Target Number of Infections (TNI) is
reached within a given follow-up period x (24≤x≤30).
If the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for VE(7-x months) is >20% at the primary analysis,
the corresponding H0 will be rejected.
OVERVIEW OF STUDY  DESIGN
This is a multi-center, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 study to
demonstrate efficacy of a heterologous prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine regimen consisting of Ad26.Mos4.HIV
and a combination of aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140. Safety,
reactogenicity and immunogenicity will also be evaluated. The study population will include healthy adults
considered to be at increased risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. A target of 3,800 participants, consisting
of HIV-1-uninfected cis-gender men and transgender individuals having sex with cis-gender men and/or
transgender individuals, aged ≥18 to ≤60 years, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the study vaccine or
placebo. Randomization will be stratified by site. Sample size re-assessment may be performed based on
blinded study data or external study data (eg, Phase 2b Study HPX2008/HVTN 705). The target number of
HIV-1 infections may be re-assessed based on external study data (eg, Phase 2b Study HPX2008/HVTN
705) only.
Participants will receive intramuscular (IM) doses of study vaccine or placebo at four time points as
indicated in the table below.

C gp140 and 125 mcg Mosaic gp140 glycoprotein correspond with 80 mcg and 75 mcg of protein, respectively.
The
 study comprises of ascreening period of 45 days, a 12-month vaccination period and a follow-up period
of at least 18 months after the fourth vaccination (until Month 30) in participants who remain HIV-1
negative or up to 6 months after diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in participants who become HIV-1 infected.
Participants who completed their Month 30 visit will be followed for HIV infection, MAAEs and serious
adverse events until the end of the study (ie, when the last participant completed the Month 30 visit or
discontinued earlier). At the end of the study, participants may be offered the possibility to enter a long-
term follow-up phase or program (to collect, amongst others, additional durability data).
After vaccination, participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes for
presence of any acute reactions. In addition, participants will record solicited signs and symptoms in a diary
for 7 days post-vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events will be recorded for all participants until 28 days
after each preceding vaccination. AESIs will be collected until 6 months after the last vaccination. Serious
adverse events, MAAEs, and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be collected for all participants
until the end of the study.
An HIV test will be performed approximately every 3 months. Upon discretion of the investigator,
additional HIV tests may be performed during unscheduled visits; participants should refrain from
performing any HIV testing outside of the study protocol. Blood samples will be collected at specific visits
for determination of humoral immune responses (all participants) and for determination of cellular immune
responses (participants at sites with access to sponsor approved PBMC processing facilities). At specific
clinic visits, participants will complete Participant Reported Outcomes (PRO) questionnaires, including a
social impact questionnaire, a sexual activity questionnaire, a questionnaire on the use of PrEP and
questions with regard to the level of absenteeism and the vaccine regimen acceptance.
If a participant becomes HIV-1 infected during the study (confirmed HIV test), the participant will remain
in the study but no further scheduled vaccinations will be administered. The participant will be followed-up
until approximately 6 months after the diagnosis (see the Time and Events Schedule for Participants Who
Become HIV-1 Infected ) and will be referred to a local clinic for medical treatment and follow-up on their
HIV-1 infection as soon as possible after the diagnosis of the infection.
The sponsor and its partners are committed to ensuring that all study participants receive access to the
highest standard of prevention, which may include, but is not limited to, HIV testing, risk reduction
counseling, provision of male condoms and lubricants, access to management of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs), and appropriate referrals for PrEP and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) according to
national and/or local guidelines. Note: potential participants choosing to use PrEP will not be eligible for

be at increased risk of HIV acquisition. However, once enrolled in the study and having received their first
vaccination, aparticipant who changes his/her mind regarding PrEP use is permittedto take PrEP according
to the site PrEP planand will continue to receive further vaccinations. In case of PrEP use during the study,
safety monitoring for PrEP will be the responsibility of the prescribing physician. HIV testing should be
performed within the study to avoid unblinding due to VISP elicited by the vaccine. Participants should
refrain from HIV testing outside of the study protocol. As part of the study protocol, blood samples will be
collected for ARV detection in dried blood spot and stored at pre-specified sample collection days for
assessment of quantitative concentrations of tenofovir diphosphate. Additional ARV detection can be done
on stored blood samples if required as per the Study Specific Procedures Binder. The use of PrEP and
adherence to PrEP (if applicable) will be monitored by means of a questionnaire which will be completed
by all participants approximately every 3 months.
The NIAID HIV vaccine Data and Safety Monitoring Board (further referred to as DSMB) will serve as an
independent DSMB for this study and will monitor data on an ongoing basis to ensure the continuing safety
of the participants and will formally monitor the efficacy endpoint.
A COVID-19 Appendix provides guidance to investigators for managing study-related procedures during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
PARTICIPANT POPULATION
Screening for eligible participants will be performed within 45 days before the first administration of study
vaccine or placebo at Day 1.
Study participants must be healthy (on the basis of medical history, physical examination [including vital
sign measurement]), HIV-uninfected adult cis-gender men and transgender individuals having sex with cis-
gender men and/or transgender individuals, aged ≥18 to ≤60 years, who are considered to be at increased
risk for HIV infection. All efforts will be made to ensure that the study population includes good
representation from the population at highest risk of HIV infection in terms of race, ethnicity, gender and
age.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Each participant will receive doses of study vaccine or placebo at 4 time points according to randomization,
on Month 0 (Day 1), 3, 6, and 12, administered by IM injection into the deltoid. For visits with only one
injection (ie, at Month 0 [Day 1] and 3), preferably the deltoid of the non-dominant upper arm is used.
When 2 injections are to be given at one visit (ie, at Month 6 and 12), it is required to use a different deltoid
for each injection. Two injections in the same deltoid are allowed only if medically indicated.

EFFI
CACY  EVALUATIONS
An HIV test will be performed approximately every 3 months. Upon discretion of the investigator,
additional HIV  tests may be performed during unscheduled visits; participants should refrain from
performing any HIV testing outside of the study protocol. Testing will be performed according to a sponsor-
approved HIV testing algorithm that differentiates VISP (see below) from true HIV infection. An endpoint
adjudication process will be in place to assess all serological and virological testing, in a blinded manner,
on each participant in the study who, prior to study unblinding, tests positive per the sponsor-approved HIV
testing.
IMMUNOGENICITY  EVALUATIONS
Venous blood samples for determination of humoral immune responses will be collected from all
participants (and analyzed in a subset). Humoral immune responses may be assessed by the response
magnitude and frequency to the vaccine autologous Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140 proteins by total
immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding ELISA, or alternative assays. Baseline and post-vaccination Ad26
seropositivity and titer will be assessed in a subset of participants by vector neutralization assay.
Venous blood samples for determination of cellular immune responses will be collected from participants
at sites with access to sponsor approved PBMC processing facilities (and analyzed in a subset). Cellular
immune responses may be assessed by the response magnitude and frequency of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells generating interferon-γ ELISpot responses to cPTE Env peptide stimulation, or
alternative assays.
Additional exploratory immunogenicity assessments may be performed, which may include limited genetic
testing.
SAFETY  EVALUATIONS
Solicited adverse events, unsolicited adverse events, AESIs, serious adverse events, MAAEs, and adverse
events leading to discontinuation will be reported for all participants.
All serious adverse events and adverse events and special reporting situations, that are related to study
procedures or that are related to non-investigational (concomitant) sponsor products will be reported

withdrawal. Clinically relevant medical events not meeting the above criteria and occurring between
signing of ICF and the moment of first vaccination will be collected on the Medical History CRF page as
pre-existing conditions. Solicited adverse events, collected through a diary, will be recorded daily for each
vaccination from the moment of vaccination until 7 days post-vaccination. All other unsolicited adverse
events and special reporting situations will be reported for each vaccination from the moment of vaccination
until 28 days post-vaccination. From the time of local approval of protocol amendment 5 onwards, TTS is
considered to be an AESI. Thrombotic events and/or thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count below
the lower limit of normal (LLN) range for the testing lab) are considered to be potential AESIs. All AESIs,
including potential AESIs, will be reported to the sponsor from the moment of first vaccination until
6 months after the last vaccination. Each potential AESI will be reviewed to identify a TTS case. All serious
adverse events, MAAEs, and adverse events leading to discontinuation (regardless of the causal
relationship) are to be reported from the moment of first vaccination for the duration of the study.
After each vaccination, participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes
for presence of any acute reactions.
Occurrences of the following solicited administration site and systemic signs and symptoms will be
collected via a diary for 7 days post-vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days). The diary
will be used as a source document.
 Administration site: erythema, swelling (measured using the ruler supplied) and pain/tenderness.
 Systemic: fever (temperature measurement [measured at approximately the same time each day using
the thermometer supplied]), fatigue, headache, nausea, myalgia, chills, arthralgia, and vomiting.
PARTICIPANT REPORTED OUTCOMES
Social impact, vaccine regimen acceptance, sexual activity, absenteeism and PrEP use will be evaluated at
selected time points during the study, through questionnaires.
STATISTICAL METHODS
The primary analysis of VE will be based on the PP populationa. The primary population for the safety
analysis will be the full analysis set (FAS)b. For those with immunogenicity outcomes, analyses of vaccine
immunogenicity and immune correlates may be based on the mITT-3c population, PP population, at risk
immunogenicity cohort (IC-at risk)d, and the FISe, Other populations may be defined in the Statistical
Analysis Plan (SAP) for the purpose of exploratory (correlate) analyses.
The sample size calculations are based on the power of a 1-sided 0.025-level Wald test for comparing
cumulative incidences of HIV-1 infection by the Month x visit (24≤x≤30) between randomized groups, in
a PP p
opulation: participants in the FAS population who have a negative HIV test 4 weeks post 3rd vaccination visit
(ie, at the Month 7 visit), who received all planned vaccinations at the first 3 vaccination visits within the respective
visit windows.
b FAS: all randomized participants who receive at least one vaccine administration.
c mITT-3 population: participants in the FAS population who have a negative HIV test 4 weeks post 3rd vaccination
visit (ie, at the Month 7 Visit), who received all planned vaccinations at the first three vaccination visits. This will
be an additional population for efficacy analysis, and potentially for immune correlates.
d IC-at risk: participants in the FAS who are selected for measurement of immune response endpoints at the primary
immunogenicity timepoints and who are HIV-1 uninfected 4 weeks after the 3rd vaccination visit (ie, at the Month
7 visit).
e FIS: participants in the FAS who are HIV-1 uninfected 4 weeks after the 4th vaccination visit (ie, at the
Month 13 visit) and who receive all planned vaccinations within the respective visit windows.

studies using the R package seqDesign under the following assumptions:
 10% annual dropout incidence in both groups;
 5% of participants with at least one missed vaccination (excluded from PP population);
 VE= 20% in the first 7 months after first vaccination;
 VE= 65% from Month 7 onwards;
 12-month uniform accrual with halved accrual during the first 3 months;
 Visits approximately every 3 months for HIV-1 diagnostic tests;
 2% annual HIV-1 incidence in the placebo group;
Under these assumptions, a study population of 3,800 participants (randomized 1,900:1,900 to
vaccine:placebo) is expected to yield a total of 78 HIV-1 infections in the PP population between the
Month 7 and Month 30 visits, considered to be the TNI needed to achieve approximately 90% power for
rejecting the primary H0, under an alternative VE of 65% and with a one-sided error rate of 2.5%.
Efficacy Analyses
The primary analysis of VE will evaluate the number of HIV-1 infections in the vaccine group compared
to the number of HIV-1 infections in the placebo group between Month 7 and Month x (with 24≤x≤30) in
the PP population. The timing of the primary analysis will be determined by when the TNI is reached within
a given follow-up period x (24≤x≤30). The H0 of VE, ie, VE(7-x months) ≤20% will be tested versus the
H1, ie, VE(7-x months) >20%. Vaccine efficacy is defined as 1-cumulative incidence ratio (vaccine versus
placebo) between Month 7 and Month x after first vaccination and is estimated by the transformation of the
Nelson-Aalen estimator for the cumulative hazard function. If the lower bound of the 95% CI for
VE(7-x months) is >20% (equivalently, the 1-sided p-value for testing H0: VE[7-x months] ≤20% is below
0.025), the H0 will be rejected in favor of the H1.
As a key secondary objective, the VE beyond Month 7 will be evaluated in all participants, regardless of
whether they received the first three vaccinations according to the protocol-specified schedule (modified
intent-to-treat-2 [mITT-2]a). Other secondary objectives will evaluate the VE over different time intervals
(eg, VE[0-x months], VE[13-x months]) and in different populations (eg, mITT, mITT-2, mITT-3, FIS).
Immunogenicity Analyses
No formal hypothesis on immunogenicity will be tested. Descriptive statistics (actual values and changes
from reference) may be calculated for continuous parameters. Frequency tabulations may be calculated for
discrete parameters. Graphical representations of changes in immunologic parameters may be made as
applicable.
Safety Analyses
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be analyzed descriptively.

In the development of the prophylactic VAC89220 HIV-1 vaccine, the sponsor is currently
evaluating the following candidate components in clinical studies: Ad26.Mos4.HIV, (aluminum
phosphate-adjuvanted) Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140. For details see Section 14.1.
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding the VAC89220 HIV-1
vaccine, see the latest version of the Investigator's Brochures and Addenda for Ad26.Mos4.HIV,
Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140.
The term "sponsor" used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact
Information page(s), which will be provided as a separate document.
Other organizations, ie, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), Division of AIDS (DAIDS; a
division of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID] which is part of the
National Institutes of Health [NIH]) are also involved in this study and are referred to in this
protocol as "partners".
1.1. Background
1.1.1. Background on the Disease and Treatment
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus that, if left untreated, can progress
to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in which the immune system is
severely compromised, leading to life-threatening conditions. The main modes of transmission of
HIV-1 in the world, although varying significantly by region, are heterosexual transmission,
male-to-male transmission and intravenous drug use.34 The global prevalence of HIV-1 in 2017 is
estimated at 36.9 million (range: 31.1 to 43.9 million), which is an increase from previous years,
mainly explained by broader access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and a related longer
life of HIV-infected individuals. Approximately 53% of all people living with HIV have access to
ART. Despite an overall decline in HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths, the number of new
infections and the cost and morbidity associated with lifelong ART remain high. Worldwide,
1.8 million (range: 1.4 to 2.4 million) people became newly infected with HIV-1 in 2017.35 HIV
infection therefore continues to be a serious and potentially life-threatening condition of major
global public health interest.
A number of specific approaches are being employed or evaluated to reduce the spread of HIV-1,
but no single prevention method or approach utilized to date suggests that it will be able to stop
the epidemic on its own. Several methods and interventions have proved highly efficacious in
reducing the risk of, and protecting against, HIV infection, including male and female condoms,
the use of ARVmedicines as PrEP or as PEP, voluntary male medical circumcision, sexual activity
change interventions to reduce the number of sexual partners, STI testing and treatment, the use
of clean needles and syringes, opiate substitution therapy (eg, methadone) and the treatment of
people living with HIV to reduce viral load and prevent onward transmission (treatment as
prevention). Despite the availability of this widening array of efficacious HIV prevention tools

sufficiently.33,36
An effective, universal prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine could play a pivotal role in the so-called ‘HIV
prevention toolbox’, where several HIV prevention methods will be necessary to play a significant
role in controlling the spread of the infection.33,38
Evidence for the potential to develop a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine comes from study RV144
(sponsored by the United States Army Surgeon General, with vaccines manufactured by Sanofi
Pasteur and VaxGen). The study was conducted in more than 16,000 healthy adult Thai
participants who received recombinant canarypox vector encoding group-specific antigen (Gag),
polymerase (Pol), and Env proteins of HIV-1 (ALVAC-HIV [vCP1521]) vaccine followed by a
recombinant gp120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E). The vaccine afforded a modest (31%)
reduction in the rate of HIV-1 acquisition.30In contrast to the Thai study, two Phase 3 studies of
gp120 protein11,29 and three Phase 2b/3 studies using adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-vectored Gag,
Pol, and Negative Regulatory Factor (Nef) HIV-1 antigens7,16,17, failed to demonstrate protection.
Recently, study HVTN 702 or Uhambo, a Phase 2b/3 evaluating the efficacy of an investigational
heterologous vaccine regimen (ie, ALVAC-HIV [vCP2438] + Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59)
based on the regimen evaluated in the RV144 clinical study but adapted to HIV-1 Clade C which
is most common in southern Africa, was stopped early because the vaccine was not efficacious.48,49
A successful global HIV-1 vaccine will need to protect against the diverse strains and clades
predominating in the target populations in different geographic regions. There is growing evidence
that potent humoral responses with multiple effector functions combined with robust T cell
responses will be necessary attributes of an effective HIV-1 vaccine. The HIV-1 genes expressed
in the cytoplasm (eg, Gag and Pol) are primarily targeted by cytotoxic cellular immune responses,
whereas the Env gp is a primary target of humoral responses.26

A regimen consisting of a 2 Ad26 vaccinations followed by two Ad26 + Clade C gp140
vaccinations was first tested in non-human primate (NHP) immunogenicity study 13-04, which
showed that several differently composed heterologous Ad26/Clade C gp140 immunization
schedules were immunogenic and induced comparable broad reactivity and neutralization capacity
of diverse tier 1 Env pseudotyped viruses and a robust cellular immune response. This regimen
was further evaluated in an NHP efficacy study (13-19/15-06), which assessed several different
components and combinations thereof in the Ad26 Clade C gp140 schedule developed in 13-04.
This latest study showed that a combination of vaccination with Ad26.Mos.HIV followed by

highest level of protection observed so far with this vaccine concept. Eight/12 NHP (67%) had
complete protection after the full series of 6 intrarectal challenges with Simian HIV (SHIV)
SF162P3, an engineered virus consisting of the generic backbone of SIVmac239 with the envelope
gene and some accessory genes derived from HIV. Env-binding antibody responses and
Env-specific cellular immune responses were identified as important immunologic markers
associated with vaccine-mediated protection against SHIV-SF162P3 challenges.4
To expand the sequence coverage of our HIV-1 vaccine strategy, an additional component (the
novel Ad26.Mos2S.Env) was added to the trivalent vaccine to produce a tetravalent vaccine
(Ad26.Mos4.HIV). Immunogenicity and antigenicity of a selection of novel insert combinations
with the vectors under clinical development in Ad26.Mos.HIV were tested in rabbits (study
0095-14), which demonstrated that the proposed tetravalent adenovector combination shows
improved Clade C pseudovirus recognition in the absence of negative effects on Clade B
pseudovirus recognition and thus has the potential to substantially increase the breadth of humoral
immune responses of the full vaccine regimen.
In guinea pigs, it was shown that Clade C gp140 was able to induce neutralizing antibody responses
against a set of HIV-1 variants from different clades and with different neutralization sensitivities.
Furthermore, it was observed that the immunogenicity of Clade C gp140 was improved by an
aluminum-based adjuvant, and that these immunogenicity results were comparable in high and
low absorption formulations of aluminum phosphate and aluminum hydroxide, both in terms of
the binding antibody and neutralizing antibody responses induced.
Clade C gp140 was further evaluated as part of the heterologous adenovirus-based vector
(Ad26)/Clade C gp140 protein immunization schedules in a rhesus monkey SHIV challenge
model. The data confirmed the improved protective capacity of vaccine regimens including a
Clade C gp140 boost immunization.
Mosaic gp140 induced an increased breadth of immune responses when combined with Clade C
gp140 in guinea pigs, and in the context of Ad26 immunization in rabbits. Mosaic gp140 was
immunogenic in NHP and was able to boost Clade C gp140-specific immune responses.

Study VAC89220HPX2008/HVTN 705 (hereafter abbreviated to HPX2008/HVTN 705) is an
ongoing, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2b
proof-of-concept efficacy study in approximately 2,600 HIV-uninfected sexually active women
aged 18 to 35 years. The study is being conducted in approximately 25 sites, with the majority of
these throughout South Africa. Study participants were selected from populations at high risk of
acquiring HIV infection in southern Africa settings with overall moderate to high HIV incidence.
The predominant circulating HIV-1 is a Clade C virus. The study is investigating the preventive
vaccine efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a heterologous regimen with 4 vaccinations consisting
of tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV and aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140, with
vaccinations at Months 0, 3, 6, and 12. The primary analysis recently demonstrated that the vaccine
regimen did not provide statistically significant protection against HIV infection. The vaccine
efficacy over Months 7 to 24 in the per-protocol cohort did not differ significantly from zero, with
apoint estimate (95% confidence interval) of25% (-10% to 49%). The regimen did not cause harm
and was generally well-tolerated.23
Clinical Safety Experience With the Ad26.COV2.S Vaccine
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
[TTS]), in some cases accompanied by internal bleeding, has been observed following vaccination
with the Janssen COVID-19 (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccine . As of 31 August 2021, out of 33,584,049

reports of probable TTS cases were identified.a
 A total of 104 post-marketing events that met the Brighton TTS Case Definition Criteria
Level 1 to 3.5 This corresponds to a reporting ratio of 3.1 per million doses overall.
 A total of 67 post-marketing events that met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) TTS Case Definition Criteria Tier 1 to 2.32 This corresponds to a reporting ratio 2 per
million doses overall.
Reports include severe cases of venous thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus
thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis, in combination with
thrombocytopenia. Venous thrombosis cases have also been reported at more common sites, eg,
in the lower extremities. The onset of associated symptoms has usually been 1 to 4 weeks, but
sometimes even later following vaccination (up to 42 days as per the American Society of
Hematology 20212). TTS cases have been reported mostly in women under 60 years of age
although some cases of TTS have also been reported in men and in individuals older than 60 years
of age. Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia has been fatal in some cases. The exact
pathophysiology of TTS is unclear. This event has not been observed to date with any other
Janssen Ad26-based vaccines (including with Ad26.Mos4.HIV). Participants should be instructed
to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest
pain, leg pain or leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, severe or persistent headaches, blurred
vision, skin bruising or petechiae beyond the site of vaccination, changes in mental status or the
occurrence of seizures.
Knowledge about TTS continues to evolve, and updates will be made as new data become
available.
1.2. Benefit/Risk Section
1.2.1. Known Benefits
The clinical benefits of combinations of Ad26.Mos4.HIV and Clade C/Mosaic gp140 have yet to
be established.
1.2.2. Potential Benefits
Participants may benefit from clinical testing, physical examination and high standard sexual
health services; others may benefit from the knowledge that they may aid in the development of
an HIV-1 vaccine. Currently, there are no effective prophylactic HIV vaccines and no efficacy can
be concluded from current data. The overall benefit and risk balance for individual participants
thus cannot be ascertained. Participants must be informed that this vaccine is currently being tested
a Prob
able TTS is defined as a thrombotic/thromboembolic event reported in combination with a low platelet count
(thrombocytopenia).

1.2.3. Known Risks
Adverse drug reactions and/or adverse reactions to immunization have not yet been fully
characterized. As of 8 January 2019, 2200 healthy adult participants have been enrolled in ongoing
Ad26.Mos.HIV and Ad26.Mos4.HIV studies, of which 236 participants, for whom the treatment
assignment is known, received at least one vaccination with Ad26.Mos4.HIV. At that cut-off date,
2250 healthy adult participants have been enrolled in ongoing Clade C gp140 and Clade C gp140
in combination with Mosaic gp140 studies, of which 93 participants, for whom the treatment
assignment is known, received 250 mcg glycoprotein Clade C gp140 + Mosaic gp140. The
available nonclinical and clinical data for the study vaccines support the conclusion that the
vaccines have an acceptable safety profile with no emerging significant safety concerns to date.
As with any experimental product, the safety profile of the vaccines or of the vaccine regimen
cannot be fully defined until more clinical data are available.
1.2.4. Potential Risks
The following potential risks for Ad26.Mos4.HIV and Clade C/Mosaic gp140 will be monitored
during the study and are specified in the protocol and/or the Study-Specific Procedures Binder:
Risks Related to Vaccination
In general, IM injection may cause local itching, warmth, pain, tenderness, erythema/redness,
induration/swelling, arm discomfort or bruising of the skin at vaccine administration sites.
Participants may exhibit general signs and symptoms associated with administration of a vaccine,
or injection with placebo, including fever, chills, rash, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, headache,
dizziness, arthralgia, general itching, and fatigue. These side effects will be monitored but are
generally short-term and do not require treatment.
Syncope can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines. Syncope can be
accompanied by falls. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury. If syncope develops,
participants should be observed until the symptoms resolve. Fear of injection might lead to fainting
and fast breathing.
Participants may have an allergic reaction to the vaccination. An allergic reaction may cause a
rash, urticaria or even anaphylaxis. Severe reactions are rare. Participants with a known allergy, or
history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine products (including
any of the constituents of the study vaccine) will be excluded from the study.
Risks Related to Aluminum
Aluminum is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in air, food, and water.
Aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and aluminum potassium
sulphate have been used safely in vaccines for more than 70 years. A few studies reported an
association between vaccines containing aluminum  adjuvants and persistent nodules at the

exposures to aluminum from both diet and vaccines concluded that aluminum adjuvants at the
levels included in vaccines are well below the calculated body burden.43,44 A 2017 review found
that current data do not support a causal relationship between aluminum-containing vaccines and
a variety of autoimmune disorders.45
Risks Related to Vaccine-induced Seropositivity
Risks related to vaccine-induced seropositivity (VISP) are discussed in Section 9.2.
Pregnancy and Contraception
No preclinical developmental or reprotoxicity studies have yet been performed with
Ad26.Mos.HIV, Ad26.Mos4.HIV, Clade C gp140 or Mosaic gp140. However, a combined
embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development study has been conducted in rabbits with an
Ad26 vector in combination with another insert(Ad26ZEBOV, as part of a 2-dose vaccine regimen
with MVA-BN-Filo). In this study, there was no maternal or developmental toxicity observed
during premating and gestation period.
The sponsor is planning to conduct a combined embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development
study including Ad26.Mos4.HIV and a combination of aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C
gp140 and Mosaic gp140 in parallel with the Phase 3 HPX3002 study.
Since the effect of the study vaccines on a fetus or nursing baby is unknown, participants of
childbearing potential are required to agree to practice adequate contraception measures for sexual
intercourse from at least 21 days before the first vaccination until at least 90 days after the last
vaccination (see Section 4.1).
Risks from Blood Draws
As with all clinical studies requiring blood sampling, there are risks associated with venipuncture
and multiple blood sample collection. Blood drawing may cause pain, tenderness, bruising,
bleeding, dizziness, vaso-vagal response, syncope, and, rarely, infection at the site where the blood
is taken. The total blood volume to be collected is considered to be an acceptable amount of blood
over this time period from the population in this study (see Section 16.1).
Risks of genetic testing
The genetic testing could indicate risks for certain diseases, which could potentially lead to
discrimination of or other problems for the participant. However, the results are for exploratory
research purposes only and will not be provided to the participant.
Unknown Risks
There may be other risks that are not known. If any significant new risks are identified, the
investigators and participants will be informed.

Statu
s: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023Participants may believe that this vaccine provides protection against acquiring HIV infection, and
therefore practice riskier sexual activity. Participants must be informed that this vaccine is
currently being tested to determine whether it is efficacious, and it should be assumed that it is not
the case until clinical study data demonstrate efficacy. The overall benefit and risk balance for
individual participants thus cannot be ascertained.
In previous HIV-efficacy studies utilizing Ad5, increased HIV-1 infection was observed in vaccine
recipients as compared with placebo recipients. The mechanism for this possible increase in HIV-1
acquisition risk remains unclear, but a longstanding hypothesis suggested that activation of vector-
specific CD4+ T cells at mucosal surfaces following Ad5 vaccination potentially results in
increased targets for HIV-1 infection. However, a recent study demonstrated no long-term changes
in the activation state of mucosal CD4+ or CD8+ T cells after Ad5-vectored vaccination, regardless
of baseline Ad5 serostatus.10 Ad26 is substantially different from Ad5 in seroprevalence and
immunology, biology, and protective efficacy in NHP.
1.2.5. Overall Benefit/Risk Assessment
Based on the available data and proposed safety measures, the overall benefit/risk assessment for
this clinical study is considered acceptable for the following reasons:
 Safety data from the ongoing clinical studies revealed no significant safety issues (see
Section 1.1.2).
 Only participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (specified
in Section 4) will be allowed to participate in this study. The selection criteria include adequate
provisions to minimize the risk and protect the well-being of participants in the study.
 Safety will be closely monitored throughout the study:
 In general, safety evaluations will be performed at scheduled visits during the study, as
indicated in the Time and Events Schedule .
 After each vaccination, participants will remain in the clinic for a certain period and will
be closely observed by study staff. Necessary emergency equipment and medications
must be available in the clinic to treat severe allergic reactions. Participants will use a
diary to document solicited administration site and systemic signs and symptoms. Details
are provided in Section 9.1.1.
 The investigator or the designee will document unsolicited adverse events, SAEs,
MAAEs and (potential) adverse events of special interest (AESIs) as indicated in
Section 12.3.1.
 Any clinically significant abnormalities (including those persisting at the end of the
study/early withdrawal) will be followed by the investigator until resolution or until a
clinically stable endpoint is reached.
 Several safety measures are included in this protocol to minimize the potential risk to
participants, including the following:
 The NIAID HIV Vaccine DSMB (further referred to as DSMB) will serve as an
independent DSMB for this study and will monitor data on an ongoing basis to ensure the

DSMB review for any single event or combination of multiple events which, in their
professional opinion, could jeopardize the safety of the participants or the reliability of
the data.
 Participants will discontinue study vaccine for the reasons included in Section 10.2.
 Contraindications to vaccination are included in Section 10.3.
 If acute illness (excluding minor illnesses such as diarrhea or mild upper-respiratory tract
infection) or fever (body temperature ≥38.0°C) occur at the scheduled time for
vaccination, vaccination will be temporarily contraindicated. However, the participant
may be vaccinated later, within the window allowed for the scheduled vaccination (see
Section 10.3).
1.3. Overall Rationale for the Study
The proposed Phase 3 clinical study VAC89220HPX3002/HVTN 706 (hereafter referred to as
HPX3002/HVTN 706) will aim to demonstrate the efficacy of a heterologous HIV-1 vaccine
regimen consisting of Ad26.Mos4.HIV and a combination of aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted
Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140.

3. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
3.1. Overview of Study Design
This is a multi-center, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 study
to demonstrate efficacy of a heterologous prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine regimen consisting of
Ad26.Mos4.HIV and a combination of aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 and
Mosaic gp140. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity will also be evaluated. The study
population will include healthy adults considered to be at increased risk of acquiring HIV-1
infection. A target of 3,800 participants, consisting of HIV-1-uninfected cis-gender men and
transgender individuals having sex with cis-gender men and/or transgender individuals, aged ≥18
to ≤60 years, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the study vaccine or placebo. Randomization will
be stratified by site. All efforts will be made to ensure that the study population includes good
representation of the population at the highest risk of HIV infection in terms of race, ethnicity,
gender identity and age. Participants will receive IM doses of study vaccine or placebo at 4 time
points: Ad26.Mos4.HIV or placebo will be given at Months 0 (Day 1) and 3; Ad26.Mos4.HIV
together with a co-formulation of aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 and
Mosaic gp140, or placebo will be given at Months 6 and 12 (see Table 2). Sample size
re-assessment may be performed based on blinded study data or external study data (eg, Phase 2b
Study HPX2008/HVTN 705). The target number of HIV-1 infections may be re-assessed based on
external study data (eg, Phase 2b Study HPX2008/HVTN 705) only.

follow-up period of at least 18 months after the fourth vaccination (until Month 30) in participants
who remain HIV-1 negative or up to 6 months after diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in participants
who become HIV-1 infected. Participants who completed their Month 30 visit will be followed for
HIV infection, MAAEs and serious adverse events until the end of the study (ie, when the last
participant completed the Month 30 visit or discontinued earlier). At the end of the study,
participants may be offered the possibility to enter a long-term follow-up phase or program (to
collect, amongst others, additional durability data).

30 minutes for presence of any acute reactions. In addition, participants will record solicited signs
and symptoms in a diary for 7 days post-vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events will be recorded
forall participants until 28 days after each preceding vaccination. From the time of local approval
of protocol amendment 5 onwards, TTS is considered to be an AESI. Thrombotic events and/or
thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count below the lower limit of normal (LLN) range for the
testing lab) are considered to be potential AESIs. All AESIs, including potential AESIs, will be
reported to the sponsor from the moment of first vaccination until 6 months after the last
vaccination. Each potential AESI will be reviewed to identify a TTS case. Serious adverse events,
MAAEs, and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be collected for all participants until
the end of the study. For details on reporting period of unsolicited adverse events, MAAEs, and
serious adverse events, see Section 9.4. In addition, physical examinations, which includes vital
sign measurements, and pregnancy testing will be performed.
An HIV test will be performed approximately every 3 months. Upon discretion of the investigator,
additional HIV tests may be performed during unscheduled visits; participants should refrain from
performing any HIV testing outside of the study protocol. Blood samples will be collected at
specific visits for determination of humoral immune responses (all participants) and for
determination of cellular immune responses (at selected sites). Participants will complete PRO
questionnaires, including a social impact questionnaire, a sexual activity questionnaire and a
questionnaire on the use ofPrEP and questions with regard to the level of absenteeism and the
vaccine regimen acceptance. For details, see the Time and Events Schedule .
If a participant becomes HIV-infected during the study (confirmed HIV test), the participant will
remain in the study but no further scheduled vaccinations will be administered. Participants will
be followed-up until up to 6 months after the diagnosis and will be referred to a local clinic for
medical treatment and follow-up on their HIV-1 infection as soon as possible after the diagnosis
of the infection. Assessments during the 6-month study follow-up will be performed according to
theTime and Events Schedule for Participants Who Become HIV-1 Infected .
The sponsor and its partners are committed to ensuring that all study participants receive access to
the highest standard of prevention, which may include, but is not limited to, HIV testing, risk
reduction counseling, provision of male condoms and lubricants, access to management of STIs,
and appropriate referrals for PrEP and PEP according to national and/or local guidelines. Note:
potential participants choosing to use PrEP will not be eligible for participation in the study as,
due to the high effectiveness of PrEP, these individuals are not considered to be at increased risk
of HIV acquisition. However, once enrolled in the study and having received their first vaccination,
a participant who changes his/her mind regarding PrEP use is permitted to take PrEP according to
the site PrEP plan and will continue to receive further vaccinations. In case of PrEP use during the
study, safety monitoring for PrEP will be the responsibility of the prescribing physician. HIV
testing should be performed within the study to avoid unblinding due to VISP elicited by the
vaccine. Participants should refrain from HIV testing outside of the study protocol. As part of the
study protocol, blood samples will be collected for ARV detection in dried blood spot and stored
at pre-specified sample collection days for assessment of quantitative concentrations of tenofovir

3.2. Study Design Rationale
Vaccines and Dose Selection Rationale
The sponsor and its partners has evaluated and are evaluating different candidate HIV-1 vaccine
components in different clinical studies, results of which formed the basis of the vaccine regimen
selection for the the Phase 3 study HPX3002/HVTN 706.
Based on immunologic responses observed in the Phase 1/2a study HIV-V-A004, a regimen of
vaccination with the Ad26.Mos.HIV vaccine at Months 0 (Day 1) and 3 and vaccination with the
Ad26.Mos.HIV vaccine and aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 at Months 6 and 12
has been selected over other regimens. The pre-clinical NHP study NHP 13-19/15-06 (in which
the vaccination regimens reflect to a large extent the regimens in the HIV-V-A004 clinical study)
indicated that this vaccination regimen showed the highest per exposure risk reduction (94%),
which was associated with 67% complete protection after a series of 6 weekly intrarectal SHIV
challenges.4
Based on the magnitude of immunologic responses observed in the Phase 1 study HIV-V-A003
and in the Phase 1/2a study HIV-V-A004, a 250-mcg glycoprotein dose of aluminum
phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 has been selected over a 50-mcg glycoprotein dose.
Based on interim (Month 7 [Week 28; 4 weeks post 3rd vaccination], approximately
60 participants) results of the Phase 1/2a study HPX2004/HVTN 117 showing better
immunogenicity for Clade C and other clades, the tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV was selected for
evaluation in the Phase 2b proof-of-efficacy study HPX2008/HVTN 705. Consequently, a
heterologous regimen with the tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV and a 250-mcg dose of aluminum
phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 is being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 2b study
HPX2008/HVTN 705. This study is being performed in female participants in sub-Saharan Africa
where circulating viruses are predominantly of subtype (Clade) C. The primary analysis results of
HPX2004/HVTN 117, including Month 7 data of all participants confirm the choice of the tetra-
over the trivalent Ad26 vaccine.21,22Therefore, the Ad26.Mos4.HIV will be used for the proposed
Phase 3 efficacy study HPX3002/HVTN 706.

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023Based on the primary analysis of HPX2003/HVTN 118 and HPX2004/HVTN 117, the
combination of aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140 was selected
for inclusion in the 3rdand 4thvaccinations over the Clade C gp140 alone. In line with the bivalent
nature of the Env and Gag-Pol encoding Ad26 vectors, a bivalent mixture of gp140 proteins, which
have complementary sequences, is anticipated to provide better coverage of the circulating strains
of HIV-1 globally, than either component alone. The favorable safety profile of Clade C gp140
was maintained by replacing half of the Clade C gp140 dose with Mosaic gp140, while maintaining
the same total glycoprotein dose of 250 mcg (corresponding to a total protein dose of 155 mcg).
Peak immune responses post 3rd vaccination were highly comparable between the 2 regimens and
similar levels ofClade C-specific humoral and cellular responses were observed, demonstrating
that a region-specific vaccine is not needed. The immune responses induced by the combination
of Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140 show broad Env-specific binding and functional humoral
responses, as well as high frequencies of Env-specific T cell responses and improved Clade B Env
binding antibody responses without compromising Clade C Env binding antibody responses. In
addition, a combination of Clade C and Mosaic gp140 is preferred due to the efficient
manufacturability of Mosaic gp140, which results in higher yields compared to Clade C gp140,
thereby contributing to a continuous vaccine supply.
This last step of the final regimen selection was based on the Month 7 (Week 28; 4 weeks post 3rd
vaccination) results of HPX2003/HVTN 118. The Month 13 (Week 52; 4 weeks post 4th
vaccination) analysis results of HPX2003/HVTN 118 strengthened the original choice of the
combination of aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140 over the
Clade C gp140 alone.
Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Treatment Groups
A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency in clinical endpoints that may occur in
the absence of active vaccine. Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of
participants to treatment groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown participant
attributes (eg, demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment
groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. In addition,
randomization will be stratified by site. Blinded vaccination will be used to reduce potential bias
during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.
The independent DSMB will monitor data on a 6-monthly basis to ensure the continuing safety of
the participants enrolled in this study. The independent DSMB will review unblinded data.
4. PARTICIPANT POPULATION
Screening for eligible participants will be performed within 45 days before administration of the
first study vaccination.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling participants in this study are described in the
following 2 subsections. If there is a question about the inclusion or exclusion criteria below, the

5. STUDY VACCINE ALLOCATION AND BLINDING
Study Vaccine Allocation
Procedures f or Randomization and Stratif ication
Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio based on a
computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision
of the sponsor. The randomization will be balanced by using permuted blocks and will be stratified
by study site. Based on this randomization code, the study vaccine/placebo will be packaged and
labeled for each participant.
Central randomization will be implemented in this study. The interactive web response system
(IWRS) will assign a unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment assignment and
matching study vaccine/placebo vial for the participant. The requestor must use his or her own
user identification and personal identification number when contacting the IWRS and will then
give the relevant participant details to uniquely identify the participant.
Blinding
The study participants, study-site personnel (except for those with primary responsibility for study
vaccine preparation and dispensing), and investigator will be blinded to study vaccine allocation
until the end of the study (see Section 10.1). The sponsor and its partners will be blinded to study

visit (with 24≤x≤30).
The pharmacist with primary responsibility for vaccine preparation (see Section 14.3) will not be
blinded to the study vaccine. In order to preserve blinding, he/she will place an overlay on the
syringes. Administration of study vaccine to the participants will be performed by a blinded
qualified healthcare provider from the study site.
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes during the study. The codes will
be 
maintained within the IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the
blind for an individual participant.
Data that may potentially unblind the treatment assignment will be handled with special care to
ensure that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can
include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the
investigators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding.
Participants who discontinue vaccination early will be reminded that no HIV testing should be
performed outside the study protocol to avoid unblinding.
Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken by the investigator until the end of
the study and the electronic data capture (eDC) database is finalized unless it is essential for the
timely management of the participant. In this case, the investigator may determine the identity of
the treatment by contacting the IWRS. While the responsibility to break the code in emergency
situations resides solely with the investigator, it is recommended that the investigator contacts the
HPX3002/HVTN 706 safety review team if possible to discuss the particular situation, before
breaking the blind. Telephone contact with the sponsor or its partners will be available 24 hours
per day, 7 days per week. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor and its partners must be
informed as soon as possible. The date and reason for the unblinding must be documented by the
IWRS, in the appropriate section of the case report form (CRF), and in the source document. The
documentation received from the IWRS indicating the code break must be retained with the
participant's source documents in a secure manner.
Participants who have had their treatment assignment unblinded due to safety reasons should
continue to return for safety and immunogenicity evaluations and efficacy (see Section 10.2), but
will be withdrawn from further study vaccine administration.
6. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Participants will be vaccinated at the study site according to the schedule detailed in Section 3.1.
For description of the vaccinations, see Section 14.1.
Each participant will receive doses of study vaccine or placebo at four time points according to
randomization, on Month 0 (Day 1), 3, 6, and 12, administered by IM injection, preferably into the
deltoid muscle. In case an alternative site is needed, please refer to the Study Specific Procedures
Binder. For visits with only one injection (ie, at Month 0 [Day 1] and 3), preferably the deltoid of
the non-dominant upper arm is used. When 2 injections are to be given at one visit (ie, at Month 6

deltoid are allowed only if medically indicated.
For information on vaccination windows, see Section 9.1.2. Every effort should be made to follow
the vaccination schedule per the protocol. Vaccinations should generally not be administered
outside the predefined visit window(see Section 9.1.2). If a participantcannot be vaccinated within
the predefined window, the HPX3002/HVTN 706 safety review team can determine on a case-by-
case basis if the participant can still be vaccinated. Note that cases of out of window vaccination
due to per protocol allowed COVID-19 vaccination (see Section 8) should be notified to the
sponsor and do not need safety review team approval. There should be a time interval of at least
28 days between study vaccinations.

is prohibited. Other licensed vaccines (eg, tetanus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, for details on
COVID-19 vaccines, see below) should be given at least 14 days before or after administration of
first or subsequent study vaccination(s) in order to avoid potential confusion of adverse reactions
and potential immune interference. If a vaccine is indicated in a post-exposure setting (eg, rabies
or tetanus), it must take priority over the study vaccine.
Vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines that have been either licensed or authorized for emergency
use (eg, EUA, EUL, or similar program) must take priority over the study vaccine. The interval
between study vaccination and administration of a recombinant viral vectored COVID-19 vaccine
or a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine should be at least 28 days. The interval between study
vaccination and administration of other types of COVID-19 vaccines (eg, mRNA vaccines,
protein-based vaccines) should be at least 14 days.
Treatment with HIV-related mAbs, whether licensed or investigational, during the study is
disallowed.
Chronic or recurrent use of immunomodulators/suppressors, eg, cancer chemotherapeutic agents
or systemic corticosteroids, is prohibited (after discussion with the HPX3002/HVTN 706 safety
review team) starting from 1 month before the planned administration of the first dose of study
vaccine until 1 month after the last vaccination. If participants require these medications, they will
be withdrawn from the study vaccine administration (See Section 10.2). Note: Ocular, topical or
inhaled steroids are allowed.
For participants who become HIV infected, all ARVs and all concomitant therapies administered
in conjunction with new or worsening adverse events reported per protocol requirements should
be reported.
The HPX3002/HVTN 706 safety review team must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible
thereafter) of any instances in which prohibited therapies are administered.

The Time and Events Schedule summarizes the frequency and timing of efficacy (HIV testing;
refer to the Study-Specific Procedures Binder for more information) immunogenicity and safety
measurements applicable to this study.
Evaluation of the safety/tolerability of the vaccine regimens will include physical examinations by
clinical staff, vital signs assessments and signs and symptoms following vaccinations. Additional
unscheduled study visits may be required if in the investigator’s opinion, further clinical or
laboratory evaluation is needed.
Participants will be provided with a thermometer (to measure body temperature), ruler (to measure
local administration site reactions), and participant diary to record body temperature and solicited
administration site and systemic signs and symptoms.
The diary includes instructions on how to capture the data and grading scales to assess severity of
the signs and symptoms. The study staff is responsible for providing appropriate training to the
participant to avoid missing or incorrect data (refer to Study-Specific Procedures Binder). If a
participant misses a vaccination, the diary covering the period after the missed vaccination does
not have to be filled in.
Venous blood samples will be collected for humoral immunogenicity testing (all participants;
analyzed in a subset) and for cellular immunogenicity testing (participants at sites with access to
sponsor approved PBMC processing facilities; analyzed in a subset).
To determine VE, venous blood samples will be collected for HIV testing. HIV testing should be
performed per the sponsor-approved algorithm as described in the Study Specific Procedures
Binder.
9.1.2. Visit Windows
The maximum screening period is 45 days, except for HIV testing which needs to be performed
within 28 days prior to first vaccination.
The timings of the visits will be determined relative to the actual day of the first vaccination. For
the study visits, following windows will be allowed:
Visit 2a: (Day 9) ± 7 days#
Visit 3: Month 3 (Day 84) ± 14 days
Visit 3a: (Day 92)* ± 7 days#

(Day 168) and Visit 7 (Day 364), the timings of the study site Visits 5 and 8 and follow-up contact
Visits 3a, 4a and 7a, will be scheduled relative to the actual day of vaccination.
# The site staff and the participant will make multiple efforts in good faith to be in contact after
the last day of the reactogenicity period, or sooner if indicated, to discuss presence of any signs
and symptoms of reactogenicity. Participants who self-report any post-vaccination reaction greater
than mild are seen by a clinician within 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is improving
and/or has resolved completely.
Every effort should be made to follow the vaccination schedule per the protocol. Vaccinations
should generally not be administered outside the prespecified window. If a participant cannot be
vaccinated within the predefined window, the HPX3002/HVTN 706 safety review team can
determine on a case-by-case basis if the participant can still be vaccinated. Note that cases of out
of window vaccination due to per protocol allowed COVID-19 vaccination (see Section 8) should
be notified to the sponsor and do not need safety review team approval. There should be a time
interval of at least 28 days between study vaccinations.
The allowed time window for the follow-up visits scheduled every 3 months post Month 30 is ±
28 days. Visits post Month 30 will be scheduled relative to the Month 30 visit.
For participants who become HIV-1 infected, the timings of the follow-up visits will be determined
relative to the date of diagnosis, which is the date of the initial positive HIV test result. Following
time windows will be allowed:
Visit #.X  as soon as possible after the initial positive HIV test result.
This could be either a scheduled or unscheduled visit.
Visit Inf1: Month 3(Day 84) ± 28 days
Visit Inf2: Month 6(Day 168) ± 28 days
9.1.3. Screening Phase (Day -45 to Month 0)

study. All the procedures described in the Time and Events Schedule , except for the TOU, will
only take place after written informed consent has been obtained.
Screening may be conducted in part via a protocol team (cross-functional) and Institutional Review
Board (IRB)/Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC)-pre-approved non-study-specific screening
consent process, but only if the relevant pre-screening tests match the per protocol screening tests
and are within 45 days (28 days for HIVtest) prior to first vaccination. However, no study-specific
procedures, other than screening assessments, will be performed until the potential participant has
signed the study-specific ICF. The study-specific ICF date will be entered into the CRF. The
non-study-specific ICF will be considered source data.
Each potential participant must pass the TOU (see Section 16.1and Attachment 2 ), indicating that
he or she understands the purpose of, and procedures required for the study, after reading the
informed consent and after the investigator or designee has provided detailed information on the
study and has answered the potential participant’s questions. Each participant must subsequently
sign the ICF, indicating that he or she is willing to participate in the study.
The following evaluations will be performed to determine eligibility requirements as specified in
the inclusion and exclusion criteria:
 Demographics (eg, sex assigned at birth, participant-identified gender at screening, age, male
circumcision, race) and Medical history (Note in addition to medical history to determine
eligibility requirements, history and family history of immune disorders will be recorded)
 Full physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and clinical assessments of
head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; heart; chest; abdomen; extremities;
neurological function; and skin
 Review of prestudy medications as specified in Section 8
 Counseling on avoidance of HIV infection
 Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria
 HIV testing (including pre- and post-HIV-test counseling). The screening HIV test should be
performed within 28 days prior to first vaccination
 Participants of childbearing potential: serum -hCG pregnancy testing
General eligibility for this clinical study will be dependent on results of the medical assessment.
After medical history and physical examination data have been reviewed for completeness and
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria, the potential participant can be deemed to be eligible for
the study. Eligible participants will be contacted and scheduled for vaccination (Visit 2) within 45
days from signing ICF.
At screening, blood samples for syphilis serology determination will be collected and the presence
of chlamydia/gonorrhea will be tested using (1) a urine sample, (2) a rectal swab, and (3) an
oropharyngeal swab. If required by standard local procedure, the collection of a urethral swab will

Potential participants with vital signs not meeting eligibility criteria on the screening visit may
have one repeat testing during the screening period if the abnormality is not clinically significant
and may be a testing aberrancy. The screening visit may be split into multiple days/visits.
All serious adverse events and adverse events and special reporting situations, that are related to
study procedures or that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will be recorded on
the CRF, from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until the end of the study/early
withdrawal, together with information about concomitant medications as specified in Section 8.
If a potential participant is a screen failure, but at some point in the future is expected to meet the
participant eligibility criteria, the potential participant may be rescreened on one occasion only.
Potential participants who are rescreened will be assigned a new participant number, undergo the
informed consent process, and then restart a new screening phase. In case a potential participant is
rescreened, there is no need to repeat the STI tests (syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea), unless the
STItest results were performed more than 3 months prior to the planned first vaccination or unless
clinically indicated. Previous STI test results can be used provided these are not older than 3
months. If the previous STI test was performed more than 3 months prior to the first vaccination
or if clinically indicated, the STI testing needs to be repeated.
9.1.4. Vaccination
Visit 2/Randomization/Vaccination 1
After re-check of inclusion/exclusion criteria (including concomitant medication), a targeted,
symptom-directed physical examination (including weight measurement and vital sign
measurement), and a urine pregnancy test (for participants of childbearing potential), eligible
participants will be randomized as described in Section 5.
If medical status and/or physical examination suggest(s) significant changes have occurred since
screening, the clinically relevant screening assessments, if applicable, will be repeated and the
Month 0 (Day 1) visit rescheduled, provided that the rescheduled visit is within 45 days of the
initial screening assessment.
Blood samples for HIV testing and humoral (pre-dose; all participants) and cellular (pre-dose; at
sites with access to sponsor approved PBMC processing facilities) immunogenicity assays will be
collected.
Participants will be provided with a thermometer, ruler, and participantdiary to measure and record
solicited signs and symptoms. Solicited adverse events will be recorded daily for 7 days post-

9.1.5. Post-vaccination Follow-up Phase
Participants who have been prematurely withdrawn from study vaccine administration will be
encouraged to complete the visit schedule as planned with assessments per the Time and Event
Schedule , including assessments of safety and HIV diagnosis. Participants who received the first
3 vaccinations but discontinue study vaccination before receiving the 4th vaccination, should
continue the visit schedule as planned with assessments per the Time and Event Schedule including
assessments of safety, immunogenicity and HIV diagnosis. They will also be reminded not to have
HIV testing outside of the study protocol as this could lead to misdiagnosis and unblinding.
Visits 2a, 3a, 4a and 7a
The site staff and the participant will make multiple efforts in good faith to be in contact after the
last day of the reactogenicity period, or sooner if indicated, to discuss the presence of any signs
and symptoms of reactogenicity. Clinic staff will follow new or unresolved reactogenicity
symptoms present at the last day of the reactogenicity assessment period to resolution. Participants
are instructed to contact the clinic for events that arise during the period between vaccination and
the next scheduled visit. In general, a participant who self-reports any postvaccination reaction
greater than mild is seen by a clinician within 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is improving
and/or has resolved completely.

Month 30 will be scheduled relative to the Month 30 visit. At approximately Month 36 and from
then onwards approximately on an annual basis, gender identity should be recorded. Upon
discretion of the investigator, additional HIV tests may be performed during unscheduled visits;
participants should refrain from performing any HIV testing outside of the study protocol. Serious
adverse events, MAAEs and adverse events leading to study discontinuation will be recorded. The
use of PrEP, PEP, hormonal therapy, hormone-based contraception, all COVID-19 vaccinations,
and all other concomitant therapies administered in conjunction with new or worsening adverse
events reported per protocol requirements will be recorded. A urine pregnancy test is to be
performed every 3 to 6 months. The level of absenteeism since their last visit will be recorded.
Approximately every 6 months, blood samples for syphilis serology determination should be
collected and tests for chlamydia/gonorrhea should be performed.
9.1.7. Visits for Participants who Become HIV-1 Infected During the Study
If a participant has a positive HIV test during the study, the participants will have a visit (Visit
#.X, scheduled or unscheduled visit as soon as possible after the initial positive test) to perform a
confirmatory HIV test, viral load measurement, and CD4+ cell count (tested locally). In addition,
a blood sample for limited genetic testing will be collected. Counseling on HIV testing and
diagnosis and transmission reduction will be provided, and a targeted physical examination will
be performed. In addition, the level of absenteeism since their last visit will be recorded. Blood
samples for immunogenicity assays (humoral immune response from all participants and cellular
response from participants at sites with access to sponsor approved PBMC processing facilities)
and viral sequencing will be collected and may be analyzed when required. Solicited and
unsolicited adverse events will be recorded, if visit is within the 7 and 28 days post-vaccination
window, respectively. AESIs will be recorded until 6 months after last vaccination. Serious
adverse events, MAAEs and events leading to study discontinuation will be recorded for all
participants until the end of the study.
The study staff will receive a report confirming the HIV-1 diagnosis. Participants with a negative
HIV test may continue study vaccinations as planned. The participant with confirmed HIV-1 will
remain in the study but no further scheduled vaccinations will be administered. These participants
will be referred to a local clinic for medical treatment and follow-up on their HIV-1 infection as
soon as possible after the diagnosis of the infection and will have 2 additional follow-up visits
(Visit Inf1 and Visit Inf2 approximately at Month 3 and Month 6 after the initial positive HIV test
result, respectively). At these visits, procedures will be the same as for Visit #.X, except that no
HIV test will be performed, no blood sample for limited genetic testing will be collected,

investigator/site staff, the completion of the social impact questionnaire can cause undue burden
to the participant, it can be omitted. Clear documentation on the rationale should be taken up in
the source document. A urine pregnancy test (participants of childbearing potential) will be
performed at each visit.
Once the last subject has completed the Month 30 visit of the Time and Events Schedule for HIV-1

participants still in the study at that time will be informed that they should return to the site for the
Visit #.X, if not completed yet, but no further site visits will be required.
9.1.8. Early Withdrawal/Exit Visit
In the event of early withdrawal from the study, an exit visit will be conducted as soon as possible.
The following procedures will be performed: a targeted symptom-directed physical examination
(including weight and vital signs measurement), recording of any adverse events (solicited and
unsolicited adverse events or AESIs, ifapplicable, and MAAEs and serious adverse events for all
participants), blood sampling for immunogenicity (humoral immune response), and HIV testing.
The use of PrEP, PEP, hormonal therapy, hormone-based contraception, and all COVID-19
vaccinations should be recorded. All other concomitant therapies should also be recorded if
administered in conjunction with new or worsening adverse events reported per protocol
requirements. A sexual activity questionnaire and social impact questionnaire will be completed.
In addition, the level of absenteeism since their last visit will be recorded. HIV risk reduction
counseling will be provided to all participants and participants will complete a questionnaire on
the use of and, if applicable, adherence to PrEP. A urine pregnancy test (participants of
childbearing potential) will be performed.
In the event of withdrawal from participants who become HIV-1 infected during the follow-up, an
exit visit will be conducted as soon as possible. Procedures will be similar as for Visit Inf1
specified in Section 9.1.7.
9.2. Efficacy Evaluations
An HIV test will be performed approximately every 3 months (see Time and Events schedule ). To
avoid delays in initiation of combined antiretroviral treatment, local HIV PCR testing is allowed
only in case of suspected acute HIV infection, in case of recent HIV exposure, or in case a request
for sample redraw is received from the central HIV testing laboratory for confirmation of an HIV
positive test. Upon discretion of the investigator, additional HIV tests may be performed during
unscheduled visits; participants should refrain from performing any HIV testing outside of the
study protocol. Testing will be performed according to a sponsor-approved HIV-1-testing
algorithm that differentiates VISP (see below) from true HIV-1 infection. An endpoint
adjudication process will be in place to assess all serological and virological testing, in a blinded

sponsor-approved HIV testing.
If a participant has a confirmed positive HIV test during the study, the participant will remain in
the study but no further scheduled vaccinations will be administered. The study staff will receive
a report confirming the diagnosis. Confirmed HIV-1 infection should not be recorded as (serious)
adverse event. The participants will be provided counseling, will be referred for medical treatment
and, if applicable, will be informed about observational studies monitoring participants with HIV
infection. Further assessments, including HIV-1 viral load measurements, CD4+ T cell count, and
viral sequencing (samples taken in all participants and analyzed to assess whether VE differs by
genotypic characteristics of HIV and whether there is evidence of vaccine-induced immune
pressure on the viral genotype, depending on the vaccine efficacy outcome) will then be performed
according to the Time and Events Schedule for Participants Who Become HIV-1 Infected.
VISP
In general, HIV-uninfected participants in preventative HIV-vaccine studies may develop
HIV-specific antibodies as a result of an immune response to the candidate HIV-1 vaccine, referred
to as VISP (also known as VISR). These antibodies may be detected in common HIV-serologic
tests, causing the test to appear positive even in the absence of actual HIV infection. Vaccine-
induced seropositivity may become evident during the study or after the study has been completed.
In a preliminary analysis from study HIV-V-A004, using commercially available 4th generation
ELISA test kits, VISP developed in a high percentage of the participants starting after the 1st
vaccination and increasing to >90% at all subsequent vaccination time points. The full duration of
VISP is not yet clear but VISP persisted to Week 96 (96%) and Week 120 (92%). The collection
of VISP data is continuing during the long-term extension of the HIV-V-A004 study and in specific
other Janssen-sponsored clinical studies to clarify the exact incidence of VISP and its duration.
Study participants have to be made aware of the risk of VISP. Study sites must ensure that study
participants understand the social risk of a positive test if it is conducted by an insurance company,
employer, government agency, blood bank, or other institution that is unaware of the
characteristics of the HIV vaccines or that the participant is or has been enrolled in an HIV-1
vaccine study.
The current study will utilize a diagnostic algorithm to distinguish HIV-1 infection from VISP.
More information is provided in the Study-Specific Procedures Binder. Should an HIV-Ab test
give a positive result for a particular participant during the study, the central lab will carry out a
follow-up testing algorithm either to exclude or confirm HIV infection. Further details of this
algorithm are given in the Study-Specific Procedures Binder.
To avoid possible unblinding as a result of positive HIV testing due to VISP, participants should
not donate blood, blood products or sperm during the study. Participants should also refrain from
performing any HIV testing outside of the study protocol as this could lead to misdiagnosis and
unblinding. Blood donation options for those participants who wish to resume blood donation after

us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023In the case of VISP, if, either during the study or after the end of the study, a participant requires
an HIV test outside the study (eg, to obtain a travel visa or insurance, or for medical reasons), they
should contact the site. The sponsor or its designee can issue a written statement giving details on
VISP and on the testing algorithm to be followed. If requested by a participant, HIV testing will
be available to confirm their HIV status upon discretion of the investigator. Preferably, the
frequency of HIV testing should not exceed once every 3 months. It is highly preferable that this
repeat HIV testing will be performed through the site. After the study, testing for a particular
participant will be available as long as VISP is present for this participant.
In addition to providing testing, participants will always receive pre- and post-test HIV counseling.
In participants who become HIV-infected, samples for viral sequencing will be collected. These
samples will only be analyzed upon discretion of the study responsible virologist.
9.3. Immunogenicity Evaluations
Venous blood samples for determination of humoral responses to vaccination will be collected
from all participants (and analyzed in a subset) at the time points indicated in the Time and Events
Schedules . Humoral immune response may be assessed by the response magnitude and frequency
to the vaccine autologous Clade C gp140 and Mosaic gp140 proteins by total IgG binding ELISA,
or alternative assays. At baseline and post-vaccination, Ad26 seropositivity status and titer will be
assessed in a subset of participants by vector neutralization assay.
Venous blood samples for determination of cellular immune responses to vaccination will be
collected from a subset of participants at sites with access to sponsor approved PBMC processing
facilities (and analyzed in a subset) at the time points indicated in the Time and Events Schedules .
Cellular immune responses may be assessed by the response magnitude and frequency of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells generating interferon-γ ELISpot responses to cPTE Env
peptide stimulation, or alternative assays.
Depending on the vaccine efficacy outcome, samples may be used for the evaluation of immune
markers that have a sieving effect on any breakthrough infections and for the evaluation of any
immune markers that are associated with post-infection control of HIV, potentially including
immune responses to all vaccine antigens. These additional tests may include limited genetic
testing.
The collected blood per the Time and Events Schedules , will be sufficient to allow for exploratory
immune analyses. Additional exploratory immunogenicity assessments may be performed for the
purposes of more fully characterizing the immune responses elicited by vaccination and/or, if any
vaccine-associated change in HIV acquisition is identified, identifying immunologic responses
which are associated with vaccination and the rate of HIV acquisition.
Note:Participant samples with high levels of biotin can interfere with immunoassays utilizing
interaction of biotin with streptavidin.

end of the study/early withdrawal will be followed by the investigator until resolution or until a
clinically stable condition is reached (see Section 12.3.2).
All adverse events and laboratory data will be graded for severity according to the criteria
presented in Section 12.1.3.
Adverse Events
All serious adverse events and adverse events and special reporting situations, that are related to
study procedures or that are related to non-investigational concomitant sponsor products will be
reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until the end of the study/early
withdrawal. Clinically relevant medical events not meeting the above criteria and occurring
between signing of ICF and the moment of first vaccination will be collected on the Medical
History CRF page as pre-existing conditions.
Solicited adverse events, collected through a diary, will be recorded daily for each vaccination
from the moment of vaccination until 7 days post-vaccination.
All other unsolicited adverse events and special reporting situations will be reported for each
vaccination from the moment of vaccination until 28 days post-vaccination. Unsolicited adverse
events with the onset date outside the timeframe defined above (>28 days after previous study
vaccination), which are ongoing on the day of the subsequent vaccination, should be recorded as
such.
From the time of local approval of protocol amendment 5 onwards, TTS is considered to be an
AESI (see Section 12.3.4). Thrombotic events and/or thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count
below the LLN rangefor the testing lab) are considered to be potential AESIs. All AESIs, including
potential AESIs, will be reported to the sponsor from the moment of first vaccination until 6
months after the last vaccination. Each potential AESI will be reviewed to identify a TTS case.
All serious adverse events, MAAEs, and adverse events leading to discontinuation (regardless of
causal relationship) are to be reported from the moment of first vaccination for the duration of the
study, which may include contact for safety follow-up. The HPX3002/HVTN 706 safety review
team will review the safety information during the conduct of the study. The sponsor will evaluate
any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an investigator beyond the time frame
specified in the protocol.
All AEs will be followed until resolution or until clinically stable.
Medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) are defined as adverse events with medically
attended visits including hospital, emergency room, urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from
medical personnel for any reason. Potentially immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs)
and new onset of chronic diseases will be collected as part of the MAAEs. Adverse events
identified during a routine study visit will not be considered MAAEs. STIs (including
HIV-2 infection) are associated with an increased likelihood to acquire HIV infection. Note that

Based on regulatory feedback, special attention will be put on PIMMC  that are reported as
MAAEs. These events will be collected and analyzed. A list of PIMMCs defined for this study is
presented in Attachment 3 .
For solicited adverse events, the following applies.
Solicited Adverse Events
Solicited adverse events are used to assess the reactogenicity of the study vaccine and are
predefined local (at the administration site) and systemic events for which the participant is
specifically questioned, and which are noted by participants in their diary.
After each vaccination, participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least
30 minutes for presence of any acute reactions. In addition, participants will record solicited signs
and symptoms in a diary for 7 days post-vaccination. These participants will be provided with a
diary and instructions on how to complete the diary (Section 9.1.1). The study staff will transcribe
the information provided by the participant into the relevant sections of the CRF. After review and
verbal discussion of the initial paper diary entries with the participant, the investigator will
complete his/her own assessment in the relevant sections of the CRF. Once a solicited sign or
symptom from a diary is considered to be of severity Grade 1 or above, it will be recorded as a
solicited adverse event. For grading of solicited adverse events, see Section 12.1.3. For solicited
adverse events, the investigators will document them in the clinic note, followed by entry into the
CRF.
Solicited Administration Site Adverse Events
Participants will be asked to note in the diary occurrences of pain/tenderness, erythema and
swelling at the study vaccine administration site daily for 7 days post-vaccination (day of
vaccination and the subsequent 7 days). The extent (largest diameter) of any erythema, and
swelling should be measured (using the ruler supplied) and recorded daily.12,25
Solicited Systemic Adverse Events
Participants will be instructed on how to record daily temperature using a thermometer provided
for home use. Participants should record the temperature in the diary in the evening of the day of
vaccination, and then daily for the next 7 days approximately at the same time each day. If more
than one measurement is made on any given day, the highest temperature of that day will be used
in the CRF.
Fever is defined as endogenous elevation of body temperature ≥38° C, as recorded in at least one
measurement.27
Participants will also be instructed on how to note daily in the diary signs and symptoms for 7 days
post-vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) of the following events: fatigue,
headache, nausea, myalgia, chills, arthralgia, and vomiting.

No blood samples for safety laboratory testing will be collected. However, clinical laboratory
assessments to be performed are as follows:
 Serum (at screening; local laboratory) and Urine (at time points indicated in the Time and
Events Schedule ) pregnancy testing for participants of childbearing potential only.
 HIV testing (see Section 9.2 and Study-Specific Procedures Binder; screening test: local
laboratory, other HIV testing: central laboratory)
 Syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea (local laboratory)
 Dried blood spot test (central laboratory)
 In case of HIV infection: HIV viral load (central laboratory) and CD4+ cell count (local
laboratory)
 In case of a potential AESI of TTS (see Section 12.3.4.1 ), a serum sample should be obtained
to test for anti-PF4 at the local laboratory or substitute local laboratory, if possible; repeat
testing may be requested for confirmation upon sponsor discretion. A test for anti-PF4 will
also be performed on a stored pre-vaccination sample, if possible.
Vital Signs (Oral or Tympanic Temperature, Pulse/Heart Rate, Blood Pressure)
Vital sign measurements will be performed at time points specified in the Time and Events
Schedule .
Blood pressure and pulse/heart rate measurements will be assessed with a completely automated
device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available.
Blood pressure and pulse/heart rate measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest
in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones).
Physical Examination
Full physical examination, including vital sign measurements, will be carried out at screening,
Month 30 and 6 months after HIV-1 diagnosis, as applicable. At all other study visits, a targeted,
symptom-directed exam will be performed as indicated by the investigator based on any clinically
relevant issues, clinically relevant symptoms, and medical history. Symptom-directed physical
examination may be repeated if deemed necessary by the investigator. Height will be measured at
screening. Weight will be measured at every study visit.
Physical examinations will be performed by the investigator or designated medically-trained
clinician. Any screening or baseline abnormality should be documented in the medical history
page of the CRF.

2. In participants who become HIV-1 infected in comparison to non-infected participants,
3. In VISP positive and negative study participants,
4. In participants who are using PrEP or not during the course of the study, if applicable.
For the full questionnaires, refer to the Study Specific Procedures Binder.
9.5.1. Social Impact Measured Using Questionnaire
Participants in prophylactic HIV-vaccine clinical studies may experience problems with personal
relationships, employment, education, health care, housing, health, disability or life insurance,
travel, and immigration.1 In relation to a participant’s family, friends, and/or colleagues, the social
impact could manifest in one or more ways, resulting in social conflicts and stigmatization, for
example:
1. The investigational vaccine is thought to be harmful to the participant’s health, including a
belief that it might cause HIV infection.
2. The participant is perceived as HIV-infected or at high risk.
3. Repercussions from VISP.
For these reasons, participants will complete a social impact questionnaire at the time points
specified in the Time and Events Schedule , to evaluate any potential consequences of the
participant’s enrollment in the study.
9.5.2. Sexual Activity Questionnaire
In order to collect information to assess the level of risk of HIV infection throughout the study,
participants will complete a sexual activity questionnaire, at the time points specified in the Time
and Events Schedule . The recall period for this questionnaire is the last month.
9.5.3. Questionnaire on the Use of PrEP
Information with regard to the use of and, if applicable, adherence to PrEP will be collected for all
participants by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire will be completed at the time points
specified in the Time and Events Schedule .
9.5.4. Other Participant Reported Outcomes
At each visit (except for Visit 2a and Visit 3a), participants will be questioned on their level of
absenteeism, defined as health-related productivity loss due to sick-leave, since their last visit at
which absenteeism was recorded.
In addition, at Visit 8, 1 month post-vaccination 4, participants will be asked how they perceived
their experience with this HIV vaccination.

 From the time of local approval of protocol amendment 5 onwards: participant previously
experienced TTS or HITT.
Withdrawal From the Study
Each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without
affecting the right to treatment by the investigator. The investigator should make an attempt to
contact participants who did not return for scheduled visits or follow-up. Although the participant
is not obliged to give reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely, the investigator should make a
reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) while fully respecting the participant’s rights.
A participant will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:
 Lost to follow-up
 Withdrawal of consent
 Death
 Repeated failure to comply with protocol requirements
 Decision by the sponsor or the investigator to stop or cancel the study
 Decision by local regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC to stop or cancel the study
If a participant is lost to follow-up, every reasonable effort must be made by the study-site
personnel to contact the participant and determine the reason for discontinuation/withdrawal. The
measures taken to follow-up must be documented.
When a participant withdraws before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal is to be
documented in the CRF and in the source document. Study vaccine assigned to the withdrawn
participant may not be assigned to another participant. Participants who are vaccinated and
withdraw will not be replaced. If a participant withdraws early from the study, assessments for
early withdrawal should be obtained (see Section 9.1.8).
Participants who wish to withdraw consent from participation in the study will be offered a single
exit visit for safety follow-up (prior to formal withdrawal of consent).They have the right to refuse.
10.3. Contraindications to Vaccination
The following events constitute a temporary contraindication to study vaccination. If any of these
events occur at the scheduled time for vaccination, the vaccination can be rescheduled (as long as
this is in agreement with the allowed windows (see Section 9.1.2):
 Acute illness at the time of vaccination. This does not include minor illnesses, such as diarrhea
or mild upper-respiratory tract infection.
 Fever (body temperature ≥38.0°C) at the planned time of vaccination.

Withdrawal From the Use of Samples in Future Research
The participant may withdraw consent for use of samples for research (refer to Section 16.2.5,
Long-Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research). In such a case, samples will be
destroyed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study. Details of the sample retention for
research are presented in the ICF.
11. STATISTICAL METHODS
Statistical analysis will be done by the sponsor and its partners or under the authority of the
sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods is outlined below. Specific details will be
provided in the SAP.
11.1. Participant Information
For all participants, descriptive statistics of demographic (eg, sex assigned at birth, participant-
identified gender at screening, age, height, weight, male circumcision, body mass index [BMI],
and race) and other baseline characteristics (eg, medical history, including history and family
history of immune disorders, concomitant diseases, Ad26 baseline serostatus) will be provided by
vaccination group.
11.2. Analysis Populations
The following study populations or analysis sets are used for addressing the study objectives. This
terminology is used throughout this protocol and SAP. The following sets and populations will
include all vaccinated participants with respect to the vaccine actually administered.
1. Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomized participants who receive at least one vaccine
adm
inistration. This will be the primary population for the safety analysis.
2. Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population: participants in the FAS who are HIV-1 negative
on t
he date of first vaccination.
3. Modified Intent-to-Treat-2 (mITT-2) Population: participants in the FAS who have a negative
HIV
test 4 weeks post 3rd vaccination visit (ie, at the Month 7 Visit).
4. Per-Protocol (PP) Population: participants in the FAS population who have a negative HIV
tes
t 4 weeks post 3rd vaccination visit (ie, at the Month 7 Visit), who received all planned
vaccinations at the first three vaccination visits within the respective visit windows. This will
be the primary population for the efficacy analysis.

respective visit windows. This will be an additional population for efficacy analysis, and
potentially for immune correlates.
6. Full Immunization Set (FIS): participants in the FAS who are HIV-1 uninfected 4 weeks after
the 
4th vaccination visit (ie, at the Month 13 Visit) and who receive all planned vaccinations
within the respective visit windows.
7. At risk Immunogenicity Cohort (IC-at risk): participants in the FAS who are selected for
meas
urement of immune response endpoints at the primary immunogenicity timepoints and
who are HIV-1 uninfected 4 weeks after the 3rd vaccination visit (ie, at the Month 7 Visit).
The analyses of safety will be performed on the FAS. The primary analysis of VE will be based
on the PP population. Secondary analyses of VE will be based on the mITT, mITT-2, and mITT-3
population, and the FIS. For those with immunogenicity outcomes, analyses of vaccine
immunogenicity and immune correlates may be based onPP, mITT-3, IC-at risk and the FIS. Other
populations may be defined in the SAP for the purpose of exploratory (correlate) analyses.
11.3. Sample Size Determination
This study is designed to test the primary hypothesis of VE in the PP population:
H0: VE(7-x months) ≤20% versus the H1: VE(7-x months) >20%, with 24≤x≤30 (See
Section 11.5.1.1 ).
If the lower bound of the 95% CI for VE(7-x months) is >20% at the primary analysis, the
corresponding H0 will be rejected.
The sample size calculations are based on the power of a 1-sided 0.025-level Wald test for
comparing cumulative incidences of HIV-1 infection by the Month x visit (24≤x≤30) between
randomized groups, in the presence of the sequential monitoring of VE. Power is computed based
on simulating 10,000 efficacy trials using the R package seqDesign14,24 under the following
assumptions:
 10% annual dropout incidence in both groups;
 5% of participants with at least one missed vaccination (excluded from PP population);
 VE 20% in the first 7 months after first vaccination;
 VE 65% from Month 7 onwards;
 12-month uniform accrual with halved accrual during the first 3 months;
 Visits approximately every 3 months for HIV-1 diagnostic tests;
 2% annual HIV-1 incidence in the placebo group;
Under these assumptions, a study of 3,800 participants (randomized 1,900:1,900 to
vaccine:placebo) is expected to yield a total of 78 HIV-1 infections in the PP population between

power for rejecting the primary H0, under an alternative VE of 65% and with a one-sided error
rate of 2.5%.
The timing of unblinding and conducting the primary analysis and the definition of the primary
efficacy endpoint will be determined by when the TNI is reached within a given follow-up period x
(24≤x≤30) for each participant. In practice, when the last participant has reached his/her Month 24
visit (or discontinued earlier), it will be assessed whether the TNI has been obtained within the
period of Month 7-Month 24. Ifat that time the number of HIV-1 infections between Month 7 and
Month 24 is greater than or equal to the TNI, the primary analysis may be conducted using VE(7-
24 months) as the primary efficacy endpoint. Only ifthis primary H0 is rejected, VE(7-30 months)
will be tested as secondary hypothesis, using a fixed sequence testing strategy, without adjustment
for the Type-I error, and using all available durability data between Month 24 and Month 30. If
the number of infections between Month 7 and Month 24 is less than the TNI, the study will
continue for 3 months until the last participant has reached their Month 27 visit. The same
procedure is repeated as described above, using all available HIV-1 infections between Month 7
and Month 27 and with VE(7-27 months) as the primary efficacy endpoint. If the number of
infections between Month 7 and Month 27 is less than the TNI, the study will continue for
3 months until the last participant has reached his final study visit at Month 30. At that point, the
primary analysis will be conducted regardless of whether the TNI has been reached, using
VE(7-30 months) as only efficacy endpoint.
The statistical strategy is schematically presented in Figure 1 .

 that investigators and participants will remain blinded with regards to their treatment

Both the study’s sample size as well as the TNI may be adjusted during the study, but prior to
unblinding, to ensure sufficient power at the time of the primary analysis. Whereas adjustment of
the sample size may be based on internal (but sponsor-blinded) study data (through monitoring of
the pooled HIV-1 incidence) as well as on external study data (eg, Phase 2b HPX2008/HVTN
705), any adjustment of the TNI will solely be driven by data external to this study (eg, Phase 2b

prophylactic methods, such as PrEP (which would result in lower than expected annual incidence
rates and thus lower study power), an estimated annual incidence rate in the control group of 2%
was used to size this study.
Under the study assumptions as described above, the study will also have approximately 80%
power for the secondary efficacy endpoint VE(0-x months), assessing VE in the mITT population
and accounting for all HIV-1 infections starting from Month 0 (Day 1).
Rationale for the HIV-1 Incidence Assumptions
This study will recruit a large population of highest-risk MSM and transgender individuals who
have sex with men from many regions. In 2011, 62% of estimated new HIV diagnoses in the United
States were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact; 39% of these MSM were black or African
American.9 Lifetime risk was 1 in 68 for males and 1 in 253 for females. Lifetime risk for men
was 1 in 22 for blacks, 1 in 51 for Hispanic/Latinos, and 1 in 140 for whites. By risk group, the
highest risk was among MSM (1 in 6) and the lowest was among male heterosexuals (1 in 524).
Most of the states with the highest lifetime risk were in the South.19 Recent data from clinical
studies show placebo incidence rates in high risk MSM of 6.6% in the Ipergay study (France,
Canada)28, 3.9% in the iPrEX study for high risk MSM (USA, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, South Africa
and Thailand)15, HVTN 505 yielded annual incidence rates of 2.3% in circumcised MSM and TG
(USA)18. To help identify the study participants pre-trial assessments and data will be collected
regarding incidence in potential sites.
The assumption of 2% annual HIV-1 incidence in the placebo group accommodates background
PrEP use by assuming incidence is decreased by the person-years at risk during which PrEP is
used, the efficacy of PrEP during PrEP use and the adherence to PrEP use. Figure 2 shows the
impact of assumed PrEP use and adherence on annual HIV-1 incidence in the placebo group when
the initial incidence (in the absence of PrEP) is 3% or 4% and the efficacy of PrEP is assumed to
be 90%.

. Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed when all participants have reached the Month x
(with 24≤x≤30) visit or discontinued earlier and the TNI has been reached in the study. Refer to
Figure 1 for more information on the timing and strategy of statistical testing.
11.5.1. Vaccine Efficacy Analysis
The primary analysis of VE will evaluate the number of HIV-1 infections in the vaccine group
compared to the number of HIV-1 infections in the placebo group between Month 7 and Month x
(with 24≤x≤30) in the PP population. The H0 of VE will be tested VE(7-x months) ≤20% versus
the H1 VE(7-x months) >20%. Vaccine efficacy is defined as 1-cumulative incidence ratio
(vaccine versus placebo) between Month 7 and Month x after first vaccination and is estimated by
the transformation of the Nelson-Aalen estimator for the cumulative hazard function. If the lower
bound of the 95% CI for VE(7-x months) is >20% (equivalently, the 1-sided p-value for testing
H0: VE[7-x months] ≤20% is below 0.025), the H0 will be rejected in favor of the H1.
11.5.1.1. Primary Vaccine Efficacy Analysis: HIV-1 Infection
The primary analysis will be done in the PP population, where participants who become HIV-1
infected or who drop out before Month 7 or who have not received all of the first threevaccinations
within the specified time window, will be excluded from the analysis. The date of HIV-1 diagnosis
will be the draw date of the first sample that leads to a positive test result by the study protocol’s
diagnostic algorithm. Dropouts will be censored at the time of their last HIV-1 negative test. To
evaluate the primary VE endpoint, the number of HIV-1 infections in the vaccine group will be
compared to the number of HIV-1 infections in the placebo group between Month 7 and x months
since the first vaccination (with 24≤x≤30). The vaccine effect will be assessed using a ratio of

estimated using the transformed Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard function estimator and tested via
a Wald test.
11.5.1.2. Secondary/Exploratory Vaccine Efficacy Analyses
As a key secondary objective, the VE beyond Month 7 will be evaluated in all participants,
regardless of whether they received the first three vaccinations according to the protocol-specified
schedule (mITT-2 population, see Section 11.2 for definition). Other secondary objectives will
evaluate the VE over different time intervals (eg, VE[0-x months], VE[13-x months]) and in
different populations (eg, mITT, mITT-2, mITT-3, FIS), using similar methods as described above.
Cox proportional hazards model will also be used for estimating VE(7-x months), measured by
one minus the hazard ratio (vaccine versus placebo) and for testing whether the VE(7-x months)
differs from 20%.
To account for potentially confounding factors, subgroup and covariate-adjusted analyses will be
performed. These subgroups/covariates will include PrEP use, baseline Ad26 seropositivity status
and titers, presence of risk factors for HIV infection, and other baseline demographic factors.
Efforts will be made to estimate vaccine efficacy in complete absence of PrEP use in a
counterfactual framework.
In addition, an exploratory analysis that employs Bayesian methods will be conducted to evaluate
VE.13 The prior to be used for this analysis will be a robust, meta-analytic one based on
pre-specified weighting of the external Phase 2b data (study HPX2008/HVTN 705) as informative
prior and a non-informative prior.31 Details of pre-specified weights and priors will be specified in
the SAP.
If VE is established, an attempt will be made to identify correlates of increased risk of HIV-1
infection as well as correlates of VE, best individual-level classifiers of HIV infection and to assess
mediators of vaccine efficacy. To this extent, appropriate statistical methodology will be applied
or developed, and will be described in a (separate) SAP for correlate identification. If significant
VE is observed, a pre-specified case-control study of immune responses elicited by vaccination in
active vaccine recipients will be performed to identify vaccine-induced correlates of protection
and/or risk. Both single parameter and combinations of multiple immunologic parameter models
will be explored. The presence of time-dependent correlates of protection will be examined in
addition to single time point immune responses, including the peak immune response after the
primary vaccination series, or the time point most closely preceding the diagnosis of HIV-1
infection. To further ascribe immune correlates of protection and/or specifically of VE, placebo
case and control samples will also be included in a secondary stage of analysis.
11.6. Safety Analysis
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be analyzed descriptively.
All safety analyses will be tabulated by vaccination group (active vaccine, placebo) and based on
the FAS.

us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023Tabulations will be presented by time of occurrence relative to the preceding vaccination (7 days
for solicited adverse events and 28 days for unsolicited adverse events, 6 months after last
vaccination for AESIs).
Baseline for all safety parameters will be defined as the last evaluation done before the first dose
of study vaccine.
11.6.1. Reactogenicity: Solicited Adverse Events
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of solicited adverse event will
be tabulated by severity and vaccination group, and the percentages will be displayed graphically
by group. For a given solicited adverse event, each participant’s adverse event will be counted
once under the maximum severity for each vaccination dose.
11.6.2. Unsolicited Adverse Events, AESIs, MAAEs and Serious Adverse
Events
The verbatim terms used in the CRF by investigators to identify adverse events will be coded using
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Tables will show, by vaccination
group, the number and percentage of participants experiencing an adverse event within a system
organ class or within a preferred term category by severity and by relationship to study vaccine.
All reported adverse events and events-related diary information with onset or worsening within
28 days after each vaccination (ie, treatment-emergent adverse events) will be included in the
analysis. For each adverse event, the percentage of participants who experience at least
1 occurrence of the given event will be summarized by vaccine group. A participant with multiple
adverse events within a category will be counted once under the maximum severity and by causal
relationship to study vaccine. Formal statistical testing comparing groups is not planned since
interpretation of differences must rely heavily upon clinical judgement. Parallel analyses will
include all AESIs, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to participant withdrawal or
early discontinuation of study vaccine(s).
For this study events of interest are PIMMCs. PIMMCs that are recorded as MAAEs will be
collected and analyzed.
Summaries, listings, datasets, or participant narratives may be provided, as appropriate, for those
participants who die, who discontinue treatment due to an adverse event, or who experience a
serious adverse event or an AESI.
Summaries and listings may be provided separately for adverse events with onset outside the above
defined timeframe and that were reported pre-dose at the moment of subsequent vaccinations.

Participant Reported Outcomes
Data from the social impact questionnaire, sexual activity questionnaire, the questionnaire on the
use of PrEP and the level of absenteeism and vaccine regimen acceptance will be summarized
using descriptive statistics:
1. In vaccine and placebo recipients,
2. In participants who become HIV-1 infected in comparison to non-infected participants,
3. In VISP positive and negative study participants,
4. In participants who are using PrEP or not during the course of the study, if applicable.
In addition, data may be included as co-variates in the exploratory efficacy analysis.

11.7. Reasons for Vaccination Discontinuation and Early Study Termination
The number and percentage of participants who discontinue vaccination and who terminate the
study early will be tabulated by vaccination group. The reason for discontinuation will be included.
11.8. Immunogenicity Analysis
Data from quantitative assays may be summarized (tabulated/graphically presented per timepoint
available) by vaccination group: N, geometric means and corresponding 95% CIs, percentage
positive responses/responders (if available).
Qualitative endpoints may be summarized by tabulating the frequency of positive responses for
each assay by group at each timepoint that an assessment is performed.
Descriptive statistics (actual values and changes from reference) may be calculated for continuous
parameters. Frequency tabulations may be calculated for discrete parameters. Graphical
representations of changes in immunologic parameters may be made as applicable.

11.9. Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board
The NIAID HIV vaccine DSMB  will serve as an independent DSMB for this study and will
monitor data on a 6-monthly basis to ensure the continuing safety of the participants enrolled in
this study. The independent DSMB  will review unblinded data as indicated below. After the
review, the independent DSMB  will make recommendations to the sponsor about potential
modifications to the study. The independent DSMB will also monitor the study progression.
An independent statistical support group, appointed by the sponsor, and not involved in the study,
will be unblinded to treatment assignment and provide all necessary data to the independent
DSMB. The independent DSMB will consist of at least four clinical and vaccine experts, at least
one independent statistician, one ethicist, and one community representative. All independent
DSMB responsibilities, authorities, and procedures (data to be provided, meeting frequency, type
of meetings) will be specified in the DSMB Charter and the details on the analyses will be provided
in the SAP. An independent DSMB  meeting will start with an open (blinded to treatment
assignment with attendance of sponsor study representatives) followed by a closed (unblinded to
treatment assignment) session. No sponsor representative will be involved in the closed sessions.
The unblinded, closed DSMB report including evaluations of HIV infections will be shared with
the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)/Office of Vaccines Research and
Review (OVRR). To ensure the blinding of the study team, an independent regulatory expert will
act as an intermediary between the DSMB and CBER/OVRR. Further details are described in the
DSMB charter.
In case of serious safety issues, the independent DSMB  will be informed immediately by the
sponsor.
11.10. Endpoint Adjudicator(s)
The diagnostic criteria for HIV-1 infection outside the setting of a vaccine trial are well accepted.
However, definitive diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in the context of having received an HIV vaccine
that is even partially effective may be more difficult. Specifically, if the immune responses elicited
by vaccination are capable of completely suppressing viral replication, or if vaccination alters the
normal serological response upon exposure to HIV-1, standard diagnostic tests may be more
difficult to assess.
Therefore, an endpoint adjudicator(s) and/or designees will assess all serological and virological
testing, in a blinded manner, on each participant in the study who, prior to study unblinding tests
positive per the sponsor-approved HIV testing algorithm.
12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies
are crucial for the protection of participants, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by
regulatory agencies worldwide. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety
information; all clinical studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in
accordance with those procedures.
Method of Detecting Adverse Events, AESIs, MAAEs and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events, AESIs, MAAEs or serious
adverse events. Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred
method to inquire about adverse event occurrence.
Solicited Adverse Events
Solicited adverse events are predefined administration site and systemic events for which
participants are specifically questioned and which are noted in their diary (see Section 9.1.1).
U nsolicited Adverse Events
Unsolicited adverse events are all adverse events for which the participant is specifically not
questioned in the participant diary.
AESIs
For details, see Section 12.3.4.
Medically-attended Adverse Events
Medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) are adverse events with medically attended visits
including hospital, emergency room, urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel
for any reason.
12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered
a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily
have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. An adverse event can therefore be any
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or
not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per
International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH])
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test
abnormalities.
Note: For time period of sponsor’s adverse event collection, see Section 12.3.1.

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal
Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
 Results in death
 Is life-threatening
(The participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product
 Is Medically Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These
should usually be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal
relationship between the study product and the event (eg, death from anaphylaxis), the event must
be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the
study endpoint.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable
product reference safety information. For Ad26.Mos4.HIV, Clade C gp140, and Mosaic gp140,
the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the
respective Investigator's Brochures.
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Vaccine
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the vaccine if the attribution is related
by the definitions listed in Section 12.1.2.
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Causality of adverse events should be assessed by the investigator based on the following:
Related : there is a reasonable possibility* that the adverse event may be related to the study agent.
This suggests that the adverse event is more likely to be related than not related to the study
product(s).

The choice suggests that the adverse event is more likely to be related to another cause rather than
the study products.
* There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the adverse
event.
By definition, all solicited adverse events at the administration site will be considered related to
the study vaccine administration.

Safety events of interest on a sponsor study vaccine that may require expedited reporting or safety
evaluation include, but are not limited to:
 Overdose of a sponsor study vaccine
 Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study vaccine
 Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study vaccine
 Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without participant/patient exposure to
the sponsor study product, eg, name confusion)
 AESIs
Participant-specific special reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF. Any special
reporting situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the
serious adverse event page of the CRF.
12.3. Procedures
12.3.1. All Adverse Events
Solicited adverse events, unsolicited adverse events, AESIs, serious adverse events and adverse
events leading to vaccine discontinuation will be reported for all participants.
All serious adverse events and adverse events and special reporting situations, that are related to
study procedures or that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will be reported from
the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until the end of the study/withdrawal. Clinically
relevant medical events not meeting the above criteria and occurring between signing of ICF and
the moment of first vaccination will be collected on the Medical History CRF page as pre-existing
conditions.
Solicited adverse events, collected through a diary, will be recorded daily for each vaccination
from the moment of vaccination until 7 days post-vaccination.
All other unsolicited adverse events and special reporting situations will be reported for each
vaccination from the moment of vaccination until 28 days post-vaccination. Unsolicited adverse
events with the onset date outside the timeframe defined above (>28 days after previous study
vaccination), which are ongoing on the day of the subsequent vaccination, should be recorded as
such.
From the time of local approval of protocol amendment 5 onwards, TTS is considered to be an
AESI. Thrombotic events and/or thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count below the LLN range
for the testing lab) are considered to be potential AESIs. All AESIs, including potential AESIs,
will be reported to the sponsor from the moment of first vaccination until 6 months after the last
vaccination. Each potential AESI will be reviewed to identify a TTS case.

us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023All serious adverse events, MAAEs, and adverse events leading to discontinuation (regardless of
the causal relationship) are to be reported from the moment of first vaccination for the duration of
the study. The HPX3002/HVTN 706 safety review team will review the safety information during
the conduct of the study. The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously
reported by an investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol.
All AEs will be followed until resolution or until clinically stable.
All events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event will be reported as serious adverse
events, regardless of whether they are protocol-specific assessments.
The investigator will monitor and analyze study data including all adverse event data as they
become available and will make determinations regarding the severity of the adverse experiences
and their relation to study vaccine. Adverse events will be deemed either related to study vaccine
or not related to study vaccine, according to Section 12.1.2.
The investigator or designee must review both collected solicited events and other adverse event
CRFs to ensure prompt and complete identification of all events that require expedited reporting
as serious adverse events or as other serious and unexpected events.
All per-protocol collected adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed
relationship to study product, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document
and the CRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to
a common etiology (eg, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be
reported as "upper-respiratory infection"). Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion
concerning the relationship of the adverse event to study therapy. All measures required for
adverse event management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to
sponsor instructions.
The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory
authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational
institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The
investigator (or sponsor where required) must report SUSARs to the appropriate IEC/IRB that
approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB. A SUSAR will
be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/IRB will
receive a blinded SUSAR summary, unless otherwise specified.
For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open-label studies, the participant must be
provided with a "wallet (study) card" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration
of the study indicating the following:
 Studynumber
 Statement, in the local language(s), that the participant is participating in a clinical study
 Investigator's name and 24-hour contact telephone number

12.3.2. Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events occurring during the study must be reported to the appropriate sponsor
contact person by study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event.
Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to the sponsor using the Serious
Adverse Event Form, which must be completed and signed by a physician from the study site, and
transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow-up reports of a serious adverse
event should be made by email (facsimile [fax] is acceptable if email is not an option for the site).
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved
upon discontinuation of the participant in the study, must be followed until any of the following
occurs:
 The event resolves
 The event stabilizes
 The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
 The event can be attributed to agents other than the study product or to factors unrelated to
study conduct
 It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (participant or health care
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow-up after demonstration of
due diligence with follow-up efforts)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as a serious
adverse event. Any event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization) that occurs
during the course of a participant’s participation in a study must be reported as a serious adverse
event, except hospitalizations for the following:
 Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event (eg, social reasons such
as pending placement in long-term care facility)
 Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the CRF).
Note: Hospitalizations that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and where the
underlying condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened, will not be
considered serious adverse events. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the
originally planned hospitalization is to be reported as a new serious adverse event.
The cause of death of a participant in a study during the entire study period, whether or not the
event is expected or associated with the study product, is considered a serious adverse event.

All initial reports of pregnancy in participants or partners of participants must be reported to the
sponsor by the study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the
appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious
adverse events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Any participant who
becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further vaccination.
Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy will be required. Any postnatal
sequelae in the infant will be collected, if possible.
12.3.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) (including potential AESIs) are significant AEs that
are judged to be of special interest because of clinical importance, known or suspected class
effects, or based on nonclinical signals. AESIs (including potential AESIs) will be carefully
monitored during the study by the sponsor.
AESIs (including potential AESIs) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness
irrespective of seriousness (ie, serious and nonserious AEs) or causality following the procedure
described above for SAEs.
AESIs (including potential AESIs) must be reported using the AESI checkbox in the eCRF using
the eCRF completion guidelines.
Specific requirements for the AESI are described below.
12.3.4.1. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome
As described in Section 1.1.2, TTS has been observed following vaccination with Janssen COVID
vaccine and is considered to be an AESI in this study. TTS is a syndrome characterized by a
combination of both a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia.2,5
Because this syndrome is rare and not completely understood, all cases of thrombosis and/or
thrombocytopenia will be considered a potential case of TTS and should be reported to the sponsor
within 24 hours of awareness using the SAE form (even in cases that are not considered ‘serious’).
Each potential AESI will be reviewed to identify a TTS case. A Charter will describe the roles and
responsibilities of the Committee appointed to perform this review. A potential TTS case is defined
as:
 Thrombotic events: suspected deep vessel venous or arterial thrombotic events as detailed in
Attachment 4 ,
and/or
 Thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count below LLN for the testing lab

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023Symptoms, signs, or conditions suggestive of a thrombotic event or thrombocytopenia should be
recorded and reported as a potential AESI even if the final or definitive diagnosis has not yet been
determined, and alternative diagnoses have not yet been eliminated or shown to be less likely.
Follow-up information and final diagnoses, if applicable, should be submitted to the sponsor as
soon as they become available.
In the event of thrombocytopenia, study site personnel should report the absolute value for the
platelet count and the reference range for the laboratory test used.
For either a thrombotic event or thrombocytopenia, a serum sample should be obtained to test for
anti-PF4 at the local laboratory or substitute local laboratory, if possible; repeat testing may be
requested for confirmation upon sponsor discretion. A test for anti-PF4 will also be performed on
a stored pre-vaccination sample, if possible.
AESIs (including potential AESIs) will require enhanced data collection and evaluation. Every
effort should be made to report as much information as possible about the event to the sponsor in
a reasonable timeframe.
If an event meets the criteria for an SAE (Section 12.1.1), it should be reported using the same
process as for other SAEs.
Treatment and Follow-up Recommendation
The medical management of thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia is different from the
management of isolated thromboembolic diseases. Study site personnel and/or treating physicians
should follow available guidelines for treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenia (eg, American
Society of Hematology 20212; British Society of Haematology 20216; CDC 20218). The use of
heparin may be harmful and alternative treatments may be needed. Consultation with a
hematologist is strongly recommended.
12.4. Contacting Sponsor Regarding Safety
The names (and corresponding telephone numbers) of the individuals who should be contacted
regarding safety issues or questions regarding the study are listed in the Contact Information
page(s), which will be provided as a separate document.
13. PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINT HANDLING
A product quality complaint (PQC) is defined as any suspicion of a product defect related to
manufacturing, labeling, or packaging, ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity, quality,
durability, or reliability of a product, including its labeling or package integrity. A PQC may have
an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and
analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of participants,
investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The sponsor
has established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure
appropriate reporting of PQC information; all studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will
be conducted in accordance with those procedures.

to preserve blinding, the pharmacist will place an overlay on the syringes. Administration of study
vaccine to the participants will be performed by a blinded qualified healthcare provider from the
study site.
14.4. Vaccine Accountability
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study vaccine received at the site is inventoried
and accounted for throughout the study. The study vaccine administered to the participant must be
documented on the interventionaccountability form. All study vaccine will be stored and disposed
of according to the sponsor's instructions. Study-site personnel must not combine contents of the
study product containers.
Study product must be handled in strict accordance with the protocol and the container label, and
must be stored at the study site in a limited-access area or in a locked cabinet under appropriate
environmental conditions. Unused study vaccinemust be available for verification by the sponsor's
study-site monitor during on-site monitoring visits. The return to the sponsor of unused study
vaccine will be documented on the Investigational Product Destruction Form. When the study site
is an authorized destruction unit and study product supplies are destroyed on-site, this must also
be documented on the Investigational Product Destruction Form.
Potentially hazardous materials such as used ampules, needles, syringes and vials containing
hazardous liquids, should be disposed of immediately in a safe manner and therefore will not be
retained for vaccine accountability purposes.
Study vaccine should be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or a qualified member
of the study-site personnel, or by a hospital/clinic pharmacist. Study vaccine will be supplied only

16.1. Study-Specific Design Considerations
Potential participants will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, during
the study, participants will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue
participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty or loss of benefits to which they
would otherwise be entitled. Only potential participants who are fully able to understand the risks,
benefits, and potential adverse events of the study, and provide their consent voluntarily will be
enrolled.
From screening to the final study visit, the total blood volume to be collected from each participant
will be approximately 590 mL (maximum). In case a participant becomes HIV-1 infected, from
visit #.X to the final study visit, additionally approximately 420 mL (maximum) will be taken. The
total blood volume to be collected is within the US Department of Health and Human Services
Office for Human Research Protections, and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines
of 550 mL in any 8-week period.
Janssen scientists and operational staff are committed to adhering to all local and national guidance
as well as Good Participatory Practice37, which dictates broad and meaningful stakeholder
engagement (including but not limited to Community Advisory Boards) for input into the planning,
conduct, and follow-up of research to address all pertinent stakeholder issues including the local
cultural and linguistic needs of the communities where the research occurs.
Test of Understanding
The TOU (see Attachment 2 ) is a short assessment of the potential participant’s understanding of
key aspects of the study. The test will help the study staff to determine how well potential
participants understand the study and their requirements for participation.
Each potential participant must pass the TOU, indicating that he or she understands the purpose
of, and procedures required for the study, after reading the informed consent and after the
investigator or designee has provided detailed information on the study and has answered the
potential participant’s questions. Each participant must subsequently sign the ICF, indicating that
he or she is willing to participate in the study.
Potential participants are allowed to retake the test twice to achieve the passing score (≥90%)
required for participation in the study. Further information and counseling will be provided by the
study team member after each missed question.
Any potential participant not capable of understanding the key aspects of the study, and their
requirements for participation, should not be enrolled.

17.4. Participant Identification, Enrollment, and Screening Logs
The investigator agrees to complete a participant identification and enrollment log to permit easy
identification of each participant during and after the study. This document will be reviewed by
the sponsor/partner study-site contact for completeness.
The participant identification and enrollment log will be treated as confidential and will be filed
by the investigator in the study file. To ensure participant confidentiality, no copy will be made.
All reports and communications relating to the study will identify participants by participant
identification and age at initial informed consent. In cases where the participant is not randomized
into the study, the date seen and age at initial informed consent will be used.
The investigator must also complete a participant screening log, which reports on all participants
who were seen to determine eligibility for inclusion in the study.
17.5. Source Documentation
At a minimum, source documents consistent in the type and level of detail with that commonly
recorded at the study site as a basis for standard medical care must be available for the following:
participant identification, eligibility, and study identification; study discussion and date of signed
informed consent; dates of visits; results of safety and efficacy parameters as required by the
protocol; record of all adverse events and follow-up ofadverse events; concomitant medication;
intervention receipt/dispensing/return records; study product administration information; and date
of study completion and reason for early discontinuation of study product or withdrawal from the
study, if applicable.
The author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable.
Specific details required as source data for the study and source data collection methods will be
reviewed with the investigator before the study and will be described in the monitoring guidelines
(or other equivalent document).
An electronic source system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally maintained in a
hospital or clinic record to document medical care (eg, electronic source documents) as well as the
clinical study-specific data fields as determined by the protocol. This data is electronically
extracted for use by the sponsor/partner. If the electronic sourcesystemis utilized, references made

the electronic source system may not be limited to that found in the CRF. Data in this system may
be considered source documentation.
Participant- and investigator-completed scales and assessments designated by the sponsor/partner
will be recorded and will be considered source data. The participant’s diary used to collect
information regarding solicited signs and symptoms after vaccination will be considered source
data.
17.6. Case Report Form Completion
Case report forms are prepared and provided by the sponsor/partner for each participant in
electronic format. All CRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator
or authorized study-site personnel. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the CRF are
accurate and correct.
The study data will be transcribed by study-site personnel from the source documents onto an
electronic CRF, if applicable. Study-specific data will be transmitted in a secure manner to the
sponsor/partner.
Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the CRF. Any
such worksheets will become part of the participant's source documents. Data must be entered into
CRF in English. The CRF must be completed as soon as possible after a participant visit and the
forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit.
All subjective measurements (eg, pain scale information or other questionnaires) will be completed
by the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations whenever possible.
If necessary, queries will be generated in the eDC tool. If corrections to a CRF are needed after
the initial entry into the CRF, this can be done in either of the following ways:
 Investigator and study-site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own
initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by the eDC tool).
 Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query for resolution by the investigator and study-
site personnel.
17.7. Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified
investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and
study-site personnel before the study, periodic monitoring visits by the sponsor. Written
instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples.
Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study-site personnel before
the start of the study.

after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or
designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they will be verified for
accuracy and consistency with the data sources.
17.8. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRF and
all source documents that support the data collected from each participant, as well as all study
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical
Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The
investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these
documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications
in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical
development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period
if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the
responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no
longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the
responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept
the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new
custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents
before having obtained written approval from the sponsor.
If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any
documentation relating to this study, the investigator/institutionmust permit access to such reports.
17.9. Monitoring
The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site
monitoring) to monitor this study.
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary. The monitor will
record dates of the visits in a study-site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post-
initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the
monitor will compare data entered into the CRF with the source documents (eg,
hospital/clinic/physician’s office medical records); a sample may be reviewed. The nature and
location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data
required to complete the CRF are known to the sponsor and study-site personnel and are accessible
for verification by the sponsor study-site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study
site, the method of verification must be discussed with the study-site personnel.

relevant study-site personnel will be available, the source documents will be accessible, and a
suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. The monitor will
meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study
conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these
remote contacts, study-site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the
study at the site.
Central monitoring will take place for data identified by the sponsor as requiring central review.
17.10. Study Completion/Termination
17.10.1. Study Completion/End of Study
The study is considered completed with the last visit for the last participant in the study. The final
data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor and its partners (or designee) after completion
of the final participant visit at that study site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial
Agreement.
17.10.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A
studysite is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected
and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of a studysite by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not
limited to:
 Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/IRB or
local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
 Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator
 Discontinuation of further study product development
17.11. On-Site Audits
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at
any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance
with regulatory guidelines and company policy. These audits will require access to all study
records, including source documents, for inspection. Participant privacy must, however, be

designees.
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part
of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a
regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or she has
been contacted by a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection.
17.12. Use of Information and Publication
If applicable, study results will be communicated to the study participants through the study sites
and/or community representatives prior to general public disclosure (eg, at a conference).
All information, including but not limited to information regarding VAC89220 or the sponsor's
operations (eg, patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior
clinical data, formulation information) supplied by the sponsor to the investigator and not
previously published, and any data, including exploratory research data, generated as a result of
this study, areconsidered confidential and remain the sole property of the sponsor. The investigator
agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only to accomplish this
study, and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor's prior written consent.
The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by the
sponsor in connection with the continued development of VAC89220, and thus may be disclosed
as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory agencies. To permit the information derived
from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide the sponsor with all
data obtained in the study.
The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by the sponsor and
will contain data from all study sites that participated in the study as per protocol. Recruitment
performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the
study will be used to determine a coordinating investigator for the study. Results of exploratory
analyses performed after the Clinical Study Report has been issued will be reported in a separate
report and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study Report. Study participant identifiers
will not be used in publication of results. Any work created in connection with performance of the
study and contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any publication
by the investigator as provided for below) shall be the property of the sponsor as author and owner
of copyright in such work.
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal
Editors guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary (multi-center) data and
information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish study-
site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish
information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor and its
partners for review at least 21 days before submission for publication or presentation. At the
request of the sponsor and/or partners, such submission may be delayed up to 60 days. Expedited

sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days
to allow for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity
or regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor
will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress
information. For multi-center study designs and substudy approaches, secondary results generally
should not be published before the primary endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly,
investigators will recognize the integrity of a multi-center study by not submitting for publication
data derived from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study
have been submitted for publication, within 18 months after study end date, or the sponsor
confirms there will be no multi-centerstudy publication. Authorship of publications resulting from
this study will be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and
Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which state that the named authors must have
made a significant contribution to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis,
or interpretation of the data for the work; and drafted the work or revised it critically for important
intellectual content; and given final approval of the version to be published; and agreed to be
accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity
of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC
It is recognized that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have an impact on
the conduct of this clinical study due to, for example, self-isolation/quarantine by participants and
study-site personnel; travel restrictions/limited access to public places, including hospitals; study
site personnel being reassigned to critical tasks, and may lead to a pause (after agreement between
the sponsor and the study site).
In alignment with recent health authority guidance, the sponsor is providing options for study
related participant management in the event of disruption to the conduct of the study. This guidance
does not supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgement of the
investigator to protect the health and well-being of participants and site staff and to maintain
oversight of delegated trial activities.
Scheduled visits that cannot be conducted in person at the study site will be performed to the extent
possible as a remote visit, a home visit, or delayed until such time that on-site visits can be
resumed.a At each contact, participants will be interviewed to collect safety data. Key endpoint
assessments should be performed if required and as feasible. Participants will also be questioned
regarding general health status to fulfill any physical examination requirement.
Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol-specified assessments. Modifications to
protocol-required assessments may be permitted via COVID-19 Appendix after consultation with
the participant, investigator, and the sponsor. Missed assessments/visits will be captured in the
clinical trial management system for protocol deviations. Discontinuations of study interventions
and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID-19-related” in the
case report form (CRF). Any deviations to study procedures occurring due to the COVID-19
pandemic need to be properly captured in the clinical trial management system (or CRF), with the
prefix “COVID-19-related” (including actual visit date) and will be summarized in the clinical
study report.
The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the clinical study, and any
changes will be communicated to the sites and to the health authorities according to applicable
guidance documents and regulations. If a participant has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the
investigator should contact the sponsor’s responsible medical officer to discuss plans for study
intervention and follow-up. Modifications made to the study conduct as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic should be summarized in the clinical study report.
a An 
on-site visit is defined as a visit during which the participant and the qualified and blinded site staff are both
present in person at the study site.
A remote visit is defined as a visit during which there is no direct in-person physical presence between the participant
and the qualified and blinded site staff (telephone or video call).
A home visit is defined as a visit during which the participant and the qualified and blinded site staff are both present
at the participants’ home.

Stat
us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023GUIDANCE SPECIFIC TO THIS PROTOCOL :
The following emergency provisions are meant to ensure participant safety on study while site
capabilities are compromised by COVID-19-related restrictions. When restrictions are lifted, sites
should revert to the original protocol conduct as soon as feasible and in accordance with local
guidance and regulations and in agreement with the institutions and the investigator’s assessment
of the safety of site staff and study participants. The sponsor has developed a specific process
allowing activity to resume on a site-by-site basis when deemed safe to do so based on a risk
assessment.
Screening
 During COVID-19-related pauses, all screening activities and enrollment of new participants
are stopped to safeguard well-being of individuals. Participants who are in screening at this
time, will be classified as screen failures, which will be captured in the CRF using the pre-fix
'COVID-19-related'. When screening activities can be resumed, these participants will be
allowed to be rescreened. Although protocol Section 9.1.3 states that potential participants
who fail screening can be rescreened only once, the COVID-19-related screen failure will not
be counted in this respect.
Vaccination Visits
 During COVID-19-related pauses, study vaccine administration is put on hold. At the next
possible on-site visit, the study vaccine may be administered. Vaccination outside of the
window can be assessed on a case-by-case basis following approval and recommendations
from the safety review team and will be documented as ‘COVID-19-related’.
Other Study Visits and Assessments
 When site visits are not possible, sites should collect the assessments via remote visits or via
home visits (if possible and if the participant allows and provides consent to it). For
participants having received one or more vaccinations, post-vaccination visits can be
conducted remotely with the main objective to collect safety and reactogenicity data, if
possible. The actual visit date and the type of visit (ie, remote or home visit) should be
captured in the eCRF according to the eCRF completion guidelines.
 Procedures that can’t be performed in case of remote visits (eg, blood/urine sampling,
swabbing), including missed assessments related to efficacy endpoints (in-study HIV testing
and sampling for immunogenicity testing), should be documented as protocol deviations and
labelled as “missed due to COVID-19”. The protocol deviations need to be captured in the
source document.
 Reactogenicity assessment should be discussed during the remote visits. Diary reconciliation
by the investigator will be done at the next possible on-site visit or at a home visit if possible
and agreed by the participant. At the end of the study, all diaries should be on site for final
reconciliation and filed in participants’ folders.

 If a site is experiencing a disruption in shipment of specimens from their Site Processing Lab
to the centralized HIV diagnostic testing laboratory(ies) due to the COVID-19
pandemic-related challenges, the Site Processing Lab should hold that specimen at the proper
temperature for later per-protocol testing and the Clinical Research Site should collect an
additional specimen for HIV-1 PCR RNA testing at a local laboratory. The site should collect
the specimen appropriate to local lab requirements for this purpose. Locally performed rapid
test, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), or chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)
should NOT be used due to potential risk of unblinding to clinical staff. Local HIV-1 PCR
RNA testing will be used only for clinical management of the participants and will not replace
the in-study HIV diagnostics testing for protocol endpoints. The local testing result should be
recorded in the source document. Sites should continue to collect all specimens that are
required per the Specimen Collection Table SSP (including specimens for HIV diagnostics
testing).
Source Data Verification/Monitoring
 In case on-site monitoring visits are not possible, the site monitor may contact the investigator
to arrange monitoring visits and activities remotely (in accordance with site and local
requirements). Additional on-site monitoring visits may be needed in the future to catch up on
source data verification.
Site Audits
 During the COVID-19 pandemic and at the impacted sites, study site GCP audits with direct
impact/engagement from the investigator and study site personnel may not be conducted in
order to comply with national, local, and/or organizational social distancing restrictions.
Additional quality assurance activities such as remote audits or focused review of study
related documents may take place with limited impact/engagement if possible.

us: Approved, Date: 28 February 2023Attachment 1: Definition of Individual of Childbearing Potential and List of Acceptable Highly Effective
Contraceptive Methods
Definition of Individual of Childbearing Potential
Indi
vidualof  Childbearing Potential
A participant is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless
permanently sterile (see below).
IndividualNot of  Childbearing Potential
 premenarchal
A premenarchal state is one in which menarche has not yet occurred.
 postmenopausal
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical
cause.
 permanently sterile
Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal
occlusion/ligation procedures, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study (eg, a premenarchal participant
experiences menarche) or the risk of pregnancy changes (eg, a participant who is not
heterosexually active becomes active), a participant must begin a highly effective method of
contraception, as described throughout the inclusion criteria.
List of Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods
Hig
hly effective contraceptive methods, based on the CTFG guidance, for this study include:
1. Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with
inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)a
2. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,
injectible, implantable)a,b
3. Intrauterine device (IUD)a,b
4. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)a,b
5. Bilateral tubal occlusiona,b
6. Vasectomized partnerb,c
7. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary
mode of action
a Cont
raception methods that in the context of the CTFG guidance are considered highly effective.
b Contraception methods that in the context of the CTFG guidance are considered to have low user dependency.
c Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner
of the WOCP study participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical
success.

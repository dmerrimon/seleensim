Section 2   Summary of Activities The following questions must be answered in lay language or language understood by a person unfamiliar with your area of research.  A research plan or protocol is required with this submission.  In the responses below, area-specific jargon should be avoided or explicitly explained.   Do not say “see protocol” or “protocol attached”. Protocol templates are available on the IRB forms page. 2.1 What is your research question? State hypothesis or primary objective, and provide a brief background on subject population, treatment procedures, and the rationale for conducting the study. This study aims to test whether there is a difference in the analgesic effect between TAP blocks and surgical infiltration during the first 72 hours following laparoscopic and robotic total hysterectomies. Laparoscopic and Robotic assisted hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that is a minimally invasive way in which to remove the uterus, which has less scarring and fewer complications.  However, this procedure, much like its open-surgical counterpart, is often associated with significant post-operative pain.  To augment this pain there are many 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           4 different analgesic techniques available to offset pain.  Ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is one such procedure involving the injection of a local anesthetic into the plane of the transversus abdominal muscle where the terminal branches of nerves lie.  A similar, yet different analgesic approach is that of direct injection of local anesthetic into the incision by the surgeon during or just after surgical procedures.  These two approaches have both been proven to decrease post-operative pain in patients for many procedures, but never compared to one another.  Background and Significance Even with the advancement of using laparoscopic and robotic technologies in total hysterectomies, patients still suffer from pain.  This study hopes to use a randomized controlled double-blinded approach to investigate the different analgesic outcomes from surgical infiltration of analgesics to that of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks in this procedure. Other studies have looked at the enhanced analgesic efficacy of both TAP blocks in laparoscopic and robotic procedures, as well as that of direct infiltration of anesthetics into the incisions following surgery.1 Up to this point, however, these two practices have not been undertaken in a single double-blind study in which to compare the analgesic efficacies.   2.2  Who developed the research plan/protocol?  Principal Investigator  Business and Industry Sponsor  Other:        2.3 Explain how the study design and methods will answer the research question. This is a double blinded randomized study.  All patients will receive one form of local anesthetic pain relief either from TAP or infiltration.  Patients will be randomized to one of two study arms in a double-blinded, placebo controlled study.  All patients will receive a TAP infiltration and all patients will receive infiltration into the incision.  In one arm the TAP infiltration will contain 10 mL of 0.25 % bupivacaine with epinephrine injected followed by 20 mL of a 50:50 mixture of liposomal bupivacaine and normal saline.  This will then be repeated on the contralateral side.  In the same arm the surgeon infiltration into the incision will consist of 10 ml of normal saline per port site, 5 ml prior to incision and 5 ml prior to closure at each port site.  In the second arm the bilateral TAP infiltration will consist of 30 mL of normal saline per side.  In the same arm the surgeon infiltration will consist of 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine per port site. The surgeon infiltration will consist of 5 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine prior to incision and 5 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine prior to closure at each port site.  A TAP infiltration is an injection of local anesthetic under the covering of the transversus abdominis muscle layer which provides effective post operative analgesia.2-5  This layer is found using an ultrasound, which is a beam of high frequency sound that allows one to visualize images in the body.  Then using this ultrasound we can see our needle as it pierces the covering of the transversus abdominis muscle layer and watch as the local anesthetic is infiltrated into this plane.  This is done on both sides of the abdomen to provide analgesia to the skin, muscle, and facial layers of the abdomen.  This is currently standard of care at our institution and will be performed within one hour of surgical incision. The injection will consist of 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine followed by 20 mL of liposomal bupivacaine saline mixture or 10 ml of saline followed by 20 ml of saline and then repeated on the contralateral side.  Surgical Infiltration of the study solution will be performed both prior to incision and at the end of surgery just prior to closure of incisions. At each time, the surgeon will inject 5 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine into each of the port site 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           5 incisions. Investigational Drug Service (IDS) pharmacy will be charged with the blinding of medications vs. saline for these procedures.         2.4 What will the subjects be asked to do solely for the purpose of this research?  Subjects will be asked to be randomly assigned to receive either a TAP with liposomal bupivacaine or infiltration with bupivacaine.  They will also be asked to answer questions at various time points related to their pain, answer a survery on their quality of recovery.  They will also be asked to allow the research staff to access their medical chart to obtain information about their pain medication use, complications, demographics, and time of discharge.   2.5 Does the study involve treatment?  No.    Yes. List any procedure that would be performed if research was not conducted (i.e. procedures performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes).  all procedures would be performed if research was not conducted as both the TAP and infiltration are standard of care.  2.6 Indicate whether your research includes any of the following to determine which supplemental forms must be submitted with your application: If the research includes Appendices and supplemental materials required   Administration of approved or unapproved drugs, chemical or biological agents Appendix E required with the application  Administration of approved or unapproved devices Appendix F required with the application  Genetic testing (whether or not results are returned to subjects) Appendix G required with the application  Use of (collecting or having access to) Protected Health Information (PHI)  Appendix H required with the application  Field Work Appendix L required with the application  Use of a deceptive technique Appendix N required with the application  A debriefing script is also required.

Section 3   Risks and Benefits  3.1  Please indicate if the proposed research will include any of the following (check all that apply). The list below is not exhaustive but represents common elements or procedures in research with associated risks that are frequently overlooked or not clearly articulated.  Administration of physical stimuli  Probing for personal or sensitive information in surveys or interviews  Collection of data with identifiers 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           7  Possible invasion of privacy of the subject or the subject’s family  Modification or extension of a surgical process to achieve research related objectives.  Major changes in diet, exercise, or sleep  Manipulation of psychological or social variables such as sensory deprivation, social isolation, psychological stresses  Placebo Use  Treatment will be withheld or subjects will discontinue current treatment (a wash out period is included)  None of the above 3.2 Describe in detail the nature and degree of the risk associated with participation. The risks must be disclosed in the consent form.  Include in the response all potential risks, not just those indicated in the checklist above. There is the potential of loss of privacy as the medical chart is accessed by the research staff.  In addition there is a placebo used however no patient will be without pain medication.  The TAP will either consist of local anesthetic or saline.  When the TAP consists  of saline the infiltration will consist of local anesthetic and when the TAP consists of local anesthetic the infiltration will consist of saline.   With injection of local anesthetic there is risk of the block or infiltration not working.  There is risk of it being injected in the wrong area and there is risk of local anesthetic toxicity albeit the dosages used are well below those which would place the patient at risk of local anesthetic toxicity.  3.3 Describe the precautions that will be taken to minimize each of the risks identified in questions 3.1 and 3.2. All patient charts will be accessed by a trained research personnel.  They will not record any identifiers.  Patient's will be asked if they are willing to answer questions prior to each round of questions regarding pain scores and surveys.   All TAP and infiltration are standard of care.  Either or would be used if we were not doing the research.  The TAP infiltration is performed by trained anesthesiologists and are under ultrasound real time guidance.  The infiltration is performed by trained surgeons.   3.4 List any anticipated direct and societal benefits to participation in this research project. If none, state that in the space provided below and in the consent form.  The benefit of receiving treatment is not necessarily a benefit to participation in the research project.   Compensation paid to subjects is not considered a benefit. none 3.5 Justify the risk in terms of the potential scientific yield and in relation to the anticipated benefits to the subjects. The benefits of this study would be to find the most effective method of pain control which would not only decrease patient's pain but decrease their use of opioids.  As opioids are a significant burden on society in terms of misuse, addiction, and even death.  It is important we find ways to minimize postoperative pain and postoperative 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           8 opioid use.

Examples: 1. hair and nail clippings in a nondisfiguring manner; 2. deciduous teeth at time of exfoliation or if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction; 3. permanent teeth if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction; 4. excreta and external secretions (including sweat); 5. uncannulated saliva collected either in an unstimulated fashion or stimulated by chewing gumbase or wax or by applying a dilute citric solution to the tongue; 6. placenta removed at delivery; 7. amniotic fluid obtained at the time of rupture of the membrane prior to or during labor; 8. supra- and subgingival dental plaque and calculus, provided the collection procedure is not more invasive than routine prophylactic scaling of the teeth and the process is accomplished in accordance with accepted prophylactic techniques; 9. mucosal and skin cells collected by buccal scraping or swab, skin swab, or mouth washings; 10. sputum collected after saline mist nebulization.  Cat. 4 Collection of data through noninvasive procedures (not involving general anesthesia or sedation) routinely employed in clinical practice, excluding procedures involving x-rays or microwaves. Where medical devices are employed, they must be cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally eligible for expedited review, 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           17 including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications.) Examples: 1. physical sensors that are applied either to the surface of the body or at a distance and do not involve input of significant amounts of energy into the subject or an invasion of the subject’s privacy; 2. weighing or testing sensory acuity; 3. magnetic resonance imaging; 4. electrocardiography, electroencephalography, thermography, detection of naturally occurring radioactivity, electroretinography, ultrasound, diagnostic infrared imaging, doppler blood flow, and echocardiography; 5. moderate exercise, muscular strength testing, body composition assessment, and flexibility testing where appropriate given the age, weight, and health of the individual.   Cat. 5 Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been collected, or will be collected solely for nonresearch purposes (such as medical treatment or diagnosis). (NOTE: Some research in this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects. 45 CFR 46.101(b)(4). This listing refers only to research that is not exempt.)   Cat. 6 Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.  Cat. 7 Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior (including, but not limited to, research on perception, cognition, motivation, identity, language, communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior) or research employing survey, interview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies.  (NOTE: Some research in this category may be exempt from the HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects. 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2) and (b)(3). This listing refers only to research that is not exempt.)   Section 9 Informed Consent Process Document the Elements of the Informed Consent Process It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess comprehension of the risks and benefits of participation in the research and only enroll subjects who can demonstrate understanding of the research study (45 CFR 46.116). The federal regulations require that consent be in language understandable to the subject. If subjects do not comprehend English, translated consent forms are required, or the use of short forms with an oral explanation can be accepted.  Consent forms must be submitted for IRB review. It is highly recommended that researchers use the sample consent for template available on the IRB Forms page. Do not submit sponsor prepared forms without editing the form to include University of Minnesota IRB standard language and all essential elements of informed consent.  Resources for preparing consent forms are available at: Informed Consent Online Tutorial – http://www.research.umn.edu/consent/  If the researcher is requesting a waiver of consent, complete questions 9.9 and 9.10 only. Be advised that waiver of consent is rarely granted.  9.1   Document the informed consent process timeline. Detail when consent will be discussed and documented in relation to research data collection, if there will be any waiting period or if process will occur over multiple contacts or clinical visits. The consent will be discussed in the ciinic visit with the surgeon.  They will be given a copy of the consent and a phone number to call if they have questions.  Then on the day of surgery after they have had adequate time to 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           18 review the consent they will sign consent after discussion with the anesthesiologist (co-PI).    9.2  Will anyone not listed on this application obtain consent? Except in rare circumstances, all individuals who will obtain consent must be listed as research personnel on the IRB application so that basic human subjects’ research training is documented.  If in-person consent will not be obtained, select the option below and provide rationale.  No If no, go to question 9.3  Yes Explain who, other than those listed as personnel on this application, will obtain consent          N/A In-person consent will not be obtained.  Explain below:       9.3  Provide a brief description of the plan to train those individuals who will be obtaining consent from subjects to participate in this project.   all staff will complete CITI training.   Note:  Everyone obtaining consent must complete CITI training.   9.4  Will all subjects consent for themselves?  Yes If yes, adults lacking capacity to consent must be listed in the exclusion criteria (question 4.7).    No If no, indicate below who, when appropriate, will provide consent  Parent/guardian  Legally authorized representative – Appendix I required  9.5  What questions will be asked to assess the subjects’ understanding? Questions should be open-ended and go beyond requiring a yes/no response. What are the benefits and risks of the tap or infiltration? What are the benefits and risks of either local anesthetic medication? How will your pain be managed post-operatively in both options of the study? What are the alternative treatment options to control your pain post-operatively? What will be done if you have an allergic reaction or reaction to the pain medication in this study?   9.6   Participation in research must be voluntary.  Describe the steps taken to minimize the possibility of undue influence on potential subjects. As the intervention we are providing two options which is the current standard of care, it is considered safe and efficacious.  We will discuss the options, as well as the risks and benefits with the patient.  No additional benefit is gained by the anesthesiologist if this technique is used and this will be discussed with the patient.   Care of Subjects in Case of Accident If this research involves a potential for injury, injury compensation language must be included in the consent form (see 21 CFR 50.25).  If a contract to pay for research-related injuries exists, the language in the consent form should not contradict the language in the contract.  9.7   Is there a potential for research related injury?  
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           19  No If no, go to question 9.8  Yes If yes, indicate which of the following statements is included in the consent form    Non-Sponsor Funded Compensation  In the event that this research activity results in an injury, treatment will be available, including first aid, emergency treatment and follow-up care as needed.  Care for such injuries will be billed in the ordinary manner, to you or your insurance company.  If you think that you have suffered a research related injury let the study physicians know right away.       Sponsor Funded Compensation  In the event that this research activity results in an injury, treatment will be available, including first aid, emergency treatment and follow-up care as needed.  Care for such injuries will be billed in the ordinary manner, to you or your insurance company.  The sponsor of the study has some funds available to pay for care for injuries resulting directly from being in this study.  If you think that you have suffered a research related injury and that you may be eligible for reimbursement of some medical care costs, let the study physicians know right away.     If the preferred injury compensation language is unacceptable to the study sponsor, the following alternative language may be used:  Under some circumstances the sponsor of the study will pay for care for injuries resulting directly from being in the study.  If you want information about those circumstances or if you think you have suffered a research related injury let the study physicians know right away.   Waiving Documentation of Consent Waiving written documentation assumes that there will be an informed consent process but signatures will not be collected on the consent form. The IRB may waive the requirement for written documentation under specific conditions.    9.8 Does the researcher wish to waive documentation of consent?   No If no, go to question 9.9  Yes If yes, check the statement below that applies to justify waiving documentation of consent.  If neither statement applies, researcher may not request waiver of documentation    The only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent form and the principal risk of the research would be the potential harm from a breach of confidentiality (the IRB may allow an option to sign or decline)    The research presents no more than minimal risk and includes no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside the research context. NOTE: Researchers requesting a waiver of documentation must submit a consent form without signature lines with the IRB application.  Waiving Consent The IRB may, in some rare and specific circumstances, waive the requirement for consent in accordance with 45 CFR 46.116(d).  Answer the questions below to determine if waiver of consent may be considered. 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           20  9.9 Does the researcher wish to waive consent?   No If no, go to section 10 - Funding  Yes Indicate if the following statements apply   The research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects.    Yes    No – waiver may not be requested   Granting a waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.

CLINICALTRIALS.GOV REGISTRATION Important Information about clinicaltrials.gov registration Resources available, penalties for failure to register and publication requirements  Potential risks associated with failure to register with clinicaltrials.gov: • Loss of funding (National Institute of Health) • Financial penalty levied against the PI • Denial of publication (ICMJE) • Denial of payment to healthcare providers. Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA 801) establishes penalties for Responsible Parties who fail to comply with registration or results submission requirements. Penalties include civil monetary penalties and, for federally funded studies, the withholding of grant funds. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or concurrent comparison or control groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process-of-care changes, and the like.   Research projects that meet the ICMJE definition may not be accepted for publication if they are not registered in a registry that is electronically searchable and accessible to the public at no charge.  For more information on this requirement see http://www.icmje.org  Note that retrospective registration of projects is not allowed. Additionally, healthcare providers are required to include the clinicaltrials.gov number on all claims during the time period the patient participates in the study. The Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) will assist University of Minnesota investigators to comply with the registration requirement.  Complete the section below to document status or determine if registration is required.  Applications submitted without a Clinicaltrials.gov registration number (either received or pending) will be forwarded to the CTSI for review.

No  The PI understands the registration requirements and the consequences, as described above, of failure to register if applicable. CTSI will review this application for concurrence with the PIs decision.  CTSI will contact the PI and the IRB to confirm registration requirement.  If registration is required, the PI may request assistance with this process from CTSI. Go to Section 12.5  Unsure CTSI will contact the PI and the IRB with a determination regarding the registration requirement. If registration is required, the PI may request assistance with this process from CTSI.  Go to Section 12.5  Yes Answer the questions below to determine who (either the PI or other entity) is responsible for registration with clinicaltrials.gov    Is this study initiated by a University of Minnesota investigator?  No  Yes – registration by PI required. Is this study federally sponsored and the University of Minnesota is the only study site OR the study’s coordinating center?  No  Yes – registration by PI required. Is a University of Minnesota investigator the holder of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the test article OR it has been determined the proposed use of the test article is IND exempt?  No  Yes – registration by PI required. Is a University of Minnesota investigator the holder of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for the device being studied OR a non-significant risk (NSR) determination has been made for the device being studied?  No  Yes – registration by PI required. If registration is required, the registration number must be provided before final IRB approval is granted. Email ctsi@umn.edu for additional information and registration assistance.  CTSI will evaluate all applications not registered with clinicaltrials.gov.   Section 12.5   SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT  Research involving human subjects must be reviewed for sound scientific design prior to review by the IRB committee.  Documentation of scientific assessment including the content of the review must be provided before the project will be reviewed by the IRB.  Scientific assessment is not required for new studies that meet the federal criteria for expedited review. If a study is submitted for expedited review but is determined by the IRB to NOT meet the criteria for expedited review, then scientific peer review will be required before IRB review.  12.5.1  Has the IRB scientific assessment requirement been met?   N/A  Project qualifies for expedited review.  Sections 12.5, 12.6 and 12.7 are not required if expedited review eligible.  GO TO Section 13 Additional Staff. 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           26  Yes Indicate below how the requirement has been met Required supplemental materials  Option1 Reviewed by a federal funding agency (National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, etc.) employing peer review mechanisms for awarding of funding.   Option 2 Reviewed by a nationally based non-federal funding agency (March of Dimes, American Academy of Pediatrics, etc.) employing peer review mechanisms for awarding of funding   Note: industry-sponsored clinical trials designed by the sponsor with or without external consultants do not satisfy this criterion for independent peer-review.   Option 3 Reviewed by locally constituted mechanisms using peer review for awarding of funding, or for permission to use resources: Cancer Protocol Review Committee (CPRC); CTSI funded pilot awards; Vikings; departmental peer review etc. Attach the review and the signed form documenting that departmental or collegiate peer review of the research protocol has been performed.        Option 4 Reviewed by HRPP facilitated Scientific Assessment committee Submit approval notification with application. Section 12.6  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN A data and safety monitoring plan (DSMP) is meant to assure that each clinical investigation has a system for oversight and monitoring of the conduct of the clinical investigation.  This oversight is intended to ensure the safety of the participants and the validity and integrity of the data.  A DSMP should be commensurate with the risks.   A DSMP can be as simple as the investigator reporting adverse event information to the IRB. A DSMP can be as complex as having a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. A DSMP can include clinical trial monitoring.  Clinical trial monitoring refers to the methods used to oversee the conduct of, and reporting of data from, clinical investigations including appropriate clinical investigator supervision of study site staff. Monitoring activities include communication with the investigator and the study site staff; review of the study site’s processes, procedures, and records; and verification of the accuracy of the data.   12.6.1 In addition to the Principal Investigator, are there other DATA monitoring entities responsible for this function? Select all that apply.  No, the PI is the only entity monitoring DATA.  Yes   A review entity will provide ongoing DATA monitoring   Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)  Data coordinating center or project principal investigator (multi-center studies)  Commercial sponsor, contract research organization (CRO) 
Health & Biological/Medical Application Form           27  Other:        12.6.2 In addition to the Principal Investigator, are there other SAFETY monitoring entities responsible for this function? Select all that apply.  No, the PI is the only entity monitoring SAFETY.  Yes Select all below that apply   A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed.  When established, the list of the DSMB members including their affiliation and credentials and the DSMB charter must be submitted to the IRB.  A description of the DSMB must be provided with the application.    A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is an independent group of experts that advises the study investigators. Primary responsibilities of a DSMB are to 1) periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when appropriate, efficacy, and 2) make recommendations concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial. The DSMB considers study-specific data as well as relevant background knowledge about the disease, test agent, or patient population under study.  The DSMB reports should be provided to the IRB as they are received.     Medical Monitor  Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Council  Other, describe:        Section 12. 7  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING RESPONSIBILITIES Data to be monitored PI Review entity DSMB/other Unassigned Study Safety (e.g., collection, reporting, and management of AEs, SAEs, and other study risks).     Data Accuracy & Quality Assurance (e.g., data collection, entry, transmission and analysis).     Trial Management (e.g., site coordination, enrollment and population distribution).     Regulatory Issues (e.g., SAE reporting, IRB Actions, disclosures of conflict of interest).     Interim Analysis.     It is the investigator’s opinion that this protocol does not require a data safety monitoring plan.  Provide justification:        Section 13 Additional Research Staff Co-Investigators Co-Investigators, responsible for knowing and following the protocol, should be listed below.

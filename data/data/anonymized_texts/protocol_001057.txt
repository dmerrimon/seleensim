Title:  Preventing Post -Vaccination Presyncope and Syncope in Adolescents 
Using Simple, Clinic -based Interventions : A Pilot Study  
Population:  Up to 30 adolescent s, 10 to 17 years  of age,  who will receive at least one 
intramuscularly administered vaccine  
Clinical Sites:  One: Duke  University  
Study Duration:  6 weeks  
 
Participa nt 
Duration:  1 day  
Description of 
Study Procedures: This is a randomized controlled open -label trial.  During the study, 
adolescents scheduled to receive at least one IM vaccine will receive 
either Buzzy®, Music , or Buzzy® and Music intervention(s)  in addition to 
standard care to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of these interventions  prior to being used in a larger study to assess the 
effectiveness of the interventions in preventing post -vaccination 
presyncope and syncope .  Feasibility will be assessed according to study 
staff ability to successfully administer the protocol specified clinic -based 
interventions and per both study staff and healthcare provider responses  
to written feasibility assessments .  Acceptability will b e assess ed 
according to the participant’s self -report. In addition, baseline needle 
phobia and anxiety, post -vaccination pain and presyncope symptoms, 
and pre - and post - vaccination state anxiety will be assessed per 
participant written self -report to standardized survey questions.

8 1 BACKGROUND   
1.1 Background  
 
Vasovagal  Syncope  
Syncope is a sudden and transient loss of consciousness and postural tone that typically 
lasts from several seconds to a minute, followed by spontaneous recovery. Syncope is caused by a sudden decrease or brief cessation of cerebral blood flow .
1 Syncope is fairly 
common and more frequently occurs among females, with a peak incidence between 15 and 19 years of age.
2  Although uncommon, syncope can occur following immunization 
and result in serious injury.3   
 Vasovagal  (neurocardiogenic ) syncope is the most common form of  syncope.
4 
Characterized by the development of arterial vasodilation in the setting of relative or absolute bradycardia, the mechanism by which vasovagal  factors lead to syncope are 
not well understood. In some cases, syncope may be triggered in the central nervous system. In other cases, activity at the level of baroreceptors may lead to an increase in vagal tone and sympathetic withdrawal, leading to bradycardia, hypotension, and 
decreased cerebral blood flow. Multiple factors have been identified as possible triggers 
for syncope including: fear, anxiety, pain, hunger, overcrowding, illness, fati gue, 
injections, venipuncture, the sight of blood, and maintaining a still upright posture for a prolonged period. Alcohol, drugs and exposure to cold or heat can also precipitate syncope. Typically , vasovagal  syncope is preceded by prodromal symptoms, known as 
presyncope, which may involve nausea, dizziness, visual changes (e.g., spots, dimming), feelings of apprehension, pallor, yawning, diaphoresis, and feelings of 
warmth.  
 Following a syncopal event, individuals may complain of malaise, fatigue, weakness, 
nausea, and headache. Although vasovagal  syncope is self -limited, there is a potential 
for harm if affected individuals fall. For example, a syncope- related fall resulting in 
cerebral injury and death has been reported  after vaccination.
5 Rarely, syncope can be 
followed by a brief tonic -clonic seizure.1 In addition to the potential for injury, syncopal 
episodes often prompt extensive diagnostic testing in the emergency department and can sometimes lead to hospitalization.  Moreover, syncopal episodes triggered by identifiable stimuli such as needle- exposure can potentiate risk for development of more 
severe reactions to similar stimuli over time (e.g., blood- injection- injury phobia).
6  The 
median age of onset of blood- injury -injection phobia is 7- 11 years.7 
 Post -vaccination syncope 
The National Academy of Medicine(formerly Institute of Medicine)  has concluded that 
evidence “convincingly supports a causal relationship between the injection of a vaccine 
and syncope”
 likely due to a vasovagal reaction.8 Although uncommon , with an estimated 
rate of 1 per 1000 in the adolescent age group ,9 syncope after vaccination can lead to 
serious injury. An analysis of cases reported to VAERs in the 1990s described cases of syncope following immunization.
3 Reported episodes (n=697) occurred most frequentl y 
among those 10 through 18 years of age (45%), in females (58%), and within 15 minutes after vaccination (89%). Complications included tonic or clonic movements (24%) and 
subsequent hospitalization (10%). Reported serious adverse events associated with post- vaccination syncope included concussion, skull fracture, intracranial bleeding, 
cerebral contusions, and a motor vehicle collision due to syncope while driving.

Following the introduction of new vaccines for adolescents (i.e., Tetanus, Diphtheria and 
Pertussis ( Tdap ), Meningococcal ( MCV4 ), Human papillomavirus ( HPV)) between 2005-
2007, the number of cases of post -vaccination syncope reported to VAERS increased, 
primarily among females 11- 18 years of age.10 Post-vaccination syncope has also been 
described in military personnel.11 The rate of medical encounters for post -vaccination 
syncope was 9.7 per 100,000 immunization episodes.  The rate of syncope was higher 
among females, declined with increasing age, and increased with increasing number of 
injections per immunization episode. Injuries occurred in approximately 7% of 
encounters for post -vaccination syncope, including head wounds, contusions, 
concussions, facial and clavicle fractures, and intracranial and ocular injuries.11  
Additional work has also shown that patients who experience syncopal symptoms in association with injection procedures are much more likely to be diagnosed with needle-
phobia.
7,12 Moreover, emerging theories regarding acquisition of needle phobia in 
children  describe that negative physical experiences such as syncope symptoms and 
pain can serve as fear conditioning events, which may contribute to the development of needle phobia.
13  
 
Post-vaccination vasovagal syncope and associated injuries , as well as risk for recurrent 
symptoms and related  interference  in functioning , are a public health concern that 
should be addressed with evidence- based preventive interventions. Although post -
vaccination presyncope does not always lead to syncope, it is more common than 
syncope, and both are vasovagally -mediated,11,14 and so presyncope is appropriate for 
use as a surrogate for syncope in prevention research. Presyncope has been used as a 
surrogate for syncope in syncope prevention studies in the blood donation literature. Also CDC supported a previous post -vaccination syncope prevention study at Duke and 
Boston University using presyncope as a surrogate endpoint for syncope.
15  
 Predictors of Vasovagal Syncope   
The efficiency of primary prevention of vasovagal syncope could be improved if 
preventive interventions could be targeted at those at greatest risk. Unfortunately, 
predicting risk of syncope is difficult. In blood donors, for example, pre -donation blood 
pressure was not associated with risk of syncope and a pre -donation elevated pulse rate 
has inconsistently been associated with risk of syncope,
16-18 and the best predictor, 
anxiety, demonstrated only a modest association .19 Due to the challenge of accurately 
predicting risk, any preventive intervention would likely have to be universally applied.  
 
Published systematic reviews and meta- analyses of interventions to prevent blood 
donation- related vasovagal symptoms and syncope in young donors suggest that risk 
factors for post -vaccination and post -blood- donation vasovagal (not volume depletion) 
syncope include: 1) younger (adolescents) and first time donors; 2) anxiety; 3) needle 
phobia; and 4) prior history of syncope from needle- related event(s).7,11,14,16,17,20-24  Some 
publications also cite increases in syncope among females;11,16,17,21,23-25 and among 
those with a prior history of fainting or feeling faint (due to any reason) .17,22,23  Blood 
donation literature also suggests that vasovagal syncope is more common among 
Caucasians as compared to Af rican -Americans ,17,24 and in persons with lower body 
mass index (BMI) as compared to greater BMI .16 
 
Current Recommendations Related to Post -Vaccination Syncope  
There are no evidence- based recommendations for the primary prevention of post -
vaccination syncope. However, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
10 (ACIP ) recommends that providers should take appropriate measures to prevent injuries 
if a patient becomes weak or dizzy or loses consciousness. Adolescents and adults 
should be seated or lying down during vaccination. Vaccine providers, particularly when 
vaccinating adolescents, should consider observing patients (with patients seated or 
lying down) for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for injury should they 
faint. If syncope develops, patients should be observed until the symptoms resolve.26 
The effectiveness of these measures is not known. One survey found that many primary 
care providers were unaware of these recommendations. Other than knowledge, the 
most commonly reported barrier to implementing the 15- minute post -vaccination 
observation period was lack of clinic space.27 
 Prevention of Vasovagal  Syncope  
Research targeting the prevention of vasovagal  syncope in blood donors may offer 
relevant insights for preventing post -vaccination syncope and associated injuries . 
However, blood donation is not an ideal  model for deriving strategies to prevent post -
vaccination syncope because blood donation involves a significant loss of intravascular 
volume, takes a longer period of time than vaccination, and only volunteers donate 
blood; in addition, most donors are adults ≥18 years, not among the youngest adolescents at highest risk for post -vaccination syncope.  
 Although several strategies have been evaluated, two have emerged as most effective in 
the blood donation setting: acute water loading and applied muscle tension.  Review of 
blood donation literature indicates that consuming approximately 500 mL of water shortly 
before phlebotomy may  help to mitigate vasovagal response to needle insertion and 
fainting, especially in young, first -time blood donors .  Consuming water  increases 
peripheral vascular tone by s tretch ing of baroreceptors in the stomach wall, and is also 
believed to be achieved through effects on the portal venous system from ingesting a 
hypo- osmolalar beverage.
27-29  Water can have an effect within 15 minutes and last up to 
an hour. In contrast, applied muscle tension can increase venous return, and thus help 
maintain blood pressure.  A  randomized prospective study found that applied muscle 
tension (AMT)  reduced vasovagal symptoms in blood donors by 50%, from 16% to 8%  
among blood don ors.22 The mechanism of action may involve a combination of factors, 
including increased venous return and through distraction and reduction of anxiety.22,28 
However, a systematic review and meta- analysis of interventions to reduce vasovagal 
reactions in blood donors found no significant reduction in vasovagal reactions among 8 
AMT studies that included 3500 subjects.21  Thus far, no single intervention has been 
shown to be effective for preventing vasovagal symptoms and/or syncope during blood donation in all age groups.   
 
Unlike the blood donation literature there are limited data on effective strategies to 
prevent post -vaccination vasovagal syncope. Only one randomized clinical trial has 
assessed an interveion to prevent post -vaccination syncope. A recent Clinical 
Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) randomized clinical trial (Kemper et al, 
ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])
30 assessed the effectiveness of pre -vaccination 
hydration with water to prevent presyncope (used as a surrogate for syncope). Drinking 
some water before vaccination was not effective in preventing presyncope and by 
extension syncope, prompting CISA to plan evaluations of other simple interventions that 
could be used in busy clinical settings. The hydration study demonstrated  the following 
as risk factors for post -vaccination presyncope among subjects 11 -21 years: receiving 
more th an one injectable vaccine; age younger than 15 years; having higher pre-
vaccination anxiety levels; history of passing out or nearly passing out after a “shot” or 
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
11 blood draw, and having higher levels of pain after vaccination (presumed injection- site 
pain) .15 These predictors may inform other strategies for preventing pre- syncope such as 
promoting relaxation, mitigating anxiety, and reducing immediate pain after vaccination.  
 
1.2 Summary & Rationale  
 
In children and adolescents, distraction and relaxation methods, such as listening to 
music, have shown some effectiveness in decreasing medically -related anxiety23,31,32 
and pain.33  Further,  other interventions, such as the use of a topical vapocoolant 
shortly before injection or the use of Buzzy® (combination vibration and cool pack 
applied to planned injection sites shortly before injections), have been shown to 
decrease injection site pain, which might play a role in decreasing injection pain-
associated vasovagal symptoms.31,32 
To identify best practices for prevent ing post -vaccination vasovagal syncope, we will 
target adolescents, a higher -risk population for post -vaccination syncope. Since post -
vaccination syncope is an uncommon  event, we will use presyncopal  (vasovagal) signs 
and symptoms as a surrogate marker for syncope, as was done in the earlier CISA study. Based on our review of available blood donation literature, which does not 
identify one intervention with high efficacy, we plan to investigate two distinct previously unstudied interventions to prevent post -vaccination syncope through mitigation of 
immediate injection- site pain and anxiety . We will also assess use of a combination of 
these interventions.  
Buzzy® | Drug Free Pain Relief is a reusable medical device designed to reduce 
vaccination pain [https://buzzyhelps.com/]. The Buzzy® device is applied to a targeted 
skin area for 30- 60 seconds in order to cool/numb the area and provide vibration to 
desensitize pain receptors (nociceptors) prior to inj ection, then the device is moved just 
proximal to the site during injection. The device has been found to decrease pain 73% in children aged 7 years receiving Tdap in a prospective , randomized controlled trial,  
and the cost of the device ranges from $40 - $100 for an individual Buzzy® 
[https://buzzyhelps.com/store/buzzy -professional].
34  
Consumer reviews of Buzzy® are positive. As seen on Amazon.com, the ‘Buzzy Mini Personal Striped’ has received 4 out of 5 stars from 552  customers.
35 The top positive 
review, as designated by the Amazon website, spoke positively of the device for use 
with at -home injections. The top critical review noted that a two- year-old child was 
unreceptive to the cold features of the device (Customer Reviews). Additional web searches identified several personal blogs, mostly written by mothers who had 
purchased the device for their child’s injections, which were generally positive. Additionally, clinical settings have started using the device including the Shriner s 
Hospitals for Children in Greenville, South Carolina (Shriner’s Hospitals).
 
Distraction has been investigated as a technique to reduce vaccination pain in children 
and adolescents. One systematic review identified various distraction techniques, 
includin g verbal distraction, video distraction, breathing with a toy, and musical 
distraction.36 Results suggested these distraction techniques  showed beneficial effects 
in reducing pain and distress from vaccinations.37 An additional review focusing 
specifically on the utility of music in mitigating procedural pain and anxiety among youth 
demonstrated reduced anxiety and improved experience of pain even after controlling 
for covariates.38 The effects of music on anxiety have been demonstrated across 
outcome measures spanning self -report, parent -report, observer -report, and 
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
12 physiological functioning (Heart Rate).   Moreover, based on subgroup analyses, they 
further concluded that passive music therapy (i.e., listening to music) may be as 
effective as active music therapy ( i.e., working with a specified music therapist), and 
that music  when combined with other modalities (e.g., may be more effective than when 
presented alone.39 Importantly, music is a low -cost and practical intervention for use in 
clinical settings.23,40 To the extent that that listening to music is an effective independent 
and/or adjunctive strategy in improving pain/or anxiety associated with injections , it may 
also help mitigate the role of these factors in the development of presyncopal 
symptoms.  
In summary, we aim to first assess the feasibility and acceptability among adolescent s 
of using Buzzy® alone, music distraction alone, or both Buzzy® and music distraction 
together  to prevent post -vaccination presyncope. Results of pilot study assessments 
will be used to guide the development of a full study to assess the effectiveness of the most feasible and acceptable intervention.

16 4 DEFINING PRESYNCOPE  AND SYNCOPE  
4.1 Presyncope  
For this study, the case definition of presyncope was based on review of the literature, 
the Blood Donations Reactions Inventory (BDRI), expert opinion,  and prior experience 
with the hydration study .12-14 Although there may be measurable physiological changes 
with presyncope (e.g., decrease in heart rate or blood pressure), there are no established cut -offs that define presyncope.  Therefore, the case definition is based on 
subjective criteria.  The case definition  previously used in Oral Water Hydration to 
Prevent Post -Vaccination Presyncope (“Water and Vaccines Study”)  is below:  
 
Sudden onset of one or more of the following symptoms or signs during the post-vaccination observation period in the clinic:  
 
Symptoms  
• Feeling lightheaded, like you might “pass out” or faint  
• Feeling dizzy, like the room is spinning  
• Feeling weak  
• Feeling like your face is getting red and warm (or hot), like blushing or flushing 
• Noticing any change in your vision, like spots or flickering lights, tunnel vision, or 
loss of vision  
• Experiencing ringing in your ears, decreased hearing, or sounds seem far away  
• Feeling like your heart is beating fast or hard or pounding 
• Feeling hot AND sweaty  
• Feeling cold AND sweaty, or “clammy”  
• Feeling like you are breathing fast or hard  
• Feeling like you might throw up (nausea)  
 
Signs  
• Pallor  
• Sweaty  
• Facial flush 
• Decreased interactivity (decreased level of arousal or responsiveness)  
 
AND  
• Not Syncope  
• Not Due to another Cause 
• Not clearly present at baseline   
For the purpose of this study, presyncope will be defined as any response of self -report 
of “some,”  or “a lot,” to the modified BDRI or study staff noting signs or symptoms on 
study documents if the subject requires medical attention and does not complete the 
BDRI form  
 
Usual clinical care will be provided to any subject who develops presyncope.  
 
4.2 Syncope  
 
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0  
April 17, 2018  
17 Syncope (fainting) that occurs in an otherwise healthy person after receipt of a vaccine 
or during venipuncture is usually attributed to vasovagal syncope, and may occur alone 
(simple syncope) or may be associated with tonic -clonic movements (convulsiv e 
syncope, anoxic seizure).12,13  For the purposes of this study, we have defined syncope 
as:  Any sudden and brief loss of consciousness or postural tone after vaccination from 
which recovery is spontaneous and is not attributed to another cause (e.g., anaphylaxis).  For purposes of this study, cases counted as syncope must occur during the post-
vaccination observation period.   
 
Usual clinical care will be provided to any subject who develops syncope.  
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
18 5 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This pilot study  is a prospective, randomized, open- label clinical trial that will be 
conducted in adolescents (10 -17 years of age) receiving at least one recommended 
intramuscular ly administered vaccine to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using 
two different  interventions that might prevent post -vaccination presyncope, and by 
extension syncope.   The two interventions to be evaluated are 1) Buzzy® Drug Free 
Pain Relief which is a medical device designed to reduce vaccination pain and 2) 
Listening to music as a distraction technique .  We will also evaluate both interventions 
when administered simult aneously (Buzzy® and music ).  We will enroll approximately 30 
subjects into this pilot study.  Eligible adolescents  will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive 
one of the three above named interventions : 1) Buzzy® alone; 2) Music alone; or 3) 
Buzzy® and Music together to assess for feasibility and acceptability. Eligible 
adolescents must have an identified risk factor for the development of presyncope 
including being either of younger age (10 -13 years) or receiving 2 or more injectable 
vaccines (one of which must be received intramuscularly).  A minimum of 20% of 
adolescents enrolled across all intervention groups will be 10-13 years of age and a 
minimum of 20% of adolescents enr olled across all intervention groups will be 1 4-17 
years of age.  Detailed data will be collected and described from study participants 
including demographics, medical history, baseline anxiety, and needle phobia. 
Participants will be observed for 20 minutes following receipt of vaccines and 
reassessed for post -vaccination anxiety, immediate and subsequent post -vaccination 
pain (within 1 minute and at 10 minutes), the occurrence of witnessed syncope or 
presyncope, and presyncop al symptoms as rated by the modified BDRI . For the primary 
objective, we will assess the acceptability and feasibility of both interventions  separately 
or together .  For the exploratory object ives, we  will assess presyncope symptoms 
following vaccination, post -vaccination pain, and change in anxiety from baseline for the 
adolescents randomized to each of the intervention groups.  Using lessons learned during the Pilot, if feasible and acceptable, we will evaluate the most feasible and acceptable presyncope prevention strateg y in a larger effectiveness trial .

approached about their adolescent  participating in the study and needing to decide 
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
22 whether or not to participate.  We anticipate that the initial consent /assent  discussion, 
including presenting t he information in the consent /assent  document and answering 
questions will take about 30 minutes.   During the consent /assent  process , it will be 
stressed that participation is voluntary and that parents can withdraw permission for their 
adolescent  to participate at any time.  Permission will not be obtained from 
parent(s)/Guardian(s)  who do not read, who are blind, or who do not read/understand 
English. Parent(s)/Guardian(s) will be given a copy of the signed informed consent to 
take home with them.  The original copy of the consent /assent  will be kept in the study 
records and a third copy will be included in the adolescent’s  medical record per local 
requirements . Eligibility of the adolescent will also be assessed .

7.4 Demographic Information, Medical History 
The participant’s  gend er, age, race/ethnicity, and country of origin will be obtained from 
parent/guardian report at the time of enrollment. The insurance payer status for the 
adolescent  will be obtained from the electronic health record (EHR). The participant’s 
medical history in cluding: history of pre- syncope, syncope, cardiac conditions, seizures, 
hypoglycemia, diabetes, headaches, prescription and over -the counter medications in 
preceding week, supplements in preceding week will be obtained by review of the 
electronic health record (EHR) and will be reviewed and confirmed by the 
parent/guardian at the time of enrollment.   
 
7.5 Physical Measures  
Participants’  height, weight and calculated BMI will be obtained at enrollment or from the 
clinical measurements collected at the visit. P ulse-rate and blood pressure will also be 
obtained at baseline either through standard of care measurements or the study team will perform these assessments if they are not otherwise available.  In addition,  the clinic 
baseline pain assessment will be recorded.
 Blood pressure, and pulse will also be 
reassessed 20 minutes post -vaccination.  
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0

7.6 Needle Related Fear  
Fear of having blood drawn has been shown to be predictive of vasovagal reactions in young blood donors.
7 In blood donors fear was assessed using a global question. “How 
afraid are you of having blood drawn from your arm?”  A similarly worded global question 
will be used to assess fear of vaccination.  “How afraid are you of getting a vaccine (shot) in your arm?”  Responses will be graded using a Likert scale: 1 - not at all afraid; 
2- slightly afraid; 3 - somewhat afraid; 4- very afraid; 5 - extremely afraid.  In addition, we 
will use the American Psychiatric Association Severity Measure for Specific Phobia to 
asse ss needle related phobia.  This assessment is a 10 -item scale which specifically 
assesses phobia around blood, needles or injections in persons 11 -17 years of age. 
7,19 
 
7.7 Anxiet y  
Prior to vaccination the study coordinator will have each subject complete a 
questionnaire to assess generalized anxiety using the Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) anxiety short form instrument for 
adolescents (11- 17 years) to categorize their overall degree of anxiety.41 A resource list  
of mental health providers will be made available to parents upon request.   
 
Participants  will also complete a questionnaire specifically designed  for this study  to 
measure state anxiety  both prior to and 20 minutes following vaccination. State anxiety 
is defined as an unpleasant emotional arousal in face of threatening demands or 
dangers .42,43  
 
 
7.8 Randomization  
Participants will be randomized (1:1 :1) to receive either music intervention alone, 
Buzzy® alone, or combination music and Buzzy®  using a permuted block randomization 
scheme .  A minimum of 6 participants per age strata ( 10-13 and 14 -17 years)  will be 
enrolled across all intervention groups . The project statistician at Duke University will 
generate randomization schemes, which will be uploaded to REDCap. The 
randomization schedule will not be available to the study staff, so the next randomization 
allocation will not be known before randomization occurs. Following confirmation of 
study eligibility criteria during Visit 1, participant randomization will be through REDCap 
with trea tment allocation recorded on the CRF.  
 
7.8.1 Blinding  
Study staff and  subjects will not be blinded to treatment arm assignments.  
 
7.9 Study Interventions  
7.9.1 Buzzy ® Intervention 
Participants randomized to Buzzy® will apply  or have applied by a member of the study 
team  Buzzy®  XL Healthcare Professional as described in the package insert on the 
deltoid vaccination site for 30 -60 seconds, then move Buzzy ® proximal to site keeping 
Buzzy’s® switch/head toward the brain or spine during injection.  The procedures for 
applying Buzzy® are consistent with the procedures on the package insert  (Appendix 
A).  If vaccines are given, in more than one arm, Buzzy ® will be placed on both arms 
with the assistance of the study coordinator. Buzzy ® will be removed from the 
vaccination site(s) following vaccination. The start and stop time of Buzzy ® placement 
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
25 will be recorded.  If more than one vaccination is given in a single arm only one Buzzy® 
device will be applied per package instructions.  
 
7.9.2 Music  Intervention  
Participants randomized to Music Distraction will be instructed to select music from a 
prepopulated playlist or music streaming service on an iPod, iPad, or similar device 
provided by the study team. Music will be played for a minimum of 3 to 5 minutes prior to 
vaccination over a Bluetooth speaker that can easily be transported between clinic rooms and clinics.   Music will be played until the time of the pain assessment – 10 
minutes following vaccination.  The start and stop time of music distraction will be 
recorded.  
 
7.9.3 Music and Buzzy ® Combination Intervention  
This in tervention group will receive a combination of music therapy and Buzzy®. The 
music will be administered the same way as that for the music only intervention group 
with Bluetooth speakers playing music the subjects select from an IPad provided to them. The Buzzy® will be applied after the music intervention has begun prior to 
vaccination. Buzzy® will be applied as described above in Section 7.9.1. Start and stop 
times for both interventions will be recorded.  
 7.10 Immunizations Administered  During Visit  
 Vaccines received as part of standard of care during the visit will be documented by the research staff.  Documentation will include: product name and  brand, lot number, site 
and date/time of vaccine administered during study participation.  
 
7.11 Post Vaccination  Pain Assessment   
The Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale will be used to assess pain.
44   The Wong- Baker 
Faces Pain Scale scores pain on a 0- 10 metric and shows a close linear re lationship 
with visual analog pain scales across the ages from 11 -17 years , this scale is acceptable 
to use on younger adolescents as well.  Pain will be assessed at within 1 minute and at 
10 minutes  (up to 15 minutes ) after vaccination for each arm in which a vaccine was 
received.  The study coordinator will be responsible for recording pain scores after 
vaccination. The time for assessment will start after the last injection is received.   
7.12 Presyncope  and Syncope  
At 15  minutes  (up to 20 minutes ) following vaccination, study participants will complete 
the BDRI. During the 20 minute ( up to 25 minute) observation period, research staff  
will also record any observed signs (pallor, sweating, facial flush or decreased 
interactivity) or spontaneous subject reports of symptoms of witnessed presyncope as 
described in Section 4.1.  Subjects who developed post- vaccination syncope as 
described in Section 4.2 regardless of presyncope are classified as having sy ncope.   
Usual clinical care will be provided to any subject who develops presyncope or 
syncope.  
7.13 Acceptability  
At the end of the study visit, we will survey participants about the acceptability of the 
intervention to which they were assigned (Appendix B).  Where appropriate, a Likert 
scale (strongly agree, agree, neither, disagree, strongly disagree) will be used to assess acceptability responses.   Alternately, a yes or no response will be solicited.  
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
26 7.14 Feasibility  
For each participant encounter, feasibility will be assessed by determining the degree of 
ease the study staff member had with assuring that the participant had complying with 
the study interventions - Buzzy® or Music.    In addition, for each participant encounter, 
the feasibility of study interventions will also be assessed by the provider administering 
vaccines to the participants. Where appropriate, a Likert scale will be used to assess 
feasibility  responses.    Benchmarks for intervention feasibility  in addition to benchmarks 
for completion of assessments  are listed in Appendix C. No identifiable information will 
be collected from either the coordinator or the provider .  They will not be considered 
study participants.  
7.15 Unsolicited SAEs 
Administration of vaccine is not itself a study procedure in the study population, and thus vaccine adverse events, including presyncope or syncope, are not considered 
study related adverse events . If indicated, however, Vaccine- related SAEs will be 
reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in accordance 
with standard procedures. Information about such events will be included in the 
study data as noted on the VAERS website (https://VAERS.hhs.gov).   
 All serious adverse events (SAES) occurring during the period of study participation 
will be reported to the IRBs overseeing this study and to the CDC within 24 hours of study staff awareness of the event. Given the short duration of study participation 
and nature of the study, SAES would not be expected to occur in this study.  
 An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following conditions: 
•Results in death during the period of protocol -defined surveillance  
•Is life-threatening (defined as immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
•Requires inpatient hospitalization during the period of protocol -defined surveillance 
(other than routine hospital admission for labor & delivery)  
•Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect  
•Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
•Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
In collaboration with Duke, the research team at the CDC will oversee the statist ical 
analysis. The 30 children enrolled in this study are considered part of a pilot to assess 
intervention acceptability and feasibility and make adjustments in study design if 
necessary to guide a potential future larger study design and conduct.    All data for this 
study will reside on a secure Duke server maintained by Duke Health Technology Solutions (DHTS).  For the pilot study, a database will be developed and a dataset 
without personal identifiers will be made available to the CDC for analysis purpose.  All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4.  
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
27 8.1 Sample Size and Power Estimation  
The Pilot phase of the study aims to enroll up to 30 participants. This is an acceptability 
and feasibility assessment and is not a powered study.  
8.2 Analysis  Plan  
 
8.2.1 Study Populations  
The study will enroll adolescents, female and male, ages 10- 17 years, receiving at least 
one ACIP recommended vaccine administered intramuscularly administered.  
Participants will be randomized into one of three intervention groups: Buzzy® only, Music only, Buzzy® and Music together.     
     
There will be two study populations used for data analysis in this study. These are defined below:   
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) population:  is defined as those subjects who are 
randomized and have received at least one dose of an intramuscularly administered vaccine.  
• Per-protocol population:   is defined as those subjects who are 
randomized, have received at least one dose of an intramuscularly 
administered vaccine, have completed study procedures including all 
surveys post -vaccination through the 20 -minute time -period, and have 
no protocol violations that are likely to affect the objectives.  
 
The primary and exploratory objective analyses will be performed in the ITT and per -
protocol populations, or only the ITT population if no subject is excluded from the per 
protocol population. The primary and exploratory objective analyses will be performed by 
intervention group and age group (10 -13 and 14- 17), as appropriate.   
 
8.2.2 Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive analyses will be conducted for demographic variables and for baseline 
characteristics (e.g., fatigue, hunger, thirst, and PROMIS score).  Continuous variables

8.3 Data Management  
The amount of data that will be collected for the proposed project will be substantial and 
will require a sophisticated, practical and flexible system that can accommodate different modes of data collection and several separate linked surveys. The novel Vanderbilt -
designed resource developed specifically for online collection of research information, 
the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform, will be used to design study 
forms, including the reaction forms, and short customized questionnaires to collect information from study subjects. This system will be used by D uke for data management.  
All electronic linkages will fulfill regulations for protection of human subjects and requirements to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality. After initial set -up, the work 
load required for electronic data collection will  be substantially reduced (description of 
REDCap resources below).
_ENREF_3345  Duke investigators have previously used the 
REDCap system for collection and analysis of large quantities of data.  All study -related 
documents containing protected health information, e.g. enrollment logs, and case report 
forms, completed by study participants, will be maintained in secure research offices at Duke , which are accessible to research staff only.  
 
8.3.1 Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
31 Investigators within the NIH -funded Clinical and Translational Research Unit at 
Vanderbilt have developed REDCap ( http://project -redcap.org/ ), to collect and manage 
data for diverse clinical and translational research studies. REDCap was designed 
around the concept of giving research teams an easy method to specify project needs 
and rapidly develop secure, web- based applications for collection, management and 
sharing of research data. REDCap accomplishes these key functions through use of a 
single study metadata table referenced by presentation- level operational modules. 
Based on this abstracted programming model, databases are developed in an efficient manner with little resource investment beyond the creation of a single data dictionary. 
The concept of metadata -driven application development is well established, and the 
critical factor for successful data collection lies in creating a simple workflow 
methodology allowing research teams to autonomously develop study -related metadata 
in an efficient manner.  REDCap  includes secure institutional data hosting and includes 
full audit -trails in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) security requirements. The REDCap Consortium is comprised of 2318 active 
institutions .  The REDCap currently supports 68,000 projects with over 89,000 users 
spanning numerous research focus areas across the consortium.  The current project will use this software application for the design of electronic forms to collect information from study participants, to link the baseline data, sample collection date, and laboratory 
results in an automated database family, to perform data cleaning and data quality 
assurance efficiently, and to design an analytical dataset for the analysis of the project 
data.  
 
Data will be entered into the REDCap database by members of the study team, from 
Duke using the paper case report forms utilized to record data collected as part of study 
procedures.  Study investigators will be responsible for assuring that all paper records 
are securely stored according to the requirements of their IRBs.  The study investigators 
will be responsible for assuring the accuracy of the data entered from the paper forms into REDCap.  Only the assigned identifiers will be used in REDCap. Therefore, 
personal health identifiers will not appear in the REDCap database.  
 
In order to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, numerous built -
in filters and checks for consistency of the data including range and limit checks, 
branching logic and pull down menus to limit choices for categorical variables to a pre -
specified list will be implemented and performed automatically to minimize data entry error. The data will be randomly sampled and checked against source records on a 
regular basis. The data and related analytical datasets will also be stored with secured 
password- protected computers. Coded data without personal identifiers  will be made 
available to the CDC and transferred using a secure transfer method.   
8.4 Role of the CDC Investigators in the Project  
This study is funded by a CDC contract with Duke University  as Task Orders in the CISA 
Project Contract . The Duke University  PI (Emmanuel “Chip” Walter ) will oversee the 
study .  CDC staff will collaborate with the site to develop the protocol, conduct the study, 
ensure the study is aligned with US Department of Health and Human Services public health priorities, and analyze the data and disseminate the results. CDC will  receive 
access to coded data not containing any directly identifying information, and lead the 
analysis for this study, in consultation with the study team .
 
 
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
32 9 HUMAN SUBJECTS  
9.1 Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design  
Duke investigators will be responsible for submitting the protocol, informed consent 
(Appendix D ), recruitment letters, flyers, and any written or verbally conveyed materials  
specific to this project to their institutional review boards.  CDC staff will be responsible 
for submitting materials to the CDC for review and obtain reliance on Duke IRB .   
  
To facilitate subject recruitment at the practices, we will request a waiver of consent and 
HIPAA authorization for ascertainment (identification, selection) and/or recruitment of 
potential subjects while recording identifiable private health information (PHI)  prior to 
obtaining the subject’s consent.  This information will be obtained from review of the electronic scheduling and medical record systems in the clinics  in order to determine 
eligibility for study enrollment. We will review only the minimum amount of information 
necessary to determine potential eligibilit y. This information will be used to recruit  and 
screen only. Use of PHI in this manner involves no more than minimal risk to subjects 
and no information will leave the study sites . 
 
Continuing reviews will be submitted to the IRBs on an annual basis.  P rotocol 
deviations or concerns about study integrity will be reported promptly to the overseeing 
IRB in accordance with institutional requir ements . 
9.2 Sources of Material  
Medical history, immunization history  and concomitant medication history  will be 
obtained from the medical record and from patient report.  Demographic information will be obtained from the medical record and patient report.  The research staff will 
administer the beverage and food intake assessment, needle phobia assessment, 
anxiety assessment, pain assessment, presyncope symptoms assessment, repeat 
anxiety assessment and the tolerability and acceptability assessment to the subjects.     
9.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
There is the potential risk of loss of confidentiality about information obtained as part of this study.   
 
There is the also the potential that adolescent subjects could experience some 
discomfort from the intervention they are randomized to such as discomfort due to music 
volume or the cold sensation of the Buzzy®.  
 
In addition,  talking to or reporting about feelings of anxiety may temporarily increase a 
subject ’s awareness of this experience and increase distress .
 
 9.4 Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
 
9.4.1 Protections against Risk  
 Every effort possible will be made to keep information about participants confidential. 
Computerized participant information will be kept in password protected files on secured servers.   Paper case report forms will be kept in locked files belonging to the study 
personnel.   Any publications resulting from this work will not contain any identifiable 
participant information.  
Syncope Prevention Pilot Study  Version 1.0 
April 17, 2018  
33 Every effort possible will be made to minimize discomfort caused by the interventions by 
adjusting music volume at patient request and following the precise guidelines for using 
the Buzzy®.  
In addition, for participants with significant anxiety, a resource list of mental health 
professionals will be made available upon request. 
9.4.2 ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements  
The project  is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov . (TBD).  
 
9.5 Human Subjects  
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator and study team will 
comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, Good Clinical Practices, and ethical 
principles. The parent or guardian must sign and date the written informed consent form 
prior to initiation of any study procedure.    
 
9.5.1 Vulnerable Subjects Research  
Vulnerable subjects  
Children are a vulnerable research population and require additional protections when they are potential research subjects. This is a minimal risk study, involving the 
administration of music or Buzzy ® intervention.   Because this study is no more than 
minimal risk , the permission of only one parent/ guardian will be obtained.  We will also 
obtain the adolescents assent either verbally or in writing as necessitated by their age.

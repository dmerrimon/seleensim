 1        I. PRIMARY RESEARCH QUE STIONS: 
 
 In Blacks with asthma, aged 5 and older , who  are inadequately controlled on low dose 
ICS, what is the preferred step- up therapy , and does the degree of African ancestry 
affect preference for different therapies ?  
 
II. TRIAL OVERVIEW  
 
In this research study, we propose a 66 week prospective, randomized, double- blind, 
crossover trial in Blacks (individuals who self-report  Black ancestry) with asthma aged 
12 and above, and separately, in Black children with asthma aged 5 -11. Participants will 
be run- in on low dose ICS , and , if inadequately controlled, will randomly have their ICS 
dose increased and/or have a LABA added. In both groups we will examine, as a 
primary question, the efficacy of increasing the dose of ICS with or without the addition of a LABA. We will compare the response of these age groups to these step-up 
therapies. Due to safety and medication considerations , the trials in these groups are 
similar but not identical. Each study will allow us to answer our primary questions in the appropriate age group and the similarities will allow us to draw conclusions regarding whether the age groups differ in response. Both groups  will have blood drawn for 
genomic analysis and ancestry markers , and w e will determine whether the differential 
responses are related to genetic anc estry and whether there are areas of the  genome 
that are associated with differential responses .     
  
 2        III. BACKGROUND AND SIGNI FICANCE  
 
Blacks suffer a disproportionate burden of asthma morbidity compared to Caucasians. As reported by the Center s for Disease Control, Blacks experience more asthma- related 
urgent care visits, higher rates of hospitalizations, and higher death rates (Akinbami 2006). The prevalence rate of asthma exacerbations for self -identified Blacks is 19.2% 
higher than the rate of Caucasians with even higher rates of emergency room visits (Eisner 2001; Adams 2000; Griswold 2005; El -Ekiaby 2006). Hospitalization rates for 
asthma are almost 2.5 times greater in Blacks than in Caucasians (Aki nbami 2006). 
Even more alarmingly, the death rate is 165% higher in Blacks than it is in Caucasians (Akinbami 2006).  Whether this disparity is due to social, environmental, cultural, or 
genetic  factors, remains unclear.  
 One possible explanation for such racial differences in asthma is that Blacks  respond 
differently to asthma therapies compared to Caucasians. Indeed, differential response to different therapies in Blacks compared to Caucasians has already been demonstrated in several other conditions, most recently in pulmonary hypertension- in 
which Blacks failed to demonstrate benefit with endothelin receptor antagonists 
compared with Caucasians (Gabler 2012) - and lupus –in which fewer Blacks who 
received belimumab  responded to treatment compared to Blacks who did not receive 
belimumab  (Mitka 2011). A similar differential response between Blacks and 
Caucasians is observed in asthma. According to national asthma guidelines, in patients 
inadequately controlled on low doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), increasing the ICS dose or adding  a long -acting beta agonist (LABA) are both preferred Step 3 
therapies based on studies that show they improve asthma control and decrease exacerbations  (Shapiro 2009, Ind 2003, Kavuru 2000) .  However , these studies were 
conducted in populations that were predominantly non- Black.  M ultiple lines of  evidence 
suggest that Blacks may not respond to escalation of medications as suggested in 
the studies used to formulate these guideline recommendations . Add-on of a LABA 
did not decrease exacerbations in self -identified Blacks and add -on LABA treatment 
was not as effective in these self -identified Blacks versus a mixed sample in improving 
other secondary indicators of asthma control (Bailey 2008) (see Table 1 ).   These 
findings were reconfirmed in the recently reported results of a study examining  
ICS/LABA vs. LABA in Blacks (Spector 201 2). In a more recent study of Blacks (Brown 
2012), add- on LABA was compared to continuation of ICS. ICS dose was not increased 
in this study. While the rate of exacerbation was low er with added LABA, the magnitude 
of change of other indices was again not as great in Blacks as in studies of mixed/Caucasian populations (Table 1). Based on these studies, and on data suggesting that the Black population has a higher risk for steroid res istance (Chan 
1998) and reduced cellular sensitivity to corticosteroids (Federico 2005), some have hypothesized that Blacks have either a diminished response to LABA, or an increased need for, or decreased sensitivity to, ICS.  Regardless of mechanism, these studies all 
suggest that  a differential response to asthma therapies occurs in Blacks.  
      
 3        
 
 
In that regard, a cross -sectional analysis of treatment responses in the studies 
conducted by the ACRN suggests that self -identified Blacks treated with LABA had a 
greater frequency of asthma treatment failures compared to Caucasians in the same trials ( Fig 1 ) (Wechsler 2011).  
 
 
Further, in the BADGER trial conducted by the CARE Network, while more Caucasian children had a preferential  response to ICS+LABA as compared  to a 2.5- fold increase 
in ICS,  more self -identified Black children preferred increased  ICS to addition of  LABA  
(Fig 2 ) (Lemanske 2010).  

 4         
Finally, we performed a post hoc analysis of data generated from the TALC trial (Peters 
2010). We evaluated a differential treatment response using a composite outcome 
measure similar to that used in the BADGER trial and identical to the one proposed for this trial. We  found racial disparities in the response to add- on tiotropium bromide 
versus LABA , providing yet another example of differences in response to different 
therapies by race. Add -on tiotropium was superior to increasing the dose of ICS in 
Caucasians, but this was not the case in self -identified Blacks ( Table 2 ), as reflected by 
the composite outcome measure of exacerbations, asthma control days and FEV
1 
(Table 2 ). It is noteworthy that in this study, there was a trend towards preference of 
LABA/ICS vs. ICS  in Blacks. The discordant findings in these different studies highlight 
the need for us to examine the question of asthma therapy in Blacks prospectively.  
TABLE 2 Response by Race in TALC
 
 
Genomic Ancestry:  
 
 As noted above, marked disparities exist in treatment -response phenotypes  between 
self-identified Blacks  and Non- Hispanic Whites. These differences have resulted in 
different treatment recommendations for Blacks with regard to hypertension and heart 

 5        
failure, for example. However , many  populations are admixed with varying degrees of 
different racial ancestr y and are becoming increasingly admixed.   
 
In fact, current s elf-reported Blacks in public databases  vary in the degree of African 
versus European white ancestry; average 71% African (SD +9.6) with a range of 29.4% 
to 96.5% in 392 African- Americans with asthma. An example  of such variation is shown 
in the figure herein  
(labeled Figure 4- 
MDS Plot)   where the 
x’s represent asthmatics from the 
Severe Asthma Research Program and CSGA  asthma 
studies. The range of ancestry can be seen from this principal component analysis (where the blue cluster represents 
Africans (Yorubans) and the green cluster 
represents whites of European descent using standard data from HapMap.org) . 
 Considering the degree of variation in degree of African vs. European ances try in self -
reported Blacks it has been postulated that self -reported measures may become 
increasingly imprecise when compared to true, genetically -measured ancestry.  In fact, a 
recent study suggested just such a possibility in relation to lung function.   
Baseline lung function is a well -established characteristic that is markedly disparate 
between these ethnic groups, independent of asthma diagnosis. Current practice assigns predicted lung function on the basis of self -identified race.  However, Kumar 
and coworkers recently  demonstrated that the degree of African ancestry as measured 
by genetic variants specific to ancestry called “ancestry informative markers” determined baseline lung function. Specifically, greater African ancestry was associated with lower baseline FEV
1 and FVC ( Genetics Figure 1) . Further , calculations of 
baseline lung function based on genetic ancestry revealed that  classic predictive 
equations actually misclassified asthma severity based on percentage predicted 
FEV 1 in a subset of asthma subjects (Kumar 2010).   
 6        
 
These data suggest that ancestry informative markers may be as good, or better, than 
self-identified racial ancestry as a marker with which to associate phenotypic  variation 
between groups.    
  
In sum,  these data suggest the following:  
1. Blacks respond differently to currently recommended asthma treatments 
than do Caucasians.  
2. As a result, current asthma guideline recommendations may not be 
appropriate for Black s with asthma.  
3.  Genetic ancestry may  be a superior method to identify subjects who 
may benefit from alternate treatment recommendations and step up in therapy.   
 The data summarized above lead us to attempt to answer the  following questions:   
- Do Blacks not completely controlled on low dose ICS  respond to 
increases in ICS better than adding a LABA ? 
- In Blacks, is a lack of response to low dose ICS/LABA due to inadequate 
dosing of the ICS compone nt? 
- Are genetic analyses using degree of African vs. European ancestry  
useful in predicting responsiveness to the different therapies ? 
- Do Black adults and children differ from one another with regard to 
responsiveness to ICS or LABA add- on therapies?  
  The trial we outline below aims to address these questions.  The results of this study will 
have the potential to significantly impact the asthma guidelines because the resulting  
data will allow for evidence based recommendations for the use of asthma 
pharmacotherapy in Blacks. This study will also offer the opportunity to assess whether 
genetic ancestry markers can help us to predict the degree of differential pharmacol ogic 
response in Black individuals.   
 7         
IV. HYPOTHESES TO BE TES TED  
Primary hypothes es in Adults/Adolescents ≥ 12 Years : 
1. In Black adults and adolescents with inadequately controlled asthma on 
low-dose ICS alone, the addition of LABA will not be more efficacious than 
increased doses of ICS in improving asthma control , regardless of the 
dose of ICS used with the LABA.  
2.  A preference for LABA vs. ICS in Blacks in the study will be associated with a lesser degree of African ancestry (%African Black versus %European White) as determined by genetic markers  of African ancestry .
   
Primary hypotheses in Children 5-11 Years : 
1. In Black children with inadequately controlled asthma on low -dose ICS alone,  the 
addition of LABA will not be more efficacious  than increased doses of ICS in 
improving asthma control . 
2.  A preference for LABA vs. ICS in Black children will be associated with a lesser 
degree of African ancestry (%African Black versus %European White) as 
determined by genetic markers  of African ancestry .   
 
Secondary  hypothes es: 
1.  Black adolescents/adults (≥12) will not differ from Black children aged 5-11 in the 
relative response to ICS and LABA examined in the primary hypotheses.    
2. The dose response curve to corticosteroids will not differ between Black 
adults/adolescents and children.  
Exploratory hypothes es: 
 
1.  T he variability in response to LABA and/or ICS will be related to differences at 
specific pharmacogenetic loci  as detected by techniques such as admixture 
mapping .   
2.   Patient characteristics, such as atopy, pulmonary function including 
bronchodilator reversibility, and methacholine responsiveness, along with selective biomarkers, such as sputum eosinophils, will be associated with the differential response to the study treatment among Black asthmatics across the ages.  
 
  
 8        V. PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND  SCHEMA 
 
To attempt to answer the primary research questions raised above, we propose a trial 
examining and comparing the effect of step- up therapy in participants with asthma.  
Because the disparities in asthma burden occur in both children and adults, we will 
examine step-up in participants ≥ 12 years of age (FDA and NAEPP cut -offs for “adult” 
asthma recommendations) and separately in participants 5-11 years  of age.  While of 
necessity, these trials are not precisely the same due to dosage restrictions in children 
and medication availability . Our goal was to create core parallels that would allow us to 
examine whether these age groups differ significantly  in their patterns of response to 
add-on therapy, specifically the dose response o f ICS and the impact of adding LABA to 
increased ICS therapy .   
 
Protocol Schema  
This is a prospective, randomized 66-week  cross- over trial in both individuals 12 years 
of age and older and children (5-11 years of age)  with inadequately -controlled asthma  
on low dose ICS. In individuals aged 12 and older, we compar e the effectiveness of a) 
adding a LABA or b) increasing ICS dose 2.5 fold or c) increasing ICS dose 5 fold or d) 
adding a LABA and increasing ICS dose 2.5 fold (Figure 5a). In children aged 5 -11, we 
compare the effectiveness of a) increasing ICS 2 fold b) increasing ICS 2 fold and adding a LABA c) increasing ICS 5 fold and d) increasing ICS 5 fold and adding a LABA  
(Figure 5b). Our goal is to identify the best option for add- on therapy in Blacks and  to 
determine  whether the response in Black  individuals aged 12 or greater differs from that 
of Black children aged 5- 11. 
 

 9         
 
Run-in: Following successful completion of the eligibili ty assessment at Screen Visit A,  
participants will be  entered into the run- in and switched from their therapy to low -dose 
ICS (100 mcg fluticasone propionate (FP)  BID or equivalent in individuals aged 12 or 
greater ; 50 mcg FP BID in children  aged 5 -11) (for individuals already on low -dose 
equivalent or requiring only 1 step down; see section VII.A for details regarding 
individuals who require a 2 step step- down process) . They will be monitored closely for 
safety , and they will have a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of 10 weeks to 
demonstrate that they are inadequately controlled and appropriate for randomization (based on NAEPP guidelines criteria, see section VII.A  below). As was done in the 
BADGER  trial, participants  will be co ntinually monitored and randomized in the trial if 
uncontrolled.  They will comple te twice daily peak flow (PEF) measurements and e-
diaries using the Spirotel
® device to monitor lung function and symptoms  and will have a 
rescue plan in place. They will complete up to three additional screen/ run-in visits at the 
performance site as follows: Following Screen Visit A, participants  will be scheduled to 
return to the performance site in 2 weeks  (+3 day regular window and +5 day extended 
window)  to complete Screen Visit B which includes additional testing  for 
characterization and eligibility confirmation and assessment for lack of acceptable asthma control. If the participant qualifies for randomization as described below, then he 
or she will be scheduled to return to the performance site between 24 hours and 2 
weeks l ater to complete Visit 1 and undergo randomization. If the participant does not 
qualify for randomization at Screen Visit B, then he or she will be scheduled for Screen Visit C in 4 weeks (+/-3 day  regular  window  and +/ -5 day extended window ) with a 

 10        phone call at the 2 week midpoint to assess for safety and lack of control. Those who do 
not qualify for randomization by Screen Visit C will be scheduled for Screen Visit D 4 
weeks later (+/ - 3 day  regular  window  and +/ -5 day extended window ) with another 
phone call at the 2 week midpoint to assess for safety and lack of control. The purpose of Screen Visits C and D is to upload the participant’s e- diary and review data for 
qualification for randomization on the basis of the ‘lack of acceptable cont rol’ cri teria 
outlined below , as well as to collect and replenish drug supplies . These visits are 
primarily administrative with no additional procedures taking place other than height 
measurements in the younger participants . If the participant qualifies for randomization 
at Screen Visit C or D, then he or she may be randomized and complete Visit 1 the same day, or he or she can be scheduled to return for Visit 1 as soon as possible, but  
definitely  within 2 weeks. Visit windows are allowed in order to give the coordinator 
flexibility with scheduling the sputum lab and dedicating the necessary time in the clinic 
calendar to complete Visit 1.  
As described below, no participant  will directly undergo a more than a 2 fold decrease in 
dose at the time of run -in. For example, adult participants  who are on the equivalent of 
fluticasone 500 mcg BID or  fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 will first have a 2 week trial on 250 mcg BID to ensure stability to enter the trial, prior to tapering down to 100 mcg 
BID to enter the run- in (See below, Inclusion Criteria).  
The 4 -way crossover design will consist of random assignment to four specific treatment 
sequences  for pediatric participants and four specific treatment sequences for 
adolescent/adult participants, as described in the Statistical Design and Analyses 
section.  
 
Treatment period :  Following the rolling run- in period with low -dose ICS, inadequately 
controlled participants will be randomized to addition of LABA, addition of LABA with increased ICS, or increased dose ICS (medium and high dose ICS) for 14 weeks. In 
those aged 12 and above at enrollment with inadequately -controlled asthma on low 
dose ICS (100 mcg fluticasone BID)  we will  compare the efficacy of different step -up 
therapies:  adding a LABA vs. increasing the ICS dose 2.5- 5 fold vs. increasing ICS 
dose 2.5 fold AND adding a LABA. In the pediatric subgroup, we will enroll participants 
aged 5- 11 with inadequately -controlled asthma on 50 mcg fluticasone BID and compare 
the efficacy of adding a LABA AND increasing ICS dose 2- fold vs. increasing the ICS 
dose 2- 5 fold vs. increasing ICS dose 5 fold AND adding a LABA.  The last 12 weeks of 
each treatment period will be considered for analysis (to allow for drug washout from 
previous arm/wash- in for new treatment arm) . Participants will come to the performance 
sites after 2 weeks to ensure adherence and safety and then at 6 week intervals 
thereafter in each treatment period. Participants will receive phone calls to ensure 
safety and to assess for any issues that may be ongoing at the 3- week point between 
visits.  
Of note, ICS doses to  be used in the study are consistent with asthma guidelines . 
Increased ICS dosing will be different in individuals aged 12 or greater and children 
aged 5- 11 as noted below (Table 3.) due to potential safety concerns of ICS in younger 
pediatric participants  and due to availability of different drug preparations.  
   
 11         
  To meet the total required sample size for this trial, participants, 291 Blacks aged 
greater than or equal to 12 at enrollment  and 284 Black children aged 5- 11 at 
enrollment , will be  recruited across the Network, with attempts to recruit similar numbers 
at each clinical center partnership. With 18  strata (9 clinical center partnerships x 2 age 
groups) , approximately 32 participants  (32.3 adults/adolescents; 31.6 children aged 5-
11) will be randomized by  each clinical center partner ship.  
 In sum, this is a 66-week randomized, double- blind, four -treatment, four -period cross -
over trial that will evaluate the differential improvement in control that is achieved following four separate treatment interventions in Black individuals whose asthma is not acceptably controlled on a low dose of ICS (per NAEPP guidelines). All participants will enter a run- in period lasting up to 10 weeks during which time they will receive a dose of 
1xICS (e.g. fluticasone 100 mcg BID in individuals aged 12 or greater  and  50 mcg BID 
in children with asthma aged 5- 11). During this period, running one week  and two week  
periods to establish lack of acceptable asthma control will be evaluated using the 
definition described in Section VII.A. below. As soon as the participant  meets the 
random ization criteria, he or she will be randomized into one of the treatment 
sequences described. Thus, it is possible for the participant  to qualify for randomization 
prior to the end of the 10-week run- in period. This approach should maximize both 
participan t safety and successful enrollment. During each period of the treatment phase, 
participants  will receive an add-on therapy in the form of LABA, different strengths of 
increased ICS, or increased ICS and LABA.  Each treatment period will be 14 weeks in 
length; the initial 2 weeks of each period will be considered to be the washout period for the previous treatment. The primary outcome measures of asthma control are asthma exacerbations (protocol defined), asthma control days (ACD) (see definition below ), and 
the %predicted FEV
1 at the end of the 14- week treatment regimen. Secondary 
outcomes are listed below.

CHARACTERIZATION PER IOD)  
A. Inclusion criteria  at Screen Visit A (to enter run -in) 
 
1. Male and female  participants , age 5 years and above at enrollment.  
2. Individuals who self -report Black ancestry (with at least 1 Black grandparent). 
Hispanics with at least 1 Black grandparent  may be enrolled. Participants who 
have 1 Black grandparent  but who do not necessarily self -identify as Black may 
also be enrolled.1  
3. Able to perform reproducible spirometry according to ATS criteria.  
4. Able to perform valid peak flow maneuver using the Spirotel® device.  
5. Clinical history consistent with asthma. 
6. Baseline FEV 1≥40% of  predicted and/or post -bronchodilator FEV 1≥40% of 
predicted (post 4 puffs of albuterol at Screen Visit A).  
7. Asthma confirmed either by: (1) Beta- agonist reversibility to 4 puffs albuterol ≥ 
12% OR (2) PC 20FEV 1 ≤ 16 mg/ml ( if FEV 1≥ 55% predicted and ≥1.0 lit er at 
baseline  in adults  or ≥70% in participants younger than 1 8) OR (3) an absolute 
relative change in %predicted FEV 1 of ≥ 12% over two measurements 
documented by repeat spirogram over the previous year  and done at an 
AsthmaNet  performance site. 
(Participants  will hold albuterol, montelukast, theophylline, ipratropium bromide 
(or other anticholinergics) and long -acting beta- agonists per instructions in the 
MOP prior to reversibility testing.  Thus, if a participant  is receiving these types of 
medications prior to  Screen Visit A, he  or she may be brought back to the 
performance site af ter following appropriate medication withholding to attempt 
qualification by reversibility criteria. If the participant does not meet this 
requirement, he/she may qualify if methacholine PC20  is ≤ 16 mg/ml at Screen 
Visit B.   Historical evidence of reversibility  or methacholine PC 20 may be used to 
meet the inclusion criteria if the source documentation is less than 1 year old and 
is from one of the AsthmaNet  perfor mance sites and was performed using 
AsthmaNet equipment , procedures , and methacholine . All participants will 
perform reversibility testing at Screen Visit A, regardless of source documentation status; all participants who qualify to perform methacholine challenge at Screen Visit B will perform the procedure, regardless of source 
documentation status. ) 
8. To enter the run- in, participants must be either: A) inadequately controlled on 
low-, medium - or high- dose ICS monotherapy, or low - or medium -dose 
ICS/LABA, o r B) well -controlled on low-, medium - or high- dose ICS  
monotherapy , or low -, medium - or high- dose ICS/LABA (see Study Visits, Screen

 17        VII. INCLUSION AND EXCLUS ION CRITERIA PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION  
 
Randomization criteria (after run -in with l ow-dose ICS  (1xICS) ) 
Participants will be randomized if they demonstrate compliance with study medications , 
e-diary completion, and PEF performance and lack of acceptable control of asthma 
during the run- in period (see below).  
 
A. Inclusion Criterion for Randomization: Lack of acceptable asthma control 
in run- in period  
For individuals aged 12 and older  at enrollment , the run- in period consists of open- label 
treatment with 1 inhalation twice daily of FP 100 mcg/inhalation . For children 5-11 at 
enrollment , the run- in period consists of treatment with 1 inhalation twice daily of FP 50 
mcg/inh alation .   
Lack of acceptable asthma control during the run- in period i s defined as: 
1. On more than 2 days per week  for any 1 week period during the run- in, one or 
more of the following (rolling 1 week periods will be used to assess this criterion using data stored in the participant’s Spirotel
® e-diary):  
a. Asthma symptoms (short ness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, 
phlegm/mucus  rated as mild, moderate or severe, or cough rated as 
moderate or severe)  
b. Use of inhaled bronchodilator for symptom rescue (≥ 1 puff)  (does not 
include pre- exercise prophylactic treatment)  
c. Reduced peak expiratory flow (i.e. Peak flows in the red or yellow zone [< 
80% of the current PEF reference2]) 
i. The PEF reference value used to determine the yellow zone 
between Screen Visit A and Screen Visit B will be the pre-
bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit A.  
 
ii. The PEF reference value used to determine the yellow zone 
between Screen Visit B and Screen Visit C will be the highest of:  
1. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
A 
2. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
B 
3. pre-bronchodilator PEFs observed at home and 
electronically recorded by the Spirotel® device between 
Screen Visits A and B  
Note: The PEF reference value may not increase by more than 
20% from one visit to the next . 
 
iii. The PEF reference value used to determine the yellow zone 
between Screen Visit C and Screen Visit D will be the highest of:  
                                            
2 Updated PEF reference values will only be applied going forward in time; they will not be applied to PEF data 
collected prior to changing the value.  
 18        1. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
A 
2. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
B 
3. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
C 
4. pre-bronchodilator PEFs observed at home and 
electronically recorded by the S pirotel® device between 
Screen Visits A and C  
Note : The PEF reference value may not increase by more than 
20% from one visit to the next.  
 
iv. The PEF reference value used to determine the yellow zone during 
the entire post-randomization treatment phase (for purposes of  
defining the participant’s action plan) will be the highest of:  
1. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
A 
2. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
B 
3. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
C 
4. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at Screen Visit 
D 
5. pre-bronchodilator PEF observed in the clinic at 
randomization Visit 1  
6. pre-bronchodilator PEFs observed at home and 
electronically recorded by the S pirotel® device between 
Screen Visit  A and randomization  
 
The PEF reference value will not be updated after randomization 
for individuals who are age 21 or older at enrollment . Participants 
who are ages 5- 17 at enrollment  will have their height  measured at 
each post -randomization visit, resulting in possible adjustments to 
their predicted PEF values. As such, participants in the 5- 17 age 
range at enrollment will be subject to the adjustments based on predicted PEF outlined in item v. below for the duration of their study participation.  Individuals who are between 18 and 21 years 
old at enrollment will have their height measured until they turn age 
21. They will be subject to the adjustments based on predicted PEF outlined in item v. below until they turn 21.  
 
v. If, at any time, the PEF reference value is lower than 50% of the 
predicted PEF calculated using published equations based on age, 
height, sex and race  (as per AsthmaNet Spirometry Manual of 
Procedures), then the PEF reference value will be set to 50% of the 
predicted PEF.  
 
OR 
 
 19        2. More than 1 night  with awakening (s) due to asthma in a 2- week period  
 
Similar to the enrollment strategy utilized in the  BADGER study (Lemanske 2010), 
individuals enrolled in this protocol can be characterized as falling into one of two 
groups  at the time of Screen Visit A : 
• Step-neutral  - currently receiving low -dose 1xICS dose = 200 mcg/day fluticasone 
equivalent in adults /adolescents , or 100 mcg/day in children age 5- 11 
For individuals in the step- neutral group, the run- in will be up to 10 weeks in duration. 
These individuals will begin the run- in on 1xICS study medications.  
• Step-down - currently receiving controller therapy considered by the NAEPP 
guidelines to be at least 1 step above 1xICS (e.g. 2- 2.5xICS or  higher, or  combination 
therapy of 1xICS /LABA  or higher ) 
For individuals in the step- down group who require a 1 step step- down approach (e.g. if 
baseline medication is 2- 2.5xICS monotherapy or 1xICS/LABA combination therapy), 
the run- in will be up to 10 weeks in duration.  These individuals will begin the run- in on 
1xICS study m edications.  
For individuals in the step- down group who require a 2 step step- down  approach (e.g. if 
baseline medication is 5xICS monotherapy or 2.5xICS/LABA) the run- in will be up to 1 2 
weeks  in duration. During the first 2 weeks, individuals will be stepped down to 2xICS (if 
age 5- 11) or 2.5xICS (if age 12 and above). At the end of the 2- week period they will be 
seen at the clinic for Screen Visit A1 for upload of Spirotel® data, spirometry, and 
assessment of asthma control  based on their Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ; 7-
item)  score (Juniper 1999). If they demonstrate control (defined as ACQ score < 1.5 and 
no asthma exacerbation) on the reduced dose regimen, such individuals then will be 
tapered to 1xICS and Screen Visit B will be scheduled 2 weeks later. At Screen Visit B, 
they will be eligible for randomization according to the criteria outlined below . If 
individuals in the 2 step step- down group experience an asthma exacerbation requiring 
treatment with prednisone while on 2- 2.5xICS  or have an ACQ score ≥1.5 , they will be 
ineligible for further study participation and study termination procedures will take place.  
To be eligible for randomization,  individuals must:  
1.  meet the definition of lack of acceptable asthma control above during any 1-week 
block (symptoms, rescue use, PEF) or 2- week block (nighttime awakenings)  on 
1xICS study medications  
AND 
2.  demonstrate adherence with taking study medi cations (≥75% of scheduled doses) 
and completing e- diaries and PEFs (≥75% of days) during the visit interval  during 
which lack of control criteria were met  
  
 20        B. Exclusion Criteria for Randomization  
Participants who have an exacerbation on low dose ICS (1xICS ) during the run- in 
period (i.e. worsening asthma symptoms resulting in treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids - see exacerbation definition in section XX  below) may  be eligible for 
randomization after the exacerbation has been appropriately treated with a 5-day 
course of prednisone per the guidelines in section XX.E below . The participant  will 
remain on 1xICS during and following treatment of the exacerbation and will be eligible 
to be randomized 14 days (+7 day window) following the final dose of prednisone , 
unless the exacerbation is severe and requires hospitalization.  In that case, the  
participant mus t be terminated from further participation in the trial  due to safety 
concerns . 
If a participant experiences a second exacerbation that does not result in hospitalization  
on low dose ICS  during the run- in, the same procedures will apply with respect to 
prednisone treatment and randomization.  
If a participant experiences a third exacerbation requiring treatment with prednisone during the run- in, then he or she will be terminated from further participation in the trial 
due to safety concerns.  
As noted above, individuals who are in the 2 step step- down group who experience an 
exacerbation while on 2- 2.5xICS or have an ACQ score ≥1.5 at Screen Visit A1 are 
ineligible for further study participation.  
Thus, exclusion criteria for randomization include any of the following:  
1. Inadequate adherence (<75% of expected medication doses taken or < 75% of 
diary recordings and PEFs completed)
* 
2. Asthma exacerbation requiri ng hospitalization during the run- in 
3. Three significant asthma exacerbations on 1xICS during the run- in 
4. For those requiring 2 step step- down:  Asthma exacerbation while on 2- 2.5xICS 
during the run- in or ACQ score ≥1.5 at Screen Visit A1  
* Individuals who do not meet the adherence criteria after 2 weeks in the trial will be 
retrained and allowed to continue in the run- in for another 2 weeks. Screen Visit B will 
be deferred until adequate compliance is demonstrated. If, after 4 weeks in the r un-in, 
the participant cannot meet the adherence requirements, then he or she will be terminated from further study participation. Individuals who show lack of adherence to medication dosing and/or e-diary and/or PEF completion on two separate evaluations at 
any point during the run- in will be terminated from further study participation. Depending 
on the circumstances, these individuals may be allowed to re- enroll starting at Screen 
Visit A at a later time.  
  
 21        VIII. RATIONALE & SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC ASPECTS 
OF THE STUDY  
A. Anticipated composition of study population 
The issue of best treatment for Blacks is of such great importance that we propose 
studying both adults /adolescents  and children since it is not clear whether the results 
will be the same in these groups.  We are including both the adolescent/adult (≥12) and 
younger pediatric (5- 11) Black population in this trial to ascertain whether the effects we 
will observe in Black s aged 12 and older  are different from Black children aged 5 -11. No 
ICS dos e-ranging study of this sort has been performed in inadequately controlled Black 
asthmatics of any age . As indicated previously, more evidence is needed to establish 
guidelines for therapy for Black  adults and children with asthma who are not acceptably 
controlled on low dose ICS.  We will therefore enroll sufficient numbers of both Black 
adults/adolescents and children to provide adequate numbers of participants to address the research hypotheses. It is likely that some of the performance sites may need to recruit larger numbers of Black participants than others due to the relative availability of participants in their immediate recruitment areas (See Recruitment Section XXV). 
However, all attempts will be made to recruit proportionately among sites as much as 
possible.  Methods for accounting for potential asymmetric recruitment are discussed in the section on Statistics.   
B. Definition of “Black” for this study :  
 For this study, w e define “Black”  as individuals who self -report Black ancestry, with at 
least 1 Black grandparent . Self-identified race is a concept that may be easil y 
translatable to the community . Additionally, all the data we have cited that demonstrated 
differential responses by race utilized self -identified Black  identification . 
   
We will, however, also estimate degree of both overall , and gene-specific, Black  
ancestry based on genetic variants identified based on genetic ancestry as discussed  
below in our section on Genetics . We will use this  data to determine whether degree of 
Black ancestry is associated  with a differential response to pharmacotherapy.  
 
C. Genetic Analysis of Responses  
 While self -identifi cation as Black is the clinical phenotype that has been associated with 
differences in response to medications, this phenotype has a complex genetic makeup.  As was pointed out in our Background and Significance section , genetic markers which 
allow estimation of genetic ancestry, may actually permit greater precision in detecting and understanding the phenotype (Kumar 2010).  Therefore, an important part of this 
proposal relates to determining the potential association of Black  ancestry, first, at a 
genome- wide level , and, as explained below, in an exploratory manner  within a specific 
gene or gene cluster, to the observed variation in response to medications.   
 In specific we propose the following:  
 Our primary hypothesis is that in asthmatics who self -report Black ancestry,  those with a 
better response to LABAs will have a lower overall proportion of African ancestry .  As a 
 22        corollary, we hypothesize that those with a better response to ICS will have a higher 
overall proportion of African ancestry . 
 
On an exploratory basis, we hypothesize that that the variability in response to the treatments will be related to degree of African ancestry at spec ific genetic loci.   
 In addition to the information we reviewed in the Background and Significance section regarding global African ancestry, below we review techniques using GWAS and admixture mapping that have been used to identify specific areas of the genome   that 
may contribute to the observed differences between groups and that we expect to use to carry out our exploratory aims.     
   
Specific Loci and Ancestry at Specific Loci  and Rare Variant Analyses . 
 
In addition to global estimates of ancestry, ancestry markers and genome- wide studies 
can be used to identify areas of the genome that may yield specific loci that differentiate differences in response to therapy.  Tantisira and coworkers performed a GWAS in 118 
probands from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and 935 asthmatics from 4 replication cohorts (primarily consisting of non- Hispanic Whites) that 
revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the glucocorticoi d-induced transcript 1 gene (GLCCl1), rs37972, that was associated with 
lung function responses to inhaled glucocorticoids, specifically that the less common allele was associated with diminished response (Tantisira 2011). Although this SNP was polymorphic  in this population of asthmatics of European descent, (minor allele 
frequency= 45% in whites of European descent), this variant is less common in an African population (minor allele frequency=14%).  
 More recently, a GWAS performed by Himes and coworkers consisting of 1,644 non-Hispanic whites for 6 clinical trials demonstrated that SNP’s adjacent to SPATS2L (gene that determines β2- adrenergic receptor expression), rs295137 and rs295114, were 
associated with lung function response to short -acting β2 -adrenergic receptor agonists 
(SABA). The minor or less common alleles of these SNP’s were associated with a greater bronchodilator response (Himes 2012).  The SNP with the most significant association, rs295137, is polymorphic in those of European descent, (minor allele frequency= 42% among Utah residents) but its minor allele is more common in an African population (minor allele frequency=59% among Yorubans).   The disparate allele frequency of this SNP, hypothetically, contributes to a greater frequency of treatment failures or other adverse responses to LABA treatment observed among 
Black s when compared to non- Hispanic Whites (Lemanske 2010, Nelson 2006, 
Wechsler 2011).  
 
In addition, since African- Americans are an admixed population, there is an increased 
frequency of rare variants. In the gene encoding for the pharmacogenetic target for 
LABA therapy, the β2 adrenergic receptor gene ( ADRβ2) , we found four rare coding 
variants plus a 25 base- pair insertion- deletion for a total allele frequency of 8% in 
African -American asthmatics while in non- Hispanic White asthmatics, only the Thr
164Ile 
 23        variant was found at a 2% frequency (Genetics Table 1 below).
 
A significant relationship was observed between rare variants and loss of asthma 
control in individuals treated with a LABA. In 581 asthmatics on LABA therapy (with adjusting for age, sex and race), the 35 individuals with a rare variant had increased risk of hospitalization for asthma in the last year (42%) versus 22% in those without a rare variant (OR=2.2, p=0.04, Genetics Figure 2 below ) (Ortega 2009, 2010).   
       

 24        Unfortunately, data were only available on 179 African- Americans. No difference was 
observed in the 412 asthmatics not being treated with a LABA (which may be expected 
since many of these subjects probably have mild asthma).  
 
Mapping by Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium? 
 
Mapping by admixture linkage (admixture mapping) is a genome- wide approach that 
utilizes a subset of SNP’s to determine genetic ancestry at given loci in the genome 
(Genetics Figure 3 below). Admixture mapping determines  local or regional estimates 
of genetic ancestry rather than global ancestry and has greater statistical power 
than classic Genome -Wide Association Studies (GWAS) because it requires a 
substantially smaller number of genetic markers (approximately 1,300 single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNP’s) (Smith 2004, Zhu 2008). In addition, it provides better coverage of rare variants that vary in frequency between populations with different ancestries (Gravel 2011, Mckeigue 2005) . 
 
Admixture mapping is based on the fundamental principle that a proportion of genetic 
variants vary in frequency between populations of different ances tries. Recent 
generations of mixing between different genetically heterogeneous populations results in admixed populations that inherit chromosomal regions unique to an individual ancestry (Smith 2005). Through admixture mapping, these regions can be ident ified 
with genetic markers that show marked differences in allele frequencies between ancestral populations --ancestry informative markers. Genomic regions where ancestry 
has a statistically significant effect on a pre- specified phenotype are represented by  
admixture mapping peaks.  The optimal setting for the use of admixture mapping is in an 
admixed population where there are marked racial disparities in disease phenotype not 

 25        attributed to environmental factors, such as responses to asthma therapies between 
Black s and non- Hispanic White asthmatics (Patterson 2004, Smith 2004).   
 
Examples of Admixture mapping in Genetic Studies  
Colleagues of our investigators at Wake Forest have extensive expertise in using 
admixture approaches in type 2 diabetes in African -Americans who have an increased 
burden of chronic kidney and end- stage kidney diseases as complications of diabetes 
mellitus type 2. In a genetic study using admixture mapping scanning with only  1,272 
SNP’s, variants in MYH9  were associated with idiopathic and HIV -associated focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis in a small population of 190 Black  cases and 222 controls 
(Kopp 2008). In addition, these investigators participated in another analysis that used a 
similar approach with 1,354 genetic markers to identify variants in MYH9  associated 
with progression to end- stage renal disease in Black s (Kao 2008). They found that 
genetic variation in MYH9 substantially explains the increased burden of these 
complications in African-Americans. 
 In asthma, the Wake Forest genomics group has collaborated with other investigators from the NIH NHLBI Severe Asthma Research Program and the NIH NHLBI Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Asthma in using high- density admixture mapping 
in 355 African- American asthma cases and 444 controls using 1,026,072 SNP’s to 
identify a novel asthma susceptibility locus in chromosome 6q14.1 (Torgerson 2012). Admixture- based approaches have also been used by Genetics of Asthma in Latinos 
(GALA) investigators to identify an asthma susceptibility locus in chromosome 5q23 in 96 Puerto Rican asthma subjects and 88 controls. Puerto Ricans are a population with a significant proportion of sub- Saharan African Ancestry in which the use of admixture 
mapping provided a statistical advantage for the analysis of such a small population (Choudhry 2008). Based on the observed differences in response to LABA or ICS therapy in Black  asthmatics when compared to non- Hispanic Whites, admixture 

 26        mapping can be used to identify novel loci that predict responses to ICS and LABA 
therapy.  
 
To summarize, w e propose to use global ancestry analysis  and analysis of admixture in 
the BARD trial in two ways:  
- First, in our primary aim, to determine the role of global African ancestry 
on the preferential response to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or long- acting beta 
agonist (LABA) therapy.  
- Second, in our exploratory aims, to determine the role of genetic variation 
on the preferential response to ICS or LABA therapy using candidate gene analyses and unb iased genome -wide admixture mapping scanning to identify 
novel loci that determine therapeutic responses.  
 
IX. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING THE STUD Y POPULATION 
AND STUDY MEDICATIONS  
 The drugs that will be used in this study include ICS (low to high dose fluticasone 
propionate) and the long- acting beta agonist  (LABA)  salmeterol . Blinded drugs will be 
made available for this study by GlaxoSmithKline. Both ICS and LABA therapy have been used in previous ACRN  (adult)  and CARE  (pediatric)  trials without the occurrence 
of any significant side effect or adverse event attributable to either form of therapy.  
Salmeterol is currently approved for use in children down to at least 5 years of age. The 
FDA has reviewed the protocol and exempted AsthmaNet from holding an IND for the 
BARD trial.  
 
A. Justification of inclusion of participants who are symptomatic on low 
doses of ICS or ICS/LABA:  
 Participants  who are symptomatic at baseline on low doses of ICS or ICS/LABA  will be 
allowed to participate in the trial and enter the run- in period. It has been the practice in 
NHLBI trials to allow such patients to participate in trials because entering a trial, being in a monitored setting, and gaining a better understanding of one’ s asthma, all may be 
particularly beneficial for such a patient.  For instance, there may be confounding factors contributing to the poor control (e.g. technique, adherence) that could be addressed in greater detail in a trial. Alternatively, such a patient may never be exposed to va rious step up options after treatment for an exacerbation, as asthma is highly 
episodic and clinical practices do not automatically recommend step -up with a single 
exacerbation. Furthermore, if it is demonstrated that such a patient is poorly controlled, a study participant may b enefit from the alternative dosing strategies to be offered in 
this trial (e.g. 5xICS BID). In addition, safety algorithms are in place (see below), and with the study ’s close monitoring, participant s will be assigned treatment failure status if 
the poor control persists. If in the run- in, they will either be randomized or treated for an 
exacerbation if needed. If post -randomization, they will also be treated as needed.  
  
 27        B. Escalation of ICS dose: 
 
Escalation of ICS Dose:  In this study, we will increase ICS  monotherapy dose from low 
dose in the run- in to medium - or high- dose monotherapy ICS during the treatment 
period, utilizing dosing that may abrogate exacerbations in individuals with asthma. Several adult studies including TALC and OPTIMA (O’Byrne 2001) suggest that 2xICS may not be adequate, and others e.g. Pauwels (FACET 1997) and Kelly (2011) have suggested that 4- 5xICS offers potential to reduce exacerbations. As participants with 
asthma may benefit from alternative dosing strategies to be offered in t his trial (like 
5xICS BID),  we are thus examining an escalation to 5x dosing because these prior 
studies have shown that 2x dosing is not always sufficient to attain control.  However, we will be examining ICS dose response, both with and without LABA, to assess 
whether or not lower doses are effective in these Black populations. Depending on which ICS is acquired for this study, escalation from low to medium dose may range from 2x to 5x the initial dose (at least a quadrupling) .  In order to assess safety,  we will 
monitor  for steroid side effects such as adrenal suppression (with overnight urine 
cortisol ) (see Safety Monitoring section XXII), and thus plan to ascertain whether there 
is a differential clinical effect of different ICS dosing in Blacks.  
 
C. Assessment of Black adults/adolescents vs. children, rationale for 
breakdown of age groups into age 5 -11 years and 12 and older, and dosing 
issues: 
 
It is important to perform  the BARD  protocol in both adults  and adolescents 12 to 18 
years of age, as well as in children in the age range of 5 to 11 years . To date, there is no 
cross- age, dose- ranging study of any ICS to determine the appropriate dose in these 
age groups. Indeed, the “boxed” labeling for LABA’s was in part due to effects of LABA in children in the 5-11 year  old age group. This cross- age study is particularly important 
since the FDA currently recognizes asthma as the same disease in children and adults and thus designs regulatory studies with this assumption in mind. We also have the 
opportunity in BARD to compare  the effects of these therapies on different  outcome 
measures in this population, and also to utilize a variety of baseline parameters, 
including genotype as well as phenotypic characteristics (e.g.  bronchodilator 
responsiveness, methacholine responsiveness) to assess predictors of responsiveness 
to the different therapies across the ages .   
D. Steroid dose response in Blacks in relation to age:  
 To date, there is no information available on specific dosing of ICS in the Black 
population , regardl ess of age, and there has not been an across- age, ICS dose ranging 
study in Blacks. BARD  with its current dosing strategy can address the question of best 
step up therapy in Black children 5 to 11 years  of age and in Black individuals aged 12 
or greater  and determine whether consideration for dosing recommendations should be 
changed in Blacks of different ages. Information on this topic is urgently needed since it is well known that the Black population, including children and adults, has a higher proporti on of asthma mortality and urgent care utilization as compared to other 
races/ethnicity in the United States (Szefler 2011). There is also concern that the Black population may have a higher risk for steroid insensitivity (Chan 1998) and/or reduced cellula r sensitivity to corticosteroids (Federico 2005). Therefore, BARD  offers the unique 
 28        opportunity to define the dose- response relationship of ICS as well as the additive effect 
of long -acting ß -adrenergic agonists in a cross -age manner in a patient population at 
high risk for asthma mortality and morbidity . We are thus trying to characterize dose 
response in this patient population, and we hypothesize that Blacks may require a 
higher dose of ICS to attain control.  Therefore, both the adult/adolescent and the  
pediatric aspects of this study will include evaluation of the dose response to inhaled corticosteroids, but lower doses of ICS will be used in the pediatric age group to minimize risks of higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids. We seek to assess what the inhaled steroid dose response is in this population, when inadequately responsive to low dose inhaled corticosteroid, a dose defined by 100 mcg fluticasone twice daily in individuals aged 12 or greater  or 50 mcg fluticasone twice daily  in children <12 years 
old. These doses are considered low in adolescents and adults as well as in children 5 
to 11 years  of age (NAEPP guidelines tables 4- 8b and 4- 4b). This strategy will still allow 
us to evaluate whether this population requires higher doses of ICS due to steroid insensitivity (Chan 1998, Federico 2005, Szefler 2011).  
 In individuals aged 12 or greater, the second dose of fluticasone propionate (the first 
step up dose) will be 250 mcg twice daily as this is the next higher available step up dose that is used in these ages. While this dose is at the upper limit of medium dose in adolescents and adults, it exceeds the designated medium dose of fluticasone propionate by 100 mcg per day (maximum range designated as 400 mcg per day) in children, so we are stepping up to 100 mcg BID of fluticasone in children <12 years old.  
The third dose to be studied in individuals aged 12 or greater is 500 mcg twice per day 
or 1,000 mcg per day. This dose is in the approved labeling for adolescents and adults  
but is greater than the limit of the high dose for children 5-11 years  so in the younger 
subjects, we will use 250 mcg BID as the second step up.  
 
E. Combining adults and adolescents aged 12 and greater to develop data to 
inform guideline and treatment recommendations : 
 While it might be argued that 13 year olds differ from adults, this strategy is consistent with both FDA and NAEPP guidelines.  Utilizing these cutoffs will increase the likelihood that our findings will be incorporated into ongoing guidelines and recomme ndations.   
While studies by Visser et al with a comparable ICS (fluticasone propionate) dosing strategy in an adolescent population with a comparable delivery device (Visser 2001, 2004) did note that HPA suppression and growth were suppressed with the 500 and 
1,000 mcg per day dose given over a time frame similar to our study design, 3 months, these effects were reversible through the course of the study . 
 
F. HPA Axis Suppression : 
 Due to the absence of data, we are not certain whether the reports of steroid insensitivity in the Black population are limited to the anti -inflammatory effect of steroid 
therapy or if they are also extended to the systemic effects of steroid therapy on growth and HPA axis suppression. To address this question, we will obtain measures of growth 
throughout the study and we will measure HPA suppression (utilizing overnight urine cortisol).  
 
 29        We feel that this comprehensive study of a range of inhaled corticosteroid dosing will 
help define medication recommendations for managing asthma in the Black population 
that will be informative across ages and will define the advantages and limitations of each treatment strategy.  
 
G. Symmetry between adult/adolescent and pediatric studies :  
 We are attempting to answer many of the same research questions in the pediatric and non-pediatric population. However, due to real differences between these groups, the 
study designs are not identical.  
 Dose of ICS.   Both studies utilize an ICS dose escalation, but the pediatric population 
starts at half the dose and escalates to a maximum that is half the dose of the non-pediatric population. This decision was made to approximate dose exposure based on size and also due to safety concerns related to use of high dose ICS (500 mcg FP BID) 
in children <12 years old).  Additionally, due to specific ICS dose availability, the step up in the 5-11 age group is a 2 fold increase in ICS  (from 1xICS, 50 mcg BID, to 2xICS, 
100 BID), whereas in the older age group, the first step up is a 2.5 fold increase (from 1xICS, 100 mcg BID, to 2.5xICS, 250 mcg BID). Nonetheless, there remains symmetry between the studies in those less than and greater than age 12, as both cohorts will get increasing doses of ICS with and without LABA.   
“Closest” Dose Step Up.   In the 12 year old and older study, the next “closest” 
randomized step up is from run- in ICS 100 mcg BID  to addition of a LABA (ICS 100 mcg 
BID + LABA BID). In those less than 12 years old the next “closest” step up is from run-
in ICS 50 mcg BID to ICS 100 mcg BID  and the LABA does not get “added- on” to the 
lowest dose of ICS but rather to the next dose of ICS . See section XIII.C Statistical 
Design and Analyses , Statistical Analysis Plan  Statistical Analysis Plan for the 
Primary a nd Secondary Outcomes , first two paragraphs, for a listing that allows one to 
appreciate this difference. Due to lack of a placebo inhaler (and potential concerns of utilizing two separate inhalers in children), we are unable to move up to ICS 50 mcg 
+LABA BID.  We could not start the children at 100  mcg BID during the run-in because  
this would result in a maximum dose of 500 mcg BID  which is not acceptable due to 
safety concerns as referenced in the previous paragraph. While this creates some 
differences in the degree to which we can answer all questions, we can still answer the primary and secondary research questions in both age groups (see section XIII 
Statistical Analysis Plan  below).

prednisone) dispensed  
  As noted in Exclusion Criteria, children 5- 11 taking a dose of FP greater 
than 500 mcg per day are ineligible.  As noted in Randomization Inclusion Criteria, so as to ensure participants’ safety, individuals taking more than 
2-2.5xICS monotherapy equivalent/day or ≥2-2.5xICS/LABA will be 
stepped down initially to 2- 2.5xICS BID and then reassessed in 2 weeks  at 
Screen Visit A1  to assure stability to taper down to the baseline of 1xICS 
BID. If not inadequately  controlled (i.e., the participant  has not 
exacerbated and does not have an ACQ score ≥1.5), then the ICS dose 
will be stepped down to 1xICS BID for the remainder of the run- in and the 
participant will be scheduled for Screen Visit B in 2 weeks . If individuals  
are inadequately  controlled on 2- 2.5xICS BID  (i.e., they have an ACQ 
score ≥ 1.5 and/or experience an asthma exacerbation), then they will be 
terminated  from further study participation.  
 
2. Week -10, Screen Visit A1 (Sa1) 
The purpose of this visit is to evaluate participants who require 2- step step -down 
procedures to determine if they are eligible to taper to the 1xICS dose. This visit is only required for those in the 2- step step- down group.

the participant  did not previously qualify for study entry based on 
reversibility criteria at Visit Sa  or documentation from two spirometry 
sessions over the course of a year , the participant  may qualify for entry 
based on a methacholine PC
20 value of ≤ 16 mg/ml. Second, t he 
methacholine bronchoprovocation is performed at this visit to establish a reference baseline for characterization purposes. If the methacholine bronchoprovocation cannot be performed at this visit because the FEV
1 is 
< 55% predicted or 1.0 liters (adults) or <70% predicted (<18 years of 
age), one additional attempt to perform the test may be made prior to randomization if the participant  is clinically stable.

Participants and/or their families will be contacted by telephone every 3 weeks between scheduled visits during the double- blind treatment periods .  
Participants/parents will be asked about the participant’s symptoms, peak flows, nightti me awakenings, and rescue use during the past 3 weeks , as well as  the 
occurrence of  any hospitalizations or urgent care visits,  to determine if the 
participant has met criteria for treatment failure or drop- out status. If the 
participant appears to have met criteria for treatment failure or drop -out status or 
is experiencing symptoms indicative of an asthma exacerbation, he or she will be seen for an unscheduled visit  at the performance site  as soon as possible.  
   
 43        XI. OUTCOMES  
 
Primary Outcome:  The primary outcome is a hierarchical asthma measure that 
uses exacerbations, asthma control days (ACDs) during the last 12 of 14 weeks of 
a treatment regimen , and the %predicted FEV 1 at the end of the 14 -week  treatment 
regimen.  This composite outcome, used in BADGER (the pediatric trial comparing 
LABA, increased ICS, and LTRA in subjects inadequately controlled on low dose ICS 
(Lemanske 2010)), uses a hierarchical method to ascertain differences in asthma control. Treatments are first compared to see if they differ in terms of exacerbations. If 
one treatment produces one or more exacerbations less than the alternate treatment , 
then it is classified as the superior treatment. If none of the treatments for a specific 
participant is  superior, then his  or her responses are compared by asthma control days 
(ACDs - see definition below). If one treatment differs by at least 31 annualized ACDs 
from the other, then t he participant  is now assigned to treatment superiority for that 
treatment.  If treatment superiority still cannot be assigned by ACDs, then  a participant ’s 
responses to treatment s are compared by the %predicted FEV
1 at the end of the 14 -
week treatment regimen (a difference of 5% or more between treatments  being 
necessary to assign superiority). If no treatment superiority can be assigned based on FEV
1, then participant s are classified as having “no preference”.   
At the end of the study, each participant  will be identified as either a differential or non-
differential treatment responder.  A differential responder is someone who exhibits 
significantly better outcomes on one treatment than on another. Treatment response is based on asthma exacerbations, ACD, and the %predicted FEV
1 at the end of the 14-
week treatment regimen.  A participant will be identified as a differential responder if he  
or she responds differentially with respect to asthma exacerbations, ACD, or the 
%predicted FEV 1. 
This trial is not a typical clinical trial comparison of treatments. A typical trial employs either a parallel or cross -over design to compare treatments with respect to population 
averages of a given outcome. Such trials are able to demonstrate that one treatment is superior to another in the sense that the average treatment r esponse across a 
population of individuals is better. However, some individuals in that population may not respond better to the superior treatment. Conversely, such trials might demonstrate that two treatments are not different with respect to the population average.  In this case, it is possible that the lack of average difference occurs because some individuals respond markedly better to one treatment while others respond markedly better to the other.  Sub-group analyses of such trials are often used to predict treatment response 
according to a set of phenotypic and/or genotypic characteristics. The purpose of these analyses is to identify sub- groups of the population that are more homogen eous with 
respect to treatment response. However, inference based on these analyses is still at the level of population averages.  
 
Secondary Outcome(s):  
 Asthma control days  
An Asthma Control Day (ACD) will be defined as a day without:  
 
1. Albuterol rescue use (pre- exercise treatment permitted)  
 
 44        2. Use of non- study asthma medications including oral steroids . In addition, 
the 7 days immediately following the end of a course of oral steroids  will 
be considered non-ACDs.  
 
3. Daytime or nighttime asthma symptoms (wheezing, coughing, 
phlegm/mucus, chest tightness , or shortness of breath)  
 
4. Unscheduled health care provider visits for asthma, emergency room visit or hospital admission for asthma, or missed work or school due to asthma  
 
5. AM or PM peak flow less than 90% of the analysis PEF reference value 
defined as:  Average AM PEF from the run-in week (7 days) most proximal 
to randomization Visit 1 that met the definition as a ‘lack of acceptable 
asthma control’ week on the basis of rescue use, asthma symptoms, or 
PEF as defined in section VII.A. If the participant qual ified for 
randomization on the basis of nighttime awakenings alone, then the reference will be the average AM PEF from the week (7 days) prior to the 
awakening that occurred most proximal to Visit 1. In the unlikely event that  
the participant qualified for  randomization on the basis of having had an 
asthma exacerbation during the run- in, and he or she did not experience 
an uncontrolled week or meet the nighttime awakenings definition of ‘lack 
of control’, then the reference PEF will be the average AM PEF fr om the 
week (7 days)  prior to the first dose of prednisone used to treat the 
exacerbation.  If an individual experienced two exacerbations prior to 
randomization, then the reference will be the average AM PEF from the week (7 days) prior to the first dose of prednisone used to treat the first exacerbation.  
 
Days without asthma will be calculated from daily e-diary entries. Other secondary 
outcomes of asthma control collected from e-diary include percentage of: rescue-
free days, albuterol -free days and episode- free days. A rescue- free day is defined as 
no albuterol rescue use (pre- exercise treatment permitted), no use of oral steroids 
for asthma, no use of non- study asthma medications, no unscheduled primary care 
provider visits for asthma, and no emergency room visits or hospital admissions for asthma. An albuterol -free day is defined as no albuterol use for rescue or for pre -
exercise treatment.  An episode- free day is defined in the same way as a day without 
asthma with the additional requirement that morning and evening peak flow are greater than 80% of personal best ( Sorkness 2007).  
  Lung Function (pre and post bronchodilator  FEV
1 including albuterol)  
 Airway Hyperresponsiveness  at baseline as a predictor of responsiveness to each 
therapy  
 Asthma Control: well -controlled week, or ACT (or c -ACT)  
 Asthma Quality of Life Measures : AQLQ+12 (Juniper 2005) and RAND- IAQL -12 
(Stucky currently under review, Eberhart currently under review ) (ages 12 and older) 
or pediatric AQLQ  (Juniper 1996) (ages 7- 11)  or PedsQL ( general quality of life, not 
asthma -specific) (Varn i 2001) ( ages 5-6) 
  
Exploratory Outcomes:  
 45         Number of Asthma exacerbations (ATS criteria i.e. requiring prednisone)  and 
characterization of asthma  exacerbations (see section XX ). 
XII. GENOTYPING METHODS  
 
Individuals in the BARD  trial will be genotyped using Illumina OmniExpress and Human 
Exome beadchips, according to manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). 
These platforms have whole exome coverage that includes 742,000 common and rare genetic variants for detailed regional admixture- based methods. Briefly, genotyping 
quality control will consist of the following procedures within BeadStudio:   1) initial 
clustering with Illumina -defined clusters; 2) removal of samples with call rates less than 
90%; 3) removal of SNPs with call rates less than 90%; 4) re- calculation of call rates 
and removal of samples with call rates less than 95%; 5) re- clustering of remaining 
samples; and 6) removal of SNPs with poor clustering (GenTrain < 0.75 and ClusterSep < 0.3). Additional quality control measures including calculation of genotyping efficiency and Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium will be performed using the publically availabl e 
software Plink v1.07 and Haploview v4.1. Although it is more cost effective to utilize a GWAS chip, a small subset consisting of approximately 1,536 variants that are ancestry informative are sufficient to determine genome- wide or global ancestry based on data 
sets from Smith et al, Hinds et al, and the Phase International Haplotype Map. (Smith 
2004, HapMap 2003, Hinds 2005).  However, by having GWAS data, we will have the 
ability to interrogate specific genes of interest such as ADBR2 without having to perform additional genotyping.  
XIII. STATISTICAL DESIGN AND ANALYSES  
A. Randomization 
The target sample size for the BARD  trial is 291 Black adults/adolescents  (ages 12 and 
older ) and 284 Black children (ages 5- 11). Each participant’s age group will be defined 
at his/her enrollment visit, Screen Visit A. Individuals who are ages 5- 11 at enrollment 
will be placed in the child track for data purposes and will cont inue to be treated 
according to the procedures for children for the duration of their  trial participation. 
This study incorporates a design in which each participant will receive each of four treatment regimens over four 14- week periods (known as a four -way crossover design). 
For adults/adolescents, if we denote the four treatment regimens as A, B, C, and D, then each BARD  adolescent/adult  will be randomized to one of the following four 
treatment sequences:  
ABCD, BDAC, CADB, DCBA  
For children, if we denote the four treatment regimens as E , F, G, and H, then each 
BARD  child will be randomized to one of the following four treatment sequences:  
EFGH, FHEG , GEHF, HGFE  
Because BARD  invokes a four -way crossover design, a stratified randomization based 
on prognostic factors is not critical. Instead, we only will invoke clinical center partnership within age group at enrollment  (adults/adolescents, children) as a stratifying 
 46        variable with permuted blocks of size four (one complete cycle of the four treatment 
sequences).  When a participant at a particular performance site is deemed eligible for 
the study  at Visit 1 , the Clinic Coordinator will access the AsthmaNet server and 
indicate to the system that a participant requires randomization. After entering the 
pertinent information with respect to clinical center partnership and eligibility criteria, the 
Clinic Coordinator will be asked to verify that all of the entered information is correct.  If 
so, the Clinic Coordinator will be given the number  of a blinded Diskus to dispense to 
the participant . At all post -randomization visits the coordinator will access the 
randomization module to generate the number of a new Diskus  that contains the 
regimen consistent with the participant’s randomized drug sequence. Some visit 
intervals are long enough in duration to require the dispensation of two Diskuses, each with its own unique number. In order to maintain security of the randomization schedules, DCC data management and coordination staff will receive automatically a 
notice from the AsthmaNet server that a participant has been randomized and/or had a new Diskus  number generated.  
B. Masking  
To minimize the bias due to possible knowledge of the sequence assignment, the study 
will be double- blinded. Thus, the investigators and the participants will not know which 
treatments are being administered during the treatment periods.  Further, key personnel 
at the DCC will also remain blinded through study implementation and analysis phases.  This includes the data managers, scientific coordinators, and statisticians. Only the project coordinator and a database programmer will have access to the unblinding documentation while the trial is being implemented and the data are being analyzed for the primary publication.  
C. Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for the Run-in Period  
The run- in period is considered the baseline evaluation period. The initial statistical 
analysis will focus on summarizing the baseline characteristics of the study participants.  We will calculate descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations, or medians and inter-quartile ranges) for continuous baseline measures such as current age, age at first 
asthma diagnosis, pulmonary function parameters including methacholine hyperresponsiveness, and asthma symptom severity.  We will generate frequency tables for categorical baseline measures such as gender, prior medication history, atopic status , and genotype.  
Statistical Analysis  Plan for the Primary and Secondary Outcomes  
The BARD  trial invokes a four -way crossover design. For convenience, the four 
treatment regimens A,B,C, and D are designated as follows for adolescents/adults:  
Run In  1.0xICS  
A = 1.0×ICS/LABA  
B = 2.5×ICS 
C = 2.5×ICS/LABA  
D = 5.0×ICS 
where 1.0× ICS is equivalent to 100 mcg fluticasone propionate BID. 
 47         
The four treatment regimens E,F,G, and H are designated as follows for children:  
 Run In  1.0xICS  
E = 2.0×ICS 
F = 2.0×ICS/LABA 
G = 5.0×ICS 
H = 5.0×ICS/LABA  
where 2.0× ICS is equivalent to 100 mcg fluticasone propionate BID. 
 
Each of the four treatment periods endures for 14 weeks, but the data from the first two weeks of each treatment period are not used in the statistical analyses because of the lack of wash -out periods in the crossover design. These four sequences yield a 
crossover design that is uniform within periods, uniform within sequences, and balanced with respect to first -order carryover effects.  
The primary outcome in the BARD  trial is adapted from the CARE N etwork BADGER 
trial and represents superiority of one treatment regimen compared to another treatment regimen using a variable based on a hierarchical determination from three asthma outcomes – asthma exacerbations, asthma control days (ACDs), and FEV
1. For each 
BARD  participant, we will compare any two treatment regimens based on the data from 
the latter 12 weeks of his/her respective treatment periods. The process is described as follows for the generic comparison of any two treatment regimens:  
1. If the BARD participant experiences fewer asthma exacerbations on one 
treatment regimen relative to another treatment regimen, then the treatment regimen that yields the fewer asthma exacerbations is deemed to be superior to the other treatment regimen and the process is terminated. If not, then continue to the next step.  
2. If the BARD  participant experiences at least 31 fewer annualized ACDs on one 
treatment regimen relative to another treatment regimen, then the treatment regimen that yields at least 31 more  annuali zed ACDs is deemed to be superior 
to the other treatment regimen and the process is terminated. If not, then continue to the next step.  
3. If the BARD  participant displays at least 5 percentage points higher in the 
%predicted FEV
1 at the end of the 14- week treatment regimen relative to another 
treatment regimen, then the treatment regimen that yields the higher %predicted FEV
1 is deemed to be superior to the other treatment regimen. If not, then the 
two treatment regimens are deemed to be “equivalent” or “tied” for that BARD  
participant.  
 This outcome allows pairwise comparisons of treatment regimens. The following table displays the pairwise comparisons of interest for the primary and secondary hypotheses in the BARD  trial:

Each BARD  participant within the ith age group, i = 1 (adolescents/adults) or 2 (children), 
generates a trinary random variable for each pairwise comparison identified in the table above. We illustrate this for the j
th participant within the adolescents/adults group, in 
which there are six pairwise comparisons of interest  (two primary and four secondary) : 
 
Y1j,AB = –1, if B is superior to A for the jth participant  
      0, if A and B are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if A is superior to B for the jth participant  
 
Y1j,CD = –1, if D is superior to C for the jth participant  
      0, if C and D are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if C is superior to D for the jth participant  
 
Y1j,AC = –1, if C is superior to A for the jth participant  
      0, if A and C are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if A is superior to C for the jth participant  
 49         
Y1j,AD = –1, if D is superior to A for the jth participant  
      0, if A and D are equivalent for the jth participant  
   +1, if A  is superior to D for the jth participant  
 
Y1j,BC = –1, if C  is superior to B for the jth participant  
      0, if B and C are equivalent for the jth participant  
   +1, if B is superior to C for the jth participant  
 Y
1j,BD = –1, if D is superior to B for the jth participant  
      0, if B and D are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if B is superior to D for the jth participant  
 For the j
th participant within the adolescents/adults group, we collect these six trinary 
random variables into a 6 × 1 random vector:  
 
Y1j = [Y 1j,AB Y1j,CD Y1j,AC Y1j,AD Y1j,BC Y1j,BD]T 
 
In order to construct the 6 × 1 expectation vector, E(Y1j) = µ1, and the 6 × 6 variance-
covariance matrix Var(Y1j) = Σ1 for the adolescents/adults group, we define the following

For the children group, we construct a similar set of marginal univariate probabilities and marginal bivariate probabilities, although there only are three pairwise comparisons of interest listed in the table above. The five pairwise comparisons of interest for the 
children group are F versus G  (primary), E versus F (secondary), E versus G 
 52        (secondary),  F versus H  (secondary) , and G versus H (secondary) . This leads to a 5 × 1 
expectation vector, E(Y2j) = µ2, and a 5 × 5 variance- covariance matrix Var(Y2j) = Σ2 for 
the children group.   These are described below.  
 
For the jth participant within the children group, the five pairwise comparisons of interest  
are as follows : 
 
Y2j,FG = –1, if G is superior to F for the jth participant  
      0, if F  and G are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if F  is superior to G for the jth participant  
 
Y2j,EF = –1, if E is superior to F for the jth participant  
      0, if E  and F are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if E  is superior to F for the jth participant  
 
Y2j,EG = –1, if E is superior to G for the jth participant  
      0, if E  and G are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if E  is superior to G for the jth participant  
 
Y2j,FH = –1, if H is superior to F for the jth participant  
      0, if F and H are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if F is superior to H for the jth participant  
 
Y2j,GH = –1, if G is superior to H for the jth participant  
      0, if G and H are equivalent for the jth participant  
    +1, if G is superior to H for the jth participant  
 For the j
th participant within the children  group, we collect these five trinary random 
variables into a 5 × 1 random vector:  
 
Y2j = [Y 2j,FG Y2j,EF Y2j,EG Y2j,FH Y2j,GH]T

 We will apply maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to arrive at estimates for all of the 
marginal univariate probabilities and marginal bivariate probabilities. If n
1 and n 2 denote 
the total sample sizes for the adolescents/adults and children, respectively, and if I(x) denotes the indicator function (equal to one if the event x is true and zero otherwise), then the ML estimates of the marginal univariate probabilities and marginal bivariate probabilities for the adolescents/adults groups are of the form

Within the adolescents/adults group, there is a one- to-one correspondence between the 
27 marginal univariate and bivariate probabilities and the 27 parameters in the 
expectations, variances, and covariances ( µ1 and Σ1). Within the children group, there is 
a one- to-one correspondence between the 20 marginal univariate and bivariate 
probabilities and the 20 parameters in the expectations, variances, and covariances ( µ2 
and Σ2). Therefore, the ML estimates for the marginal univariate probabilities and the 
marginal bivariate probabilities lead to ML estimates for the expectation vectors µ1 and 
µ2 and the variance- covariance matrices Σ1 and Σ2, denoted as ,ΣˆΣˆμˆμˆ2 1 2 1, ,  ,
respectively, by substituting the ML estimates of the probabilities into the expressions for the expectation vectors and variance- covariance matrices above.

Statistical Analysis Plan for Additional Secondary and Exploratory Hypotheses   
 
We will analyze separately each of three components of the composite outcome as secondary outcomes. We will apply a Weibull  hazards regression analysis for the time 
to first asthma exacerbation and linear mixed- effects models for the longitudinal data on 
ACDs and FEV
1. The linear mixed- effects models will include  
1. fixed effects for treatment regimen, sequence, period, and season of enrollment (spring, summer, fall, winter) nested within each of the age groups  
2. a random effect for clinical center partnership within each of the age groups  
3. a 12 × 12 unstructured variance- covariance matrix for the 12 measurements per 
participant within each of the age groups  
The Weibull  hazards regression model will include the same set of fixed terms and 
random effects as the linear mixed- effects models, as well as a random effect (frailty) 
for the BARD  participant to account for the correlations within the BARD  participant (Liu 
2008).  
 We will apply a similar statistical approach with the linear mixed- effects model for the 
other secondary outcomes that are measured on a continuum, such as diary peak flow 
values  and quality -of-life scores . 
 56         
Secondary hypothesis #1 and secondary hypothesis #3 both involve comparisons of 
adolescents/adults to children. As indicated in the table above, these comparisons are based on (step 1) within- age comparisons of the treatment regimens and then (step 2) 
comparisons of the results from step 1. Such two- step comparisons are constructed via 
the Q
2 statistic described above.  
 With respect to secondary hypothesis #2 (genetic marker effects), we will include the genetic markers as regressors in the linear mixed- effects models and a Weibull  hazards 
regression model (in addition,  see Genetics Analysis  below) .  With respect to the 
exploratory hypothesis (characteristics and biomarker effects), we will include the patient characteristics (atopy, pulmonary function, and methacholine responsiveness ) 
and selected biomarkers (sputum eosinophils) as regressors in the linear mixed- effects 
models and the proporti onal hazards regression model.  
 
Accounting for Family Members  
 It is very likely that some randomized participants will be members of the same family. We anticipate that this clustering could comprise 5- 10% of the sample. To account for 
this clustering effect, we will expand the statistical models for the primary and secondary outcomes described above. In particular, we will incorporate (1) an additional 
random effect for family membership into the linear mixed- effects models for continuous 
outcomes, (2) a random effect for family membership into a nonlinear mixed- effects 
model for continuous outcomes, and (3) a random effect for family membership into a 
nonlinear mixed- effects Weibull hazards model for time-to-event outcome variables . 
Intention -to-treat analyses  
All of the analyses described above will follow the intention -to-treat paradigm whereby 
all available data from randomized participants are included in the analyses regardless of information about deviations from study protocol.  
 
Sensitivity Analyses  
With respect to the composite preference outcome, t here may be period effects due to 
the cr ossover design and there may be seasonal effects due to the staggered entry over 
time for participant enrollment. For example, an exacerbation is more likely to occur 
during the winter months than the summer months for a participant, regardless of the respective treatments administered to the participant during the summer and winter months. Similar scenarios can be envisioned for asthma symptom and pulmonary function outcomes. In this context, expression of the participant’s ast hma may not 
remain stable over the seasons even though the underlying disease may not change measurably. The permuted blocks within the randomization scheme will alleviate this concern to a modest extent, but will not resolve it completely.  
Therefore, as a  sensitivity analysis, we will adjust the ACD and FEV
1 measurements of  
the composite preference scores  for each BARD  participant by subtracting off the 
estimates of the fixed effects ( sequence, period, and season of enrollment nested within 
each of the age  groups ) in the linear mixed- effects models described above. We will 
conduct additional sensitivity analyses by constructing the composite preference scores using only ACD and FEV
1 measurements . 
 57        There could be some disparity in recruitment numbers across c linical center 
partnerships  due to the fact that only Blacks are eligible for BARD . Therefore, we will 
apply sensitivity analyses in the form of meta- analyses across all the clinical center 
partnerships . We will invoke the proportional hazards regression models and the linear 
mixed -effects models described above, except that the random effects for clinical center 
partnerships will be excluded. Instead, we will analyze the data within each clinical 
center partnership separately, and then combine the results across partnership via a 
random -effects meta -analysis model. We will supplement these meta- analyses with 
statistical diagnostics by re- performing the meta- analyses on selected subgroups of 
clinical center partnerships (those with high Black recruitment and those with low Black 
recruitment).  
 
Missing Data  
 
Because of the possibility of drop- outs and other missed visits, there will be some 
missing data. The statistical models and analyses that are planned for the primary and secondary outcomes assume that the data are missing -at-random (MAR). Because we 
are applying likelihood- based methods for the data adjustment with the primary 
outcome and for all of the secondary outcomes, MAR data still yield valid estimates. Although not expected, if it appears that the MAR assumption is not reasonable, then we will invoke shared parameter models to simultaneously model the time to drop- out 
and the individual secondary outcome (Vonesh 2006).  
 
Interim Analyses  
There will be no formal interim analysis of efficacy in this trial. Nevertheless, interim statistical analyses to evaluate the safety of the four treatment regimens will be presented to the AsthmaNet Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) semi -annually 
for review. Based on the results of these interim analyses, the DSMB will recommend to the NHLBI the continuation or discontinuation of the trial. In addition, the DSMB will be monitoring all of the safety data throughout the course of the trial and will be notified within 72 hours of any serious adverse event (SAE) that is deemed both unexpected and related to the study. All SAEs will be reviewed at each 6- month review.  
D. Statistical Analysis Plan for Genetics  
 Our primary hypothesis is that in Black asthmatics , those with a better response to 
LABAs will have a lower overall proportion of African ancestry.   As a corollary, we 
hypothesize that those with a better response to ICS will have a higher overall proportion of African ancestry.  
 On an exploratory basis, we hypothesize that the variability in response to the treatments will be related to a degree of African ancestry at specific pharmacogenetic 
loci.  
 Per the clinical protocol, the primary outcome for BARD  is a hierarchical asthma 
measure based on exacerbations, asthma control days (ACDs) , and FEV
1. Based on 
the clinical protocol, for the genetic analysis, the percentage of African ancestry will 
serve as a continuous regressor for the trinary outcome variables, described in Section VII.C above, via a trinary logistic regression. Analysis will be similar to Lemanske et al., 
 58        in which a priori predictors (such as PC20 and FeNO) were tested for association with 
the probability of best response to a particular therapy (Lemanske 2010).  
 
Approach to Determining Genetic Ancestry  
 
Global estimates of African ancestry will be obtained with 1,536 ancestry -informative 
markers to infer population structure within our sample and assign individuals to ancestral populations using the program STRUCT URE (Pritchard 2000, Smith 2004, 
HapMap 2003, Hinds 2005). Global estimates of African ancestry will be compared between preferential treatment response groups.  
 We will identify whether whole- genome or global African ancestry is associated with 
preferential responses to LABA and  secondarily associated with a preferential response 
to ICS.  To make those determinations we will examine response pairs in which the only difference between groups is the drug of interest.  We will use response data from  both 
those <12 and >12 year of age.  In each age group we will examine the treatment pairs that vary with the drug of interest (e.g. in <12 y .o. for LABA -- 2x ICS vs. 2x ICS + LABA 
or for ICS —2x ICS vs. 5x ICS).  If more than one potential comparison for an age group 
exists we will choose the one in which the greatest preference for that drug is seen. In each case, those who “preferred” the treatment of interest will be compared to those who preferred the alternative plus those who showed no preference.  
 
Approach to Secondary and Exploratory Genetic Analyses:   
 We will assess the role of genetic variation on the preferential response to ICS or LABA 
therapy using an analysis of global genetic ancestry, candidate gene analyses, and unbiased genome- wide admixture mapping scanning to identify novel loci that 
determine therapeutic responses.  
 
We will perform a candidate gene and an unbiased genome- wide approach using 
admixture mapping scanning throughout the genome to identify specific genomic 
regions or loci where ancestry is associated with treatment response. The approach outlined (admixture mapping) is focused on local or regional estimates of ancestry 
rather than global ancestry . In contrast to an analysis of global African genetic ancestry , 
admixture mapping scanning has the potential to identify novel loci with rare or common variants that determine treatment response.  
 We will also assess differential response based on a case/control admixture mapping 
analysis. For this analysis, we define cases as those who respond best to ICS (versus 
those who do not) and those that respond best to LABA combination therapy (versus those who do not). We will use admixture mapping to identify chromosomal regions that may harbor common and rare genetic predictors of treatment response  which will be 
represented by admixture mapping peaks  (Figure 4). We will then investigate individual 
genes and variants within these regions.  
 Next, w e will try  to identify genomic areas associated with preferential responses to 
LABA and  secondarily  those associated with a preferential response to ICS.  To make 
those determinations we will also examine response pairs in which the only difference 
between groups is the drug of interest.  We will use response data from both those <12 
 59        and >12 year of age.  In each age group we will examine the treatment pairs that vary 
with the drug of interest (e.g. in <12 yo for LABA -- 2x ICS vs. 2x ICS + LABA or for 
ICS—2x ICS vs. 5x ICS).  If more than one potential comparison for an age group exists 
we wil l choose the one in which the greatest preference for that drug is seen. In each 
case, those who “preferred” the treatment of interest will be compared to those who 
preferred the alternative plus those who showed no preference.  
 The statistical analyses re quired for admixture- based genetic approaches are primarily 
based on a Markov Chain Carlo- based methodology which can be performed with 
different programs or methods, including the STRUCTURE program, Local Ancestry in 
adMixed Populations (LAMP) method, the ADMIXTURE program, and ANCESTRYMAP (Pritchard 2000, 
Patterson 2004, Alexander 2009, Sankararaman 2008). Based on the Wake Forest site’s established experience in admixture mapping studies, STRUCTURE will b e 
the program primarily used to determine both 
global estimates of 
ancestry and ANCESTRYMAP will be used to determine local estimates of ancestry in the BARD  cohort.  
 Since we plan to use the OmniExpress Beadchip platform, we will have whole exome coverage that includes 742,000 common and rare genetic variants for detailed regional admixture- based methods. Genotyping data from this platform will be used for classic 
case- control candidate gene analyses of loci identified with admixture mapping 
scanning or pre- selected candidate genes of interest.  
 SNP’s fr om our exome sequencing project consisting of 191 Black s in the NHLBI 
Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) and the NHLBI exome sequencing project will complement data from admixture mapping scanning and the OmniExpress Beadchip platform. The use of this a dditional sequencing data is crucial because 
important variants identified with admixture mapping might be in linkage disequilibrium with other potentially causative common or rare variants.  
 Local or regional estimates of ancestry will be obtained with 1,536 ancestry -informative 
markers sufficient for genome -wide coverage based on data sets of ancestry 
informative SNP’s using ANCESTRYMAP  (Smith 2004, HapMap 2003, Hinds 2005).    
Genomic regions where ancestry has a statistically significant effect on preferential treatment response will be represented by admixture mapping peaks where an 

 60        increased number of SNP’s from the OmniExpress Beadchip genotyping platform will be 
analyzed for more detailed admixture mapping to identify rare and common variants in 
novel candidate genes (Figure 4). Statistical significance will be set at a 2- tailed p- value 
of < 10-5 based on a conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. 
Although we will use a small subset of ancestry -informative markers to minimize the 
number of comparisons in the analysis, this platform does provide the option of performing more detailed genome- wide admixture mapping (Torgerson 2012)  
 Exploratory Analyses :  In the case of our investigation of effect of genetic ancestry on 
specific genomic regions, in order to decrease the issue of multiple testing, we will analyze pre- selected candidate genes specific to corticosteroid and beta agonist 
response based on prior  studies and those that encode for the glucocorticoid and β2 
adrenergic receptor pathway.  They include ADRβ2 , adenyl cyclase type 9 ( ADCY9 ), 
corticotropin- releasing hormone ( CRHR1 ), heat shock organizing protein ( STIP1 ), and 
glucocorticoid- induced transcr ipt 1 ( GLCCI1 ). (Tantisira 2004, 2005, 2011; Israel 2004, 
Hawkins 2009). Genotyping data from these genes will be used to estimate local or regional Sub- Saharan African and European ancestry with ANCESTRYMAP. Classic 
candidate gene analyses will also be performed for all of these genes using global and regional ancestry as a covariate. Statistical significance will be set at a 2- tailed p- value 
of < 0.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons using a conservative Bonferroni correction.  
  Further Exploratory Analyses:  
 In an exploratory part of this aim, we will test for associations between estimated global African ancestry and each individual component of the composite endpoint based on treatment responses on measures of exacerbation frequency, asthma control days, and FEV
1 during each individual arm of the BARD  trial. 
 Also as exploratory, association tests for rare variants (MAF< 5%) will also be 
performed using statistical methods developed for handling of these variants, including Fisher’s exact test and collapsing variants within a gene.  
 
E. Power Calculations  
The initial target sample size for the BARD  trial was 494 participants (236 Black 
adults/adolescents, 258  Black children) .  It was revised to 544 participants (260 Black 
adults/adolescent, 284 Black children)  when preliminary estimates of the post -
randomization drop- out rate exceeded 20% .  Details are provided below for  the January 
2015 amendment  (increase)  made to the adult/adolescent sample size and the April 
2015 amendment (increase) made to the pediatric sample size. 
In September 2015, after accruing a significant amount of follow -up data for the 
adult/adolescent group, it appeared that the drop- out rate was in danger of exceeding 
30%. The targ et sample size for this group was increased further to 291, bringing the 
total sample size for the study to 575.  
 
 61        The AsthmaNet Steering Committee considers a 20% absolute difference (0.2) in the 
composite preference outcome between any two treatment regimens (that seen in the 
CARE Network BADGER trial and in the ACRN TALC trial) as evidence that one treatment regimen is superior to the other treatment regi men and thus to be 
recommended.  
 With respect to primary hypothesis #1 for adolescents/adults  (N=236) , a two -sided, 0.05 
significance level test that allows for as much as a 20% withdrawal rate, yields  98% 
statistical power if the difference between treatment regimen A and treatment regime n B 
with respect to the composite outcome of preference is 0.2 and the difference between 
treatment regimen C and treatment regimen D also is 0.2 (µ
1,AB = 0.20 and µ1,CD = 0.20) . 
There is 81% statistical power in the worst case scenario, which occurs if the difference 
between treatment regimen A and treatment regime B is 0.2 but the difference between 
treatment regimen C and treatment regime n D is 0 (µ1,AB = 0.20 and µ1,CD = 0) within the 
adolescents/adults  group.  There is 90% statistical power in the anticipated scenario, 
which occurs if the difference between treatment regimen A and treatment regimen B is 
0.2 and the difference between treatment regimen C and treatment regimen D is 0 .10 
(µ1,AB = 0.20 and µ1,CD = 0.10) within the adolescents/adults  group.  The following power 
curve illustrates the range of the statistical power as µ1,AB is fixed at 0.20 and µ1,CD 
ranges from –0.20 to +0.20.  
 
 
With respect to primary hypothesis #1 for children  (N=258) , a two -sided, 0.05 
significance level test that allows for as much as a 20% withdrawal rate, yields  90% 
statistical power if the difference between treatment regimen F and treatment regimen G  
with respect to the composite outcome of preference is 0.2 ( µ2,FG = 0.20 ). 
 
January 2015 Amendment to Adolescent/Adult Sample Size 

 62         
The original target sample size was 236 Black adolescent/adults  per the sample size 
calculations with assumptions described above. In January 2015 we became concerned 
that we may be underpowered for our primary analysis  in the adolescent/adult group, 
given a higher than expected number o f drop- outs early in the follow -up period. At that 
time, 12% of  participants (17/142) had dropped out during period 1. Of the participants 
who made it to period 2,  6% (5/82) had dropped out. Assuming slightly lower drop -out 
rates for periods 3 and 4, which could not be projected at that time, we estimated that 
the overall drop- out rate in this age group could be as high as 25%. Original sample 
size calculations  were based on a withdrawal rate of 20%.  To ensure that the primary 
analysis will have evaluable data from at least 189 participants to yield adequate power  
for the comparisons of interest , the AsthmaNet Steering Committee  requested an 
increase in the adult sample size to 260 randomized participants (an increase of 10% or 
24 participants).  The AsthmaNet DSMB approved this request during their meeting on January 23, 2015.  
 
September 2015 Amendment to Adolescent/Adult Sample Size 
 In September 2015, after monitoring the BARD drop- out rate over several months and 
accruing a significant amount of  follow -up data, we became concerned that the  actual  
drop- out rate in the older age group could exceed 30%. This was based on estimates of 
completion rates for periods one through four calculated at the time as: 0.88, 0.91 (of 
those who completed period 1) , 0.92 (of those who completed period 2) , and 0.93 (of 
those who completed period 3) , respectively.   These estimates yielded an overall drop-
out rate estimate of 32%. To protect the power of the primary analysis, the AsthmaNet 
Steering Committee requested an increase in the adult sample size to 291 randomized participants (a net increase of 22 participants over the 269 that were randomized at the time). A sample size of 291 will allow for up to 35% drop out without compromising statistical power. We felt th at we needed to commit to over -recruit ing at that time, in 
conjunction with implementing new approaches to increase retention, in order to bring in 
new participants while the recruitment window remained open within the study and Network timelines.  The Ast hmaNet DSMB approved our request during their meeting 
on September 10, 2015.  
 
April 2015 Amendment to Pediatric (Age 5- 11) Sample Size 
 The original target sample size was 258 Black children per the sample size calculations 
with assumptions described above. After observing a similar drop- out rate to that of  the 
adolescent/adult group and becoming aware of additional participants who appeared to  
be lost to follow -up, we requested an increase  in the pediatric  sample size to 284 
randomized participants (an increase of 10% or 26 participants).  This request was 
made in conjunction with planning timelines and resources to complete the AsthmaNet grant funding period.  Although recruitment in the pediatric group was slower than in the 
adolescent/adult group and it was difficult to estimate the proportion of participants who would complete the trial based on available data at the time, we wanted to ensure that 
we had earmarked sufficient resources t o complete  the stu dy successfully. The 
AsthmaNet DSMB approved this request during their meeting on April 10 , 2015.  
 
Sample Size for Genetics  Analysis  
 63         
Our primary hypothesis is that in Black asthmatics  those with a better response to 
LABAs will have a lower overall proportion of African ancestry . 
Secondarily, we hypothesize that those with a better response to ICS will have a higher 
overall proportion of African ancestry . 
On an exploratory basis, we hypothesize that the variability in response to the 
treatments will be related to a degree of African ancestry at specific genetic loci.  
Power Calculation: For our primary question, a sample size of 140 African Americans 
provides 90% statistical power with a 2- sided, 0.05 significance level test, to detect a 
difference of 0.2 in the response at the mean value of the regressor (the percentage of 
Black ancestry) vs. the mean + one standard deviation value of the regressor  (response 
to ICS or LABA as described above).   
 
As fewer genetic variants are required for admixture mapping than a typical genome-wide scan (~1,300 single nucleotide polymorphisms), P<10
-5 is accepted as “genome-
wide significant” instead of P<10-8. For this study of 4 94 African -Americans, assuming 
50% of the trial participants are ICS -superior vs. 50% non- ICS superior, we have 90% 
power to detect a relative of risk of 2.0 at the two- sided 10-5 significance level.  
Based on the Bailey et al. 2008 article (Bailey 2008),which studied the response to 
LABA in patients on ICS,  in which the primary outcome exacerbation rate was 0.45 per year for African- Americans treated with combination ICS and LABA and 0.53 per year 
for individuals treated with ICS alone (p=0.169; not significantly different), we estimate that approximately 50% of the trial participants will be ICS -superior vs. 50% non- ICS 
superior, according to the hierarchical preference system we are utilizing.   
 As an example of our specific “ allelic ” genetic analysis, the GLCCI1 steroid 
pharmacogenetic variant (rs37972) is expected to have the following minor allele 
frequencies (from hapmap.org): 45% in non- Hispanic whites and 14% in Africans with 
29% in African- Americans.  For an additive genetic model with a minor allele frequency 
of 20% and a sample size of 494 , we have 90% power to detect a relative risk of 1.5 
and with a minor allele frequency of 30%, we have 90% power to detect a relative risk of 1.4 for a two-sided test with a type I error rate of 0.05.  
   
 64        F. Timeline  
We will randomize 575 total Black subjects , 291 adults/adolescents, and 284 children 
(age 5-11). A ll 18 AsthmaNet  centers , both adult and pediatric ( 5 years and older) , will 
be recruiting approximately 32 Black subjects each.  
It is expected to take 24 months to randomize 291 adults/adolescents ( 32.3 participants 
for each of the nine AsthmaNet adult center s or 1.35 randomized participants per center 
per month).  It is expected to take 24 months to randomize 284 children (32 participants 
for each of the nine pediatric AsthmaNet center s or 1.31  participants per center per 
month).  
Recognizing that some centers are underrepresented by Blacks  and others have 
greater access to this population, no restrictions will be set on the maximum number of subjects that  can be randomized at a particular center. The total time from study 
initiation to last subject completed will include 2 years of recruitment and 1. 3 years for 
study participation for a total of 3.3 years . 
G. Anticipated Results 
 Anticipated Results and Impac t in Adults/Adolescents : Based on the published literature 
in self -identified Blacks and data presented above, we expect that we will not be able to 
demonstrate that LABA added to lower dose ICS (1x) will be more effective than 
increased ICS dose (2.5x) (Comparison 1 - Treatment Regimen A versus Treatment 
Regimen B) . As a reminder the regimens are as follows:  
Run In= 1.0xICS  
A = 1.0×ICS/LABA  
B = 2.5×ICS 
C = 2.5×ICS/LABA  
D = 5.0×ICS 
In contrast, we anticipate that LABA added to higher dose ICS (2.5x ICS) may be 
superior to further increasing the ICS dose (5x) (Comparison 2 - Treatment Regimen C 
versus Treatment Regimen D) .  
There are three main major patterns of outcome that are possible and/or likely:  
# 1) That we cannot demonstrate ICS/LABA superiority in Comparison 1 but we 
can in Comparison 2;  
#2) That we cannot demonstrate superiority in Comparison 1 and 2;  
#3) That we demonstrate superiority in Comparison 1 and 2.   
We discuss the implications of each as follows:  #1)  If we show that adding 
LABA at  lower dose ICS is not more effective than increasing the dose of ICS but is 
superior at the higher dose of ICS, our results will have suggested that contrary to current guidelines, in Blacks, ICS should be increased before addition of a LABA.  They would suggest that once this has been done, adding a LABA would provide additional 
clinical benefit for the outcomes we measure. It would also suggest that Blacks require higher doses of ICS for LABA to be effective. Our in vitro studies regarding CS sensitivity  will be informative in this regard.  #2) If adding LABA to ICS at either dose of 
 65        ICS is not superior to increased ICS, we will have suggested that Blacks differ from the 
known results in Caucasians at both lower and higher doses of ICS and that the 
differ ence in response to LABA as compared to Caucasians is not due to a requirement 
for more ICS before LABAs can be effective in Blacks. #3) We will have disproved our hypothesis and laid to rest the issue of whether Blacks experience less benefit than Caucasi ans when treated with LABA.    
Outcomes #1 and #2 in Blacks will weigh heavily on reconsideration of the national treatment recommendations for Blacks. This is important in view of the disproportionate asthma burden borne by Blacks and, in the case of LABAs, the continued concern about the potential risk to Blacks from regimens containing a LABA.  
Anticipated Results and Impact  in Pediatric Population:  In the pediatric population, we 
will not be able to conduct the same analysis as the adult study except f or the 
comparisons of ICS treatment arms. As a reminder the treatment regimens are shown as follows:  
Run In :  1.0xICS  
E = 2.0×ICS 
F = 2.0×ICS/LABA 
G = 5.0×ICS 
H = 5.0×ICS/LABA. 
 
Due to previous reports of steroid insensitivity in the Black population reported by 
Federico et al (2005), we anticipate that there will be an incremental increase in response with increasing dose of ICS.  Therefore, we should see a higher differential response with Treatment G as compared to Treatment E. This may not be the case if 
the maximal response is achieved with Treatment E.  
Based on analysis of the entire population of the BADGER study (Lemanske 2010), one might anticipate that the response to IC S/LABA step -up would be greater than to 
increased ICS. However, in the Black subpopulation, the differential response in the composite outcome for these two treatments was comparable and greater than low dose ICS step- up therapy.  
We have two opportunities to determine whether LABA when added to ICS increases the likelihood of a more favorable response when combined with medium and high doses of ICS.  Therefore, we will look to compare differential response in Treatment F over Treatment E and Treatment H over Treatment G.  
In addition, we can examine the direct comparison of increasing the dose of ICS vs. adding the LABA by analyzing Treatments F vs. G.  Based on the studies by Wechsler 
et al, (2011) derived from the Asthma Clinical Research Network and the BADGER data, we anticipate that adding LABA to ICS in this population will not be shown to be 
favored by more Black children than increasing the dose of ICS.  Such a result would suggest that the treatment guidelines for Blacks need to be modified to focus on increased ICS over adding LABA therapy.  This will be especially true, if our data concerning HPA axis suppression shows only a minority of subjects experience such an effect.   
Unfortunately, we will not be able to compare the results of adding LABA to low dose 
 66        ICS compared to medium dose ICS as conducted in the adult study due to availability of 
the required formulations. Our study  drug provider , GlaxoSmithKline , and many 
investigators in the AsthmaNet Pediatric Investigator group, are reticent to support a 
treatment arm that would utilize ICS and LABA in two separate devices since this would be contrary to FDA guidance on the use of these two medications. The FDA guidance strongly recommends the combination of ICS/LABA in a single delivery device.  Despite this compromise in study design, we still feel that the questions regarding ICS dose-response and the impact of LABA when added to ICS therapy will be answered and provide important information for the national asthma guidelines in managing asthma in Black children between the ages of 5 to 11 years.  
Anticipated Results - Pediatric vs. Non- Pediatric Population:  We expect to see similar 
result s in children and adolescents/adults.  We will have 98% power to detect whether a 
0.2 preference difference within each comparison between adults and children is significant.  We will have significant power to detect differences between adolescent/adults and children in their responses to each treatment. This will be one of the first times such a comparison can be made and will allow us to understand whether the drugs differ in their effectiveness as measured by our outcome between these age groups.  
Anticipated Results - Genetic Analysis:  Our analysis regarding genetic ancestry will 
allow us to examine whether degrees of genetic African ancestry affect the response to 
LABA or ICS.  If, as we suspect, the degree of genetic African ancestry is associated 
with the preference for one treatment escalation over the other, we anticipate that such testing would eventually be used to identify and guide treatment decision for individual patients.  Since, as we note, genetic admixture is increasing and self -reported labeling 
may become less accurate, the importance of such a tool will increase.    Since the cost 
of such genetic profiling is falling rapidly, i f confirmed, such profiling would be used to 
guide treatment escalation in such populations.   
Global ancestry and loci -specific admixture approaches complement each other. Since 
genetic association studies have already shown pharmacogenetic effects for both steroids and B2 agonists, we expect our exploratory efforts to identify specific loci that associate with differential pharmacologic responses to bear fruit.  This is especially true given the increase in power from using admixture– based analytical approaches. Thus, 
there are several outcomes that may be observed. First, a significant effect may be 
observed for only global ancestry which would indicate that there are multiple genes involved, each with a small effect. Second, global ancestry analysis may not be 
significant but through admixture mapping, we may identify gene(s) due to local ancestry with a stronger effect demonstrating that there are a limited number of important genes affecting drug response. Therefore, we expect to identify genes that regulate response to corticosteroids or B 2 agonists that are differentially important in 
those with more or less African ancestry. This is an important step in personalized medicine and individualized therapies in moderate to severe asthma for individuals of mixed African/White ancestry.  
It is possible that neither the global ancestry nor the locus specific approaches associate with differential pharmacologic responses.  This would suggest that DNA sequence modifications may not be the source of this variation and that other post -
sequence event, such as epigenetic modifications, may be determinative.   
 
 67        H. Exploratory Analyses  
 
Below we outline additional exploratory analyses we wish to undertake.   
 
a) Analyses of baseline phenotype as a predictor of treatment  response  in Blacks : 
This trial o ffers a unique opportunity to assess biomarkers that may serve as 
predictors of response to each treatment in Black individuals with asthma across the ages. Indeed, there is evidence that there are differences in biomarkers of asthma severity among Blacks (Gamble 2011). We will thus take advantage of this study’s large patient population of Black adults/adolescents and children to take the opportunity to  collect blood and sputum samples (in those 12 and older). We are planning to perform the following studies that will allow us to do predictive biomarker analyses: i) Induced 
sputum for differential and supernatant  (in those 12 years of age and older)  ii) CBC with 
differential  iii) Blood for future exploratory cytokine/biomarker  and genetic analyses  (as 
above)  iv) IgE and in vitro allergy testing. These samples will be collected and 
processed (or stored for future analysis) to assess whether any may predict responsiveness to a given therapy. ( See also: XVI I.  Phenotyping and special study 
techniques section below .) 
 
While some blood/serum will be stored for study of biomarkers in the future (e.g. 
IL-5 levels and periostin levels and others to be determined in the future as our 
knowledge base expands), blood and sputum eosinophil count will be measured, and analyzed in an exploratory manner, to examine the relationship between potential biomarkers in the blood and sputum and the differential response to drugs in Blacks across the ages.   In particular, the AsthmaNet is interested in the ability of sputum 
eosinophils to pr edict those who would respond preferentially to ICS vs. a beta-
agonist.   This interest stems from data compiled from ACRN studies (Deykin, 2005) that 
suggested that sputum eosinophils counts could accurately identify those patients that require ICS for continued control of their asthma.   A recent unpublished analysis of 
sputum eosinophils across the ACRN studies suggests that sputum eosinophils (in patients not on ICS ) could identify those patients that have a response to ICS in groups 
of patients who have similar responses to beta- agonists.   Since our group will be on 
ICS, in an exploratory manner, we will investigate whether sputum eosinophil counts  in 
patients currently receiving ICS therapy also associate with corticosteroid responsiveness across the ages in Blacks.   Of note, due to concerns about the ability of 
younger children to effectively perform sputum induction, this procedure will only be done in those aged 12 and older.  
 
b)  Analyses of multidimensional clinical phenotypes as predictors of treatm ent, 
by race (cluster analysis) :  
 Clinical phenotypes based on multidimensional composites of clinical characteristics and lung function parameters  have recently been described in the Severe Asthma 
Research Program (SARP) cohort (Moore 2010). This cohort includes asthma subjects of all disease severity and thus, is ideal to explore novel disease phenotypes. Using an unsupervised hierarchal agglomerative cluster analysis of subjects >=12 years of age, five clinical phenotypes were identified that ranged from milder to more severe asthma. The majority of mild to moderate asthma subjects were present in two clusters (1 and 2). These clusters include 60% of the SARP cohort and are racially diverse (30% self-
 68        identified Blacks) with elevated measures of atopy and preserved lung function. 40% of 
the subjects in these clusters reported current use of low to medium doses of inhaled 
corticosteroids and 40% report concurrent use of LABAs, yet 30% had sought urgent evaluation for an asthma exacerbation in the past year (ED visit, unscheduled MD visit, 
need for oral steroids) indicative of poor asthma control. Thus, these subjects would be representative of the subjects to be studied in the proposed protocol.  
 Preliminary analysis of differences between White and Black subjects within clusters 1 or 2 (unpublished data, Moore) shows more atopy, lower quality of life scores (by Juniper AQLQ) and more health care utilization in the self - identified Black subjects 
despite similar baseline lung function. The frequency of reported LABA use was lower in Blacks subjects in cluster 1, while Blacks and Whites in cluster 2 had similar LABA use. Comparison of Black and White subjects in the more severe clusters (4, 5) show less disparity between these racial groups, suggesting that self -identified race may be more 
important in mild -moderate asthma than more severe disease. The disparity in reported 
LABA use in Blacks as compared to Whites, particularly in cluster 1, raises the question of a possible racial difference in drug efficacy, drug adverse effect, pharmacogenetic or pharmacoeconomic interactions.  
  
The SARP algorithm by which one assigns subjects to clinical cluster phenotypes has 
been refined to include a smaller group of variables identified as most important by discriminant analysis. These variables include age of onset, asthma duration, sex, BMI, race, baseline and maximal lung function and medication use (steroid dose, other controllers). For the proposed exploratory analysis, study subjects would be assigned to a cluster phenotype using the refined algorithm; this would require no additional testing 
other than what is in the current protocol. This approach will allow assessment of the ability of a multidimensional, MD -friendly composite clinical phenotype to predict 
response to treatments in general, in this Black asthmatic population.  
Participants will also be extensively phenotyped during screening and during post -
randomization visits to assess predictors of response to each treatment; this will be one of the largest phenotypic assessments in Black asthmatics.  Phenotyping includes, but is not limited to, spirometry, airway hyperresponsiveness if FEV
1 > 50% predicted, 
maximum bronchodilator response after 4 puffs albuterol, IgE and presence of atopy; extensive questionnaires  to capture full patient history, medication history, family 
history, smoking history, exposures, atopic status, presence of co- morbid conditions, 
and number and severity of exacerbations. Sputum supernatant, serum, plasma and DNA will also be collected and stored for future predictor analysis  as detailed above) . 
 
c) Analyses of predictors of responsiveness to different therapies by race based 
on environmental characterization:   
In all subjects, we will characterize the subjects’ home environment to assess whether any environmental parameters can predict a differential responsiveness across individuals of all ages. For example we will examine the following: smoking exposure  
(by history and through cotinine levels), allergen exposure, perceived stress (Cohen 
1983)  and socioeconomic status . These parameters all reflect a subject’s home 
environment and smoking exposure and may relate to responsiveness to a specific therapy.  An ancilla ry protocol based on Geographic Information Systems analysis 
(GIS) -based information is also planned.  
 
 69        d) Pharmacoeconomic analyses 
We will do pharmacoeconomic analyses similar to what  we performed for the PACT 
study, conducted by the CARE Network  (Wang 2011) .  
 
Cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) compares the effectiveness of different treatments 
relative to their costs. For example, suppose that increased ICS  add-on has better 
effectiveness than LABA add- on; if it also has lower cost than LABA add- on, then ICS 
add-on is said to dominate LABA add- on. However, if treatment with ICS add-on is not 
the dominant strategy, e.g., ICS add-on has better effectiveness and higher cost than 
LABA add -on, then the choice decision can be made by comparing a decision maker’s  
willingness to pay (WTP) for one unit of effect using the incremental cost -effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). ICER measures the additional cost for one additional unit of effect, i.e., ICER=Δcost/Δeffect, where Δ stands for difference between the two candidate therapies. The units for the ‘effect’ term reflect the outcome of interest, for example, 
ACD or number of exacerbations.   If WTP is greater than ICER, then one is willing to 
pay the additional cost of LABA  add-on in order to gain its additional effect, and LABA 
add-on is cost -effective.   
 
Both direct costs from a third- party payer’s perspective and societal costs from a 
societal perspective will be assessed. Payer costs will be standardized across sites using microcosting methods including unit costs for rescue medications, hospitalizations, emergency department visits and unscheduled visit physician costs.  Societal costs will be the value of lost productivity from missed school or work 
estimated by the Human Capital approach. The drug costs will be calculated as the average wholesale prices from the Drug Topics Red Book.    Deterministic models will 
be used to estimate the ICER for the various treatment comparison and effectiveness outcome combinations.   A probabilistic approach to account for sampling uncer tainty will 
be conducted by nonparametric bootstrap. The 95% confidence interval for an estimate of the ICER will be defined by the 2.5% percentile through the 97.5% percentile of the corresponding values from all bootstrapped samples.   
 
  
 70        XIV. DRUG SUPPLIES  
During the run- in phase, participants will be given low dose inhaled corticosteroids 
(1xICS).  Medications will consist of open- label inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone 
propionate 100 mcg BID (i.e., Flovent Diskus, GlaxoSmithKline) for individuals 12 
years  old and above and fluticasone propionate 50 mcg BID  (Flovent Diskus®, 
GlaxoSmithKline) for children age 5-11.  
Individuals requiring a 2 step step- down process to achieve the low dose will be put on 
2-2.5xICS for the first 2 weeks of the run- in order to assure that their asthma is stable 
prior to stepping them down to 1xICS. Individuals 12 years old and above who require 2 
step step -down therapy  will be given open- label fluticasone propionate 250 mcg BID 
(2.5xICS) (Flovent Diskus®, GlaxoSmithKline). Childr en aged 5- 11 who require 2 step 
step- down therapy will be given open- label fluticasone propionate 100 mcg BID  (2xICS)  
(Flovent Diskus®, GlaxoSmithKline).  
During the treatment periods, in adults  and adolescents,  we will use masked, double-
blind  Diskus® preparations of fluticasone propionate ICS monotherapy  (Flovent Diskus® 
250, 500 mcg)  and fluticasone/salmeterol ICS/LABA combination  medications  (Advair 
Diskus® 100/50, 250/50  mcg) . During the treatment periods, in children age 5- 11, we 
will use masked , double- blind  Diskus® preparations of fluticasone propionate ICS 
monotherapy  (Flovent Diskus® 100, 250 mcg)  and fluticasone/salmeterol  ICS/LABA 
combination medications  (Advair Diskus® 100/50, 250/50  mcg ). All run-in and treatment 
period ICS and ICS/LABA  medications will be supplied by GlaxoSmithKline.  
Individuals who experience an exacerbation near the end of a treatment period or who qualify as having had a treatment failure during a treatment period (see Section XX.A) will receive open- label 5xICS for 2- 3 weeks following their last dose of oral or parenteral 
corticosteroids, prior to starting the next double- blind treatment period. For individuals 
12 years old and above, treatment will be open- label fluticasone propionate 500 mcg 
BID. For children aged 5- 11, treatment will be open- label fluticasone propionate 250 
mcg BID.  
We will use albuterol MDI and prednisone (5 day course, see Section XX.E) for rescue.

XV. ADHERENCE AND MONITORING  
The following mechanisms will be employed to determine adherence and measure 
outcomes:  
1. The Spirotel® electronic peak flow meter/e- diary device will be used to measure 
peak expiratory flows (PEF) and will serve as a general adherence check (date and time are electronically recorded). Electronic measurements will be downloaded at each study visit and a compliance report will be reviewed with the 
participants. AsthmaNet coordinators will provide positive feedback to participants who demonstrate good adherence, and ongoing encouragement when warranted.  
2.  Medications: The AsthmaNet Network has explored various published methods of 
assessing adherence to asthma treatment, including pharmacy records, canister weights, self -report, and electronic devices attached to metered dose inhalers.  
No single adherence measure is currently deemed to provide complete accuracy.  Self-report accuracy is enhanced if the participant or parent is asked to report on 
medication use in the daily e- diary within the previous 24- hour period, rather than 
asked to provide a global characterization of adherence.  This approach will be 
empl oyed in BARD . In addition, Diskus
® counter information will be recorded 
from visit to visit.  
XVI. INHALATION TECHNIQUES   
To minimize the variability in the dose of both the ICS and LABA delivered to the lungs, the participant’s inhalation technique will be reviewed at each study visit.  Objective 
feedback will be given to each participant to improve performance.  
 
XVII.  PHENOTYPING AND SPECI AL STUDY TECHNIQUES  
Participants will be extensively phenotyped during screening and during the post -
rando mization visits to assess predictors of response to each treatment . Phenotyping 
includes , but is not limited to, spirometry, airway hyperresponsiveness (if participant 
 72        meets safety requirements for methacholine challenge) , bronchodilator response after 4 
puffs albuterol , extensive questionnaires to capture full participant  history, medication 
history, family history, smoking history, exposures, atopic status, presence of co- morbid 
conditions, and number and severity of exacerbations. Urine, sputum supernata nt, 
serum, plasma and DNA will also be collected and will be stored for future predictor 
analysis  (see above analyses) . 
1. Bronchodilator reversibility – The bronchodilator reversibility procedure is 
detailed in the AsthmaNet Spirometry Manual of Operations and will include 4 
puffs of albuterol.  
 
2. Methacholine bronchoprovocation – The methacholine bronchoprovocation  
procedure is detailed in the AsthmaNet Methacholine Challenge Manual of 
Operations.  
 3. Immuno CAP – ImmunoCAP  testing of standard al lergens will be performed at 
Visit 1  including at a minimum:  rat, grass mix, tree mix, weed mix, mite mix, 
cockroach mix, mouse, penicillium/alternaria/aspergillus/cladosporium (mold mix), cat, dog.  
 4. Genetics analysis ( See Section XIII.D )– Blood will b e obtained at the study site 
from the participant and shipped to the AsthmaNet Genetics Lab in Tucson, AZ for DNA extraction and storage according to AsthmaN et procedures . DNA will be 
prepared and shipped the laboratory of Dr. Eugene Bleecker at the Wake F orest 
site for study analysis . This will be limited to genetics analysis related to drug 
response, drug metabolism, allergy, asthma and inflammation.  In addition, w e will 
use genetic ancestry to conduct secondary analyses of participant  responses to 
medications based on genetic ancestry.  Although ancestry may be estimated using Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs), it is becoming more effective to perform a GWAS and use the SNP data for calculating % African versus % European Caucasian.  
Thus, using GWAS data and/or AIMs, analyses will be performed in three areas: 1) Percent predicted lung function will be recalculated using estimates of individual geographical ancestry (Kumar et al, NEJM 2010) and lung function analyses (that are already specified) will be repeated, 2) Individual estimates of 
geographical ancestry will be calculated for use as a covariate in analyses of the clinical endpoints, 3) local ancestry for the chromosomal region on 5q surrounding ADRB2 will be calculated for use as a covariate in analyses of the clinical endpoints. With GWAS data available on this African- American cohort, 
we will examine quantitative as well as qualitative response parameters . Specific 
biologic pathways related to pharmacogenetics of the two therapies (beta 
agonists, and corticosteroids) will be evaluated to determine whether pharmacologic responses in this protocol are associated with genetic variation.  
These results can be compared to the GWAS analyses being performed in the 
ACRN TALC and B ASALT studies to determine differences form non- Hispanic 
whites in an exploratory manner. Finally, specific phenotypes ( clusters) and 
genetic subgroups will be identified to determine their interaction with therapeutic responses in African- Americans.  
 
5. Blood, urine,  and sputum samples – Blood ( including serum) , urine,  and sputum  
will be collected and stored for future analyses of biomarkers in these specimens  
 73        that are considered directly relevant to asthma and allergies.   This will also 
provide a means to assess whether certain asthma and allergy genes have the 
potential of increasing or decreasing proteins in these compartments  to gain new 
insights into pathophysiologic mechani sms underlying these diseases.  For 
example, sputum eosinophils in those 12 and above will be measured, as these 
have been shown to predict asthma control in the context of inhaled 
corticosteroid use (Deykin 2005). Cotinine levels will also be measured to assess smoking exposure.   
 
Sputum induction.  Sputum induction is a relatively si mple, repeatable and 
noninvasive method of collecting airway secretions. Cellular and biochemical analyses of induced sputum samples collected from asthmatic and non- asthmatic 
subjects have revealed differences in markers of eosinophilic inflammation and bronchovascular permeability in an asthmatic population. Induced sputum will be 
collected at Visit 1 following inhalation of hypertonic saline according to the 
AsthmaNet Sputum Induction MOP. Sputum total and differential cell counts will 
be counted by a central reader at the San Francisco adult site.  Cell free 
supernatant and cell pellets will be frozen and stored for future analysis.  Sputum 
induction for asthma is increasingly used as a way to predict response to therapy and define individuals as eosinop hilic/noneosinophilic.  This is particularly 
important in this population. Each participant  will perform one sputum induction at 
baseline to assess whether sputum indices can predict response in Blacks. Of note, as sputum induction cannot  be done reliably in children down to age 5-6 , 
this procedure will be performed only in individuals at least  12 years of age.  
  
XVIII.  SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Assessment of systemic exposure/activity to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs)  
Due to the escalating doses of ICS to be used in this trial, along with limited data 
available on the dose- response relationship between escalating ICS dosing and HPA 
axis function in children and adults, and the use of high doses of ICS as defined by the NAEPP Guidelines, we will assess the potential for systemic effects on HPA axis function. We have chosen overnight urinary cortisol/creatinine (OUCC) as the measure of systemic exposure in all participants,  along with linear growth by stadiometry in 
childr en 5- 17 years of age. This choice resulted from  extensive review of the literature 
and consultation with David Allen MD, an endocrinologist at the University of Wisconsin who has written extensively about systemic effects of ICSs (Allen 2003, Allen 2004, Allen 2005, Allen 2007, Bernstein and Allen 2007), as well as being a consultant to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We feel the OUCC provides minimal invasiveness , particularly in children, and sufficient sensitivity for detecting systemic 
activity in adults and children. It is also more convenient than the 24 hour urine 
collection or overnight plasma cortisol sampling.  
Choice  of OUCC for HPA -axis effect.  Available measures of the hypothalamic -
pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis include the insulin tolerance test, metyrapone test, standard 
and low -dose cosyntropin stimulation, and measures of basal cortisol secretion 
 74        including morning cortisol concentration, 24-h our plasma area under the curve (AUC) 
cortisol concentration, 24- hour urinary free cortisol (UFC), OUCC, and salivary cortisol 
concentrations.  
The pros and cons of each of these tests for assessing systemic activity of ICSs have 
been extensively reviewed (Bernstein and Allen 2007, Kelly 2003, Krasner 1999, Oelkers 1996, Zollner 2007) but will be briefly discussed here to establish our selection rationale. While the insulin tolerance test and metyrapone test are considered the “gold standards” for assessing  clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency as they test the entire 
HPA axis, they require hospitalization and can cause significant adverse effects (Oelkers 1996, Krasner). Thus, the high dose (250 mcg) cosyntropin stimulation test 
has been used as the standard stimulation test for assessing HPA axis function secondary to systemic corticosteroid and ICS exposure by the FDA and the medical community. Due to the supraphysiologic dose delivered, this test produces some false negatives and has been criticized for missing adrenal suppression (Oelkers 1996, Allen 
2007).  
Therefore, the low -dose (0.5 mcg/m
2 or 1 mcg) cosyntropin test has been developed. 
The low dose test has been shown to be a sensitive test for detecting low levels of 
adrenal suppression and correlates well with the insulin tolerance test, but it is not clear whether the increased sensitivity is picking up clinically relevant suppression that predicts adrenal insufficiency (Allen 2007, Kelly 2003, Zollner 2007). In addition, there are no normative data in children for this test and it requires careful dilution for 
preparing and intravenous access.  
The standard test for basal cortisol excretion (morning cortisol) has been shown to be 
insensitive to low levels of adrenal suppression with high variabil ity due to the diurnal 
variation of cortisol secretion (Krasner 1999, Oelkers 1996). Thus, the 24- hr AUC and 
24-hr UFC were developed to obviate the diurnal variation problem. The 24- hr UFC has 
demonstrated consistency with the low dose cosyntropin test for detecting low levels of adrenal function (Broide 1995). Both of these tests are highly sensitive to systemic corticosteroid exposure and allow dose- response comparisons within an ICS molecule 
as well as direct comparisons between various delivery devices  and/or ICS molecules 
(Martin 2002, Nielsen 2000). They have been recommended as a means of comparing relative bioavailability/systemic activity between various ICS preparations and the FDA accepts 24- hour UFC for this purpose (Allen 2007, Zollner 2007). However, both 24- hr 
collections require overnight hospitalizations to permit observed collections and would, therefore, increase the expense and patient burden in large clinical trials. Also, they do not project clinical risk for meaningful adverse effects on bone density, linear growth 
and cataracts.  
Choice of OUCC for systemic activity.  Two studies suggest that OUCC is as 
sensitive as 24- hr AUC and 24- hr UFC (McIntyre 1995, Wilson and Lipworth 
1999;54:20) . The initial study compared OUCC to 24- hr UFC and AM serum cortisol in 
12 healthy volunteers given 800 and 2000 mcg/day of BDP by MDI; however, there was 
a lot of scatter to both measures. Wilson and Lipworth then looked at 12 moderately severe asthmatics in a crossover study comparing 24- hr AUC to OUCC an d 24- hr UFC 
for triamcinolone acetonide 1600 mcg/day and FP 1760 mcg/day by CFC -MDI. Although 
the 24- UFC looked a little more sensitive, it actually had a wider confidence interval. 
The ACRN used this data to perform 24- hr AUC, 24 -hr UFC and OUCC with abou t 23-
 75        25 patients/drug tested in a parallel escalating dose- response and only found consistent 
dose- response with the 24- hr AUC and more inconsistent results with 24- UFC and 
OUCC due to the lesser variability of the former (Martin 2002). However, others hav e 
found it sufficiently sensitive to detect dose- response differences between 1000 and 
2000 mcg/day of FP by DPI (Fardon 2004).  Raissy and colleagues (2006) 
demonstrated that correcting UFC for creatinine provided an index that is independent 
of age and weight in healthy children (N=64) and children with mild asthma (N=36) 6- 16 
years old. The clinical pharmacology group from the University of Dundee has used OUCC in excess of 20 trials over the past 12 years that have compared different ICS molecules and delivery devices and have demonstrated the ability of OUCC to differentiate between potency and devices when the ICSs are delivered in high doses 
(Lipworth 1999, Lipworth 2001).  
Expected findings:  As we are proposing to use FP and the combination by dry -powder 
inhalers (DPIs) in maximum doses of 1000 mcg/day in adolescents and adults and 500 
mcg/day in children, 5 to 11 years , we expect to see that some patients (approximately 
20-30%) will have mild HPA -axis suppression, on the average of a 5 -20% decrease in 
OUCC. The ACRN study with FP -DPI (via Diskhaler) showed only 10% suppression of 
24 hr cortisol AUC at 800 mcg/day with a median dose and 95% confidence interval of 
445 mcg/day (0- 918 mcg/day) (Martin 2002). The GOAL study (Bateman 2004) using 
FP-DPI up to  1000 mcg/day for as little as 12 weeks and as much as 40 weeks found 
no significant suppression of OUCC in 166 patients in the high dose range. At the end of the study there were 15 patients who had values below the lower limit of normal, but 
there were also 12 patients who had values below the normal range at baseline who 
corrected to normal after receiving FP.  
In a randomized parallel trial comparing the therapeutic index of budesonide and FP 
DPIs at medium to high doses in 66 patients with asthma, 1000  mcg/day for 2 weeks of 
FP produced a 4% decline in 24- hr UFC compared to baseline and a 30% decline at 
2000 mcg/day for 2 weeks (Nielsen and Dahl 2000).  In 21 adult patients comparing 
mometasone furoate and FP by DPIs, 1000 mcg/day for 2 weeks FP produced a 28% 
reduction in OUCC compared to a 45% reduction for 2000 mcg/day for 2 weeks (Fardon 
2004).   
In children, a study of fifty -five 6 -10 year -olds with asthma treated with FP -DPI 500  and 
1000 mcg/day for 2 months each demonstrated a 11% reduction of 24- hr UFC with the 
500 mcg/day dose and 24% reduction with 1000 mcg/day (Visser 2004). Kannisto 
(2000) reported that only 5 of 30 5- 14 year olds had mild suppression by low dose 
cosyntropin stimulation receiving a dose of FP -DPI 500 mcg/day. Verona (2003), in an 
open label 52 week study of 528 4- 11 year olds given FP -DPI at doses of 200 and 400 
mcg/day, reported unchanged to slightly increased OUCC at 16 and 52 weeks at the 
400 mcg/day dose.  
Finally, GSK is performing the FDA mandated LABA safety studies (available at clinicaltrials.gov) with doses of FP up to 500 mcg/day in 6000 5- 11 year old children and 
dose up to 1000 mcg/day in 11,000 adult subjects (the FDA has reviewed the studies). Interestingly, function of the HPA axis is not being measured in these trials due to the fact that FDA review of the existing data was not compelling enough for this safety data 
to be mandated in the trials.  
 76        As a result of both our review and FDA opinion of these data, we feel there is sufficient 
data to support that the proposed low doses of ICS during the run- in period for both 
children and adults will not produce any clinically significant effects on HPA axis 
function and, moreover, that these doses will not interfere with our ability to detect significant effects with the high-dose regimens that will be used following randomization 
(Martin 2002, Fardon 2004, Kannisto 2000, Lipworth 2001, Nielsen 2000, Masoli 2004, 
Verona 2003, Visser 2004).  
Linear growth will be used in children 5- 17 as an additional measure of systemic act ivity 
as it is provides additional insight regarding systemic effects of ICS that may not be 
seen with an evaluation of the HPA axis alone and occurs at lower doses of ICSs than those required to produce HPA -axis suppression (Ferguson 2007, Kelly 2003, CAM P 
2000, Visser 2004). As with the HPA -axis suppression data, there exists ample 
evidence that the 100 mcg/day run- in dose in children 5 to 11 years, and 200 mcg/day 
in adolescents, will not have an effect on growth velocity (Allen 1998, Ferguson 2007, 
Price 1997, Visser 2004).     
 
XIX. RISK/BENEFITS IN ADULTS/CHILDREN  
Although both adults and children enrolled into this protocol will need to demonstrate 
lack of control at the time of randomization, all will receive some form of adjunctive therapy once they enter the treatment phase of the trial (i.e. no participant  will receive 
either placebo or experimental therapy that has not yet been proven to be efficacious in asthma) and all participants  will be closely monitored throughout.  
In a previously published BADGER trial (Lemanske), both increasing the dose of ICS and keeping the dose the same and adding LABA were found to produce a differential 
treatment response in favor of that form of step- up in children . LABA step -up was found 
to be significantly more frequent as being the best choice. Thus, in at least two of the four treatment phases of this trial, children are likely to receive a form of therapy that will 
produce the best differential treatment response using a similar composite outcome 
measure to the one that was used in the BADGER trial.  
In adults, all four add-on options have shown some efficacy. Increas ing dose of ICS is 
currently the FDA’s recommended add- on therapy. However, as outlined in the 
background, increasing ICS dose appears to be less effective than adding LABA (TALC, Peters 2010). Nonetheless, there are potential risks of these therapies as well, and it has been advocated that quadrupling corticosteroid dose is more effective than doubling ICS dosing in maintaining asthma control (Pauwels 1997, Oborne 2009). Whether these therapies are equally effective in Blacks remains unclear and remains one of the major goals of this study. In either circumstance, individuals  who participate in this trial will be 
closely monitored and will be treated for worsening asthma should that occur.  
 
    
 77        A. Medication Risks:  
 
a.) LABA Risks  
The proposed study is a comparison of the effect of  adding  a long -acting beta- agonist 
(LABA) to  the effect of  increasing the dose of ICS in patients with asthma. There 
remains some controversy surrounding the use of LABA in the treatment of asthma. The 
SMART study suggested that there may be a risk of life threatening events in patients treated with salmeterol, particularly in Blacks (Nelson, 2006). Nonetheless, treatment with a LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid continues to be an accepted part of treatment for asthma of moderate severity. Newly revised national asthma treatment guidelines 
continue to approve and advocate for this treatment in patients not well controlled on single agent therapy (NAEPP, 2007). For the majority of patients, the decision to use a LABA for treatment will have already been made by the treating physician and thus 
participation will not result in patient exposure to a LABA for the sake of the study. In addition, the SMART study suggested that the risk of LABA treatment might be diminished by the concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids. All patients in this study will be receiving concomitant inhaled corticosteroids and we will reinforce the importance of the use of both agents.  
 The SMART study (Nelson 2006)  further suggested that using the LABA, salmeterol, 
was associated with a small increase in the risk of fatal and severe life- threatening 
asthma attacks (1 in 10,000). Although the SMART study did not find a statisti cally 
significant increase in the risk of these severe attacks when salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroids were used together, the study results could not exclude the possibility that an increase in severe attacks may occur even when salmeterol is used with an inhaled corticosteroid. No LABA will ever be taken alone in this study; it will be taken with an inhaled corticosteroid. Furthermore, in the SMART study, the patients did not do any home monitoring and did not have any return visits to the clinic. In this study, 
asthma symptoms will be monitored daily in the e- diary , by visits to the clinic, as well as 
by calls to the performance site as needed should safety concerns arise. Medications 
and instructions will be given by study physicians or the patient’s  primary care 
physicians in case of asthma worsening, so that any attack may be treated promptly.  
 Other side effects of long -acting beta- agonists (LABA) include tremors, nervousness, 
rapid heart rate, headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, sweating, nausea, and less frequently, insomnia, chest pain, and irregular heartbeat. This study hopes to find out if taking this class of medication makes some people’s asthma worse because of race or because of one’s genetic makeup. In this study, the LABA is used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid, a controller medication. LABAs have also been used alone to treat asthma. Studies that we have performed, as well as those performed by others, suggest that LABAs should not be used without a controller medication, because, when used alone, they do not protect well against asthma attacks  (Lazarus 2001; Lemanske 
2001) . 
 b.) Inhaled Corticosteroids Risks  
All participants will have been on inhaled corticosteroids prior to enrollment in the study. 
Corticosteroid dosing  will be increased in most treatment regimens for this study. 
Nonetheless, participants  will be informed that when taken at high doses for extended 
periods, inhaled corticosteroids can produce hoarseness, sore throat, and thrush, as well as cause adrenal gland suppression, weight gain, bruising of the skin, and 
 78        diabetes. These side effects are not anticipated in our studies because of the doses we 
propose using and the duration of the study. Inhaled corticosteroids have also been 
associated with reduced growth velocity in children; height  will be monitored throughout  
the clinical trial, as will urine cortisol . 
 
B. Risks and Benefits of Study Procedures:  
 a) Venipuncture  
Blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture of an antecubital vein to determine blood counts, total and specific IgE, cotinine levels , and for DNA extraction for future 
genotyping studies and ancestry characterization.  
 Risks: The risks of venipuncture are minimal. The possible risks include bruising and/or 
infection at the site of the venipuncture and vasovagal episodes experienced by the blood donors. Pressure will be applied to the venipuncture site to prevent bruising. Aseptic technique will be used to prevent infection. Blood will be obtained while the donors are in a seated position and medical and nursing personnel will be available at the study sites to treat and manage vasovagal episodes.  
 Benefits: The DNA isolated for future genotyping studies will provide important insight into potential genetic modifiers of responses to each of the studied therapies. 
Measurement of IgE, allergen- specific IgE (Immuno CAP
®) and blood counts will allow 
for better participant characterization and an assessment of whether these factors can 
predict responsiveness to a given therapy . 
 The potential benefits justify the potential risks.  
 a) Pulmonary Function Testing (spirometry)  
Spirometry will be performed to determine the participants’ pulmonary function.  
 Risks: The risks of spirometry are minimal. The possible risks include precipitation of 
bronchospasm and light -headedness from repeated blowing attempts. Medical and 
nursing personnel and medications will be available at the study sites to treat and manage bronchospasm. Inhalation of a short -acting beta- 2 adrenergic agonist (such as 
albuterol) will be used to assess reversibility  at some visits . The possible risks of inhaled 
beta- 2 adrenergic agonists include tachycardia and hand tremors. These side effects 
are non- life threatening and are short -lived.  
 Benefits: Spirometry with assessment of reversibility to a short -acting beta- 2 adrenergic 
agonist will be used to determine if the participants meet the inclusion criteria for this study ; it will also serve as a secondary outcome for the study, as will FEV
1 measured 
longitudinally. FEV 1 measured through spirometry also provides part of the primary 
composite outcome variable.  
 The potential benefits justify the potential risks.  
 b) Methacholine Inhalation Challenge  
Methacholine challenge will be used to assess airway hyper -responsiveness.  
 79         
Risks: The major risk of methacholine challenge is the induction of severe 
bronchoconstriction. As a precaution, participants will not undergo methacholine challenge if their FEV
1 is less than  55% of predicted or 1.0 liter (adults) or  70% of 
predicted (children under 18 years). Medical and nursing personnel, medications and 
equipment will be available at the study sites to treat and manage any bronchoconstriction episodes.  
 Benefit s: There are no direct benefits to the participant. This procedure is considered 
necessary for the protocol due to the following reasons : First, for the participants who 
do not demonstrate a 12% improvement in FEV
1, a positive methacholine challenge 
would allow them to meet one of the inclusion criteria for this study. Second, the 
assessment at baseline will allow for participant characterization and an assessment of 
whether airway hyperresponsiveness can predict responsiveness to a given therapy . 
 The potential benefits justify the potential risks.  
 c) Induced Sputum  
Sputum will be induced with hypertonic saline to collect an airway sample and to assess for airway inflammation. As not all children younger than 12 years old can reliably perform induced sputum induction, this procedure will not be performed in individuals younger than 12 years of age.  Risks: Like any bronchoprovocation challenge, sputum induction can provoke bronchospasm and warrants close supervision during its performance.  
 Benefits: There are no direct benefits to the participant. This procedure will allow us to characterize baseline airway inflammatory status to help assess predictors of responsiveness to each of the therapies.  
 The potential benefits justify the potential  risks. 
 d) Urine collection  
Urine will be collected to assess overnight urine cortisol, to perform pregnancy tests at specified visits, and for future exploratory assessments of urine biomarkers . 
 Risks: There are no risks associated with urine collection.  
 Benefits: This test will be for cortisol measurement, pregnancy testing , and for 
assessment of urinary biomarkers that may help predict responsiveness to these therapies in different participants.  
 The potential benefits justify the potential risks.  
  
 80        XX. TREATMENT FAILURE, DRO P-OUT STATUS AND ASTHM A 
EXACERBATIONS  
 
A. Criteria for assigning treatment arm failure during any one of the four 
treatment periods  
 
1. Participant hospitalized due to asthma  
2. Participant requires 10 or more days of treatment with prednisone f or asthma 
exacerbation(s)  
3. Participant experiences two distinct asthma exacerbations  
 
If the participant experiences two distinct asthma exacerbations, or requires 10 or 
more days of treatment with prednisone for asthma exacerbation(s), or is 
hospitalized due to asthma during any treatment period, he/she will be considered a treatment failure and, after at least 14 days following the completion of oral or 
parenteral corticosteroids, he/she will enter into the next treatment period (window of 7 days will be permitted to complete next study visit). Finally, if the participant has his/her first oral or parenteral corticosteroid treatment for an exacerbation near the end of any treatment period, the start of the next treatment period cannot occur until at least 14 days have elapsed since the completion of that steroid treatment (window 
of 7 days will be permitted to complete next study visit). During the 14- 21 day waiting 
period prior to starting the next double- blind treatment period, the par ticipant will be 
given open- label 5xICS (500 mcg BID for ages 12 and up and 250 mcg BID for ages 
5-11). 
B. Criteria for assigning drop- out status at any point in the study  
 
1. Participant or parent of participant (for children) withdraws consent or child withdra ws assent  
2. Participant becomes pregnant  
3. Study physician determines that continuation in the study is not in the best interest of the participant  
4. Participant suffers hypoxic seizure due to asthma  
5. Participant undergoes intubation due to asthma 
6. Participant suffers serious  adverse event related to the use of a study medication  
7. Participant requires long -term systemic corticosteroids for an illness other than 
asthma 
 
Participants meeting any of the above criteria will be seen for an exit visit and withdrawn from the study immediately . They will be referred to their primary care 
physician for follow -up care.  
C. Criteria for assigning  treatment period drop- out status during any of the 
periods  
If the study physician determines that continuation on the current treatment is not in the best interest of the participant,  for any reason other than poor asthma control,  but that 
study termination is not warranted, the participant will be assigned treatment period drop- out status. Participants assigned treatment period drop- out status will stop taking 
 81        study medications immediately, will go back on run- in medication (ICS dose equivalent 
to fluticasone propionate 100-200 mcg/ day) and begin the next treatment period as 
soon as possible. If the participant is currently in the fourth treatment period, he/she will 
be terminated from the study in the same way as a participant assigned study drop- out 
status.  
D. Definition and m anagement of asthma exacerbations  
Definition  
In this study an asthma exacerbation will be defined according to the r ecommendation 
of the NIH Outcomes Workshop (Fuhlbrigge 2012 JACI 129:S34- 48) as a worsening of 
asthma requiring the use of a systemic corticosteroid18 to prevent a serious outcome. In 
accordance with the Expert Panel recommendations, data will be captured on the following exacerbation- related outcomes:  
1. All worsening asthma events in which systemic corticosteroids were initiated to prevent a serious outcome, including use of systemic corticosteroids in association with any form of healthcare provider encounter 
2. All asthma -specific emergency department or urgent care visits that involved 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids  
3. All asthma -specific hospitalizations that involved treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids  (also reported as a serious adverse event)  
4. All asthma- specific intensive care unit admissions or intubations  (also reported 
as a serious adverse event)  
5. All deaths (all cause and asthma -related; also reported as a serious adverse 
event ) 
For the purpose of this study, and to standardize our approach among AsthmaNet studies, two courses of systemic corticosteroids must be separated by at least one week to count as two exacerbations and to be documented as such.   
Management  
The approach to rescue medications will be based on the consensus report presented in the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Guidelines and structured according to the protocols successfully implemented in previous ACRN and CAMP trials. Each participant will be given specific guidelines for decision- making and institution of rescue 
management (action plan). Two medications, albuterol and/or oral prednisone, will be employed when increasing symptoms and/or fall in peak flow require treatment.  
Participants will be given an adequate supply of albuterol for use throughout the trial. At the conclusion of the first screening visit, they will be dispensed a 5- day course of 
prednisone as outlined in Section E below to keep at home for rescue use on the advice of a study physician.  For a severe acute asthma exacerbation, participants will be 
                                            
18 Given changes in common practice since the Outcomes Workshop paper was published in 2012, we will consider 
one- and two -dose treatments with dexamethasone as constituting treatment for an asthma exacerbation and will 
document and follow these events as such.  
 82        provided with medication according to the best medical judgment of the treating 
physician. The treatment approaches outlined below have been safely and effectively 
used in previous CARE (CLIC, PACT, and BADGER) and ACRN (LARGE and TALC) 
trials.  
 
Home care:  
The onset of an asthma exacerbation will be recognized by symptoms such as 
coughing, dyspnea, chest tightness and/or wheezing, or by a decrease in the participant’s PEF. Caretakers and participants will be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of an asthma exacerbation early and the significance of falls in their peak flow readings so that prompt rescue treatment may be instituted and morbidity decreased.  
Participants who experience symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chest tightness, wheeze, phlegm/mucus and/or PEF less than 80% of their reference value will initiate use of 
albuterol (2- 4 puffs) by MDI every 20 minutes for up to 1 hour , and then every 4 hours if 
necessary. If the participant cannot achieve a PEF of at least 80% of their reference value, or if symptoms persist after three treatments, the performance site should be 
contacted. If the participant’s peak flow reaches 80% of their reference value, but the participant requires albuterol every 4 hours for 24 hours in order to maintain a peak flow of at least 80% of the reference value, or if symptoms persist, the performance site  
should be contacted. At the time of performance site contact, a clinic visit may be 
necessary. The initiation of oral prednisone therapy will be based on specific guidelines  
and on physician discretion.  
If symptoms are severe, the participant has retractions, evidence of cyanosis based on saturations on room air of < 90% based on pulse oximetry, has evidence of increased work of breathing, shortness of breath and/or “air hunger”, and/or the PEF is less than 50% of reference value after 8 puffs of albuterol, the participant  must seek immediate 
medical care and should contact the performance site. 
Physician’s office or emergency room:  
In the primary physician’s office or emergency room, the participant with an acute asthma exacerbation will be treated according to usual medical care that may include nebulized albuterol or high dose MDI albuterol (6- 8 puffs every 20 minutes x three or 
more often , if needed). The dose of albuterol for the doctor -supervised situation is 0.10 
– 0.15 mg/kg up to 5 mg per treatment. Albuterol can be delivered by nebulizer driven 
with oxygen, and treatments will be given every 20 minutes for up to three treatments. If 
after three  treatments, the participant is not stable as described below, the physician 
may use additional albuterol treatments or other medications as is in his  or her best 
clinical judgment. The participant will be assessed for general level of activity, color, pulse rate, use of accessory  muscles and airflow obstruction determined by 
auscultation, and FEV
1 and/or PEF before and after each bronchodilator treatment.  
Measurement of oxygenation with a pulse oximeter may also be indicated for complete participant assessment during the acute ex acerbation. The following assessments will 
also be made.  
• If the participant has a favorable response to initial albuterol nebulizer 
 83        treatment (FEV 1 at least 80% predicted and/or  PEF at least 80% reference 
value), the participant will be observed for 1 hour  prior to being discharged 
home with instructions to continue albuterol every 4 hours , as needed, and to 
report any decline in PEF and/or symptom fluctuation promptly.  
• If the participant does not improve (FEV 1 less than 80% predicted or PEF less 
than 80% r eference value) after the initial albuterol nebulizer treatment, 
nebulized albuterol therapy will be continued for at least two more trials (for a 
total of three  times in 1 hour).  If the participant’s clinical symptoms are 
stabilized and FEV 1 or PEF is between 50- 80% of predicted or reference 
value, the participant will be discharged home to continue use of albuterol (2 
puffs every 4 hours) and to start a five- day course of oral prednisone.  
• If the participant’s FEV 1 is less than 50% of predicted or PEF is less than 50% 
of reference value after three treatments with nebulized albuterol in 1 hour, 
the physician may use his/her best medical judgment to treat the participant. Such clinical judgment may include the need for hospitalization and inpat ient 
monitoring.  
E. Prednisone courses  
Oral prednisone will be administered for the treatment of impending episodes of severe asthma when bronchodilator therapy is inadequate. The decision concerning the initiation or continuation of a course of oral prednisone will be at the physician’s discretion.  Prednisone should be prescribed if:  
 
• The participant uses more than 12 puffs of albuterol in 24 hours (excluding 
preventive use before exercise) and has an e- diary symptom code of 3 (i.e., 
symptom graded severe)  or PEF less than 70% of reference value before each 
albuterol use, or  
• The participant has symptom code of 3 (severe) for 48 hours or longer, or  
• PEF drops to less than 50% of reference value despite albuterol treatment  
For both adults and children, the recommended prednisone dose for acute 
exacerbations is 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg) as a single morning dose for three days followed by 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 30 mg) as a single morning dose for two days.   All administered doses will be rounded down to the nearest 5 mg in children/adolescents ( i.e., participants aged 17 or younger ).  
F. Characterization of Asthma Exacerbations  
 The AsthmaNet Investigators are interested in studying interventions for management of 
asthma exacerbations. To accomplish this, better tools and endpoints are required, and the Protocol Review Committee previously suggested that AsthmaNet trials might provide the opportunity to gather useful preliminary information on exacerbations, which was also a major theme of a recent NIH Outcomes Workshop (Fuhlbrigge 2012 JACI 129:S34- 48). Thus, as an exploratory outcome, we will evaluate the responsiveness of 
a range of endpoints to characterize the time- course (onset and resolution) and 
magnitude of morbidity associated with an exacerbation and the use of systemic 
 84        corticosteroids as part of the BARD  action plan. The assessments will be incorporated 
within the main BARD  protocol and visits, to minimize both participant and site burden .  
The Asthma Index:   The asthma 
index is a continuous variable 
that reflects the magnitude and the timing of changes in asthma control, with objective and subjective elements weighted similarly  (Sorkness 2008) . Data 
from 15 participants of the ACRN- BASALT trial having 
exacer bations are presented in 
the figure to the left, centered on 
the day (D0) of starting prednisone. This tool is a composite measure that 
assesses symptoms, rescue medication use, and lung function to advance the 
understanding of the components of these events, involving a 48- hour rolling calculation 
of an acute -to-baseline difference of scores generated from  peak flow and asthma 
symptom diaries. These data are captured twice-daily in the BARD  protocol using the  
Spirotel electronic diary recordings of asthma symptoms (0 = no symptoms, 1=mild symptoms, 2=moderate symptoms, 3=severe symptoms), nocturnal awakenings, rescue albuterol use (# rescue  puffs), and peak expiratory flow  data. The reference period for 
the asthma index will be derived from the Spirotel -collected diary data during the most 
stable week within the context of the trial, which we have previously defined as that with 
the lowest standard deviation of the asthma scores collected during the course of the week (Denlinger 2011) . The Asthma Index will be calculated serially using the diary data 
during each treatment period. We will define the peak asthma index as the highest value that occurs within 14 days after declaration of a significant exacerbation requiring prednisone. T he time to resolution of  the exacerbation will be assessed by the number 
of days between the peak and the point at which the index has been below 50% of the 
peak for at least 4 consecutive days . This instrument will allow for study of factors 
related to the speed of recovery from exacerbations.  
The Asthma -Specific  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Score (WPAI:Asthma) : 
This instrument captures asthma impairment by measuring the patient’ s assessment of 
disease impact on productivity at work, school, or daily activities  (Chen 2008).   It has 
been validated in >2000 patients with asthma in the TENOR study and administered in the AsthmaNet VIDA study. This questionnaire is validated for and applicable to 
individuals ages 12 and up. Baseline values using this instrument (recall of past 7 days) will be measured at the initial BARD  screening  visit (Screen Visit A)  for all participants 
ages 12 and older . This survey will be part of an exacerbation kit to be completed at 
home on the day that the participant  (ages 12 and up)  starts prednisone (day 0). A post -
exacerbation follow -up survey will also be completed at the next study visit occurring 
after an exacerbation. This tool will allow us to assess impairment associated with 
exacerbations in participants ages 12 and greater and the extent to which recovery has 
occurred by the time of the next study visit.   
 
AZMA asthma index figure: Time from prednisone burst, n=15, 
    

 85        Acute Asthma Assessment Questionnaire  (see Appendix 2).  An Acute Asthma 
Assessment will be included in the exacerbation kit, to be completed at home by the 
participant (ages  12 and greater) on the day he/she starts prednisone. Participants will 
be asked to report the precipitating factor for the asthma exacerbation (viral illness, exercise, allergen exposure, pollutant/irritant exposure, medication nonadherence), as well as a 72 hour review of number of asthma awakenings, albuterol rescue use, and 
missed school/work. Specific medication and health care utilization questions will be included on the exacerbation form completed at the next study visit to capture the following: 1) additional systemic corticosteroids prescribed by AsthmaNet personnel or 
other healthcare providers due to persistent symptoms and which are not included in the initial burst, 2) antibiotics prescribed by health care providers, and 3) unscheduled office visit, urgent care/emergency department visit, or hospitalization for respiratory symptoms. This tool will help evaluate exacerbation severity with the goal of 
establishing correlation between acute scores and the risk of subsequent adverse events.  To introduce the questionnaire to the study participants and to establish a 
baseline, the Acute Asthma Assessment will be administered to participants ages 12 and greater at the firs t study visit (Screen Visit A).  A po st-exacerbation follow -up 
questionnaire will be completed at the next study visit occurring after an exacerbation. 
This tool will allow us to assess impairment associated with exacerbations in participants ages 12 and greater and the extent to which recovery has occurred by the time of the next study visit.  
 
G. Timing of Asthma Exacerbations and Trial Management  
 
Run-In Exacerbations : 
 Participants who require 2 steps to step down to 1xICS in the run- in and experience an 
exacerbation while on the 2- 2.5xICS step are ineligible for further study participation.  
 Participants who experience an exacerbation while on 1xICS in the run- in may be 
eligible for randomization if they meet all other criteria, including compliance requirem ents for study drug dosing and e- diary/PEF completion. These participants 
must wash out from their final dose of prednisone for 2- 3 weeks prior to completing the 
randomization visit (Visit 1).  During the washout period they will remain on 1xICS. If a 
secon d exacerbation occurs prior to randomization, the run- in will be extended further to 
allow for a 2- 3 week washout period from the final dose of the second prednisone 
course. If a third exacerbation occurs, then the participant is  ineligible for further study 
participation for  safety reasons.   
 Participants who experience an exacerbation while on 1xICS in the run- in and do not 
meet compliance requirements are ineligible for further study participation. These individuals will be terminated from the study and may re- enroll, at the discretion of study 
staff, after meeting all applicable washouts.  
 
Post- Randomization Exacerbations : 
 Participants who experience an exacerbation during the first 2 weeks of a double- blind 
treatment period (prior to the treatment period’s baseline visit) will have their baseline 
 86        visit delayed for at least 1 week (but no more than 2 weeks) from their final dose of 
prednisone. Participants will remain on their double- blind study medication during this 
washout period. If a second exacerbation occurs during the washout period, then the 
participant meets treatment failure conditions and will follow the procedures outlined in section XX.A above.  
 Participants who experience their first exacerbation of a treatment period near the end of the period will delay the start of the following treatment period by 2- 3 weeks following 
their final dose of prednisone. Participants will receive open- label 5xICS during the 
washout period. These individuals are treated in the same fashion as those who achieve treatment failure status (see section XX.A above).   
 
XXI. ADVERSE EVENTS.  
A. Definitions  
Participants are at risk of developing adverse events during study enrollment. A clinical 
adverse event shall be defined as any unintended worsening in the structure (sig ns) or 
function (symptoms) of the body,  whether it is related to an exacerbation of asthma or to 
another unrelated illness , and whether or not it is considered study - or drug -related . 
Adverse events include any side effect, injury, or sensitivity reaction,  as well as any 
intercurrent event. An adverse event is deemed serious if it suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. Serious adverse events include any experience that is fatal or life- threatening, is permanently disabling, requires or prolongs 
inpatient hospitalization, or is a congenital anomaly, cancer or overdose.  
Documentation of an adverse event will be recorded on the Clinical Adverse Event Report form  and the Concomitant Medications for Asthma/Allergies and Adverse Event 
form and will include the following information: Description of the condition, dates of 
condition, treatment of condition (medications, doses, dates), whether hospitalization or emergency treatment was required, treatment outcome, relationship of the adverse event to the study medication(s) and severity of the event. Additional information is recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form when an event is deemed serious in nature.  
 
B. Adverse events unrelated to asthma  
Adverse events due to concurrent illnesses other than asthma may be grounds for withdrawal: 1) if the illness is considered significant by the study investigator, 2) if the illness requires systemic corticosteroids, or 3) if the participant is no longer able to effectively particip ate in the study.  Participants experiencing minor intercurrent illnesses 
may continue in the study provided that the nature, severity, and duration of the illness are recorded and that any unscheduled medications required to treat the illness are also recorded. Examples of minor intercurrent illnesses include acute rhinitis, sinusitis, upper 
respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis. Medications are allowed for treatment of these conditions in accordance with the judgment of the  
responsible study physician.  
 87         
C. Adverse events related to asthma exacerbations 
In this study an asthma exacerbation is defined according to the recommendation of the 
NIH Outcomes Workshop (Fuhlbrigge 2012 JACI 129:S34- 48) as a worsening of 
asthma requiring the use of a systemic corticosteroid (at least 3 days of treatment) to prevent a serious outcome.  An asthma exacerbation will usually  be recognized by the 
development of an increase in symptoms of cough, chest tightness, shortness of breath, phlegm/mucus, and/or wheezing or by a decrease in the participant’s PEF.  
Participants developing asthma exacerbations during the double- blind treatment period 
(or during the run- in) will be managed according to a participant specific guide for 
decision- making and rescue management (action plan).  Home care, physician’s office 
or emergency room visit  care, and prednisone course algorithms are previously 
described above.  
Participants developing asthma exacerbations during the characterization/assessment period or the run- in period will be managed based on their ICS step -down profile. Those 
who require 2 step step- down who experience an exacerbation while on the 2- 2.5xICS 
dose will be terminated from further trial participation, as they cannot tolerate a decrease to 1xICS. Those in the step- neutral or 1 step step- down group who 
experience an exacerbation while on the 1xICS dose are eligible to be randomized in the trial 14 days following their last dose of prednisone. If a given individual experiences more than two exacerbations on the 1xICS dose during the run- in period, he or she will 
be terminated from further trial participation due to safety concerns. These individuals will be treated appropriately and may re- enroll at Screen Visit A at least 4 weeks 
following their last  dose of prednisone, a t the study investigator’s discretion.  
During any of the four treatment periods, adverse events related to asthma exacerbations will be assigned Treatment Failure status if the event results in hospitalization or the need for 10 or more days of treatment with prednisone for asthma 
exacerbation(s). These adverse events will be managed according to rescue algorithm described above.  Individuals who attain treatment failure status will begin the next 
treatment period after at least 14 days  have passed since the completion of their oral or 
parenteral corticosteroids ( 7 day window).  
 
XXII.  SAFETY MONITORING  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established for this study to monitor data and oversee participant safety.  The DSMB consists of physicians skilled in 
both pediatric and adult asthma management, asthma pharmacology, and/or asthma 
clinical research, as well as a statistician and a bioethicist experienced in clinical trials. 
The Study Chair, the Director and a senior staff  member of the Data Coordinating  
Center, and representatives from the NHLBI participate as non- voting members.  
Specific DSMB procedures are identified in the AsthmaNet Manual of Operations.  
The current study will request DSMB review of study data every 6 months. The DSMB 
will assess the following:  
 88        • S tudy performance, including assessment of  performance sites’ adherence to 
protocol, adequate participant accrual, and quality control of data collection and 
management  
• Adverse event reports. These data will be presented to the DSMB in a fashion blinded to treatment group assignment.  However, the DSMB will have the option of unblinding when and if this action is deemed appropriate. Reports of serious adverse events will also be summarized. The DSMB will be notified within 72 
hours of any serious adverse events that are unexpected and deemed related to the study procedures or drugs.  
Serious adverse events 
A serious adverse event is defined as any event that results in death, is life- threatening, 
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or other medically important condition.  A life- threatening event is one in which, in the 
study physician’s opinion, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred.  Although not unexpected as an outcome in asthma clinical trials, hospitalizations for asthma will be included in the listing of adverse events as identified in the AsthmaNet Network Manual of Operations.  Summary reports of the 
DSMB’s review of serious adverse events will be distributed to each AsthmaNet PI by the DCC within 30 days following each DSMB meeting. The Summary Reports will include the foll owing: a statement that a DSMB review of the data and outcomes  across 
all performance sites  took place on a given date; a summary of the DSMB review of the 
cumulative serious adverse events without specific disclosure by treatment group unless safety considerations require such disclosure; and the DSMB’s conclusion with respect to progress or need for potential protocol modification. The AsthmaNet PIs are required to forward the Summary Reports to their local IRBs.  
Cost, Liability and Payment  
All tests will be performed without cost to the participants.  Since this is a trial comparing  
established asthma treatments, liability for participant care costs incurred by participants during the course of the trial will, in most cases, be borne by the participant or  their 
insurer. Details of the NIH policies concerning this issue can be found in NIH Documents #5305 and 6352- 2, Research Participant Care Costs Supported 
Agreements, in the AsthmaNet Network Manual of Operations.  Each participant will be paid a specified amount for study reimbursement that will be equivalent across clinical 
center  partnerships . For participants who drop out, reimbursement will be pro- rated for 
the length of time they stayed in the study.  
XXIII.  SUMMARY/IMPACT 
 The trial we outline above aims to address the important questi ons related to best add-
on ther apy in Blacks across the ages. The results of this study have the potential to 
significantly impact the asthma guidelines because the provided data will allow for 
evidence based recommendations for the use of asthma pharmacotherapy in Blacks.   This study will also offer the opportunity to assess whether genetic ancestry markers  
 89        can help us predict the degree of differential pharmacol ogic response in Black 
individuals.

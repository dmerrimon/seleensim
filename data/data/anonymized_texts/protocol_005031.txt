PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title  Partners in Health: Pilot test of a Pre -Visit Question Prompt List to 
Enhance Engagement of Heart Failure Patients and Family Members 
During Medical Visits   
Funder  North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute  
RTI International  
Clinical Phase  N/A 
Study Rationale  Heart failure (HF) is prevalent in more than 6 million Americans and is a 
leading cause of hospitalizations. Active HF self- management reduces 
hospitalizations but patient adherence to HF self -care behaviors is poor. 
Data suggests that family involvement in the patient’s care enhances 
patients’ self -management.  
Patient and family engagement is critical to obtaining the knowledge, skills, and confidence for effective self- management. Engagement is 
often manifested through asking questions, expressing concer ns, and 
clarifying information from health care providers (HCPs). Engagement is generally low among individuals with HF.  
Strategies such as pre -visit prompt lists can enhance patient and family 
engagement by encouraging patients and family members to ask r elevant 
questions and discuss sensitive topics with HCPs. However, several 
important gaps in the literature exist. First, the effect of prompt lists on self- management has not been tested. Second, few studies have used 
them with family members. Lastly, pro mpt lists have not been tested in 
HF patients.  
Study Objective(s)  The specific aims of this pilot study are to: 1) Develop a pre -visit question 
prompt list for use with HF patients and family members; and 2) Conduct a pre -post pilot study in up to 30 HF patients and family members to 
evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and effects of the prompt list on HF 
self- care behaviors (of patients and family members/caregivers), 
communication behaviors, and self -efficacy with communication. 
 
Test Article(s)  
(If Applicable)  The question/topic prompt list is the main intervention in this study. A prompt list is a written document containing suggested questions that the family member and/or patient may want to ask the health care provider during the visit. A section is included for the patient to check which behaviors t hey would like for their family member to engage in 
during the visit and space is provided for the family member to check which behaviors they are willing to perform during the visit.

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Heart failure (HF) is prevalent in more than 6 million Americans and is a leading cause of hospitalizations. Active 
HF self -management reduces hospitalizations but patient adherence to HF self -care  behaviors is poor. Data 
suggests that family involvement in the patient’s care enhances patients’ self -management.  
Patient and family engagement is critical to obtaining the knowledge, skills, and confidence for effective self-
management. Engagement is often manifested through asking questions, expressing concerns, and clarifying 
information from health care providers (HCPs). Engagement is generally low among individuals with HF.  
Strategies such as pre -visit prompt lists can enhance patient and family engagement by encouraging patients 
and family members to ask relevant questions and discuss sensitive topics with HCPs. A prompt list is a structured list of questions or topics related to illness, treatment, and support that is developed from interviews with patients, family members, and HCPs. Prompt lists are completed by patients and family members before a visit. Prompt lists have been shown to increase the number and relevance of questions asked by patients and 
family members. However, several important gaps in the literature exist. First, the effect of prompt lists on self-
management has not been tested. Second, few studies have used the m with family members. This gap is 
important given that about 1 in 3 adults are accompanied to medical visits by a family member. Moreover, family members’ concerns are often ignored by HCPs, thus adversely affecting families’ ability to support 
patients’ self-management. Lastly, prompt lists have not been tested in HF patients. Most of the research on 
their use has been conducted in cancer patients facing oncology -specific clinical decisions. To address these 
gaps, we will:  
1) Develop a pre -visit question prompt list for use with HF patients and family members; and 2) Conduct a pre -
post pilot study in up to 30 HF patients and family members to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and effects of 
the prompt list on HF self -care behaviors (of patients and family members/caregivers), communication 
behaviors, and self -efficacy with communication.  
This study will take place in the UNC Cardiology clinic or the General Internal Medicine clinic at the Ambulatory Care Center.

4 STUDY PROCEDURES   
4. 1 Screening/Baseline Visit procedures : Thirty HF dyads will receive the prompt list. Each dyad member 
will receive a prompt list to complete in the clinic waiting room immediately before their appointment. HF dyads 
will complete the prompt list without staff help. Completing the prompt list involves two steps. In step 1, 
participants will independently select from a list of questions or write in their own questions they would like to ask their health care provider during the visit. Patients will also be asked to select among a pre -determined list 
of behaviors they would like their family member to enrage in during the visit (e.g., write down the providers 
instructions). In step 2, d yad members will collaboratively decide which questions to discuss during the visit. 
Participants will be encouraged to take the prompt list into the exam room and use it to facilitate 
communication with the HCP. The RA may take a picture of the prompt lis ts (which will not contain any 
identifying information, only a study id) to assess areas of agreement and disagreement between the dyad on 
what to discuss with the HCP. This information will inform future studies.  
Potential participants will be identified  using several sources:  the Carolina Data Warehouse (CDW -H); the HF 
social support and family studies registry (SSR; IRB #11 -0562); medical record audits by the study PI; and 
suggestions from HCPs.  
Page 7 After initial identification, we will query HCPs of potentially eligible patients to confirm the diagnosis of HF . 
(based on their clinical assessment), determine if the patients are appropriate to approach for possible study  
participation (procedures we have successfully used in our prior studies). When we provide participating  
providers with a list of their potentially eligible patients, we will all ask them to check how often the patient  has 
a companion enter the exam room with them (none of the time, rarely, some visits, most visits, every  visit). 
Patient s will be considered "likely to be accompanied" if the provider indicates that a companion enters  the 
exam room "most visits or every visit." We anticipate that the providers will be very accurate in predicting  
patients who usually bring a family member in to the exam room, since these will be their regular patients.  This 
method will be used to facilitate more efficient recruitment of patients most likely to be eligible for the  study. 
For patients deemed ineligible by providers, we will ask providers to prov ide reasons why the patients  should 
not be contacted, Provider approved patients will be approached by a research assistant (RA) to assess  eligibility 
and possible interest in the study either during a scheduled clinic visit, via a provider -approved  letter , or via 
telephone using an IRB approved telephone script.  For those presenting for a clinic visit, the RA/ SC will approach 
them about participation in the  study. If they are interested, the study staff will consent the patient at that time 
and administer the baseline  survey. If there isn't time to complete the entire baseline survey before the visit, we 
will finish the remainder of the survey either after the visit or via phone within the week of the visit.  
 
We will use several approaches to identify and enroll family members: 1) If a family member has  
accompanied the patient to the clinic visit, the family member will be approached by a study coordinator at  that 
time about participation in the study and they can provide written consent at that time, if they are  
interested and eligible. They will also be administered the baseline survey either before (or after the visit 
depending on the time) or via phone in the week of the visit. 2) If a family member is not present with the  
patient at a clinic visit, an  IRB-approved study recruitment letter and a copy of the consent form will be sent  
home with the patient to give to a family member who may be interested in participating, and the family  
member can contact a study coordinator to discuss the study and/or ma il in the signed consent form. The  study 
team will provide a pre -paid self-addressed envelope to return the signed consent form. After receiving  signed 
consent form, the study team will call the potential participants to schedule the baseline study interview  for 
both members of the dyad.  For potential participants identified through the CDW or from the HF social support 
and family studies  registry, the study team will mail an IRB approved recruitment letter to potential patient 
participants. The  letter will notify the patient that a family member (preferably who one attends medical visits 
with them) is  required to also participate in the intervention, so they should discuss the study with family 
members and get  their permission to share their contact (phone number or address) with the study team. The 
letter will include  an opt -out form that potential participants may return using pre -paid, self-addressed 
envelope that will  accompany the recruitment letter. We will follow -up with potential patient participants via 
telephone 1 week  after the letters have been mailed. If they are interested in participating and have identified a 
family member who is interested, the study team will obtain verbal consent from each person and a written 
consent form will also be mailed to them to sign and return to the study team. The RA/Project Coordinator will 
also schedule the  baseline study interview. If the patient and family member provide verbal consent, but do not 
return the  written consent form via  mail, we will have t hem sign a written consent form at the time of baseline 
study  interview.  We will make it clear to the patient and family member that both individuals must be eligible 
and provide  informed consent for either to be eligible to participate in the study. An RA /Study coordinator will 
obtain  informed written consent for all eligible and interested dyads.

BASELINE ADMINISTRATION PROTOCOL  
 
The following is protocol for the administration of the BASEL INE QUESTIONNAIRES to study participants.   
The baseline questionnaires can be collected in 3 different ways: 1) on the phone with the participant after the 
participant has provided verbal consent; 2) in person, after the participant has completed their informed consent; or 3) by phone after the par ticipant has met with the RA/SC in person at a medical appointment at enrollment and completed 
their informed consent but did not have time to complete the baseline questionnaires.  
After participants have consented (verbally or by  in-person informed conse nt), the BASELINE QUESTIONNAIRES will be 
administered.   
 
The RA/SC will need the following:  
• iPad and power source for data collection into REDCap  
• Paper copies of the questionnaire  
• Answer key for the patient  
• Pen/pencil for both the RA/SC and the subjects   
 
Note: For iPad administration of the surveys, refer to the REDCap section in this protocol.  
After the participant has provided consent, the RA/SC will administer the baseline questionnaires. It is important to 
speak clearly and slowly so that the participant can understand what is being asked, especially if the baseline data 
collection occurs over the phone.  
 
Baseline data collection is preceded by the following prompt:  
 Hello, _____. This is [NAME] calling from UNC Health Care. I’m calling about the Heart Failure Study that you joined last 
week.  
As a first step in the study, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your health and your healthcare experiences. Our 
conversation should take about 15 minutes. Is this a good time to talk?  
 
[IF YES, PROCEED]  
 [IF NO, RESCHEDULE FOR A LATER DATE/TIME]  
 You are in this study because you have heart failure. Doctors sometimes call this congestive heart failure, an enlarged 
heart, or fluid in the lungs.  
 
Page 13 During our conversation, I’ll ask you questions about yourself, your visit companion, and your interactions with your 
doctor. Your “visit  companion” is the family member or friend who comes with you to your health appointments. Your 
“doctor” is the doctor, nurse practitioner, or other health care provider who you usually see during your visit.   
 After completing the prompt and if the parti cipant is able to conduct their data collection at that time, the RA/SC will 
collect their data either by using one of the following: 1) paper data collection materials; 2) the iPad REDCap application; 
or 3) by computer using the REDCap online data capture  system. Regardless of the way in which the data is collected, 
each data collection will be administered uniformly to all participants.  
 
Below are the BASELINE QUESTIONNAIRES  with their respective variables for analysis  for patients  
List of measures included in this questionnaire:  
1. Relationship with companion  
2. Companion involvement  
3. Closeness with companion

The following script will be used after the participant has completed their baseline data collection. 
 The next part of the study is to meet you at your next doctor’s appointment at the heart clinic in Meadowmont. At this 
appointment you will receive a list of topics and questions that you and your family member will review and complete 
before your appointment. We will also audio record your appointment with your provider.  
 
So that you have time to complete your list, we ask that you and your family member arrive 30 minutes before your 
scheduled appointment.  
 
Do you know when your next appointment at the heart clinic at Meadowmont is?  
 
[If yes]  Great, when is your appointment?  
 Date __________________  
Time __________________ 
 
Don’t forget that your family member will need to join us for that appointment.  
 
Will your family m ember be able to attend that appointment with you?  
 
[if not or if the patient is unsure, ask the patient to follow up with the family member, the RA/SC should plan to follow up with the family member to remind them of the appointment as well]  
 I would like to call you 1 – 2 days before your appointment to remind you that I will be there.  
 
Do you have a telephone number that I can reach you?  
________________________________________  
 Great, thank you!  
 
When would you prefer I call you to remind you of your appointment?  
__ Morning __ Afternoon __ Evening __ Specific time ______________  
 Again, we really appreciate you taking the time to participate in the study. For your time and participation on the study, 
you will receive a gift card.  
 
[provide t hem with their gift card if in person]  
 [if baseline is completed over the phone, use the following script…]

 Here is our information. Please contact us if you have any questions or if your appointment has been rescheduled.  
 
Thank you 
for taking time to answer my questions today. I’ll call you again a few days after your appointment 
with your heart doctor to ask some additional questions. I look forward to talking with you then. Have a great 
day!  
4.1 Intervention/Treatment procedures  (by visits)   
PATIENT’S MEDICAL APPOINTMENT  
The following protocol is for the administration of the study visit at the time of the patient’s medical appointment.  
 
Each dyad member will receive a prompt list to complete in the clinic waiting room immediately before the ir 
appointment. HF dyads will complete the prompt list without staff help. Completing the prompt list involves two 
steps. In step 1, participants will independently select from a list of questions or write in their own questions they would like to ask their health care provider during the visit. Patients will also be asked to select among a 
pre-determined list of behaviors they would like their family member to enrage in during the visit (e.g., write 
down the providers instructions). In step 2, dyad members  will collaboratively decide which questions to discuss 
during the visit. Participants will be encouraged to take the prompt list into the exam room and use it to 
facilitate communication with the HCP. The RA may take a picture of the prompt lists (which w ill not contain any 
identifying information, only a study id) to assess areas of agreement and disagreement between the dyad on what to discuss with the HCP.  
The RA/SC will meet participants in the waiting room and introduce their self and review the directions of 
completing the prompt list with the participant(s) as well as the process of the data collection.  
Note: If a participant has not completed an informed consent, one must be obtained prior to proceeding with the audio recorded medical appointment.  
The RA/SC will obtain consent from the patient’s HCP and remind the HCP that the appointment will be audio 
recorded. After the HCP has consented and the RA/SC has confirmed which exam room the patient will be in, 
the RA/SC can set up the audio recording e quipment. When the HCP enters the room, the RA/SC will start the 
recording and exit the room. Once the appointment is over, the RA/SC will knock on the door and enter the 
exam room to stop the recording.  
After the recording has been stopped, the RA/SC will  need to collect a copy of the completed prompt list from 
the participant. The copy can be provided as a carbon copy, a picture taken by a camera, a scanned copy, or a copy from the copy machine in the clinic. Scanned copies and pictures must be saved on a  study approved 
computer in order to prevent loss of data. It is preferable to obtain a picture using the study iPad; pictures will 
be taken on the iPad and entered into the REDCap application.  
Once the RA/SC has obtained a copy of the completed prompt li st, the RA/SC will provide the participant(s) with 
their gift card(s) for completing their baseline questionnaire for the study. The RA/SC will also have each participant sign a gift card receipt which the RA/SC will keep track of all gift cards. The RA/SC  will also schedule a 
time to call the participant(s) for their 2 day follow up call and confirm telephone contact information. After 
their appointment and scheduling their next visit, the RA/SC will thank the participant(s) for their time and exit the roo m. 
 
Page 27 The following script will be used after the patient’s in person medical appointment and data collection has completed.  
Thank you for allowing us to audio record your appointment. The next part of the study is for you to complete a 
telephone survey 2 da ys from today. This call should last approximately 20. I will call you at a time that works best for 
you.

Part 2: Help from Your Companion  
Having a family member or friend accompany you to your medical appointment can be useful, especially if 
that person knows how to help. Below are some ways a companion might support you during your visit. Read through this list and put a checkmark  next to the ways you’d like your companion to help.  
 I would like my companion to…(check all that apply)   
Take notes on what the doctor says during my appointment.   
Remind me to ask my questions.   
Ask my doctor questions for me.   
Remind me to tell my doctor about my symptoms.   
Tell my doctor about my health.   
Make sure I understand what my doctor says.   
Stay in the waiting room for part of the visit.

2 DAY & 1 MONTH FOLLOW UP CALL ADMINISTRATION PROTOCOL  
 
Hello, _____. This is [NAME] calling from UNC Health Care. I’m calling about the Partners in Heart Health 
Research Study that you are participating in. Thanks again for participating in our stud y.  
 
 I’d like to ask you a few questions about your most recent appointment [interviewer to specify when the 
appointment was - e.g. 2 days ago]. Our conversation should take about 15 minutes. Is this a good time to 
talk?  
 
 Yes ➔  [Continue]  
Page 5  No ➔  [Resched ule interview for next available time - preferably within the same week]  
 
During our conversation, I’ll ask you questions about yourself, your visit companion, and your interactions with your provider. Your “visit companion” is the family member or friend t hat came with you to your 
appointment. Your provider is the doctor or nurse practitioner you saw during your visit.  
 
2-Day Follow -Up Measures  
1. Prompt List Acceptability  
2. Satisfaction with visit  
3. Perceptions of provider communication  
4. Patient communication  
5. Perceived efficacy in interactions with doctor  
6. Self-efficacy related to self- care  
 
The following protocol is for the administration of the 2 Day Follow Up and the 1 Month Follow Up Calls for 
each study participant.    
Hello, _____. This is [NA ME] calling from UNC Health Care. I’m calling about the Heart Failure Study that 
you joined earlier this year. My records show that your family member or friend had an appointment with their healthcare team 2 -3 days ago. Is that right?  
 Yes  ➔  [Continue]  
 No ➔  [Clarify appointment date and reschedule interview accordingly]  
 
As part of the study, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your family member or friend’s appointment. 
Our conversation should take about 15 minutes. Is this a good time to talk?  
 Yes ➔  [Continue]  
 No ➔  [Reschedule interview for next available time]  
 
During our conversation, I’ll ask you questions about yourself, your family member or friend who has heart 
failure, and your interactions with the doctor who treats your family member or friend’s heart failure. We 
will use “doctor” to refer to the doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant who your family member or friend usually sees during medical appointments.  
[*Note that the 2 -day follow -up questionnaires for companions  includes the same  measures, which 
parallel the patient questionnaires ].

Hello, _____. This is [NAME] calling from UNC Health Care. I’m calling about the Heart Failure 
Study that you joined earlier this year. This is the final part of the study, and I’d like to ask you a 
few questions about your health and your healthcare experiences. Our conversation should take abou t 15 minutes. Is this a good time to talk?  
  Yes 
→ [Continue]  
No →  [Reschedule interview for next available time]  
  During our conversation, I’ll ask you questions about yourself, your visit companion, and your interactions with your doctor. Your “visit c ompanion” is the family member or friend who comes 
with you to your health appointments. Your “doctor” is the doctor, nurse practitioner, or other health care provider who you usually see during your visit.  
 
4.3 Unscheduled visits  N/A 
4.4 Concomitant Medication do cumentation  N/A 
4.5 Rescue medication administration ( if applicable)  N/A 
4.6 Subject Completion/ Withdrawal procedures . 
The total duration of study participation will be 
up to 6 months. Participants are eligible to withdraw at any time.  
4.7 Screen failure procedures . For individuals  who refuse or who are not eligible to participate, 
eligibility screening forms will be destroyed within 1 week of refusal or ineligibility is determined. 
We will keep a list of participant names who were approached and who are not eligible or not 
interested in participating so that they are not approached a second time.  
 
5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS (how measurements will be 
made)   
Data sources for this study include survey data and audio -taped data . Research staff will 
administer the surveys to study participants. We will use validated survey measures, where -ever 
possible. We will submit copies of all data collection instruments for IRB approval. We will not 
collect biometric or laboratory data as part of this study.

5.2 Pharmacokinetic Evaluation (if applicable)  N/A 
5.3 Safety Evaluations  N/A 
 
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION     
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
Primary outcome = Percent of eligible patient participants who enrolled in the study . The 
investigators will assess enrollment rate into the study. The investigators aim to have at least 50% 
of screened patients consent and enrollment. This is a pilot study and as such, our sample siz e was 
selected based largely on feasibility. Specifically , we examined the expected margin of error for 
varying recruitment and recruitment yields.  
 
6.2 Secondary Endpoint  
Secondary outcomes  include:  1) mean score on acceptability checklist ; 2) mean score on self- care 
of heart failure index scores (maintenance, management, and confidence subscales); 3) mean 
score on caregiver contribution to self- care of heart failure index scores (maintenance, 
management, and confidence subscales); 4) mean score on perceived efficacy in patient -physician 
interactions score; 5) mean score on communication with physicians measure  
 
6.3 Statistical Methods  
Analysis for this study will be quantitative pre -post analyses. We will compute descriptive  
statistics (percentages, means, and standard deviations) for feasibility, acceptability, and 
behavioral  outcomes. For each behavioral outcome (HF self- care behaviors, self- efficacy  related to 
self- care, communication with provider, communication with providers, and perceived efficacy in 
interactions with doctor ), we will use paired t -tests to compare change s in mean scores from 
baseline  to 1-month  separately for  accompanied patients, companions, and unaccompanied 
patients.  In this pilot study,  we are not conducting hypothesis testing. To help plan for future 
proposals, point estimates of effect sizes for the mean change value in each behavioral outcome 
will be computed as the ratio of the mean difference in  each change value between baseline and 
1-month follow -up. 
 
6.4 Sample Size and Power .  
This is a pilot study and as such, our sample size was selected based largely on feasibility. Specifically , we examined the expected margin of error for varying recruitment and recruitment 
yields.  
 
6.5 Interim Analysis . N/A 
 
7 STUDY INTERVENTION (drug, device or other intervention details ) N/A- this is 
not a drug or device trial. Behavioral intervention is described above in Sections 1.1 and 4.2 . 
8 STUDY INTERVENTION ADMINISTRATION  (if applicable)  N/A- this is a non -
randomized trial design. Behavioral intervention  administration  is described above in Sections 4.1 
 
9 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 
Page 17 We will not have a DSMC, DsMC, or DMC for this study given that the safety risk to participants  
is extremely low. However, the PI and Co -I (Chang), both physicians, will review any safety 
concerns raised, including involving others from the study team (or external to it, if necessary) and 
decide on an appropriate  action.  For any unanticipated problems, the PI and stud y coordinator will 
conduct an aggregate review using SOP 19.2 and 19.3 to decide if an event or events meets the criteria for unanticipated problems and whether it is an adverse event. If found to meet the requirements, all unanticipated problems will be reported using the online reporting portal within required timelines (SOP 19.5).  
 
10 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGMENT   
Data will be collected at baseline, the day of the participant’s medical appointment, 2 days (+/ - 2 
days) following the medical appointment and 1 month (+/ - 7 days) after the participant’s medical 
appointment. There are several ways in which data may be collected: at baseline, data collection 
instruments may be administered by telephone or in person using the REDCap online data capture system, the  REDCap iPad application, or pen and paper surveys; at the participant’s medical 
appointment, the visit will be audio -recorded; and two day follow up and 1 month follow up data 
will be collected over the telephone using the REDCap online data capture syste m, the REDCap 
iPad application, or pen and paper surveys. All data will be entered into the study REDCap database.  
We will have a follow up call with participants 2 -days (+/ - 2 days) after the visit to gather their 
perspectives on the utility of the prompt list as well as their perspectives on the communication 
during the visit and their satisfaction with the visit. The study team will also send participants a 
reminder letter at least 1 week before time for their 1 –month (+/ - 7 days) follow -up outcomes 
assessment. Finally, we will conduct the 1 -month follow -up outcomes assessment via phone.  
 
We will make every possible effort to keep the data confidential. All contact information will be 
kept in electronic files that are password protected and only accessible by study staff. Any hard copy of contact information (used to process the mailing of incentives) will be kept in a secure place (locked office and file  cabinet). No names will appear on questionnaires; files linking name 
with study ID will be kept electronically under password protection. During participant identification, the RAs, PI, and Co -Investigators will know the identity of the patient and their 
family member. This is  required to contact providers for approval, to mail letters to potential 
patients, and/or to conduct direct in -person recruitment. Upon enrollment, patients and family 
members will be given a unique study ID number and all data collected thereafter will be linked to this study ID number.  
 
We will use the web -based application known as REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture 
project -redcap.org) for data management. REDCap is used for building and managing online 
surveys and databases.  It is a flexible informatics systems -based approach used to support 
research studies, including clinical trials. Critical components of REDCap include but are not limited to: 1) user authentication and role -based security; 2) intuitive electronic case report forms; 3) real-
time data validation, integrity checks and other mechanisms for ensuring data quality (e.g. double -
data entry options); 4) data attribution and audit capabilities; 5) protocol document storage and sharing; and 6) central data storage and  backups. The graphical view and stats tool allows the user 
to look at numerical and categorical variables to determine the amount and frequency of missing questionnaire data. The report builder tool serves as a search engine to  conduct database queries, 
which can be used to track attrition rates. The documents linking study  identification number to 
Page 18 PHI will be kept on a secure, password -protected server that only the RA/study coordinator and PI 
can access. Data will be transmitted between the PI and the pr oject biostatistician by copying files 
directly from one computer to another; email will not be used to transmit data. All computerized 
data will be kept on password protected computers. Audiotaped data will be stored on a secure, 
password  protected server  at UNC -CH. At the end of the award period, the electronic files  will be 
destroyed.  
 
11 RECRUITMENT STRATEGY  
11.1 CONSENT PROCESS  
Recruitment will be completed by the Study Coordinator or other approved study personnel.  
Screening to determine eligibility to participate will take place via telephone or in a private 
location within the clinic. An IRB -approved eligibility form will used by the RA. The informed 
consent process will occur in a  private location within the clinic.  
 Potential participants will be given a description of the study in a clear, concise manner and given time to ask questions and have their questions answered by study personnel. Consent will be obtained immediately after the initial consent discussion; and will be obtained d irectly from the 
participant. An unsigned hard copy of consent documents (Consent, HIPPA) will be given to each 
participant for their records. This document will contain contact information for the study 
coordinator and the PI.  
 Potential participants (both patient and visit companion) will be given the choice of either reading the consent on their own, or having the consent read to them. If the consent form is read to the participant, the signature page will indicate that the consent was read to the partic ipant. The 
consent form will describe the study including the potential risks and benefits and will explicitly state that if participants choose not to participate; their medical care at UNC will not be impacted in any way. In addition to the consent form,  the HF patient will read a HIPAA authorization form. 
The patient will be informed that if they choose not to sign the HIPAA authorization form then 
they may not participate in the study. This information will also be on the written consent form.  
 
The HF patient and the family member will have similar, but separate consent forms. Both the HF patient and the family member will be asked to consent to be audio -taped. The consent form for 
the family member will state that if s/he is a patient of the health care  provider at UNC Hospitals, 
we will not access their protected health information (PHI) and thus, will not require patient authorization. Potential participants will be allowed to ask questions and have the answered, and the consent forms will then be sign ed. During this entire process, the PI will be available by pager 
or cell phone for questions. Copies of all consent documents will be given to participants.  
 
We will also consent select health care providers who see patients at the Cardiology clinic at 
Meadowmont. Most, if not all, of these providers are individuals who consented and participated 
in the PI's previous study. The health care providers will be approached by the PI or Co -I (Dr. 
Chang) either in person or via email, informed of the study, and asked to participate. The informed consent process will occur in a private location within the Cardiology clinic. An IRB- approved 
written consent will form be given to the health care provider to read while the RA explains the form to them. The consent for m for the health care provider will state that taking part in this 
research is not a part of their University duties as an employee, and refusing will not affect their employment at UNC -CH. In addition, the consent form will also state that the health care  provider 
will not be offered or receive any special job -related consideration if they choose to take part in 
Page 19 this research. Potential participants will be allowed to ask questions and have them answered, and 
the consent forms will then be signed. During t his entire process, the PI will be available by pager 
or cell phone for questions. Copies  of all consent documents will be given to participants.  
 
All consent forms will be designed to be read at the 5th grade level. They will describe the study, 
its pote ntial benefits and risks, and indicate that participation is strictly voluntary and that 
participants may stop at any  time.  
 
12 PLANS FOR PUBLICATION  
We plan to publish 2 paper s from this clinical. One paper will present the main study findings for 
the primary and secondary outcomes . The other study  will describe findings from comparing  
audio tape data (actual questions asked during the visit)  as compared to questions patients and 
companions indicated  on the prompt list  that they wanted to ask during the visit .

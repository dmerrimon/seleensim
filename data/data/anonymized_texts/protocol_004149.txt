2013N179529_01 2014 -JUN-06 Amendment No. 1
Section 4.2.1. I nclusion Criteria, Inclusion#8; hemoglobin levels are updated based on 
the feedback re ceived from FDA. It was ≤11 g/dL for ESA naïve subjects, it is updated as 
<10.0 g/dL; it was ≤12.0 g/dL for subjects receiving ongoing ESA treatment, it is updated 
as ≤11.0 g/dL.
Section 4.2.2. Exclusion Criteria, the numbering of exclusion criteria was in advertentl y 
incremented from previous section. The numbering now starts from “1”.
Section 5.3.3. Stopping Criteria; the stopping criteria related to the hemoglobin level is 
updated per the FDA’s feedback received. A previous criterion required subjects to have 
their absolute hemoglobin level ≥13.0 g/dL to stop the dosing. The hemoglobin level for 
stopping the dosing is now updated as >11.0 g/L .
Section 6.1. Time and Events Table, Protocol Activity  “Urine Drug and Alcohol Screen” 
is updated as “Drug and Alco hol Screen” with a new footnote “m”. Majority  of subjects 
with ESRD undergoing peritoneal dial ysis will not be able to produce urine samples. For 
these subjects this screening test will be serum -based.
Section 6.3.2. Vital Signs; body temperature measureme nt was not included under vital 
signs assessment. It is now included as a part of vital signs assessment since it is a 
measurement performed as a standard practice at the site.Section 6.3.3. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG), instruction for Day  -1 ECG measurement is updated as it 
indicated that ECG measurement should be done 2 h prior to dosing. The first dosing day  
is Day  1, and there will be no ECG measurement on the dosing day . This is now 
corrected.
2013N179529_02 2014 -JUN-24 Amendment No. 2
Section 6.1. Time and Events Table, Footnote m is revised to make the Drug and Alcohol 
test ty pe flexible. At screening and on Day  -1, this test would have been performed urine 
based or alternativel y serum based. However, it was recognized that each site has their 
standard tests for this assessment. At the discretion of the investigator, sites will be able 
to use their standard test in order to ensure that the test results will be ready for an 
evaluation prior the dosing. Test will also be performed on Day  13. 
Section 6.1. Time and Events Table, a new footnote, footnote n, is included to clarify  
how hemoglobin can be assessed on Day  3, Day  7, and Day  11 visits. 
2013N179529_03 2014 -JUL-01 Amendment No. 3
Section 4.2.2., I nclusion and Exclusion Criteria, the numbering of e ach criterion was 
inadvertentl y changed starting from subtitles “Efficacy” and “Other”. After subtitle 
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
The GlaxoSmithKline group of companies 200942
3“Safet y”, the numbering was not consecutivel y increasing for the remaining inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. The inclusion and exclusion criteria numbers were changed to be 
consecutive.  Inclusion criteria numbers now starts from 1 and goes up to 12, exclusion 
criteria numbers start from 1 and goes up to 28.
Section 4.3.3. Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco, the word “sample” was missing after the 
word “the fi nal pharmacokinetic” in the last part of the first sentence, this is now 
included.
2013N179529_04 2014 -DEC -12 Amendment No. 4
List of Abbreviations, the abbreviation for kilocalorie, kcal, is listed as it is now included 
in the text.
Regulatory  Agency  Identify ing Number(s), the EudraCT number was inadvertently  
provided as 2013-002681-39 which belongs to phase II program of this compound. The 
EudraCT number is now updated as “2014 -001197 -34” with this amendment which is the 
correct number for this specific protocol.
Section 4.2.1 I nclusion Criteria, Efficacy , inclusion criteria#5; the urine output and Kt/V 
values were revised for subject’s eligibility  after study  investigators provided further 
information gathered about these conditions for the subjects who are on peritoneal 
dialy sis.
Section 4.2.1. I nclusion Criteria, Efficacy , inclusion#8; hemoglobin levels are updated to 
meet with country  specific requirements. For UK only site(s) , hemoglobin value is 
updated as ≤11 g/dL for ESA naïve subjects and as ≤12.0 g/dL for subjects receiving 
ongoing ESA treatment.
Section 5.3.3. Stopping Criteria; the stopping criteria related to the hemoglobin level is 
updated to meet with country  specific requirements. For UK only site (s), stopping 
criteria for absolute hemoglobin level now is ≥12.0 g/dL to stop the dosing. 
Section 4.2.2. Exclusion Criteria, Safet y, exclusion criteria#15; it was revised to be 
flexible for those subjects who have not received their ophthalmology  exam w ithin 12 
months prior to Screening, so they  may  take their exam with a referral from the study  
investigators during Screening period.
Section 4.3.2 Meals and Dietary  Restrictions; it was stated that subjects would not 
consume an y food and drinks (except wa ter) during 4 h fasting period after dosing on 
Day 1 and Day  14. Based on the initial feedback from one of study  sites, some subjects 
on peritoneal dial ysis are very  hungry  after they  finish night portion therapy  on peritoneal 
dialy sis cy cler. This is most likely  due to the relatively  high insulin dose required to 
mitigate high dextrose content in the peritoneal dialy sis fluid needed to achieve adequate 
ultrafiltration. Thus this section was revised to allow subjects to have a light snack and a 
beverage whi ch would not exceed 500 kcal during this 4 h fasting period after dosing.
Section 6.4.2. Dialy sate Sample Collection, on Day  1 and Day  14, the volume of 
dialy sate solution to be collected for anal ysis was specified as 10 mL aliquot. This is 
revised to 1.5 mL as 10 mL  aliquot would have exceeded the required amount for the 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis.
Section 6.1, Time and Events Table, there was a typo error on the Day  of Follow -up visit. 
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L

4It was entered as Day  23. This is now corrected as Day  22.
2013N179529_05 2014 -DEC -15 Amendment No. 4 
(Republishing)
The abbreviation “PD” included in Revision Chronology  in 2013N179529_04 was 
required to change to “peritoneal dialy sis” as “PD” in this protocol refers to 
“Pharmacod ynamic ”. The abbreviation “PD” in this section could have been 
misinterpreted if it was left as is. Thus, Amendment No. 4 was republished with this 
update in order to prevent any  confusions.
2013N179529_06 2015 -SEP-10 Amendment No. 5
This protocol amendment is to clarify  several sections of protoc ol text and to confirm that 
there will be informal reviews of the available PK data to assist Phase III development of 
the compound .  Additionally , if during the informal review of the available PK data it is 
determined that there are no clinically -significant differences in PK between the CAPD 
and APD populations, the planned number of subjects may  be reduced.  All changes are 
detailed in Appendix 5.   
In order to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects to meet the 
Consolidated Standards o f Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and 
respond to queries from Regulatory  authorities, a minimal set of screen failure 
information is required including Demograph y, Screen Failure details, Eligibility  Criteria, 
and an y Serious Adverse Events.  Section 4.4 has subsequently  been updated to 
document that screen failure information is being collected.  T he anal ysis populations 
(Section 9.3.1) have also been expanded to clarify  the screen failure population.
Wording in Section 4.3.2 has been a mended to clarify  the duration for which subjects 
need to avoid consumption of red wine, grapefruit (juice), blood orange (juice), star fruit, 
onions, kale, broccoli, green beans, or apples, specificall y are all prohibited from 7 days 
prior to the first do seof GSK1278863 until the Follow -Up visit, unless in the opinion of 
the investigator and GSK Medical Monitor this will not interfere with the study  
procedures and compromise subject safet y
Wording in Section 5.10 has been amended to ensure the text is cur rent regarding use of 
concomitant medications. 
The following protocol sections were updated accordingl y:
Section 4.1, Section 4.3.2, Section 5.10, Section 9.3.1, Section 9.3.2. Section 11, 
Appendix 5
2013N179529_07 2016 -JUN-20 Amendment No. 6
This protocol amendment is to reduce the number of subjects in the study  (either cohort)
to a total of 8 completed subjects. This study  has been active for 2 years and only  6(1 
CAPD and 5 APD) subjects have completed the study . Given the recruitment challenges 
in general, and the CAPD population in particular, the protocol was amended to enroll 
ESRD subjects undergoing peritoneal dial ysis from either the CAPD or APD population.

141. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Rationale
1.1.1. Study Rationale
The purpose of this stud y is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK1278863 
and its metabolites in subjects with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) undergoing 
peritoneal dial ysis, one of the target populations for Phase 3 studies.  
Peritoneal dialy sis represents a treatment modalit y for subjects with ESRD as an 
alternative to hemodial ysis for removal of waste from the blood normally  eliminated by  
the kidney s.  Although peritoneal dial ysis may  allow greater freedom for subjects with 
ESRD to carry  out normal activities of life, it is potentially  less efficient at removing 
these wastes.  In particular, subjects undergoing peritoneal dial ysis have different 
clearances of waste products that can affect the disposition of drugs.  As GSK1278863 is 
to be admi nistered to anemic subjects with ESRD undergoing peritoneal dialy sis, it is 
important to characterize the PK in this target patient population.
One modality  of peritoneal dialy sis is known as Continuous Ambulatory  Peritoneal 
Dialy sis (CAPD) and involves 3 -5 manual exchanges per day  of dial ysis solution into the 
peritoneal cavity  with a 4 to 8 hour dwell time. Automated Peritoneal Dial ysis (APD) 
employ s an automated peritoneal dialy sis device, called cy cler to perform between 4 and 
6 exchanges during the nig ht time. Patients may  drain completel y or have additional 
dialy sis solution fill in the morning after last drain on cy cler. Additional automated or 
manual exchange may  be added during the day .  
For the majorit y of patients, both peritoneal dialysis modali ties are considered essentially 
equivalent, therefore, selection of modality  typically  is based on patient life sty le and
preference, with APD allowing more free time during the day . As the proportion of 
peritoneal dial ysis patients using either modalit y is approximately  equal globally , it is 
considered important to enroll ESRD subjects on both CAPD and APD.
In vitro pharmacology  has shown that all major metabolites of GSK1278863 are 
pharmacologically  active and show pIC 50s > 8 (<10 nM), comparable to the p arent 
compound GSK1278863 for human prol yl -4-hydroxy lases (PHDs) .  Therefore, there is 
the potential that the metabolites also may  contribute to the clinical pharmacody namics 
(PD) and therapeutic activity  of GSK1278863.  While a previous clinical study  of 
GSK1278863 in subjects with impaired renal function had demonstrated that parent 
GSK1278863 has similar pharmacokinetic characteristics to subjects with normal renal 
function (Study  PHI112843). Preliminary  PK data suggests that the major metabolites of 
GSK1278863 have prolonged half -lives compared to parent GSK1278863, with some 
metabolites accumulating upon repeat -dose administration in subjects with chronic 
kidney  disease (CKD; Study  PHI115573).  Full PK profiles of GSK1278863 and 
metabolites have not b een collected following repeat -dose administration to the ESRD 
population undergoing peritoneal dial ysis; therefore, the purpose of this study  is to fully  
characterize the PK of GSK1278863 and metabolites following repeat -dose 
administration to this popula tion.  This open -label study  will evaluate the PK of parent

15GSK1278863 and metabolites in two cohorts of ESRD subjects undergoing peritoneal 
dialy sis.
The effective date of the or iginal protocol is 11- APR -2014. In the 2 years that the study  
has been activ e, onl y 6subjects have completed the study . This incl udes 1 CAPD and 5
APD subjects. Considering the difficulties with recruitment in general, and the CAPD 
population in particular, this protocol will be amended to enroll ESRD subjects 
undergoing perito neal dialy sis of eithe r modality  (i.e., CAPD or APD). In addition, in a 
previous study  (PHI115573), the pharmacokinetic properties of daprodustat and the 
predominant metabolites were able to be adequately characterized in an ESRD population 
undergoing he modial ysis with 8 subjects. Finally , preliminary  results from this study  has 
shown that a subject using CAPD had similar PK to the 3 subjects using APD suggesting 
that, if there are differences in the PK of daprodustat depending upon the peritoneal 
dialy sis modality , they  are likely  to be not considered clinicall y significant.
1.2. Brief Background
Anemia is frequently  present in patients with CKD, patients receiving chemotherapy , and 
patients with various chronic diseases.  Anemia may  result from several cause s, including 
factors which shorten red blood cell life span, vitamin deficiency , uremia, iron 
deficiency , inflammation, and insufficient production of ery thropoietin (EPO).  
Erythropoiesis- stimulating agents (ESAs), such as recombinant human ery thropoietin
(rhEPO), are commonl y used in the treatment of patients with anemia, particularl y 
anemia associated with chronic kidney  disease.
Under h ypoxic conditions, the hypoxia -inducible factor (HIF) -prolyl hydroxy lases 
(PHDs) are inhibited, resulting in the accumu lation of unhy droxy lated HIFα subunits.  
These HIFα subunits dimerize with HIFβ subunits to effect the transcription of HIF -
responsive genes, including the gene responsible for the production of EPO and others 
involved in increasing oxygen utilization (e.g ., transferrin, heme oxy genase 1).  Other 
functions regulated b y HIFs include iron metabolism and utilization, angiogenesis, 
extracellular matrix metabolism, apoptosis, energy and glucose metabolism, vascular 
tone, cell adhesion, and motility  (Haase , 2013).
GSK1278863 is a novel, orally -available, small molecule agent which stimulates 
erythropoiesis through inhibition of PHDs, mimicking the hy poxic state.  This activity  
leads to increased transcription of HIF- responsive genes including the gene responsible 
for the production of EPO.  This pharmacod ynamic activity  simulates components of the 
natural response to exposure to hy poxia.
1.3. Clinical Experience to Date
As of 28 August 2015, GSK1278863 has been administered as singl e oral doses ranging 
from 2 to 500 mg to 235 healthy , adult male and female subjects in nine completed 
Clinical Pharmacology  and Biopharmaceutical studies (PHX111427, PHI112842, 
PHI112843, PHI116008, PHI 115573, PHI113635, PHI113634, PHI114703, PHI 115385)

16and administered once daily  (15 to 100 mg) or 25 mg twice daily  for up to 14 day s 
duration to 20 healthy  subjects in completed study PHI 112842.
Additionally , oral GSK1278863 has been administered to 234 subjects with CKD.  
Twelve CKD subjects received two d oses of up to 150 mg GSK1278863 (PHI112843).  
Fourteen CKD subjects received 5 mg GSK1278863 for up to 15 day s (PHI115573).  
Sixty -one non- dialysis dependent (NDD; Stage 3 to 5) and 31 hemodial ysis-dependent 
(HDD; Stage 5) anemic CKD subjects received 10 m g to 100 mg GSK1278863 for up to 
28 day s in Study  PHI112844.  Fift y-four subjects with anemia associated with CKD 
(Stage 3/4/5) who were not taking rhEPO and who were not undergoing dialy sis received 
0.5, 2 or 5 mg GSK1278863 for up to 28 day s (Study  PHI116581).  Sixty -two Stage 5 
HDD subjects with anemia associated with CKD switching from stable rhEPO to 
GSK1278863 received 0.5, 2 or 5 mg GSK1278863 for up to 28 days (Study  
PHI116582).

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Stud y Design Detail
This is a repeat -dose, open label, 2 cohort study  to assess the pharmacokinetics of 
GSK1278863 and metabolites in ESRD subjects undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
GSK1278863 (5 mg) will be orally  administered once dail y for 14 day s to approximately  
12 ESRD subjects; 
Cohort 1 will enrol subjects on continuous ambulatory  peritoneal dialy sis 
(CAPD) tocomplete all dosing and critical assessments
Cohort 2 will enrol subjects on automated peritoneal dial ysis (APD) to
complete a ll dosing and critical assessments.  
Once a total of 8subjec ts across both cohorts collectively  have completed the trial ,
enrolment will be stopped and the study  will be concluded. 
A sufficient number of ESRD subjects undergoing peritoneal dial ysis will be enrolled in 
this study  in order to ensure that at least 8 subjects total complete dosing and all critical 
assessments. However, if during an informal review of available PK data it is determined 
that the PK appears to be adequatel y characterized, the planned number of subjects may  
be reduced.
Blood samples for primary  PK assessment will be collected on Day 1 and Day 14. 
To determine subject eligibility  for enrolment in the study , a screening visit will be 
performed within 30 days of the start of dosin g (prior to Day  1).  
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
18Subjects who are deemed eligible and sign the informed consent may  remain in residence 
at the site from the afternoon of Day  -1 through the last assessment on Day  17, at the 
discretion of the investigator or b y request of the subject . Subjects will be offered to stay  
in residence at the study  site (inpatient) or they  are allowed to remain at home 
(outpatient) throughout the study . Forsubject s that choose to participate in the study  as 
an outpatient, they will be released from the clinic and must return to the clinic for 
schedule dassessments .
At a minimum, study  staff must ensure that subjects are in residence at the site on full PK 
Days (Day 1 and Day 14 ), as well as on Days 15, and16 for 48 and 72 h PK sampling.
All subjects are re quired to return to the unit 8 (+2) day s from the last dose of 
GSK1278863 for a follow- up visit.
3.2. Discussion of Study  Design
The purpose of this stud y is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 and 
metabolites in ESRD patients undergoing peritone al dialy sis.  To date, GSK1278863 has 
not been administered to this patient population, and there have been differences in the 
PK of the metabolites in subjects with CKD (Stage 3/4), both in subjects not on dialy sis 
as well as in subjects undergoing hemodial ysis, as compared to subjects with normal 
renal function.
In this stud y, subjects will receive GSK1278863 for 14 day s.  Stead y-state parent and 
metabolite PK have been evaluated after repeat- dose administration of 5 mg 
GSK1278863 in healthy subjects and subjects with renal impairment (Stage 3/4 NDD and 
Stage 5 HDD) in Study  PHI115573.  PK of parent GSK1278863 was generally  similar 
across healthy , NDD, and HDD subjects; slightl y (16%) higher AUC was observed in 
HDD subjects on a dial ysis day  (GSK1278863 do sed ~2 h prior to dial ysis) compared to 
a non dialy sis day .
Compared to health y subjects, stead y-state metabolite exposures were 2.3 to 3.6 -fold 
higher in NDD subjects, 1.8 to 3.3- fold higher in HDD subjects on a dial ysis day , and 
3.0to 6.9 -fold higher in HDD subjects on a non -dialy sis day .  
In HDD subjects, metabolites demonstrated 1.7 to 2.3-fold higher exposure on a non-
dialy sis day  compared to a dialy sis day .  Metabolite PK reached steady -state by  14 day s.
Since no placebo treatment group is required in this PK study , an open -label study  design 
will be used.  
Plasma biomarker concentrations of on- target effects (erythropoietin and hepcidin) will 
be obtained to examine the time course of changes in ery thropoietin and hepcidin after a 
5 mg dose.  
Sampl es for assessment of stead y-state plasma protein binding will be collected (3 
samples to obtain approximate peak and trough concentrations of GSK1278863 and 
metabolites, M4 (GSK2487818) and M5 (GSK2506102).  Samples (aliquots) from the 
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
19peritoneal dial ysis fluid (dialy sate) will be collected for determination of clearance of 
GSK1278863 and metabolites at steady -state on Day  14.
3.2.1. Dose Rationale
A 5 mg 14 -day repeat dose schedule was selected for this study  to allow direct 
comparison to a recent study  with a si milar study  design in subjects with normal, Stage 
3/4, and Stage 5 (HDD) renal function (PHI115573).
In previous studies, single oral doses of 50 mg and 150 mg, and repeat oral doses 
between 0.5 mg and 100 mg for up to 28 day s have been well tolerated in subjects with 
CKD.  
In a prior Phase IIa stud y, GSK1278863 was administered to Stage 5 HDD subjects who 
had been on rhEPO and switched to doses of 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg (Study PHI 116582).  
In the stud y, switching from rhEPO to 5 mg GSK1278863 had a similar effect on 
maintaining Hgb over 4 weeks as continuing rhEPO.  To avoid a potential rapid increase 
in hemoglobin that has been observed with repeat doses > 10 mg, a 5 mg dose is 
appropriate for PK investigation in this study .  
Further, in a study  (PHI115573 ) conducted in subjects with various stages of CKD, no 
safet y concerns were found with a 5 mg oral dose.  
Finally , a 5 mg dose is anticipated to lead to quantifiable plasma levels of parent and 
metabolites, permitting characterization of the pharmacokinet ics.
3.3. Risk Management
Non-clinical data to date have not identified prohibitive risks associated with 
GSK1278863 at the exposures planned for this study .  Overall, the compound has been 
generall y well tolerated with no clinically  significant safety -related findings observed to 
date following administration of up to 5 00 mg single dose and up to 100 mg once dail y 
for 14 day s in healthy  subjects and up to 100 mg once dail y for 28 days in CKD patients.  
Please refer to the GlaxoSmithKline Investigator’s Brochure [GlaxoSmithKline 
Document Number. R M2008/00267/07, 14 October 2015 ]and associated IB 
Supplements for GSK1278863 [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2015N266524_00, 
17-Dec-2015; GlaxoSmithKline Docume nt Number 2015N266524_01, 08- Apr-2016] for 
additional pre -clinical and clinical details.
To minimize risks to participants, eligibility  criteria, safet y monitoring, and stopping 
criteria are incorporated into the study  design. 
Based on the non -clinical studies, the primary  areas of interest for GSK1278863 are 
related to GI tolerability  (e.g., stomach erosions with bleeding) and potential for 
thrombosis and/ortissue ischemia secondary  to excessive erythropoiesis.  
In addition, several events of special interest have been identified based on clinical 
experience with ESAs including increased risk of cancer related morbidity  and mortality  
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
20and increased risk of major cardiovascular events (e.g., death, stroke, my ocardial 
infarctio n, congestive heart failure).  
Lastl y based on what is currentl y known of the possible roles for HIF -regulated pathway s 
in mediating h ypoxia associated pathoph ysiology , pulmonary  artery  hypertension , 
cardiom yopath y,and tissue neo -vascularization (e.g., r etinal, joint sy novium) have also 
been identified as areas of special interest. 
Although no relevant safety  findings related to these areas of special interest have been 
noted in animal or clinical studies conducted to date, where appropriate, specific 
eligibility  criteria or monitoring instructions relevant to these theoretical concerns are 
included in the study  protocol.   For example, subjects who are at high risk for thrombotic 
events or malignancy , or who have underl ying significant retinal vascular di sorders, 
significant pulmonary disease (including pulmonary  hypertension), or inflammatory  
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis are not eligible to participate.  
Hematologic parameters will be closely monitored throughout the dosing period with 
guidanc e provided regarding discontinuation of dosing.  Stopping criteria or specific 
suggestions for diagnostic evaluations are also provided for gastrointestinal, visual, 
pulmonary , and joint related adverse events.

ovulation methods) and withdrawal are notacceptable methods of contraception . 
Contraceptive Methods with a Failure Rate of 1%
Oral contraceptive, either combi ned or progestogen alone
Injectable progestogen 
Implants of etonogestrel or levonorgestrel
Estrogenic vaginal ring
Percutaneous contraceptive patches
Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine s ystem (IUS) that meets the <1% failure 
rate as stated in the p roduct label
Documented male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry intothe 
study , and this male is the sole partner for that subject.  For this definition, 
“documented” refers to the outcome of the investigator's /designee’s review of t he 
subject's medical history  for study  eligibility , as obtained via a verbal interview with 
the subject or from the subject’s medical records.
NOTE: These allowed methods of contraception are onl y effective when used 
consistently , correctly  and in accorda nce with the product label.  The Investigator is 
responsible for ensuring subjects understand how to properl y use these methods of 
contraception.

For detail information about dosage and administration, refer to Appendix 5 .
5.3. Subject Specific Dose A djustment/Stopping Criteria
5.3.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria
Liver chemistry  threshold stopping criteria have been designed to assure subject safet y 
and to evaluate liver event etiology  (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical 
liver safet y guidance). 
Study  treatment will be stopped for a subject if the followi ng liver chemistry  stopping 
criteria is met: 
ALT 3xULN
NOTE: Refer to Appendix 1 for details of the required assessments if a subject meets the 
above criteria .
5.3.2. QTc Withdrawal Criteria
A subject that meets an y of the criteria below will be withdrawn from the study .  
The same QT correction formula should be used to determine inclusion and 
discontinuation for an y individual subject throughout the study.  Uncorrected QT 
>600 msec,
Change from baseline:  QTcB or QTcF >60 msec
QTcB or QTcF ≥500 msec (for subjects without underly ing bundle branch block)
For subjects with underlying bundle branch block the following withdrawal criteria 
should be used 
Baseline QTc value (with 
underlying bundle branch block)QTc withdrawal 
criter ia
<470 msec >500 msec
470-480 msec >530 msec
Withdrawal of subjects is to be based on an average QTc value of triplicate ECGs.  If an 
ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, obtain 2 more ECGs over a brief period of 
time and then use the averaged QT c values of the 3 ECGs to determine whether the 
subject should be discontinued from the study.
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
29Note: The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual subject to 
determine eligibility  for and discontinuation from the study .  This formula may  not be 
changed or substituted once the subject has been enrolled.
For example, if a subject is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then QTcB must be 
used for discontinuation of this individual subject as well.
5.3.3. Stopping Criteria
Dosing in the stud y ma ybe stopped if three or more subjects receiving GSK1278863 
experience an y of the safety  criteria listed below.  An individual subject may  also be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor for other 
safet y reasons not liste d below.  
The subject will be followed at the discretion of the Investigator, and the GSK Medical 
Monitor will be notified.  I n the event one or more subjects are withdrawn, additional 
subjects may  be enrolled (upon consultation with the GSK protocol cont act, see Section 
4.1) to ensure an adequate number of subjects complete the study . For an individual study  
participant, stopping criteria include, but are not limited to:
Severe signs or s ymptoms, or significant changes in any  of the safet y 
assessments, that put the safet y of the individual at risk (e.g., ECG, vital signs, 
laboratory  tests, etc), as judged b y the Investigator in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor if necessary .
Pregnancy .
Active GI bleeding or new diagnosis of peptic or duodenal ulcer disease.

requirements.
5.6. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability
A description of the methods and materials required for preparation of GSK1278863 is 
provided in Appendix 5 .
No special preparation of study  treatment is required.
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
31Study  treatment will be dispensed or administered acco rding to procedures described 
herein.  Onl y subjects enrolled in the study will receive stud y treatment.  Only  authorized 
site staff will supply  or administer study  treatment.  
All study  treatment must be stored in a secure area with access limited to the investigator 
and authorized site staff.  Study  treatment is to be stored to up 30C (86F).  Maintenance 
of a temperature log (manual or automated) is required.
The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for stud y treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance.  
The Investigator or the head of the medical institution (where applicable), or designated 
site staff (e.g., storage manager, where applicable) must maintain study  treatm ent 
accountability  records throughout the course of the study .  The responsible person(s) will 
document the amount of study  treatment received from and returned to GSK and the 
amount administered to subjects.  The required accountability  unit for this stud y will be 
tablet.  Discrepancies are to be reconciled or resolved.  Procedures for final disposition of 
unused study  treatment are listed in the Appendix 5 .
GSK1278863 is not expected to pose significant occupational safet y risk to site staff 
under normal conditions of use and administration.  Take adequate precautions to avoid 
direct ey e or skin contact.  
In the case of unintentional occupational exposure notify  the study  monitor, GSK 
Medical Monitor and/or protocol c ontact.  
A Material Safety  Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational 
hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the 
investigator, where this is required b y local laws, or is available upon request from GSK.   
Precaution will be taken to avoid direct contact with GSK1278863.
5.7. Assessment of Compliance
When the individual dose for a subject is prepared from a bulk supply, the preparation of 
the dose will be confirmed by  a second member of the study  site staff. 
When subjects are dosed at the study site, they will receive stud y treatment directly from 
the Investigator or designee, under medical supervision.  
The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source 
documents.  The dose of study  treatment and study  participant identification will be 
confirmed at the time of dosing b y a member of the study site staff other than the person 
administering the stud y treatment.  
Study  site personnel will examine each subject’s mouth to ensu re that the study  treatment 
was ingested.
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
325.8. Treatment of Study  Treatment Overdose
No specific antidote for GSK1278863 is known. The expected manifestations of 
GSK1278863 overdosage include signs and s ymptoms associated with an excessive 
and/or rapid increas e in Hgb concentration. GSK1278863 is highly  protein bound; thus, 
clearance of GSK1278863 by HD or PD is very  low and these are not effective methods 
to enhance the elimination of GSK1278863. GSK1278863 metabolites are, in part, 
cleared via hemodial ysis. 
In the event of suspected overdose :
collect blood samples for pharmacokinetics and safety  laboratory  immediately .
it is recommended that the appropriate supportive clinical care be instituted, as 
dictated by the subject’s clinical status. Additionally , subjects should be 
monitored closely  for CV events, increased heart rate and hematologic 
abnormalities.
5.9. Treatment after the End of the Study
Subjects will not receive any additional treatment from GSK after completion of the 
study . 
The Investigator is resp onsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post -
study  care of the patient’s medical condition, whether or not GSK is providing specific 
post-study  treatment.
5.10. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies
All concomitant medications (inc luding rhEPO) taken in the 4 weeks before andduring 
thestudy  will be recorded in the eCRF.  The minimum requirement is that drug name, 
dose administered and dates of administration are to be recorded.
In vitro characterization of GSK1278863 distribution and biotransformation has 
identified potential mechanisms for clinical drug- drug interactions.  GSK1278863 is 
primarily  metabolized via the CYP2C8 pathway , with minor involvement of the CYP3A4 
pathway .  Data from a study  (PHI113634) to assess the interacti on potential between 
GSK1278863 and a CYP2C8 inhibitor (gemfibrozil) showed a clinicall y-significant 
increase in GSK1278863 exposure following co -administration.
  In vitro studies showed the potential for inhibition of CYP2C8 (I C50: 21 µM) by  
GSK1278863, while there was no evidence of concentration -or metabolism -dependent 
inhibitory  potential towards human CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4.  In a 
recent drug -drug interaction, there was no apparent evidence of a drug interaction 
between GSK1278863, at doses up to 100 mg, with pioglitazone, a CYP2C8 substrate.
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
33GSK1278863 was also observed to be an inhibitor of organic anion transporting 
polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 in vitro with IC 50s of ~6 μM and ~11 μM, 
respectivel y.  The average Cmax observed afte r single dose administration of 5 mg 
GSK1278863 to healthy  subjects was 0.24 μM, suggesting a low risk of an interaction. In 
a recent drug- drug interaction, there was no apparent evidence of a drug interaction 
between GSK1278863, at doses up to 100 mg, with rosuvastatin , an OATP1B1 substrate.
GSK1278863 is a substrate of human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in vitro.  
Therefore, there may  be the potential for interactions when GSK1278863 is co-
administered with drugs which are inhibitors of human-B CRP, however, GSK1278863 
has moderate to high passive permeabilit y, potentially mitigating an y BCRP inhibition 
effects.
5.10.1. Permitted Medications
Paracetamol or Acetaminophen, at doses of ≤ 2 grams/day  is permitted for use from 48 h 
prior to the first dose of GSK1278863 and until completion of follow -up procedures. 
Use of low dose ( ≤325mg/day ) aspirin/acety lsalicy lic acid is permitted for the durat ion of 
the study  (from Screening to the follow -up visit at the end of the study ).
Concomitant medications other than specified in Section 5.10 may be considered on a 
case b y case basis by the Investigator in con sultation with the GSK Medical Monitor.
Subjects receiving HRT and other drugs not specifically  prohibited (see Section 5.10.2 ) 
are permitted to continue while on study .  
5.10.1.1. Inhibitors of BCRP
Medications that are inhibitors of BCRP will be permitted in the study .  These 
medications include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole.
5.10.1.2. Non-Drug Therapies
Calcium, Vitamin D, and other vitamins and minerals may  be permitted at the discretion 
of the Investi gator or his/her designee.  Refer to Study Procedural Manual (SPM) for an 
extended list. 
5.10.2. Prohibited Medications and Non- Drug Therapies
5.10.2.1. Supplements
Subjects must abstain from taking supplements (with the exception of vitamin or 
minerals), within 7 day s (or 14 day s if the drug is a potential enzy me inducer) or 5 half -
lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of GSK1278863 until completion of the 
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
34follow -up visit, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor it will not interfere 
with the st udy. 
5.10.2.2. NSAIDs
Chronic use of NSAIDs will notbe permitted with the exception of low dose 
(≤325mg/day) aspirin/acety lsalicy lic acid for the duration of the study  (from Screening to 
the follow-up visit at the end of the stud y). 
5.10.2.3. Immunosuppressants
Immunosuppressant drugs and drugs used to treat malign ancies (including corticosteroids 
at doses >10 mg prednisolone per day  or equivalent) within 2 weeks of first dose of 
GSK1278863 are specifically prohibited from Screening through the follow -up visit.   
Note: Failed transplant subjects who are on peritone al dial ysis are eligible for 
participation in this study  but should not be on immunosuppressive medications within 3 
months prior to Screening.
5.10.2.4. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C8
The primary  route of metabolism of GSK1278863 involves CYP2C8.
Strong i nhibit ors and inducers of CYP2C8 are prohibited from 14 day s prior to the first 
dose of GSK1278863 until 7 day s after the last dose of GSK1278863.  These medications 
include gemfibrozil, rifampin/rifampicin, pheny toin, hy perforin supplements (e.g., St 
John’s Wor t), Phenobarbital/phenobarbitone .
6. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES
This section lists the procedures and parameters of each planned study assessment.  The 
exact timing of each assessment is listed in the Time and Events Table Section 6.1. 
Whenever vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal 
time, the assessments should occur in the following order: 
12-lead ECG
vital signs
blood draws
The timing of the assessments is required to allow the blood draw to occur as close as 
possible to the nominal time.
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety  
concerns.  Therefore, adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those 
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
35specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 6.1), are essential and required for stud y 
conduct.
The timing and number of planned study  assessments and procedures may  be altered 
during the course of the study  based on newl y available data (e.g., to obtain data closer to 
the time of peak plasma concentrations) to ensure appropriate monitoring. 
The change in timing or addition of time points for any  planned stud y assessments must 
be approved and documented in a Note to File wh ich is approved by  the relevant GSK 
study  team member and then archived in the study sponsor and site study  files.  This will 
not constitute a protocol amendment. 
The I RB/IEC will be informed of any  safet y issues that require alteration of the safet y 
moni toring scheme or amendment of the Informed Consent Form (I CF). 
Additional safet y tests (such as vital signs, ph ysical exams, and clinical laboratory  tests) 
may also be obtained during the course of the study  based on newl y available data, to 
ensure approp riate safet y monitoring.  
No more than 500 mL  of blood will be collected over the duration of the study , 
including an y extra assessments that may  be required.
Refer to Appendix 3 for details regarding PK sample time w indows that will not be 
regarded as protocol deviations.
During the Follow -up Period, deviations of up to +2 day s for clinical research unit visits 
will not be regarded as Protocol Deviations.
The actual date and time will be recorded for all procedures an d the Investigator will 
make every  effort to perform procedures at the scheduled nominal dates and times.

406.2. Demographic/Medical History  Assessments
The following demogra phic parameters will be captured: date of birth (only  year), 
gender, race and ethnicity.
Medical/medication/alcohol history  will be assessed as related to the eligibility  criteria 
listed in Section 4.2.  
Baseli ne assessments are defined as the last pre -dose timepoint of each assessment 
(except ECG, which will be the average of the 3 ECGs obtained at that timepoint).
6.3. Safet y
Planned timepoints for all safet y assessments are listed in the Time and Events Table 
(Section 6.1).  
Additional time points for safet y tests such as vital signs, ph ysical exams and laboratory  
safet y tests may be added during the course of the study  based on newl y available data to 
ensure appropriat e safet y monitoring.
6.3.1. Physical Exams
A complete physical examination will include assessments of the head, ey es, ears, 
nose, throat, skin, thy roid, neurological, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen (liver and 
spleen), l ymph nodes and extremities.  
Height and we ight will also be measured and recorded.
A brief physical examination will include assessments of the skin, lungs, 
cardiovascular s ystem, and abdomen (liver and spleen).
6.3.2. Vital Signs
Vital sign measurements will be measured in supine position after 5 min rest and 
will include sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, body  temperature, and pulse rate.
6.3.3. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
12-lead ECGs will be obtained at each timepoint during the stud y using an ECG 
machine that automatically  calculates the heart rate and meas ures PR, QRS, QT, and 
QTc intervals.  
Subjects are required to rest quietly  at supine position for at least10 min before and 
during each ECG reading (subjects should remain comfortable).  
Repeat measurements may  be performed if there are any  clinical abn ormalities observed 
or if artifacts are present.

41Below is the number of ECGs will be obtained at each timepoint:
Screening :  Three ECGs will be taken, at least 5 min apart. Take average of the three 
intervals to determine subject eligibility .    
Day -1:  Three ECGs will be taken, at least 5 min apart. The average of the intervals 
from the three ECGs will determine the baseline (HR, PR, QRS, QTc).  
Day 17: A single ECG will be taken.
Refer to Section 5.3.2 for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc readings that may  
be necessary .
6.3.4. Clinical Laboratory  Assessments
Blood samples for Clinical Laboratory Assessments will be collected in the fasted state 
during the stud y at the time points indicated in the Time a nd Events Table (Section 6.1).  
Subjects are to be fasted for a minimum of 6 h prior to blood sample collections.
If screening results suggest that the blood sample was obtained without an appropriate 
fasting pe riod, the clinical chemistry  may  be repeated once at the Investigator discretion.
The total volume of blood collected for planned Clinical L aboratory  Assessments, 
pharmacod ynamic and pharmacokinetic assessments from all subjects will not exceed 
500 mL during the entire study  period.

(M5), GSK2531398 (M6), and GSK2531401 (M13) will be collected on the day s listed in 
Section 6.1, Time and Events Table.  
On Day 1:
After mixing, approximately  1.5 mL aliquot of dialy sate from the last drained dwell prior 
to GSK1278863 dosing will be collected (aliquot for APD subjects may be collected 
from automated cy cler drain /drain bag).
On Day 14:
All drained dial ysate will be collected over a 24 h period, starting at the time of 
GSK1278863 dosing.  The volume of each drained dwell needs to be recorded, and an 
aliquot taken for anal ysis.
CAPD subjects: After mixing and measu rement of drained dial ysate volume, 
approximately  1.5 mL aliquot of dialy sate from each drained dwell will be collected.
APD subjects: After mixing and measurement of drained dial ysate volume, 
approximately 1.5 mL aliquot of dialy sate from the cy cler drain bag (and any  manual 
peritoneal dial ysis exchanges during the day ) will be collected.
Details of PK dialy sate sample processing, storage and shipping procedures are provided 
in the SPM.
6.4.3. Sample A nalysis
All samples will be shipped at the end of dosing perio d and appropriatel y analyzed for 
plasma or dial ysate GSK1278863 and metabolite concentrations and protein binding (free 
fraction, plasma if technically  feasible) using validated methods.
Once the plasma has been anal yzed for GSK1278863 and metabolites, and protein

44The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Details of PD 
blood sample collection, processing, storage, and shipping procedures are provided in the 
SPM.
6.6. Pharmacogenetics
Information regarding pharmacogenetic (PGx) research is included in Appendix 2
The I RB/IEC and, whe re required, the applicable regulatory  agency  must approve the 
PGx assessments before these can be conducted at the site.  
In some cases, approval of the PGx assessments can occur after approval is obtained for 
the rest of the stud y.  If so, then the writ ten approval will clearl y indicate approval of the 
PGx assessments is being deferred and in most cases, the study , except for PGx 
assessments, can be initiated.  
When PGx assessments will not be approved, then the approval for the rest of the study  
will c learly indicate this and therefore, PGx assessments will not be conducted.
7. ADVERSE EVENTS, SERI OUS ADV ERSE EVENTS, 
PREGNA NCY A ND MEDICA L DEVICES INCIDENTS
7.1. Adverse Events (AE) and Serious A dverse Events (SA Es)
The Investigator or site staff is responsible f or detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
7.1.1. Time period for collecting A E and SA E information
AEs will be collected from the start of Study  Treatment and until the follow -up contact.  
Medical occurrences that be gin prior to the start of study  treatment but after obtaining 
informed consent may  be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions 
CRF.
SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs.  However, any  
SAEs assessed as r elated to study  participation (e.g., protocol -mandated procedures, 
invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded 
from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including an y 
follow -up co ntact.  All SAEs will be recorded and reported to GSK within 24 h, as 
indicated in Appendix 4 . 
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the Investigator le arns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time after a 
subject has been discharged from the stud y, and he/she considers the event reasonabl y 
related to the stud y treatment or study participation, the investigator would promptly 
notify  GSK.
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
45NOTE: The method of, recording, evaluating and follow -up of AEs and SAEs plus 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSK are provided in 
Appendix 4 .
7.1.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introd uce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open- ended 
and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  Appropriate questions include:
“How are you feeling?” 
“Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact
 “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since 
your last visit/contact?” 
7.1.3. Definition of A dverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subjec t, 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
NOTE : An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product.  
Events meeting the definition of an AE include :
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the Investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre- existing condition includi ng either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possibl e suicidal/self -
harming intent.  This should be reported regardless of sequelae.).
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
46Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments that are associated wit h the underl ying disease, unless judged by  the 
Investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more seve re than expected for the subject’s 
condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
7.1.4. Definition of Serious A dverse Events
If an event is not an AE per Section 7.1.3 , then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , 
death due to progression of disease, etc).
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
NOTE:  In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained 
(usually  involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency  ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are 
AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from ba seline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , or
NOTE:  The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y min or medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may  
interfere or prevent everyday  life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
47e.Is a congenita l anomal y/birth defect
f.Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These should also be considered 
serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intens ive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of 
drug dependency  or drug abuse.
g.Is associated with liver injury  and impaired liver function def ined as:
ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xUL N (>35% direct), or
ALT 3xULN and INR**> 1.5. 
* Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if 
unavailable, measure urinary  bilirubin via dipstick.  If fractionation is una vailable 
and ALT 3xUL N and total bilirubin  2xUL N, then the event is still to be reported 
as an SAE.
** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply  to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.  If INR measurement is obtained, t he value is to be 
recorded on the SAE form.
7.1.5. Cardiovascular Events
Investigators will be required to fill out event specific data collection tools for the 
following AEs and SAEs:  
Myocardial infarction/unstable angina
Congestive heart failure
Arrh ythmias
Valvulopathy
Pulmonary  hypertension
Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack
Peripheral arterial thromboembolism
Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism
Revascularization
This information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascula r eCRF within one week 
of when the AE/SAE(s) are first reported.
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
487.1.6. Death Events
In addition, all deaths, whether or not they  are considered SAEs, will require a specific 
death data collection tool to be completed.  The death data collection tool includes 
questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and 
noncardiovascular death.
This information should be recorded in the specific death eCRF within one week of when 
the death is first reported.
7.1.7. Prompt Reporting of SA Es to GSK
Once the inves tigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, 
the SAE will be reported to GSK within 24 h.  Any follow -up information on a 
previously  reported SAE will also be reported to GSK within 24 h.
If the investigator does not have all i nformation regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to 
receive additional information before notify ing GSK of the event and completing the 
appropriate data collection tool.  The investigator will alway s provide an assessment of 
causality at the time of the i nitial report as described in Appendix 4 .
7.1.8. Regulatory  Reporting Requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification of SAEs by  the investigator to GSK is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards t he safet y of subjects are met.
GSK has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authorit y and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation.  GSK will 
comply  with country  specific regulatory  requirem ents relating to safet y reporting to 
regulatory  authorities, IRBs/IECs and Investigators.  
Investigator safety  reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory  requirements and GSK policy  and are forwar ded 
to Investigators as necessary .  An Investigator who receives an Investigator safet y report 
describing an SAE(s) or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of 
SAEs) from GSK will file it with the IB and will notify  the IRB/IEC, if ap propriate 
according to local requirements.
7.2. Pregnancy
7.2.1. Time period for collecting pregnancy  information
All pregnancies in female subjects will be collected after the start of dosing and until the 
time period that is 5 terminal half- lives after the last dose .
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
497.2.2. Action to be taken if pregnancy  occurs
The Investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any  female subject, who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study .  The Investigator will record pregnancy  
information on the appropriate form and subm it it to GSK within 2 weeks of learning of a 
subject's pregnancy .  The subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy .  Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK.  
Generally , follow -up will be no lo nger than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  
date.  An y premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for m edical reasons will be recorded 
as an AE or SAE.
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such.  
Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -study  pregnancy  and is considered 
reasonabl y related to GSK1278863 by the Investigator, will be reported to GSK as 
described in Section 7.1.7 .  While the I nvestigator is not obligated to actively  seek this 
information in former study  participants, he or she may  learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.
Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue 
GSK1278863.
8. DATA MANAG EMENT
For this study  subject data will be entered into GSK defined electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs), transmitted electron ically to GSK and combined with data provided from other 
sources in a validated data system.
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable GSK 
standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data, e.g., r emoving 
errors and inconsistencies in the data.  Adverse events and concomitant medications 
terms will be coded using MedDRA ( Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities) and 
an internal validated medication dictionary , GSKDrug.  eCRFs (including queries and 
audit trails) will be retained by  GSK, and copies will be sent to the I nvestigator to 
maintain as the Investigator copy .  Subject initials will not be collected or transmitted to 
GSK according to GSK policy .
9. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERA TIONS

509.1. Hypotheses and Treatment Comparisons
This study  is designed to estimate pharmacokinetic endpoints of GSK1278863 and 
metabolites in ESRD patients undergoing peritoneal dialy sis following repeat 
administration of 5 mg once dail y GSK1278863.  
There will be two cohorts of subjects in this study : subjects with CAPD and subjects with 
APD.  
No formal statistical h ypotheses wil l be tested. An estimation approach will be used to 
evaluate the comparisons of interest, with point estimates and associated 90% confidence 
intervals presented to provide a range of plausible values for the comparisons.
9.2. Sample Size Considerations
9.2.1. Sample S ize A ssumptions
As this study  is descriptive in nature and no formal statistical comparisons of PK data 
will be performed, the sample size of 24subjects ( 12in each cohort) will be recruited 
such that at least 8subjects complete the tria l. Based on PK pa rameter CV% of ~50% in 
subjects with renal impairment or ESRD [ refer to GlaxoSmithKline Document Number

against an y immediate hazard.
The sponsor will work with the I nvestigator to ensure the IEC/IRB is notified.
10.3. Qualit y Control (Study  Monitoring)
In accordance with applicable regulations including GCP, and GSK procedures, GSK 
monitors will contact the site prior to the start of the study  to review with the site staff the 
protocol, study  requirements, and t heir responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory, ethical, and 
GSK requirements.  When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also 
include identification, agreement and documentation of data items for which eCRFs will 
serve as the source docu ment.
GSK will monitor the study  and site activity  to verify  that the:
Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected.
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol and any  other 
study  agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory  requirements.
The Investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents
10.4. Qualit y Assurance
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory  requirements, GSK may  
conduct a qualit y assurance assessment and/or audit of the site records, and the regulatory  
agencies may  conduct a regulatory  inspection at any  time during or after completion of 
the study .  In the event of an assessment, audit or inspection, the Investigator (and 
institution) must agree to grant the advisor(s), auditor(s) and inspector(s) direct access to 
all relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to discuss the 
conduct of the study , any findings/relevant issues and to implement any  corrective and/or

200942
5610.5. Stud y and Site Closure
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study , the monitor will conduct site 
closure activities with the Investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with 
applicable regulations including GCP, and GSK procedures.
In addition, GSK reserves the right to temporarily  suspend or prematurel y discontinue 
this study  at any  time for reasons including, but not limited to, safety  or ethical issues or 
severe non -compliance.  For multicenter studies, this can occur at one or more or at all 
sites.  I f GSK determines such action is needed, GSK will discuss this with the 
Investigator or the head of the medical institution (where applicable), including the 
reasons for taking such action.  When feasible, GSK will provide advance notification to 
the Investigator or the head of the medical institution, where applicable, of the impending 
action prior to it taking effect.
If the study is suspended or prematurely discontinued for safet y reasons, GSK will 
promptly  inform Investigators or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) 
and the regulatory  authorities of the suspension or pre mature discontinuation of the study  
and the reason(s) for the action.  If required b y applicable regulations, the Investigator or 
the head of the medical institution (where applicable) must inform the I RB/I EC promptl y 
and provide the reason for the suspension or premature discontinuation.
10.6. Records Retention
Following closure of the study , the Investigator or the head of the medical institution 
(where applicable) must maintain all site study  records, except for those required by  local 
regulations to be mainta ined by  someone else, in a safe and secure location.  The records 
must be maintained to allow eas y and timel y retrieval, when needed (e.g., audit or 
inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow an y subsequent review of data in 
conjunction with assessment of the facility , supporting s ystems, and staff.  Where 
permitted by  local laws/regulations or institutional policy , some or all of these records 
can be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, 
electronic); however, caution ne eds to be exercised before such action is taken.  The 
Investigator must assure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate 
copy  of the original, and meet accessibility  and retrieval standards, including re -
generating a hard cop y, if requ ired.  Furthermore, the I nvestigator must ensure there is an 
acceptable back -up of these reproductions and that an acceptable qualit y control process 
exists for making these reproductions.
GSK will inform the I nvestigator of the time period for retaining t hese records to comply  
with all applicable regulatory  requirements.  The minimum retention time will meet the 
strictest standard applicable to that site for the study , as dictated by  any institutional 
requirements or local laws or regulations, or GSK stand ards/procedures; otherwise, the 
retention period will default to 15 y ears.
The Investigator must notify  GSK of any  changes in the archival arrangements, 
including, but not limited to, archival at an off- site facility  or transfer of ownership of the 
records in the event the Investigator leaves the site.

5710.7. Provision of Study  Results to Investigators, Posting of 
Information on Publically  Available Clinical Trials Registers 
and Publication
Where required b y applicable regulatory requirements, an Investigator sign atory will be 
identified for the approval of the clinical study report.  The Investigator will be provided 
reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the 
opportunity  to review the complete study  results at a GSK si te or other mutually -
agreeable location.
GSK will also provide the Investigator with the full summary  of the stud y results.  The 
Investigator is encouraged to share the summary  results with the study  subjects, as 
appropriate.
GSK will provide the Investiga tor with the randomization codes for their site only  after 
completion of the full statistical analy sis.
The results summary  will be posted to the Clinical Study  Register no later than eight 
months after the final primary  completion date, the date that the final subject was 
examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the 
primary  outcome.  In addition, a manuscript will be submitted to a peer reviewed journal 
for publication no later than 18 months after the last subject’s last visit (L SLV).  When 
manuscript publication in a peer reviewed journal is not feasible, a statement will be 
added to the register to explain the reason for not publishing.  
A manuscript will be progressed for publication in the scientific litera ture if the results 
provide important scientific or medical knowledge.

The procedures listed below are to be followed if a subject meets the liver chemistry 
stopping criteria defined in Section 5.3.1:
Immediately  withdraw the subject from study  treatment 
Notify  the GSK medical monitor within 24 h of learning of the abnormality to 
confirm the subject’s study  treatment cessation and follow -up.
Complete the “Safet y Follow -Up Procedures” listed below.
Complete the liver event case report forms.  If the event also meets the criteria of an 
SAE (see Section 7.1.4 ), the SAE data collection tool will be completed separatel y 
with the relevant details.
Upon completion of the safet y follow- up withdraw the subject from the study  unless 
further safet y follow up is required

Safety Follow -Up Procedures for subjects with A LT 3xULN and total bilirubin 
2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin); or ALT 3xULN and INR1> 1.5:
This event is considered an SAE (see Section 7.1.4 .  Serum bilirubin fractionation 
should be performed if testing is a vailable. If fractionation is unavailable, urinary  
bilirubin is to be measured via dipstick (a measurement of direct bilirubin, which 
would suggest liver injury).
Make every  reasonable attempt to have subjects return to the clinic within 24 h for 
repeat li ver chemistries, additional testing, and close monitoring (with specialist or 
hepatology  consultation recommended).
Monitor subjects twice weekl yuntil liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within bas eline values.
In addition, for allsubjects with ALT 3xULN, every attempt must be made to also 
obtain the following:

6312.2. Appendix 2: P harmacogenetic research
Pharmacogenetics –Background
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is the study  of variability in drug response due to hereditary  
factors in populations.  There is increasing evidence that an individual's genetic 
background (i.e., genot ype) may  impact the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, elimination), pharmacod ynamics (relationship between concentrations and 
pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) and/or clinical 
outcome (in terms of efficacy  and/o r safety  and tolerability ).  Some reported examples of 
PGx associations with safety /adverse events include:
Drug Disease Gene Variant Outcome
Abacavir HIV 
[Hetherington ,
2002; Mallal , 
2002; 
Mallal ,2008]HLA-B* 57:01 
(Human 
Leukocyte 
Antigen B)Carriage of the HLA -B*57:01 variant has been 
shown to increase a patient's risk for 
experiencing hypersensitivity to abacavir.  
Prospective HLA -B*57:01 screening and 
exclusion of HLA -B*57:01 positive patients 
from abacavir treatment significantly 
decreased the incidence of abacavir 
hypersensitivity.  Treatment guidelines and 
abacavir product labeling in the United States 
and Europe now recommend (US) or require 
(EU) prospective HLA -B*57:01 screening prior 
to initiation of abacavir to reduce the incidence 
of abacavir hypersensitivity.  HLA -B*57:01 
screening should supplement but must never 
replace clinical risk management strategies for 
abacavir hy persensitivity.

Regulators, including the US FDA and the 
Taiwanese TFDA, have updated the 
carbamazepine drug label to indicate that 
patients with ancestry in genetically at risk 
populations should be screened for the

64Drug Disease Gene Variant Outcome
Irinotecan Cancer 
[Innocenti , 2004; 
Liu, 2008; 
Schulz , 2009]UGT1A1*28 Variations in the UGT1A1 gene can influence 
a patient’s ability to break down irinotecan, 
which can lead to increased blood levels of the 
drug and a higher risk of side effects. A dose 
of irinotecan that is safe for one patient with a 
particular UGT1A1 gene variation might be too 
high for another patient without this variation, 
raising the risk of certain side -effects that 
include neutropenia following initiation of 
Irinotecan treatment.  The irinotecan drug 
label indicates that individuals who have two 
copies of the UGT1A1*28 variant are at 
increased risk of neutropenia.  A genetic blood 
test is available that can detect variations in 
the gene.    
A key  component to successful PGx research is the collec tion of samples during the 
conduct of clinical studies.
Collection of whole blood samples, even when no a priori hy pothesis has been identified, 
may enable PGx anal ysis to be conducted if at any time it appears that there is a potential 
unexpected or unexp lained variation in response to [insert the name of the study  
treatment]. 
Pharmacogenetic Research Objectives
The objective of the PGx research (if there is a potential unexpected or unexplained 
variation) is to investigate a relationship between genetic factors and response to 
GSK1278863 .  If at an y time it appears there is potential variability  in response in this 
clinical study  or in a series of clinical studies with GSK1278863, the following objectives 
may be investigated – the relationship between ge netic variants and stud y treatment with 
respect to:
Pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacod ynamics of study  treatment
Safety  and/or tolerability 
Efficacy
Study Population
Any subject, who is enrolled in the clinical study , can participate in PGx research.  Any  
subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from 
the PGx research.
Subject participation in the PGx research is voluntary  and refusal to participate will not 
indicate withdrawal from the clinical study  or result in any  penalty  or loss of benefits to 
which the subject would otherwise be entitled.

65Study Assessments and Procedures
Blood samples can be taken for Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction and used in 
PGx assessments.
In addition to any  blood samples taken for the c linical study , a whole blood sample 
(~6ml) will be collected for the PGx research using a tube containing EDTA.  I t is 
recommended that the blood sample be taken at the first opportunity  after a subject has 
been randomized and provided informed consent for PGx research, but may be taken at 
any time while the subject is participating in the clinical study .
The PGx sample is labelled (or “coded”) with a study  specific number that can be 
traced or linked back to the subject b y the investigator or site staff.  Coded samples 
do not carry  personal identifiers (such as name or social securit y number).  The 
blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due 
to inability  to utilize the original sample.  
The DNA extracted from the blood sample may  be subjected to sample quality  control 
analysis.  This anal ysis will involve the genot yping of several genetic markers to confirm 
the integrit y of individual samples.  If inconsistencies are noted in the analysis, then those 
samples may  be d estro yed.
The need to conduct PGx anal ysis may  be identified after a study  (or a set of studies) of 
GSK1278863 has been completed and the clinical study  data reviewed.  In some cases, 
the samples may  not be studied; e.g., no questions are raised about how people respond to 
GSK1278863.
Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject 
completes the study  or GSK may  destro y the samples sooner.  GSK or those working 
with GSK (for example, other researchers) will use samples collected from the study  for 
the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form.  
Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any  time.
Subject Withdrawal from Study
If a subject who has consented to participate in PGx research withdraws from the clinical 
study  for any  reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a choice 
of one of the following options concerning the PGx sample, if alread y collected:
Continue to participate in the PGx research with th e PGx sample retained for 
analysis 
Withdraw from the PGx research and destro y the PGx sample 
If a subject withdraws consent for PGx research or requests sample destruction for an y 
reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to re quest sample 
destruction within the timeframe specified b y GSK and maintain the documentation in 
the site study  records. The investigator should forward the Pharmacogenetic Sample 
Destruction Request Form to GSK as directed on the form. This can be done at any time 
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
66when a subject wishes to withdraw from the PGx research or have their sample destro yed 
whether during the stud y or during the retention period following close of the main study .
Screen and Baseline Failures
If a blood sample for PGx research has been collected and it is determined that the 
subject does not meet the entry  criteria for participation in the clinical study, then the 
investigator should instruct the participant that their PGx sample will be destroy ed. No 
forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent 
and sample reconciliation process.  In this instance a sample destruction form will not be 
available to include in the site files.
Pharmacogenetics A nalyses
Pharmacogenetics Anal yses
1.Specific gene s may  be studied that encode the drug targets, or drug mechanism of 
action pathway s, drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters or which may  
underpin adverse events, disease risk or drug response. These candidate genes may  
include a common set of ADME (A bsorption, Distribution, Metabolism and 
Excretion) genes that are studied to determine the relationship between gene 
variants or treatment response and/or tolerance. 
In addition, continuing research may  identify  other enzy mes, transporters, proteins or 
receptors that may  be involved in response to [insert the name of the study  treatment].  
The genes that may  code for these proteins may  also be studied.
2.Genome -wide scans involving a large number of poly morphic markers (e.g., single 
nucleotide poly morphisms) at defined locations in the genome, often correlated with 
a candidate gene, may  be studied to determine the relationship between genetic 
variants and treatment response or tolerance. This approach is often employ ed when 
a definitive candidate gene(s) does not exist and/or the potential genetic effects are 
not well understood. 
If applicable and PGx research is conducted, appropriate statistical anal ysis methods will 
be used to evaluate pharmacogenetic data in the context of the other clinical data. Results
of PGx investigations will be reported either as part of the main clinical study  report or as 
a separate report. Endpoints of interest from all comparisons will be descriptively  and/or 
graphicall y summarized as appropriate to the data.  A detailed descrip tion of the anal ysis 
to be performed will be documented in the study  reporting and anal ysis plan (RAP) or in 
a separate pharmacogenetics RAP, as appropriate.  
Informed Consent
Subjects who do not wish to participate in the PGx research may  still participa te in the 
clinical study .  PGx informed consent must be obtained prior to an y blood being taken for 
PGx research.

67Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality  of Subject’s PGx Data
GSK may  summarize the PGx research results in the clinical study  report, or separatel y, 
or may  publish the results in scientific journals. 
GSK does not inform the investigator, subject, or any one else (e.g., family  members, 
study  investigators, primary  care ph ysicians, insurers, or emplo yers) of individual 
genot yping results t hat are not known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the 
time of the study , unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information 
generated from PGx studies is generall y preliminary in nature, and therefore the 
significance and scientific validity  of the results are undetermined.

6912.4. Appendix 4: Procedures for Detection, Evaluation, Follow -
Up and Reporting of A dverse Events and Medical Device 
Incidents
Recording of A Es and SA Es
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentati on (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event.  The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE in the appropriate data collection tool. 
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical 
records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK, AE/SAE data collection tool.  
However, there may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y GSK.  In this instance, all sub ject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission 
of to GSK.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clini cal information.  I n such cases, the diagnosis will be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.
Subject -completed health outcomes questionnaires and the collection of AE data are 
independent components of the study .  Responses to eac h question in the health outcomes 
questionnaire will be treated in accordance with standard scoring and statistical 
procedures detailed b y the scale’s developer.  The use of a single question from a 
multidimensional health survey  to designate a cause -effec t relationship to an AE is 
inappropriate.
Evaluating AEs and SA Es
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories:
Mild:  An e vent that is easily  tolerated by  the subject, causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal every day 
activities.
Severe:  An event that prevents normal every day activities.
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE.  Severity  is a 
category  utilized for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it mee ts at least one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE.
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
70Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  A "reasonable possibility " ismeant to convey  that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship 
cannot be ruled out.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship.  Alternative causes, such as natural h istory  of the underl ying diseases, 
concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study  treatment will be considered and investigated.  The investigator will also consult 
the Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Pro duct Information, for marketed products, in the 
determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may  be situation s when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK.  However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality  for every  event prior to the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to GSK.  The investigator may change his/her opinion of 
causality  in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE data collection tool 
accordingl y.  The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory  reporti ng requirements.
Follow -up of A Es and SA Es
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All AEs and SAEs will be followed until 
resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until 
the subject is lost to follow -up.
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as may  be indicated or as requested by  GSK to 
elucidate a s fully  as possible the nature and/or causality  of the AE or SAE.   The 
investigator is obligated to assist.  This may  include additional laboratory  tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health care 
professional s.  If a subject dies during participation in the study  or during a recognized 
follow -up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post -mortem 
findings, including histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the origina lly completed data collection 
tool.  The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to GSK within the designated 
reporting time frames.
Reporting of SA Es to GSK
The primary  mechanism for reporting SAEs to GSK will be the electronic data collection 
tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for greater than 24 hr, the site will use the 
paper SAE data collection tool and fax it to the GSK Medical Monitor and/or protocol 
2013N179529_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200942
71contact.  Then the site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electroni c system 
as soon as it becomes available.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., 
InForm s ystem) will be taken off- line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to 
existing data.  If a site receives a rep ort of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives 
updated data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has 
been taken off -line, the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to their 
GSK protocol contact b y telephone.
GSK contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page.
Facsimile transmission of the SAE data collection tool is the preferred method to transmit 
this information to t he project contact for SAE receipt.  I n rare circumstances and in the 
absence of facsimile equipment, notification by  telephone is acceptable, with a copy  of 
the SAE data collection tool sent by  overnight mail.  I nitial notification via the telephone 
does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE data 
collection tool within the designated reporting time frames.
GSK contacts for SAE receipt can be found at this beginning of the protocol on the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Info rmation page.
In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by  
telephone is acceptable, with a cop y of all required information sent by overnight mail.

Section 4.3.2 Meals and Dietary  Restrictions
It was stated that subjects would not consume an y food and drinks (except water) during

one of study  sites, some subjects on peritoneal dialy sis are very  hungry  after they  finish 
night portion therap y on peritoneal dial ysis cycler. This is most likely  due to the 
relativel y high insulin dose required to mitigate high dextrose content in the peritoneal 
dialy sis fluid needed to achieve adequat e ultrafiltration . Thus this section was revised to 
allow subjects to have some light snacks during this 4 h fasting period after dosing.

REVI SED TEXT
The effective date of the original protocol is 11- APR -2014. In the 2 years that the study  
has been active, onl y 4 subjects have completed the study. This includes 1 CAPD and 3 
APD subjects. Considering the difficulties with recruitment in genera l, and the CAPD 
population in particular, this protocol will be amended to enroll ESRD subjects 
undergoing peritoneal dialy sis of either modality  (i.e., CAPD or APD). In addition, in a 
previous study  (PHI115573), the pharmacokinetic properties of daprodus tat and the 
predominant metabolites were able to be adequately characterized in an ESRD population 
undergoing hemodial ysis with 8 subjects. Finally , preliminary  results from this study  has 
shown that a subject using CAPD had similar PK to the 3 subjects u sing APD suggesting 
that, if there are differences in the PK of daprodustat depending upon the peritoneal 
dialy sis modality , they  are likely  to be not considered clinicall y significant.

(0-τ) (Day 14), of GSK1278863 and metabolites for each cohort will be performed 
separately  after a log transformation of the data. 
A mixed effect model will be fitted with day  as fixed effects and subject as a random 
effect.  Day  14 AUC (0- τ) will be compared to Day  1 AUC (0- ∞) by  cohort in order to 
estimate the time invariance ratios, R S=AUC (0 -τ, Day  14): AUC (0- ∞, Day  1). The 
ratios will be calculated by  back -transforming the difference between the LS means. 
Using the pooled estimate of variance, 90% confidence intervals will be calculated for the 
primary  comparisons, and back -transformed to the original scale.

To evaluate the time invariance ratio, statistical analy sis of (AUC (0- ∞) Day  1) and AUC 
(0-τ) (Day 14), of GSK1278863 and metabolites for both the cohorts combined will be 
performed after a log transformation of the data. 
A mixed effect model will be fitted with day  as fixed effects and subject as a random 
effect.  Day  14 AUC (0- τ) will be compared to Day  1 AUC (0- ∞) in order to estimate the 
time invariance ratios, R S=AUC (0 -τ, Day  14): AUC (0- ∞, Day  1). The ratios will be 
calculated b y back -transforming the difference between the LS mean s. 
Using the pooled estimate of variance, 90% confidence intervals will be calculated for 
Rs, and back-transformed to the original scale.

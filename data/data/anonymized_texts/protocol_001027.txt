2.1.
The purpose of this open-label, extension study is to evaluate the long-term safety of repeated 
MT10109L treatment of GL and/or LCL in participants with moderate to severe GL, LCL, or 
both (GL and LCL) who completed the lead-in pivotal Phase 3 studies (MT10109L-001, -002,
- 005, and -006) over an additional 24 months.
The clinical development program for MT10109L in the treatment of GL and LCL includes 
4 pivotal Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
clinical studies. Each of these studies will provide the primary safety and efficacy data for 
MT10109L treatment of GL (Studies MT10109L-001 and -005) and LCL 
(Studies MT10109L-002 and -006). Participants completing these studies will be eligible to 
enroll into the current 24-month open-label extension study (Study MT10109L-004) and 
continue their treatment of GL, LCL, or both GL and LCL.
2.2.
Glabellar lines are deep furrows or frown lines in the glabellar area of the face and LCL (or CFL) 
are horizontal smile lines by the sides of the eyes. Both types of facial lines result from the 
repetitive functional action of the underlying mimetic facial musculature during animation 
(Blitzer 1993). When injected at therapeutic doses, MT10109L produces partial chemical 
denervation of the muscle, resulting in localized reduction in muscle activity. Because GL and 
LCL result from muscular activity, the muscle relaxation leads to a temporary relief of facial 
lines. While it was previously thought that these facial lines were structural and permanent, the 
effects of these injections demonstrate the lines are part functional and remain because of 
constant muscle tone ( Ferreira 2004; Garcia 1996).
The development of facial lines (such as GL and LCL) is an age-related change of the face that 
occurs because of the repetitive muscle contractions that are associated with common facial 
expressions. Thus, these facial lines can be observed with contraction (dynamic rhytides) or in 
more severe cases in repose (static rhytides). Increasing severity in the appearance of facial lines 
has been associated 
self-esteem and sense of well-being (Koblenzer 1996 ). Furthermore, the appearance of these 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5
MT10109L
17
facial lines can lead to a miscommunication of an emotional state of anger, anxiety, disapproval, 
or sadness ( Khan 2001) causing distress and affecting social interactions ( Finn 2003).
The popularity of BoNT/A cosmetic treatment of LCL and GL in adults is related to its proven 
efficacy for reducing moderate to severe facial lines ( Beer 2006 ); well documented safety profile 
(Brin 2009); and positive impact on psychological well-being and the resulting psychosocial 
benefits (Finn 2003).
The purpose of this open-label, extension study is to evaluate the long-term safety of repeated 
MT10109L treatment of GL and/or LCL in participants with moderate to severe GL, LCL, or 
both (GL and LCL) who completed the lead-in pivotal Phase 3 studies (MT10109L-001, -002,
- 005, and -006) over an additional 24 months. This information will supplement the primary 
safety and efficacy data from the 4 pivotal lead-in Phase 3 studies. Together with their lead-in
Phase 3 study participation, participants who complete this study will provide up to 3 years of 
continuous treatment exposure data.

2.3.
Generally, the popularity of BoNT/A cosmetic treatment of GL and LCL in adults is related to its 
proven efficacy for reducing moderate to severe facial lines ( Beer 2006 ); well documented safety 
profile ( Brin 2009 ); and positive impact on psychological well -being and the resulting 
psychosocial benefits ( Finn 2003 ).
In some cases, botulinum toxin effect may be observed beyond the site of local injection. The 
symptoms may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, eyelid ptosis, 
dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. Swallowing 
and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to 
distant spread of toxin effects with other BoNT/A treatments for noncosmetic indications. The 
risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also 
occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions.
Reduced blinking after BoNT/A product injection to the orbicularis muscle can lead to corneal 
exposure, persistent epithelial defect, and corneal ulceration with perforation. In the use of 
another BoNT/A product for treatment of blepharospasm, 1 case of corneal perforation in an 
aphakic eye requiring corneal grafting has occurred because of this effect.

withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, 
or administrative reasons. 
 If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
 See the SoA  for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and 
for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
7.3. 
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the study site for a required 
study visit: 
 The study site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon 
as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study. 
 Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant
methods). These contact attempts will be documented in the participant . 
 Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Appendix 1.

8.2.1.
The investigator will question the participant to ascertain whether any adverse events were 
experienced since the previous visit. Additionally, at treatment visits, the participants will be 
observed for 30 minutes following study intervention. All pertinent information regarding 
adverse events (ie, date of onset and stop, duration, outcome, severity, relationship to study 
intervention, action or treatment required) will be obtained and recorded in the source documents 
and appropriate eCRF page.
8.2.2.
Pulse rate (beats per minute): Participants are to be seated for at least 2 minutes, and pulse 
rate will be counted over 60 seconds and recorded in the source document and eCRF as 
beats per minute.
Blood pressure (mm Hg): Participants are to be seated for at least 2 minutes, and 
systolic/diastolic blood pressure will be measured.
Respiration rate (breaths per minute): Participants are to be seated for at least 2 minutes, and 
breaths will be counted for 30 seconds and multiplied by 2.

or more fre discretion.
8.2.4.
Suicidal risk monitoring is not applicable for this study.
8.3.
The definitions of an adverse event or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
Adverse events will be reported by the participant.
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an adverse event or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up adverse events that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study 
procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7).
The following expected adverse drug reactions are based on BOTOX clinical trial data for the 
treatment of GL and LCL ( Tables 8-1 and 8-2, respectively).

aData are based on BOTOX lateral canthal lines clinical trial data ( BOTOX Cosmetic US Package Insert, 2017 )
The adverse drug reactions of eyelid edema, eyelid ptosis, facial pain, facial paresis, and 
muscular weakness with BOTOX are usually mild in severity, reversible, and have a low 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5
MT10109L
42
incidence. Therefore, no treatment for these reactions is recommended. If these reactions are 
moderate or severe, medical help should be sought as needed.
8.3.1.
All adverse events will be collected from the signing of the ICF at the timepoints specified in the 
SoA (Section 1.3), and as observed or reported spontaneously by study participants until 30 days 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention, but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded in the adverse event section of the eCRF.
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF study at the timepoints specified in the 
SoA (Section 1.3), and as observed or reported spontaneously by study participants, until at least 
12 weeks after the last administration of MT10109L intervention. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
inAppendix 3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 
24 hours of it being available.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek adverse event or SAE information after 
conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers 
the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator 
must promptly notify the sponsor.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of adverse events and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
8.3.2.
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or SAEs. Open-ended 
and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
adverse event occurrences.
8.3.3.
After the initial adverse event/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All TEAEs including SAEs, AESIs (Section 8.3.6), and 
TEAEs that lead to study discontinuation will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3).
 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5  
MT10109L 
43 
 
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the adverse event or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals. 
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the 
investigator will provide the sponsor with a copy of any postmortem findings including 
histopathology. 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. 
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information. 
8.3.4. 
 Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
 The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators.  
 Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory 
requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
 An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review 
and then file it along with the ochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements. 
8.3.5. 
 Urine pregnancy testing will be conducted for women of childbearing potential prior to each 
study intervention and at the study exit visit. See Appendix 7 for detailed information on 
definition of women of childbearing potential, use of contraceptives, and pregnancy.  To minimize the risk of pregnancy, all women of childbearing potential must agree to use a 
highly effective or acceptable contraception method (Appendix 7) consistently and correctly 
throughout the duration of the study. For participants of childbearing potential in Germany 
and Belgium , only highly effective contraception methods are allowed for this study. 
 Women who test positive for urine pregnancy test will NOT receive further intervention and 
will be discontinued from the study.  
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5
MT10109L
44
Women who test positive for urine pregnancy test must complete end-of-study procedures 
and be followed up for pregnancy outcome.
Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for the procedure
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 7.Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) or genetic abnormalities (whether leading to an elective 
abortion or not) are considered SAEs.
8.3.7.Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study 
intervention as per instructions in the protocol. Medication errors generally fall into 4 categories 
as follows:
Wrong study intervention
Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount)
Wrong route of administration
Wrong participant (ie, not administered to the intended participant)
Medication errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study intervention.
Overdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study intervention given per 
administration or per day that is above the maximum recommended dose according to the 
reference safety information or protocol for the study intervention or comparator as applicable. 
See Section 8.4 for information on the treatment of overdose. 
Underdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study intervention given per 
administration or per day that is under the minimum recommended dose according to the

Overdose of MT10109L is a relative term and depends upon dose, site of injection, and 
underlying tissue properties. Signs and symptoms of overdose are likely not to be apparent 
immediately postinjection. Excessive doses may produce local, or distant, generalized and 
profound neuromuscular paralysis.
Because MT10109L is administered as injections by physicians, for this study, the chance of 
overdose is extremely low. Should accidental injection or oral ingestion occur, or overdose be 
suspected, the participant should be medically monitored for up to several weeks for progressive 
signs or symptoms of systemic muscular weakness that could be local or distant from the site of 
injection, which may include ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria, generalized weakness, or 
respiratory failure. For GL or LCL, eyelid ptosis, diplopia, and vision blurred are known local 
effects of the toxin. These participants should be considered for further medical evaluation and 
appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted, which may include hospitalization.
If the musculature of the oropharynx and esophagus is affected, aspiration may occur, which may 
lead to development of aspiration pneumonia. If the respiratory muscles become paralyzed or 
sufficiently weakened, intubation and assisted respiration may be necessary until recovery takes 
place. Supportive care could involve the need for a tracheostomy and/or prolonged mechanical 
ventilation, in addition to other general supportive care.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should educate the participant, monitor the course of 
overdose, contact the MSP as needed, document the quantity of the excess dose, associated 
adverse events as well as the duration of the overdose in the eCRF.8.5.

A 2-stage assay approach will be used for the detection of binding antibodies against MT10109L 
will be screened for the presence of binding antibodies using the validated ELISA in a 3-tier 
format (screening, confirmation, and titering). The screen positive serum samples will be 
subsequently immunodepleted to confirm that the binding antibodies are specific to MT10109L
and titered to assess the extent of antibodies present. In Stage 2, only samples that are confirmed 
positive in the ELISA will be tested for neutralizing antibodies to MT10109L.

AE Definition
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related 
to the study intervention.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of study intervention.
.
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
Any abnormal safety assessments (eg, vital signs measurements), including those that 
worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease); for 
example:
The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or
The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5  
MT10109L 
57 
 
 The test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol-specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy, and/or 
 The test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or sponsor. 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE 
or SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
 Lack of efficacy or failure of expected pharmacological action per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, 
the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as AEs or SAEs if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
 
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Merely 
repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not 
require recording as an AE. 
 The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms (clearly 
defined) of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
 
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE 
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital) 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5  
MT10109L 
58 
 
10.3.2. 
SAEs must meet both the AE criteria described above and the seriousness criteria listed below. 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
a. Results in death 
b. Is life threatening 
The term life threatening  in the definition of serious  refers to an event in which the participant 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or intervention 
Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospitalization for elective intervention of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity 
 
life functions. 
 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5  
MT10109L 
59 
 
f. Other situations: 
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious. 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive intervention in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
10.3.3. 
AE and SAE Recording 
 When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all  
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event. 
 The investigator will then record all relevant AE or SAE information in the eCRF. 
 It is not  
records to the sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE or SAE eCRF page. 
 There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to the 
sponsor.  The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5  
MT10109L 
60 
 
Assessment of Intensity 
MILD A type of adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living. 
MODERATE A type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the 
research participant. 
SEVERE A type of adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or 
significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic 
intervention. 
An event is defined as serious  when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 
Assessment of Causality 
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and 
each occurrence of each AE or SAE. 
 A reasonable possibility  of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
 The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated. 
 The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment. 
 For each AE or SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE or SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
 There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.  The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MT10109L-004 AMD 5
MT10109L
61
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
See Section 8.3.3
10.3.4.
SAE Reporting
In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone 
is acceptable with a copy of the SAE form, sent by overnight mail or courier service.
Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete 
and sign the SAE form within the designated reporting time frames.

Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below). 
Women in the following cate gories are not considered WOCBP: 
1. Premenarchal 
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
 Documented hysterectomy 
 Documented bilateral salpingectomy 
 Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 
3. Postmenopausal female 
 A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
 Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to continue to 
use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods from the 
lead-in study if they wish to continue their HRT during the current study.

sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective 
method of contraception should be used.
Sexual Abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.

Table 10-2 Acceptable Contraceptive Methods
Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure of more than 1% per year include:
Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of 
action
Male or female condom with or without spermicide 
Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide
Nonhormonal intrauterine device
A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) 
are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.10.7.3.
Pregnancy testing, with a sensitivity of  will be performed according to 
instructions provided in the pregnancy test kit .
WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highly 
sensitive urine pregnancy test at Day 1 and, if a participant meets retreatment criteria, a
negative urine pregnancy test prior to retreatment.
Additional pregnancy testing is not required during the study intervention period.
Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected.
10.7.4.
Female Participants Who Become Pregnant 
The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate 
form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours
The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
investigator will collect follow-up information on the participant and the neonate, and the 
information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for 
longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy 
will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication 
for the procedure.
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication 
will be reported as an AE or SAE. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, ectopic pregnancy) or genetic 
abnormalities (whether leading to an elective abortion or not) are always considered to be an 
SAE and will be reported as such. Any poststudy pregnancy-related SAE considered 
reasonably related to the study intervention by the investigator will be reported to the

sponsor as described in Section 8.3.4. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek 
this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.  
 Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention and be withdrawn from the study.

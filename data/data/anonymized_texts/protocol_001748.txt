16 1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Protocol Title:  
A MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE -BLIND, PLACEBO -CONTROLLED STUDY 
EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF DEUCRAVACITINIB ON Q UALITY OF LIFE 
 
IN 
PARTICIPANTS  
WITH
 
PLAQUE PSORIASIS IN A COMMUNITY SETTING
 
(ARTISTYK)
 
Brief Title: 
Randomized, double
-blind, placebo 
-
controlled study to evaluate the effect of 
deucravacitinib on quality of l ife 
in participants with plaque psoriasis in a community setting
 
Rationale:  
SOTYKTU™ ( deucravacitinib ), a first 
-
in-class, oral, selective, allosteric tyrosine 
kinase
 
2 
(TYK2) inhibitor  is approved in multiple countries 
for the treatment of adults with moderate
-to-
severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 
Th
ese approval s 
were
 
based on the results of the 52-week, randomized, Phase  
3, placebo 
-
controll ed studies of 
deucravacitinib 6 mg daily v 
ersu
s placebo and apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID) (POETYK 
PSO-1 and PSO -2). 
In these 2 Phase 3 studies, in addition to achieving both co -primary clinical efficacy endpoints 
(Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [ PASI] 75 and 
static Physician Global Assessment 
[s-PGA 
]
 0/1), deucravacitinib  also improved Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI ) scores. 
Mean changes from baseline in DLQI were greater for deucravacitinib as early as Week 1 versus 
placebo in PSO -1 (-3.67 vs 
-
2.18) and PSO -2 (-3.49 vs 
-
2.82) and Week 4 versus apremilast in 
PSO-1 (-5.63 vs 
-
4.83) and Week 8 in PSO -2 (-7.35 vs 
-
6.31). More deucravacitinib 
-
treated 
patients achieved ≥ 
 
4-point improvement on DLQI meaningful change threshold (MCT ≥  
4) at 
Week  
16 versus placebo
-treated and apremilast -treated patients in PSO -1 (77.6% vs 43.4% and 
68.8%, respectively) and PSO -2 (78.6% vs 44.9 % and 69.3%). 
 
Similarly,  h
igher responses versus 
apremilast were maintained through Week 24 in PSO -1 (79.5% vs 67.9%) and PSO -2 (79.2% vs 
67.5%). In PSO -1, 81.6% achieved MCT ≥  
4 at Week 52 with continuous deucravacitinib 
treatment. Results were similar wh en applying an MCT ≥  
5. Higher DLQI 0/1 responses were seen 
with deucravacitinib vs apremilast and placebo arms at Week 16 in POETYK PSO -1 (40.7% vs 
28.6% vs 10.6%) and POETYK PSO -2 (38.0% vs 23.1% vs 9.8%). 
Better 
DLQI 0/1 responses 
were also noted at 
W
ee
k 24 in deucravacitinib vs apremilast in POETYK PSO
-1 (47.8% vs 24.2%) 
and PSO -2 (38.0% vs 23.1%). At Week 52, 46.1% of patients in POETYK PSO -1 maintained their 
DLQI 0/1 score.

Overall Design:  
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, 
double
-blind placebo- controlled study 
comparing 
the 
effect  of deucravacitinib v 
ersu
s placebo  on QoL in patients with 
moderate
-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis and impaired HR QoL. Participants  will undergo screening evaluations within 28 
 days
 
prior to administration of study 
intervention
 to determine eligibility . Following the screening 
process, approximately 17 
4 
participants
 will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to  either deucravacitinib 
6 mg 
once daily (
QD
)
 
or placebo, respectively
. 
 
 
 
 
It is estimated that 
approximatel
y 90% of randomized 
participants
 (ie, 
approximately 156 
participants
) would have baseline s -PGA scores ≥ 
 3.
 
The duration of study participation is approximately 60 weeks  and will be divided into the 
following periods: screening (up to 4 weeks), treatment (52 weeks), and follow -up (4 
weeks).
 
At Week  
16, all participants regardless of their blinded intervention, will be switched to open 
-
label 
deucravacitinib 6 mg QD bottles through Week 52. Participants and investigators remain blinded 
to double -blind placebo -controlled period study intervention until the end of the study at Week 52. 
Participants will be followed up for safety for 4 additional weeks, from Week 52 through Week  56. 
Participants who discontinue study intervention early/withdraw prematurely must complete the 
end of treatmen t visit. The participant will be asked to return to the clinic to complete the 28 -day 
safety follow -up visit and encouraged to report any 
serious 
adverse events 
or 
adverse events 
experienced during this time.  
Number of Participants:  
It is estimated that ap proximately 250 
enrolled
 participants will be required to achieve 
174 randomized. Approximately 17 4 participants will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to 
deucravacitinib 6 mg Q D or placebo matching deucravacitinib QD, respectively.

21 Statistical Methods : 
There are 2  population groups of interest in this study. The 
Overall Population consists of a
ll 
participants who wer e randomized to 
any treatment arm. The 
s-PGA 
 
≥
 
3 Sub 
-
Population consists 
of all participants who were randomized to any treatment arm in the study with s -PGA ≥ 3 at 
baseline.  
The 2 primary hypotheses will be tested simultaneously with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 
(2-sided). If either of the test results is not statistically significant (ie, at least one of null hypotheses 
is not rejected), then it is deemed that the study objective is not met. 
Key secondary endpoints will 
be tested in a hierarchical order only if the primary endpoint achieved statistical significance at the 
2-sided 0.05 level on both the Overall Population a nd the s -P G A  ≥  3  S u b -Population. A 
hierarchical test may proceed to the next key secondary endpoint only if both null hypotheses 
within a key secondary endpoint are rejected.  
The analysis model for the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary binary endpoin t will use 
stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel tests 
 
 
to compare the response rates of 
deucravacitinib
 6 
mg QD to 
placebo. If expected cell counts are not sufficient for each strata level, then strata levels will be 
combined for the analysis. Non 
-responder 
imputation will be used for binary endpoints for 
participants who discontinue early or who have otherwise missing endpoint data at the specified 
timepoint . Sensitivity analyses to be performed for the primary endpoint will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan . 
The analysis model for the continuous secondary endpoint will use analysis of covariance with 
study intervention 
 
. The baseline value will be added into the model as 
a covariate. Intervention differences based on least -squares means and the corresponding 2 
-sided 
95% confidence i ntervals will be provided for the difference between 
deucravacitinib
 6 
mg QD 
and placebo. 
For the continuous secondary efficacy endpoint, multiple imputation will be used for missing data. 
 
The primary analysis at 
Week
 
16 will occur once all randomized 
participant
s completed their 
Week  
16 visit or discontinued prior to 
Week
 
16. Analyses of the collected efficacy and safety data 
through W eek 16 will be performed. A final analysis will be performed after all 
participant
s 
complete the final safety follow -up visit at Week  56 or post-discontinuation follow- up visit.

22 Data Monitoring Committee  and Other Committees : 
A Data Monitoring Committee will not be used in the study. 
 
This study will use an external Study 
Steering 
Committee
. 
Brief Summary:  
The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the effect of deucravacitinib on QoL 
in patients with 
moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis . The study will also 
compare the efficacy and safety of 
deucravacitinib to placebo in participants with mode rate-to-severe 
 
plaque psoriasis 
 
.
 This will be a randomized, double -blind placebo 
-
controlled study 
 
across multiple 
centers in a community setting . 
The study will compare improvement in QoL in participants treated with 
deucravacitinib
 to those 
treated with placebo during the first 16 weeks. This improvement is defined as DLQI 0/1 score 
and will be assessed at Week 16. The primary 
hypotheses
 are
 
that the odds of achieving DLQI 0/1 
score at Week 16 in participants receiving 
deucravacitin
ib 6 mg QD are improved compared to 
participants receiving placebo  in both the Overall Population and the s -PGA ≥ 3 Sub-Population 
. 
In addition, the proportion of participants at Week 
 
16 who achieve a 
≥
 4-point reduction from 
baseline in DLQI, the change from baseline in whole -body itch Numerical Rating Scale score at 
Week  
16, and the proportion of participants 
wi
th s-PGA 
 
≥ 3 at base li
ne 
who achieve s -PGA 
 
0/1 at 
Week  
16 will also be assessed. Similar assessments for improvement and maintenance of response 
will be performed at Week  52 
The duration of study participation is approximately 
 
60 weeks and will be divided into the 
following p eriods: screening (up to 4 weeks), treatment (52 weeks), and follow -up (4 weeks). 
Following the initial screening study visit, subsequent visits will occur at 
 
Week −2 , Day 1, Week  1, 
Week  
2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 28, 
Week 32, Week
 40, 
Week  52, 
and Week
 56. 
Participants who have completed the screening procedures and have met the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 2:1 ratio to either 
deucravacitinib 
6 mg QD
 
or placebo, 
respectively , for the fi 
rst 16 weeks.
 At Week  
16, all participants, regardless of their blinded 
intervention, will be switched to open 
-
label deucravacitinib  6 mg QD bottles through Week 
 52. 
Participants and investigators will remain blinded to the double -blind study intervention until the 
end of the study.

Plaque Psoriasis  
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder, characterized primarily by erythematous scaly 
plaques, that affects up to 3% of the general population. Men and women are equally affected, and 
it can present at any age.1,2 Several studies have observed a bimodal distribution of psoriasis onset 
with the  first peak ranging from 15 to 22 years of age, and the second peak ranging from 55 to 
60 years of age.3,4,5 The most common form of psoriasis (58% to 97%) is plaque psoriasis 
(psoriasis vulgaris), with less common variants being guttate, pustular, inverse (flexural), and 
erythrodermic psoriasis. The disease can have a fluctuating relapsing course, with flares that may 
be induced by factors such as infections, trauma, smoking, and stress.3 Psoriasis can involve skin 
in any part of the body; particularly disabling is the involvement of specific anatomic regions, such 
as hands and feet (palmoplantar), face, scalp, genital , and nails. Psor iasis has been associated with 
major changes in patients’ psychosocial, emotional, and physical functioning. Psoriasis may impact patients’ lives as much or more than other major medical conditions.  These may include 
psychological stress, embarrassment, st igma , and physical discomfort, which are not reflected in 
objective measures of skin disease severity (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [ PASI ], body s urface 
area [BSA] , static Physician Global Assessment [s- PGA]) . Over time, these may result in 
significant worsening in overall emotional well-being, social functioning, productivity at work or 
school, self -care activities and self -esteem may worsen. Furthermore, the quality of life (QoL) of 
patients with psoriasis affecting sensitive areas may be disproportionately impacted relative to the 
affected area.
6 For example, the presence of lesions in highly visible areas can affect a patient’s 
self-esteem, whereas involvement of the palms can make activities of daily living challenging. 
Nail or hand psoriasis can be a financial burden due to reduced workplace productivity. Scalp 
psoriasis is frequently associated with pain, itching, and bleeding, and is associated with a 
disproportionate impact on QoL and psychosocial impa irment.6 
Clinician -reported outcomes for disease severity (PASI, BSA, and s- PGA) may not adequately 
capture patients’ lived experience of the disease. Patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures may 
provide complementary information, allowing clinicians to better understand the patient’s unique experience of living with psoriasis, which could facilitate individualized treatment . Evaluating 
patients with c linician -reported outcomes  (BSA or PASI) or PRO measures alone could lead to an 
incomplete understanding of disease severity, which may lead to undertreatment or 
overtreatment.
7,8,9 
Importantly, correlation between Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), which is a standard 
tool to assess the impact of psoriasis on patients’ QoL in clinical studie s, and PASI in patients with 
BSA <  10% has not been fully determined. Furthermore, the National Psoriasis Foundation survey 
(2003 to 2011) revealed that 30% of patients  with 3% to  10% BSA received treatment solely with 
topical medications and 24% to  36% of psoriasis patients felt that they were untreated. Many 
patients with BSA <  10% (range: 7.1% to 8.4% ) report a large  impact on their QoL  (DLQI range: 
10.2 to  12.2).10,11

Date: 25-May-2023 34 Treatments for psoriasis include topical preparations  (eg, corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues,  
calcineurin inhibitors, salicylic acid, urea, and coal tar ); phototherapy modalities, including 
broad- band and narrow -band ultraviolet (UV) B; and systemic therapies. In moderate- to-severe 
disease, systemic treatments are usually needed and may include oral agents (retinoids, 
methotrexate, cyclosporine, and apremilast) or injectables (eg, biologics such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF ] inhibitors etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) anti–interleukin [ IL]-12/23p40 
antibody [ ustekinumab ], IL-17 antagonists [secukinumab, ixekizumab, and brodalumab] , and 
anti– IL-23p19 antibody [guselkumab, tildrakizumab and risankizumab ]. Many of these treatments 
are associated with increased risk of adverse events (AEs) such as hepatotoxicity and neutropenia 
(methotrexate);
12 nephrotoxicity (cyclosporine);13 depression and weight loss (apremilast);14 
serious infections (cytokine inhibitors);15,16,17,18 and candidiasis and Crohn’s disease (IL -17 
antagonist s).18,19,20 
Although effective therapeutic options are available, under treatment or nontreatment of psoriasis 
has been reported in up to half of surveyed patients (based on absence of treatment and/ or 
dissatisfaction with treatment).11 Many patients with moderate- to-severe disease are still being 
managed with only topicals,4,21 and many patients consider their psoriasis treatment to be 
inadequate. Accordingly, there remains a need for more  effective oral options, when compared 
with currently  available agents, that would improve efficacy responses , increase adherence to 
treatment and improve various domains of patients’ QoL . 
3.1 Study Rationale 
SOTYKTU™ (deucravacitinib), a first- in-class, oral,  selective, allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 
(TYK2) inhibitor  is approved in multiple countries for the treatment of adults with moderate -to-
severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Th ese approvals 
were based on the results of completed 52- week, randomized, Phase 3, placebo -controlled studie s 
of deucravacitinib  6 mg daily (BMS -986165) versu s placebo and apremilast 30  mg twice daily 
(BID) (POETYK PSO -1 and PSO-2).  
In these 2 Phase 3 studies, in addition to achieving both co -primary clinical efficacy endpoints 
(PASI  75 and s -PGA 0/1), deucravacitinib  also improve d DLQI scores.  Mean changes from 
baseline in DLQI were greater for deucravacitinib as early as Week 1 versus placebo in PSO -1 
(-3.67 vs -2.18) and PSO -2 (-3.49 vs - 2.82) and Week 4 versus apremilast in PSO -1 (-5.63 vs -4.83) 
and Week 8 in PSO -2 (-7.35 vs - 6.31). More deucravacitinib- treated patients achieved ≥ 4-point 
improvement on DLQI meaningful change threshold (MCT ≥  4) at Week  16 versus 
placebo -treated and apremilast -treated patients in PSO -1 (77.6% vs 43.4% and 68.8%, 
respectively) and PSO -2 (78.6% vs 44.9% and 69.3%). Similarly, h igher responses versus 
apremilast were maintained through Week 24 in PSO -1 (79.5% vs 67.9%) and PSO -2 (79.2% vs 
67.5%). In PSO -1, 81.6% achieved MCT ≥  4 at Week 52 with continuous deucravacitinib 
treatment. Results were similar when applying an MCT ≥  5. Higher DLQI 0/1 responses were seen 
with deucravacitinib vs apremilast and  placebo arms at Week 16 in POETYK PSO -1 (40.7% vs 
28.6% vs 10.6%) and POETYK PSO -2 (38.0% vs 23.1% vs 9.8%). Better DLQI 0/1 responses 
were also noted at W eek 24 in deucravacitinib vs apremilast in POETYK PSO -1 (47.8% vs 24.2%)

Background 
 
TYK2 is a  nonreceptor tyrosine kinase associated with receptors for the p40 -containing cytokines 
IL-12 and IL -23, as well as the Type I interferon (IFN) receptor, and is required for the activation 
of their downstream signaling pathways. TYK2 catalyzes the phosphor ylation of the intracellular 
receptor domains and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins resulting in 
the activation of STAT -dependent transcription and functional responses specific for these 
cytokines.22,23,24 Because TYK2 -dependent cytokines (eg, Type I IFNs, IL -12, IL -23) are distinct 
from those dependent on closely related Janus kinase (JAK) family members JAK1/JAK3 
(eg, 
IL
-2, IL -15, IL -7) or JAK2 (eg, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, GM -CSF), a TYK2 inhibitor 
would b 
e expected to have a 
distinctly different effects than
 inhibitors of other JAK family kinases. 
TYK2 -dependent pathways and the cytokine networks they modulate (eg, IL -23/IL -17, IFNα) 
have been implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple immune -mediated d iseases, including 
psoriasis, lupus, spondylarthritis, and Crohn’s disease.  
Deucravacitinib  is a potent, highly selective, oral, small molecule inhibitor of TYK2. 
A 
comprehensive in vitro and in vivo characterization of 
deucravacitinib 
has been established  and 
supports the development of this compound in humans. Inhibition of TYK2 is expected to provide 
therapeutic benefit for participants with psoriasis for multiple reasons: 1) Many of the pathways

36 in the TYK2 signaling cascade (IL -23 and the downstream me diators IL -17 and IL -22; IFNα) are 
involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.21 2) Biologic agents targeting the IL -17, IL -23p19, and 
IL-12/23 p40 pathways have been approved for and are highly efficacious in the 
treatment
 of

3.2.1  Clinical Development  
The clinical development program for 
deucravacitinib
 consists of multiple studies in healthy 
volunteers, participants with renal or hepatic insufficiency, and participants with psoriasis, 
alopecia areata, 
psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, 
lupus nephritis, Crohn’s disease, 
and ulcerative colitis.  
In adult participants with moderate -to-severe psoriasis, 
1 
Phase 2 study (IM011011) and 
2 
Phase 
 3 
studies (IM011046 and IM011047) have been completed. Study IM011011 was a 12 
-week, 
randomized, place bo-controlled study conducted with 5 
deucravacitinib
 intervention arms ranging 
from 3 mg 
every other day 
 
to 12 mg once daily ( QD
)
. Studies IM011046 and IM011047 were 
pivotal, double -blind, placebo 
- 
and active 
-
controlled 52 -week, Phase 3 studies.  Based on these 
studies, SOTYKTU 
™ 
(deucravacitinib), a first 
-
in-class, oral, selective, allosteric TYK2 
inhibitor 
 
was approved in multiple countries 
for the treatment of adults with moderate
-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therap y or phototherapy. 
There are 
2 other 
completed Phase 3 studies for adult participants with moderate 
-
to-severe plaque 
psoriasis (IM011065 
 and IM011066 
) and 
an ongoing 
long-term extension study (IM011075). 
IM011065 is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 52 
-
week study conducted in China, Singapore,

This study ( IM011237 
) is 
a Phase 
 
4, multicenter, randomized, 
double

42 plaque psoriasis will be randomized .  It  is estimated that approximately 90% of 
randomized participants  (ie, approximately 156 participants ) would have baseline s -PGA scores 
≥ 3. 
The duration of study participation is approximately 60 weeks and will be divided into the 
following periods: 
screening (up to 4 weeks), intervention (52 weeks), and safety follow
-up 
(4 
weeks).
 
Physical examination (PE) 
, clinical laboratory evaluations
, and other assessments will be done at 
select visits during the study. Participants in this study will be monitor 
ed for AEs. 
5.1.1 
 
Screening Period 
 
Participants will be evaluated during the screening period (up to 4 weeks/28 days) to ensure they 
meet eligibility criteria. A detailed medical history will be done at this time, as well as a complete 
PE
. Psoriasis
-related hist 
ory, which will include length of diagnosis, 
 s-
PGA 
score, DLQI score , and history of systemic intervention will be assessed 
at Screening.  
 
 
 
If a participant exceeds the 28 -day screening period 
 due 
to a study 
-
related procedure (eg 
, 
waiting 
for a study -related laboratory value), the participant must be re consented . A new participant 
identification number will be assigned by 
i
nteractive response technology (IRT) at the time of 
re-enrollment. In this situation, the fewest number of procedures from the initial screening should 
be repeated to qualify the participant, while maintaining participant safety and eligibility. In these 
cases, the site should consult with the BMS Medical Monitor (or designee).  
5.1.2 
 
Intervention Period 
 
Participants who  have completed the screening procedures and have met the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 2:1 ratio to either 
deucravacitinib
 6 mg QD or placebo, 
respectively.  
Dummy tablets (placebo to 
deucravacitinib 
6 mg tablets) will be administered to participants to 
maintain blinding  (Section  
7.1
).  
All participants will 
receive a 
wristwatch 
to monitor sleep quality for 
14 
days prior to Day 1 to be 
worn for 
14 
days. This wristwatch  will be 
returned
 to the study site  on Day 1 as listed in 
the 
Schedule of A ctivities  (Section  
2
). This wristwatch  will be returned to all participants again on 
Weeks
 
12 and 40 to be worn for 
14 
days prior to Week 16 and 
 
Week  52 and will be returned to 
the study sites as per the 
Schedule of A
ctivities  (Section  
2
)

End of 
Study 
Definition  
The duration of study participation for individual participants is expected to be up to 60 
 
weeks 
(420 
days), which includes screening (up to 4 weeks), intervention (52 weeks) and follow
-up 
(4 weeks) periods. 
The start of the 
study 
is defined as the first visit for the first par 
ticipant screened.
 
The end of 
study 
is defined as the last participant last visit or scheduled procedure shown in the 
Schedule of Activities 
(
Section  
2
) 
for the last participant.
 
Study completion is defined as the final date on which 
data w
ere
 or 
is expected to be collected if 
this is not the same.

Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
 
This Phase 
 
4 study will be conducted in a population of 
participants with stable moderate
-to-severe 
plaque psoriasis 
 
 
who are candidates  for systemic 
psoriasis therapy. Additional key inclusion criteri on is DLQI score > 5, which captures participants 
with moderate -to-severe impact on 
HR 
QoL. The study is designed to compare the 
efficacy  of 
deucravacitinib to placebo in achieving DLQI 0/1 at Week 16. DLQI 0/1 is a standard measure in 
clinical studies  of demonstrating efficacy of systemic psoriasis treatments on QoL. Additio nal 
analyses 
, including formal statistical hypothesis testing,
 will also be performed in the participant 
sub-population with s -PGA ≥ 3 at baseline for s -PGA 0/1 response at 
W
eek 16 
 
 
. s-
PGA 0/1 is a standard measure in clinical trials of demonstrating efficacy 
of systemic psoriasis interventions.  
A placebo arm is included in this study for a short d
uration of 
16 weeks to provide a control for the natural fluctuation of psoriasis activity that may occur and to 
provide a safety standard for comparison. Participants in the placebo arm will be switched to 
deucravacitinib at Week 16 to provide them psoria sis treatment after the endpoints are collected. 
Week  
16 was chosen for the primary endpoint evaluations, as it will allow enough time for 
deucravacitinib to treat psoriasis and is the endpoint used in preceding psoriasis Phase 3 
studies
. 
The purpose of doing a 52 
-
week study is to demonstrate the maintenance of improvement in 
PROs
 
and clinical response. 
 
A randomized, double -blind, placebo 
-control
led study provides the most robust assessment of 
efficacy and safety .

Screen Failures 
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
who 
are no t subsequently randomized  in the study/included in the analysis population.  
A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen 
failure participants, to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
publi
shing 
requirements,  as applicable,  and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes date of consent, 
demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and 
any serious AEs.   
6.4.1 
 
Retesting During 
the 
Screening Period 
 
For laboratory parameters that initially do not meet eligibility requirements, a single retest within 
the 28 
-
day screening period is permitted before participant is declared a screen failure. This is an 
effort to find all possible well 
-
qualified par ticipants. Consultation with the Medical Monitor or 
designee may be needed to identify 
 
whether repeat testing of any parameter would be clinically 
relevant.  
The study permits the rescreening (after the end of the initial 28 -day screening period) of a 
participant who discontinues the study as a pretreatment failure (ie, the participant fails to meet 
eligibility criteria and has not been treated). If re -enrolled, the participant must be reconsented, 
assigned a new identification number, and a full Screening V isit must be performed again. A 
participant can only be rescreened 1 time (ie, if the participant fails 1 rescreening attempt, no 
additional rescreening is allowed). Depending on the timing of rescreening, repetition of some 
assessments may not be required . The fewest number of procedures from the initial screening 
should be repeated to qualify the participant, while maintaining participant safety and eligibility. 
In these cases, the site should consult with the BMS Medical Monitor (or designee).  
 
Duration of existing 
interventions and required discontinuation periods shall be considered relative to the new 
Screening Visit and/or randomization.

7 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, 
procedure(s) or medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the 
study protocol. 
Study intervention includes both i nvestigational [medicinal ] product (IP/IMP) and 
non-investigational [ medicinal ] product (non- IP/non-IMP) as indicated in  Table  7.1-1.  
An IP, also known as IMP  in some regions, is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products 
already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form. 
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care f or a given diagnosis, may be considered as non-IPs.

7.2 Method of Study Intervention Assignment  
Before the study is initiated, each user (at investigative sites) will receive log -in information and 
directions on how to access the IRT system. At the time of the 
S
creening 
V
isit, immediately after 
informed consent is obtained and before any study 
-
relate d procedures are performed, the 
investigative site will access the enrollment option of the IRT system for assignment of a 
participant number for all participants, including participants not subsequently randomized or 
treated. The participant number is ass igned sequentially by the system and will be unique across 
all sites. All enrolled participants will be assigned sequential participant numbers. The participant 
number will not be used for any other participant. If a participant is rescreened, they will be  given 
a new identification number.  
At Day  
1, participants who meet all criteria for enrollment at Screening and Day 1 will be centrally 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
deucravacitinib
 6 mg QD or placebo as determined by a computer -
generated randomization schedule using IRT. The randomization lists will be generated by the IRT 
vendor using a permuted block design within each stratum level.  
 
 
After all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met for a participant, the investigative site will 
access the IRT on Day 1 for the purpose of randomizing a participant. An intervention group will 
be assigned by IRT based on the above -described randomization schedule. In addition, a unique 
kit number will be assigned to the participant corresponding to the intervention assignment.  
Study intervention will be dispensed at study visits as shown in the Schedule of Activities  
(Section  
2
). 
When new intervention kits need to be provided, the investigative site will access the 
IRT to obtain the kit number to assign to the participant. 
At Week 16, all participants, regardless of their blinded intervention, will be switched to open 
-
label 
deucra vacitinib  6 mg QD bottles through Week 52. 
7.3
 
Blinding 
 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
7.3.1 
 
Maintaining the Blind  
Blinded intervention assignments will be managed using IRT. IP supply will be controlled by IRT 
at each visit.  
All table ts are identical in appearance and will be supplied in bottles with each daily dose made 
up of the appropriate combination of active and/or placebo tablets to provide the correct 
intervention, as shown in 
 
Table  7.1-1 
. Investigative site staff, Sponsor and designee personnel, and 
participants and their families will remain blinded to intervention assignments.  
The 
Sponsor and site facing study team will b 
e unblinded to the individual treatment assignments 
at the primary endpoint database lock after the last 
participant 
 
has completed the 
W
eek 
16 visit

Date: 25-May-2023 55 The primary analysis database lock  will occur after all randomized participants completed their 
Week  16 vi sit or discontinued prior to Week 16. The study participants and investigators will 
remain blinded to the initial treatment assignment throughout the study.  
7.3.2 Circumstances for Unblinding 
Blinding of study treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, 
in the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant  in which knowledge 
of the IP  is critical to the participant 's management, the blind for that pa rticipant may be broken 
by the investigator. The participant’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant ’s treatment, the investigator should 
determine that the unblinded information is necessary  (ie, that it will alter the participant ’s 
immediate management ). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to 
the IP, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the participant  is receiving the IP .  
It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor, but the investigator always has ultimate authority for the decision to unblind. The actual task of unblinding can be delegated by the investigator to a designee assigned the task  
on the Delegation of Authority. The Principal Investigator or appointed designee should only call 
in for emergency unblinding after  the decision to unblind the participant  has been documented.  
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is described in the IRT manual.  
In case of an emergency, the investigator has unrestricted access to randomization information via IRT and is capable of breaking the blind through the IRT system without prior approval from the 
Sponsor. After the unblinding, the investigator shall notify the Medical Monitor or designee and/or study director. Participant and unblinded treatment information and the reason for the blind being broken must be recorded on the appropriate study status page of the eCRF. After unblinding via 
IRT, the investigator s hall notify the Medical Monitor or designee. 
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor and ensure every attempt is made 
to minimize additional disclosure  and the impact of unblinding. 
Any request to unblind a participant  for nonemergency purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.  
If a participant  is unblinded for any reason, the partic ipant will be discontinued from treatment.  
7.4 Dosage Modification  
There is no provision for dose modification of study intervention. If a partici pant interrupts 
intervention due to an AE, study intervention can be restarted in consultation with the Medical Monitor or designee.  
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 
The IP must be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is th e responsibility of the 
investigator , or designee where permitted,  to ensure that IP  is only dispensed to study p articipants.

Date: 25-May-2023 56 The IP must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local 
regulations.  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study intervention is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study intervention arise, the study intervention  
should not be dispensed,  and BMS should be contacted immediately.  
Study intervention not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.  
IP documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that includes all processes 
required to ensure the drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of drug 
storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reco nstitution, and use of required 
processes ( eg, required diluents, administration sets).  
• The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepanci es are reported 
and resolved before use of the study intervention.  
• The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
• Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are 
provided in the Study Reference Manual . 
7.6 Treatment Compliance 
When participants self -administer study interve ntion(s) at home, compliance with study 
intervention will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be assessed by direct questioning, 
counting returned tablets, etc , during the site visits and documented in the source documents and 
relevant form. Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the C ase 
Report Form (CRF). 
A record of the quantity of deucravacitinib /placebo dispensed to and administered by each 
participant must be maintained and reconciled with study intervention and c ompliance records. 
Intervention start and stop dates, including dates for intervention delays and/or dose reductions, 
will also be recorded in the CRF.  
7.7 Concomitant Therapy 
7.7.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments 
Prohibited and/or restricted medications tak en during the study are described below. 
• Exposure to any investigational drug, investigational vaccine, or placebo outside of the current 
study. Specifically, participants currently in other interventional studies  for COVID- 19, 
including investigational COVID -19 vaccination studies that are not authorized or approved 
by relevant Health Authorities, should not participate in BMS clinical studies  
• Use of any medications/therapy that would aggravate psoriasis. These include agents such as

Permitted Vaccines ( Including COVID -19 Vaccine)  
Administration of a 
non-
live vaccine is allowed during the study. However, the efficacy and safety 
of non- live vaccines (including 
non-
live COVID 
-
19 vaccines) in participants receiving 
deucravacitinib is unknown. The following are examples of 
non-
live vaccines: inactivated 
vaccines (eg, heat -killed and formalin -killed vaccines), subunit vaccines (eg, influenza and 
pneumococcal vaccines), toxoid vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines that do not encode potentially 
infectious virus (eg, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines) and 
replication -incompetent recombinant vector vaccines (eg, AstraZeneca/University of Oxford 
COVID 
-
19 vaccine).  
For COVI D-19 vaccines requiring more than 1 dose, the full series (eg, both doses of a 2 
-dose 
series) should be completed 30 days prior to enrollment. Ideally, AEs attributable to a vaccine 
should have resolved prior to enrollment. 
If a participant receives a COVI D-19 vaccination during the study, details such as type and date 
of vaccine received should be recorded on the concomitant medication page . For COVID 
-19 
vaccines administered prior to enrollment, the types, details , and dates should be  also recorded on 
the 
appropriate eCRF page.
 
Please contact the Medical Monitor or designee with any questions related to COVID -19 vaccines.

Date: 25-May-2023 60 In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this event. The study treatment will be permanently discontinued. See Section 8. 
All participants who discontinue study intervention should comply with protocol -specified 
follow -up procedures as outlined in Section 2. The only exception to this requirement is when a 
participant withdraws consent for all study procedures, including post -treatment study follow -up, 
or loses the ability to consent freely (eg, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the 
intervention of either a psychiatric or physical illness). 
If study intervention is discontinued prior to the participant’s completion of the study, the reason 
for the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical rec ords per local 
regulatory requirements in each region/country and entered on the appropriate CRF page. 
8.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation from Study Intervention 
Temporary study intervention discontinuation is only allowed if the participant develops an AE 
which, i n the opinion of the investigator, indicates that it is in the participant’s best interest that 
the study intervention be placed on hold. Study intervention in this situation should be stopped until the AE is medically treated and has resolved per investigator’s  judgement . 
Temporary interruption of study treatment should be implemented in the context of clinical suspicion for SARS -CoV- 2 or a positive diagnostic test for SARS -CoV- 2. When study treatment 
is interrupted in a confirmed case of SARS -CoV- 2, the investigator, in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor, should determine whether the resolution of symptoms alone (ie, without repeat 
diagnostic testing for SARS- CoV- 2) is sufficient to resume study treatment.  
Temporary interruption of study intervention may be considered in the event of SARS -CoV- 2 
vaccination according to local guidelines. To  facilitate reporting of SARS -CoV- 2 events that occur 
during the study, all AEs and SAEs related to SARS -CoV- 2 must be reported from the time of 
consent. In addition, AEs or SAEs will trigger additional data collection through dedicated eCRF pages, which will allow the Sponsor to further evaluate these events. 
Any temporary study intervention discontinuation as well as restart must be documented on the 
corresponding eCRF. 
8.1.2 Post -Study Intervention Study Follow -up 
In this study, efficacy  is a key endpoint of the study. Post -study follow -up is of critical importance 
and is essential to preserving participant safety and the integrity of the study. Participants who 
discontinue study intervention must continue to be followed in this study for collection of outcome 
data as required and in line with Section 5 until the conclusion of the study. 
8.2 Discontinuation From the Study 
Participant s who request to discontinue study intervention will remain in the study and must 
continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is 
when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant  to provide this information.

intervention is not cons idered withdrawal from the study.  
• At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early termination  visit should be 
conducted, as shown in the Schedule of Activities  (Section  2). See the Schedule of Activities  
(Section  2) for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for 
any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
• The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from 
the study at that time . 
• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the S ponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
8.3 Lost to Follow -up 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participant s to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the participant . 
• Lost to follo w-up is defined by the inability to reach the participant after a minimum of 
3 documented phone calls, faxes, or emails , as well as lack of response by participant to 
1 registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical 
records.  
• If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use permissible local methods to 
obtain date and cause of death. 
• If the investigator’s use of third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the 
study has been incl uded in the participant’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor- retained third -party representative to assist site staff with obtaining  the participant ’s 
contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the fo llow-up 
portion of the study.

For several assessments, appropriate training will be provided to investigators and designated 
personnel at sites. Only those individuals trained and certified to perform these assessments 
will be performing them during the study.  
•
 
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the 
samples.  
9.1
 
Efficacy Assessments 
 
Every effort must be made to ensure that the same evaluator(s) complete the 
assessment for each 
participant. If the evaluator(s) is/are unable to complete the evaluation, then a qualified individual 
with overlapping experience may perform the evaluation. Documentation of who performed the 
evaluation is to be recorded in source doc uments. Assessments are to be performed at 
approximately the same time of day throughout the duration of the study. 
Baseline assessments must be performed per protocol (standard of care assessments may not be 
used for baseline). Procedures not specified in 
 
the protocol that are part of standard care may be 
performed if they do not interfere with study procedures; any data arising from such procedures 
are not to be reported in the eCRF.

Investigator -Administered Assessments  
9.1.1.1 
 S
tatic Physician’s Global Assessment 
(s
-PGA)  
The s -PGA 
 
is a 5 -point scale of an average assessment of all psoriatic lesions based on erythema, 
scale, and induration.27 The s -PGA  measure determines psoriasis severity at a single point in time 
(without taking into account the baseline disease condition) as clea r (0), almost clear 
 
(1), mild (2), 
moderate (3), or severe (4). All s -PGA  assessments should be performed by a trained physician 
(eg, dermatologist) or appropriately trained investigator who is experienced in the assessment of 
psoriasis patients. Every eff ort should be made to ensure that the physician or designee who 
performed the s -PGA 
 
evaluations for a 
participant 
 
at randomization performs the s -PGA  for that 
participant  
at all subsequent visits
. 
9.1.1.2 
 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
 
(PASI)
 
The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of psoriatic skin lesions 
(each graded on a 0 –
4 scale), weighted by the area of involvement (head, arms, trunk to groin, and 
legs to top of buttocks).28 The PASI produces a numeric score that can range f rom 0 to 72, with 
higher PASI scores denoting more severe disease activity. The PASI can also be used to assess 
response to treatment. The PASI 50 is the proportion of 
participant
s who experience at least a 50% 
improvement in PASI score as compared with the baseline value. The PASI 75, PASI 90, and 
PASI 100 are defined similarly. BMS will host a training session prior to initiation of the study to 
demonstrate proper PASI scoring. Al l PASI assessments should be performed by a trained 
physician (dermatologist) or appropriately trained investigator who is experienced in the 
assessment of psoriasis patients 
. 
9.1.1.3 
 
Body Surface Area 
 
(BSA)
 
Measurement of psoriasis BSA involvement is estimated us ing the handprint method with the size 
of a participant 
’s handprint (including fingers and thumb) representing 1% of BSA involved.29,30,31 
The total BSA = 100% with breakdown by body region as follows:  
Head and neck = 10% (10 
 
handprints), upper extremitie
s = 20% (20 handprints), trunk 
including axillae and groin = 30% (30 handprints), lower extremities including 
buttocks = 40% (40 handprints).  
All BSA assessments should be performed by a dermatologist or appropriately trained investigator 
who is experienc ed in the assessment of psoriasis patients.

For this assessment in participants with scalp involvement,32 scalp lesions are evaluated in terms 
of clinical signs of redness, thickness, and scaliness and scored on the following 5- point ss -PGA 
scale:   
0 = absence of disease, 1 = very mild disease, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 
 4 = severe disease.  
The ss- PGA should be performed by a dermatologist or appropriately trained investigator who is 
experienced  in the assessment of psoriasis patients.  
9.1.1.5 Physician Global Assessment -Fingernails (PGA -F) 
In this asses sment,33 the overall c ondition of the fingernails is rated on a 5- point scale:  
0 = clear, 1 = minimal, 2 =  mild, 3 = mode rate, and 4 = severe. 
The Physician Global Assessment -Fingernails (PGA-F) will be performed only in participants  
with psoriatic fingernail involvement to assess severity and subsequent improvement. The PGA -F 
should be performed by a dermatologist or appropriately training investigator who is experienced 
in the assessment of psoriasis patients.  
9.1.1.6 Palmoplantar PGA  (pp-PGA)  
This measure will be used for participants  with palmoplantar involvement.34 The palmoplantar 
Physician Global A ssessment (pp-PGA ) uses a 5 -point (0- 4) scale:  
0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; and 4  = severe .  
The pp- PGA should be performed by a dermatologist or appropriately trained investigator  who is 
experienced in the assessment of psoriasis patients.  
9.1.1.7 Intertriginous- area s-PGA (I-s-PGA)  
The intertriginous- area s- PGA (I-s-PGA)  is a 5-point scale of an average assessment of 
intertriginous  psoriatic lesions based on erythema, scale, and induration.35 It is not necessary that 
all 3 criteria be fulfilled. The I-s- PGA score is based on a combination of erythema and the 
secondary features ( plaque elevation and/or scale). Since erythema is the most robust finding, it 
should be the dominant feature influencing the I -s-PGA rating in the majority of cases.  This 
intertriginous -area specific s- PGA measure determines psoriasis severity at a single point in time 
(without taking into account the baseline disease condition) as clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2), 
moderate (3),  or severe (4) . Intertriginous skin, also known as skin folds, are sites  in which 
opposing skin surfaces come into contact while at rest, resulting in chronic skin occlusion. The primary intertriginous skin areas include the groin folds, axillae, gluteal cleft and perianal area . 
Body habitus may contribute to additional intert riginous sites, such as inframammary skin and 
abdominal folds. All I-s-PGA assessments should be performed by a trained physician 
(eg, dermatologist) or appropriately trained investigator who is experienced in the assessment of 
psoriasis patients. Every ef fort should be made to ensure that the physician or designee who

) is the clinician’s determination of the 
participant’s
 psoriasis 
lesions’ overall severity in the genital area (labia majora, labia minora, and perineum in females; 
penis, scrotum, and perineum in males) at a given timepoint . Overall, lesions are categorized by 
descriptions for elevation, erythema, and scaling .36 It is not necessary that all 3 criteria be fulfilled. 
The s -PGA 
-G 
score is based on a combination of erythema and the secondary features (plaque 
elevation and/or sca le). Since erythema is the most robust finding, it should be the dominant feature 
influencing the s -PGA 
-G 
rating in the majority of cases. For the analysis of responses, the 
patient’s
 
psoriasis is assessed as clear (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3),  severe (4), or very severe 
(5). All s -PGA -G assessments should be performed by a trained physician (eg 
, 
dermatologist) or 
appropriately trained 
investigator 
 
who is experienced in the assessment of psoriasis patients. Every 
effort should be made to ensure that the physician or designee who performed the s -PGA

Adverse Events 
 
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in 
 
APPENDIX 3
.
 
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, or a surrogate, or the 
participant’s legally acceptable representative) 
. 
The investigator and any qualified desi gnees are 
responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or 
SAE and remain responsible for following up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the 
study intervention or the study, or that caused the p 
articipant to discontinue before completing the 
study.

69 9.2.2  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study intervention until 
discharge from the study (ie, final study visit for a given participant), at the timepoints specified 
in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  
2
)
.
 
Appendix 1 
 of the IB26 represents the Reference Safety Information to determine expectedness of 
SAEs  
for expedited reporting.
 
All SAEs must be collected from the time of signing the consent, including those thought 
to be 
associated with protocol 
-
specified procedures, and within 30 days following discontinuation of 
dosing. 
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study intervention or protocol- specified procedure.  
•
 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the CRF module. 
•
 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in
 
APPENDIX 3
.
 
•
 
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the 
S
ponsor or designee within 24 
 
hours 
of updated information being available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the 
investigator 
 
learns of any SAE, including a d 
eath, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
intervention or study participation, the investigator 
 must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in 
 
APPENDIX 3
.
 
9.2.3 
 
Method of Detecti ng AEs and SAEs  
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a 
participant 
. 
Care should be taken not to introduce bias when collecting AE s and/or 
SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement in the context of known 
AEs, when appropriate for the program or protocol. 
9.2.4 
 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
•
 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or report ed as SAEs if they 
become serious (see 
 
APPENDIX 3
)
.
 
•
 
Follow- up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study 
intervention
 and for those present at the end of study 
intervention
 as appropriate. 
•
 
All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may b e requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study. 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the 
investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs,

until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). 
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in APPENDIX 3 . 
9.2.5 Regul
atory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report descr ibing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg , summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
The Sponsor or designee  must  report AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws and regulations . A SUSAR ( suspected, unexpected serious 
adverse r eaction) is a subset of SAEs and must be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities 
and investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements. 
9.2.6 Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the study intervention, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is 
pregnant 
or ma y have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least for 
30 days after study product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surve illance Form 
to the BMS designee within 24  hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE 
reporting procedures described in APPENDIX 3 . 
Follow- up i
nformation regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information, must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be 
performed on the participant. 
In the event a participant becomes pregnant during the study , the study intervention must be 
discontinued immediately. 
9.2.7 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities 
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE eCRF , as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back -up option when the 
electronic system is not functioning.  
• Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study intervention  
discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant  to receive specific 
corrective therapy  
It is expected that , wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator ( eg, anemia vs low hemoglobin value).

Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver- related l aboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs meeting 
the defined criteria must be reported as SAEs (see Section  9.2.5 and APPENDIX 3  for rep orting 
details).  
A potential DILI is defined as:  
1) Aminotransferase (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) 
elevation > 3× ULN 
AND  
2) Total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase) 
AND  
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of aminotransferase elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
9.2.9 Other Safety Considerations 
Any significant worsening of conditi ons noted during interim or final PEs , ECG, x-ray filming,  or 
any other potential safety assessment required or not required by the protocol should also be 
recorded as a nonserious AE or SAE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. 
9.3 Overdose  
For this stud y, any dose of deucravacitinib  greater than 24 mg within a 24- hour time period will 
be considered an overdose. Overdoses that meet the regulatory definition of SAE will be reported 
as an SAE (see APPENDIX 3 ). 
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 
1) Contact the Medical Monitor or designee immediately  
2) Closely monitor the participant for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities for at least 5  half-
lives of deucravacitinib , approximately 3 days 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions will be made by the investigator in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor or designee based on t he clinical evaluation of the participant.  
9.4 Safety 
Planned timepoints for all safety assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  2). 
9.4.1 Physical Examinations 
A complete PE will include general appearance, vital signs, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, throat, neck, 
respiratory, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal /abdomen, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, 
skin, psychiatric and neurologic exams. A targeted PE will include any organ system associated 
with an AE or a laboratory abnormality.

72 While the targeted PE  may not be as comprehensive as the initial full examination, key aspect s 
should evaluate important body systems as clinically indicated. These body systems can include 
lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and breast at the discretion of the examiner. A targeted examination 
may note any changes in the participant’s condition (body syst ems) since the last assessment and 
does not preclude examination of any of the other body systems as clinically indicated. Every 
effort should be made to ensure the same evaluator will complete the examination for each 
participant at all visits throughout 
the study. Documentation of who performed the examination is 
to be recorded in source notes. 
9.4.2 
 
Vital Signs 
Vital signs include (ear or oral) body temperature, respiratory rate, and seated 
BP
 and heart rate 
and will be recorded at each visit based on 
the 
Schedule of Activities ( Section  
2
). BP and heart 
rate should be measured after the participant has been sea ted quietly for at least 5  
minutes.

)
. The participant will remain supine for 5
 
to
 
10 minutes prior to the ECG and must have 
their lab work done after the tracing so that the ECG results remain as accurate as possible. The 
ECG r esults will be read by the primary study 
investigator 
 
or a designee.

potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  
The Sponsor or designee will provide  the investigator with an appropriate sample ICF, which will 
include all elements required by the ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sample ICF will adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The investigator  or his/her representative must:  
• Obtain IRB/IEC written approval/favorable opinion of the written ICF and any other 
information to be provided to the participant prior to the beginning of the study and after any 
revisions are completed for new information.  
• Provide a copy of the ICF and written information about the study in the language in which 
the participant is proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be nontechnical and easily understood.  
• Explain the nature of t he study to the participant or his/her legally acceptable representative 
and answer all questions regarding the study.  
• Inform participant that his/her  participation is voluntary. Participant  or his/her legally 
acceptable representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets 
the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study center.  
• Allow time necessary for participant  or his/her legally acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the study. 
• Obtain an ICF signed and personally dated by the participant or his/her legally acceptable 
representative  and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  
• Include a statement in participant’s medical record that written informed consent was obtained 
before participant was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was obtained. The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF. 
• Re-consent  participant to the most current version of the ICF(s) during his/her  participation in 
the study, as applicable . 
• Revise the ICF whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the 
participant’s consent. The investigator , or a person designated by the investigator , should fully 
inform the participant or his/her legally acceptable representative of all pertinent aspects of the 
study and of any new information relevant to the participant’s  willingness to continue 
participation in the study. This communication should be documented.

Protocol Amendment 02  
Date: 25-May-2023 99 In situations where consent cannot be given by participants, their legally acceptable representatives 
(as per country regulation) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studi es in which the participant volunteers to participate.  
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal guardian and the participant subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating his or her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the participant.  
Participants who are unable to give their written informed consent (eg, due to stroke or participants with severe dementia) may only be enrolled in the study with t he consent of a legally acceptable 
representative. The participant must also be informed about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with his or her understanding, and should this participant become capable, he /she 
should personally sign and dat e the ICF as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a participant who 
is unable to give his or her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing information to refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study a t any time, 
should be considered by the investigator.  
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study participants are the most important considerations 
and should prevail over interests of science and society.

transferred to a mutually agreed -upon designee (eg, another investigator , study site, IRB). Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS or its designee.  
RETURN OF STUDY TREATMENT  
For this study, study treatments (those supplied by BMS or a vendor or sourced by the 
investigator ), such as partially used study treatment containers, vials, and syringes, may be 
destroyed on site.  
If Then  
Study treatments supplied by BMS 
(including its vendors)  Any unused study interventions supplied by 
BMS can only be destroyed after being inspected 
and reconciled by the responsible Study 
Monitor, unless study treatments containers must be immediately destroyed as required for safety, 
or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxics or 
biologics).  
Partially used study interventions and/or empty 
containers may be destroyed after proper 
reconciliation and documentation. But unused 
Investigational Medicinal Product  (IMP) must 
be reconciled by site monitor/Clinical Research Associate prior to destruction.  
If study treatments will be returned, the return 
will be arranged by the responsible Study 
Monitor.

It is the investigator ’s or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of study interventions, 
provided  that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, 
state, local, and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of 
disposal are kept. The following minimal standards must be met:  
• On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from the drug.  
• On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances. 
• Written procedures for on -site disposal are available and followed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s standard operating procedures and a copy provided to BMS upon request.  
• Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each container, including th e date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal  (eg, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste -disposal 
vendor ) must be documented.  
• Accountability and disposal records are complete, up  to date, and available for the Study 
Monitor to review throughout the clinical study period.  
It is the investigator ’s or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers.  
If conditions for destruct ion cannot be met, the responsible Study Monitor will make arrangements 
for return of study treatments provided by BMS (or its vendors). Destruction of non study  
treatments sourced by the site, not supplied by BMS, is solely the responsibility of the invest igator

DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP, AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse Event Definition:  
An adverse event (AE) is define d as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study 
treatment that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore b e any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abno rmal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiograms, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically s ignificant 
in the medical and scientific judg ement  of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term should be updated to be the diagnosis. 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration, even though it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study interventi on 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the investigator ), 
should not be reported as an AE/serious adverse event (SAE) unless it is an intentional 
overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdose s should be 
reported regardless of sequelae and should specify “intentional overdose” as the verbatim term.  
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital). 
 
DEFINITION OF SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE, even if serious conditions 
are met.

Date: 25-May-2023 108 SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
Results in death.  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).  
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see NOTE 
below). 
NOTE:  
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in Bristol -Myers Squibb Company 
(BMS) clinical studies:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical o r life -threatening event).  
• Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent. 
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure. 
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health 
status (eg, routine colonoscopy). 
• Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases. 
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).  
• Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other 
SAEs  (applies to oncology protocols).  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event[s] that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judg ement , may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm and blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization. Potential drug- induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered a n important 
medical event (s ee Section  9.2.8 for the definition of potential DILI).  
Pregnancy and DILI must follow the same transmission timing an d processes to BMS as used for 
SAEs ( see Section  9.2.6 for reporting  pregnancies).

Protocol Amendment 02  
Date: 25-May-2023 109 EVALUATING AES AND SAES  
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The investigator  will use clinical judg ement  to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration, 
will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or product information for 
marketed products in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator  must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator  has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Spon sor. However, it is very important that 
the investigator  always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.  
• The investigator  may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
 
• Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator  will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moder ate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of 
an event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.

in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
FOLLOW -UP O F AES AND SAES  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note:  Follow -up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator  term[s] initially reported)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study treatment or if new information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE  
• SAEs, whether related or not related to study treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form. 
The required method for SAE data reporting is through the electronic case report form  (eCRF).  
The paper SAE Report Form is intended only as a back -up option when the electronic data 
capture system is unavailable/not functioning for transmission of the eCRF to BMS (or 
designee).  
In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile transmission.  
When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site. 
• Pregnancies must be recorde d on paper Pregnancy Surveillance Forms and transmitted via 
email or confirmed facsimile transmission.

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
Appendix 4 provides general information and definitions related to Woman of Childbearing 
Potential (WOCBP) and methods of contraception that can be applied to most clinical studie s. For 
information specific to this study regarding acceptable contraception requirements for female and male participants, refer to Section  6.1 of the protocol. Only the contraception methods as described 
in Section 6.1  are acceptable for this study.  
DEFINITIONS  
Woman of Childbearing Potential  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following categories are n ot considered WOCBP:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in 
the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, fem ales under the age of 
55 years must have a serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level >  40 mIU/mL to confirm 
menopause. 
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. Suggested guidelines for the duration of the washout periods for HRT types are presented below. Investigators should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
• 1-week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)  
• 4-week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8-week minimum for oral products  
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 mont hs. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40  mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.

End of relevant systemic exposure is the timepoint where the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) or any active major metabolites have decreased to a concentration that is no longer considered to be relevant for human teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. This should be evaluated in context of safety margins from the no -observed-adverse- effect level or t he time required for 
5 half- lives of the IMP to pass.  
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods.  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent  
Failure rate of <  1% per year when used consistently and correctly.a 
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation and/or impla ntation.  (This method of contraception can only be used 
by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is permitted by the study 
protocol)b 
• Oral (birth control pills)  
• Intravaginal (rings)  
• Transdermal  
• Combined (estrogen -and progestogen-contai ning) hormonal contraception must begin at 
least 30 days prior to initiation of study therapy . 
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. (This 
method of contraception can only be used by WOCBP participants in studies  where 
hormonal contraception is permitted by the study protocol)b 
• Oral 
• Injectable  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception must begin at least 30 days prior to initiation of 
study therapy. 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation and/or implantation. (This method of contraception can only be used by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is permitted by the study protocol )b 
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS). (This method of contraception can only be 
used by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is permitted by the study protocol.)

partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
A vasectomy is a highly effective contraception method provided that the participant is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
• Sexual abstinence . 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The rel iability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
• Continuous abstinence must begin at least 30 days prior to initiation of study therapy. 
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section  2. 
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participant chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
• Periodic abstinence (including, but not limited to, calendar, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study.  
NOTES:  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from  failure rates  when  contraceptive methods are  used consistently and 
correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants in clinical studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposur es such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized.  For information specific to this study  regarding permissibility of 
hormonal contraception, refer to Section  6.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA and  Section  7.7.1  PROHIBITED 
AND/OR RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.  
c IUSs are acceptable methods of contraception in the absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone 
exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness . For information specific to this 
study regarding permissibility of hormonal contraception, refer to Section  6.1 INCLUSION CR ITERIA and  
Section  7.7.1  PROHIBITED AND/OR RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.

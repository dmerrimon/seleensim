Protocol  Short Title : “Ascorbic Acid Levels in MDS, AML , and CMML Patients ” 2

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Research over the past two decades has shown that epigenetic changes are essential in the initiation 
and development of hematological cancer, and that DNA methylation are among the earliest and most 
common events in carcinogenesis (Baylin and Jones, 2011).  De novo methylation of the promoters and 
enhancers of tumor suppressors is an alternative to DNA mutation in gene silencing in cancer. An 
additional layer of epigenetic regulation of gene expression relies on the methylation of lysine residues 
on the hist one tails.  
 
Recent investigations have shown that mutations in epigenetic regulators are common, both in the 
apparently normal hematopoiesis of the elderly (Busque et al., 2016; Genovese et al., 2014; Jaiswal et 
al., 2014), and in patients with myeloid ca ncers (Shih et al., 2012).  
 
It was long anticipated that DNA methylation was a permanent silencing mark, but with the discovery of 
the TET enzymes (Tahiliani et al., 2009) it became clear that active demethylation occurs. The initial 
steps in this process  are catalyzed by TET enzymes (Pastor et al., 2013), which are however frequently 
mutated (Shih et al., 2012) and methylated (Cimmino et al., 2015) in hematological cancers. The 
Jumonji enzymes, which catalyze histone demethylation, are also aberrantly reg ulated in hematological 
cancers (Monfort and Wutz, 2013).  
 
Vitamin C was identified in the 1930’ies as the necessary micronutrient in the prevention of scurvy 
(Grzybowski and Pietrzak, 2013). Unlike plants and most animals, humans are unable to synthesize  
vitamin C from glucose due to lack of the required enzyme, L -gulonolactone oxidase (Nishikimi et al., 
1994). Therefore, vitamin C must be provided through the diet. The role of vitamin C in cancer has 
remained controversial. Initial studies of high dose v itamin C supplement showed increased survival 
time and palliative effects (Cameron and Campbell, 1974; Cameron and Pauling, 1978). However, later 
two randomized, placebo -controlled trials were unable to confirm the findings by Cameron and 
coworkers. In the se trials cancer patients were given oral vitamin C (10 g/day) or placebo, but no 
significant differences were found with regards to symptoms or survival time (Creagan et al., 1979; 
Moertel et al., 1985). More recently, several groups suggested the use of vitamin C in combination with 
chemotherapy, the rationale being that vitamin C may both enhance the effects of the chemotherapy 
and/or reduce side effects (Du et al., 2013; Jacobs et al., 2015). Mechanistic studies showed that 
vitamin C is capable of killi ng KRAS  and BRAF  mutated colon cancer cells by elevating the levels of 
endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), which inhibit GAPDH leading to energy depletion and cell 
death (Yun et al., 2015). Importantly, recent investigations from our group show that hematological 
cancer patients are severely vitamin C deficient (Liu, Ørskov et al., submitted).  
 
In addition to the functions of vitamin C described above, recent studies recognize vitamin C as an 
important cofactor for the Fe(II) - and 2 -oxoglutarate dioxygenase family. These include the TET 
enzymes, which are involved in the conversion of 5 -methylcytosine (5 -mC)to its oxidized derivatives 5 - 
hydroxymethylsytosine (5 -hmC), 5 -carboxyl cytosine (5 -caC) and 5 -formylcytosine (5 -fC) (Blaschke et 
al., 2014), and the Jumonji enz ymes that are involved in histone demethylation (Monfort and Wutz, 
2013) (Figure 1). Accordingly, vitamin C may potentially play an important role in the regulation of DNA 
and histone demethylation.

Dr. Peter Jones  
v. Feb 9, 2018   
It has been shown that the formation of 5 -hmC and its derivatives may be compromised in healthy 
individuals (Busque et al., 2016) and patients with TET mutations (Ko et al., 2010). However, since 
many of these mutations are heterozygous, and since the thre e TET enzymes (TET1, TET2 and TET3) 
may have some redundancy, we speculate whether restoration of vitamin C to physiological levels may 
have an impact on the level of 5 -hmC/5 -mC in individuals with TET mutant clonal hematopoiesis or 
hematological cancer.  
 
 
Figure 1: Vitamin C as a cofactor:  Ascorbate (the dominant form of vitamin C at physiological pH) is an 
essential cofactor for A) the TET -mediated oxidation of 5 -mC to 5 -hmC, 5 -fC and 5 -caC and B) the 
Jumonji -domain -containing histone demethylases whic h catalyze the demethylation of lysine residues of 
histone proteins. In both processes ascorbate is reduced to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA).  
 
Because of its dynamic nature, DNA methylation is attractive as a therapeutic target of EMA - and FDA - 
approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi’s) (5 -aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5 -aza-CdR) or 5 -
azacytidine (5 -aza-CR)), which are currently the drugs of choice in the treatment of higher risk 
myelodysplastic syndrome (Fenaux et al., 2009) and certain subtypes of AML (Fen aux et al., 2010; 
Treppendahl et al., 2014). 5 -Aza-CdR is incorporated into the DNA of proliferating cells during S phase 
and inhibits methylation of the newly synthesized DNA strand by trapping DNA methyltransferases 
(DNMTs) onto the DNA, leading to their  proteolysis (Egger et al., 2004). Thus, as opposed to the active 
demethylation by the TET enzymes, DNMTi dependent demethylation occurs via a passive dilution 
during DNA replication.  
 
While it has long been suggested that DNMTi’s reactivate tumor suppres sor genes, our collaborators 
recently observed that inhibiting DNA methylation by DNMTi leads to upregulation of endogenous 
retroviruses (ERVs) and formation of double stranded RNA that mimics a viral infection and induces the

and sensitization of the immune system (Chiappinelli et al., 2015; Roulois et al., 2015).  
 
Only about 50% of patients with MDS or AML respond to DNMTi, and most patients become r esistant 
over time. Recent in vitro studies from our group suggest that physiological levels of vitamin C 
potentiate the effects of DNMTi’s in upregulation of ERVs and in induction of the viral defense pathway. 
We specifically show a synergistic effect of the combination treatment with increased amounts of 5 -
hmC at the loci that control ERV expression and upregulation of double stranded ERV RNA, and the 
genes in the viral defense pathway (Liu, Ørskov et al., submitted). In addition, ERV proteins may be 
expressed and recognized by T -cells of the adaptive immune system. Thus, we suggest that 
combination treatment with vitamin C and DNMTi may potentially optimize the outcome of treatment in 
cancer patients (Figure 2).  
 
 
 
Figure 2: Proposed mechanism of action  of the combination treatment:  5-aza-CdR becomes 
incorporated into DNA, and traps the DNMTs to DNA so that the methylation pattern is no longer copied 
in subsequent cell divisions. TETs and its co factor vitamin C actively convert 5 -mC to 5 -hmC on the old 
stand, thereby enhancing DNA demethylation. This specifically happens at the regulatory long terminal 
repeats (LTRs) of ERVs and will lead to upregulation of ERVs, formation of dsRNA and activation of the 
viral defense pathway.  
 
Interestingly our collabora tors in Copenhagen  recently conducted a study which shows  that 89% of a 
randomly picked group of hematological cancer patients were below the minimum value of the normal 
range of vitamin C, while patients taking recommended doses of vitamin C supplement re store normal 
levels (Liu, Ørskov et al., submitted). We find the similar deficiency reflected in the preliminary results of 
our (same) collaborator’s ongoing  trial randomizing AML/MDS patients  naïve to Vit C supplements are 
treated with 500mg  Vit C supplem ent or placebo. The patients baseline vitamin C levels thus far are 
shown in Figure 3 .

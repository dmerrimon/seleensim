 SYNOPSIS  
Title: A Randomized, Controlled, Double -blind Continuation Study Comparing the 
Long- term Safety and Efficacy of Orelvo (voclosporin) (23.7 mg Twice Daily) with 
Placebo in Subjects with Lupus Nephriti s. 
Short Title:  AURORA (AUR inia Orelvo Renal Assessment s) 2: Aurinia Renal Response in 
Lupus Nephritis with Orelvo  
Study  Product:  Orelvo (v oclosporin ) 
Indication:  Lupus nephritis  
Phase:  3 
Sponsor:  Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Study Code:  AUR -VCS -2016- 02 
Objectives:  Primary Objective : 
• To assess the long -term safety and tolerability of Orelvo compared with placebo 
for up to an additional 24 months following completion of treatment in the 
AURORA 1 study in subjects with  lupus nephritis  (LN) . 
Secondary Objective: 
• To assess the  long-term efficacy of Orelvo compared with placebo for up to an 
additional 24 months following completion of treatme nt in the AURORA 1 
study in subjects with LN.  
Design:  Prospective, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel -group, 24 -month 
continuation study to the AURORA 1 study (AUR -VCS -2016- 01). 
Treatment:  Investigational Treatment:  
Orelvo softgel capsules containing 7.9 mg drug.  
Subjects who have completed 52 weeks of treatment  with study drug and 
participation in the AURORA  1 study will continue to receive the same treatment as  
assigned by  randomization in the AURORA 1 5 2-week study (either Orelvo or 
matching placebo).  
Subjects will continue to receive treatment  with study drug at  the same dose 
administered at Week  52 of the AURORA 1 study.  
After 12 months treatment in the AURORA 2 Continuation Study (i.e. , 24 months 
treatment in total), subjects taking the 23.7 mg (3 caps ules) twice daily ( BID) dose 
will be permitted to reduce the dose of Orelvo to 15.8 mg (2 capsules) BID if  
considered appropriate by the I nvestigator and after consultation with the Medical 
Monitor.  
 
 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential

 Where a dose reduction is considered, the following guidance should be considered:  
AURORA 2: Week 52 Dose AURORA 2 : Reduced Dose  
23.7 mg BID and UPCR ≥1.5 mg/mg No reduction  
23.7 mg BID and UPCR <1.5 mg/mg 15.8 mg BID  
<23.7 mg BID  No reduction  
Notes:  BID = Twice daily; UPCR = Urine protein creatinine ratio  
For any subject receiving an Orelvo (or matching placebo) dose of <23.7 mg BID 
and presenting with 2 consecutive clinically relevant (in the opinion of the 
investigator ) increases in urine protein creat inine ratio ( UPCR) , a dose increase of 
voclosporin  (to a maximum of 23.7 mg BID) or appropriate rescue therapy per the 
Investigator’s discretion and current treatment guidelines should be considered.  
All subjects will continue to receive background therapy  of mycophenolate mofetil 
(MMF) and/or oral corticosteroids starting at the same dose as at the end of the 
AUR ORA 1 study . When clinically indicated, subjects are allowed to be completely 
titrated off of oral corticosteroids; the sites will contact the Medical Monitor if the 
dose of oral corticosteroids is to be increased.    
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Written informed consent before any study -specific procedures are performed . 
2. Male or female subjects who have completed 52 weeks of treatment with study drug in the AURORA 1 study . Subjects who had a temporary interruption and 
successfully restarted study drug during the AURORA 1 study will be allowed with Medical Monitor  approval.  
3. In the opinion of the Investigator, subject requires continued immunosuppressive 
therapy . 
4. Women of childbearing potential must continue to use effective contraception 
and have a negative urine  pregnancy test at Month 12 . Two effective forms of 
contraception must be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen 
method. Subjects must  use effective contraception during the study (see 
Section  5.4, Adequate/Effective Contraception ). 
5. Subject is willing to continue taking oral MMF for the duration of the study .

 Procedures:  See Schedule of Events  for full details of protocol required procedures and applicable 
visits (and timings). Subjects who have completed 52 weeks of treatment  with study 
drug in the AURORA 1 study and have provided signed and dated informed consent 
will be entered into this study. Subjects meeting the required eligibility criteria will 
be registered in the interactive web response system for the AURORA 2 continuation 
study, using the same subject number assigned in the AURORA 1 study. Subjects 
will continue to receive eith er Orelvo or matching placebo as randomized in the 
AURORA 1 study. Study drug treatment in the continuation study will remain 
blinded. Dosing of Orelvo or matching placebo in AURORA 2 is detailed in the 
Treatment section above. All subjects will continue to receive background therapy of 
MMF and/or oral corticosteroids starting at the same dose as at the end of the 
AURORA 1 study.  When clinically indicated, subjects are allowed to be completely 
titrated off of oral corticosteroids; the sites will contact the  Medical Monitor if the 
dose of oral corticosteroids is to be increased.    
All subjects will receive up to 24 additional months of treatment, i.e ., maximum 
36 months in total (12 months in AURORA 1 plus 24 months in AURORA 2). After 
12 months treatment in the AURORA 2 Continuation Study (i.e. , 24 months 
treatment in total), subjects with controlled UPCR  (in the Investigator’s opinion) , 
taking the 23.7  mg (3 capsules) BID dose will be permitted to reduce the dose of 
Orelvo to 15.8 mg (2 capsules) BID if cons idered appropriat e and at the discretion of 
the Investigator  and after consultation with the Medical Monitor . 
Subjects who permanently discontinue treatment with study drug will be treated a t 
the I nvestigator’s discretion, and where appropriate in accordance with current 
guidelines (e.g. , American College of Rheumatology (ACR 2012) ). Subjects will 
return for all remaining study visits and assessments unless they have withdrawn 
consent. Those subjects who have withdrawn consent to complete remaining visits 
will be advised to return for the End of Treatment/Early Termination Visit.  
All subjects will have a safety follow -up visit after the last dose of study drug, and 
an assessment of vital status at 6 and 12 months post study.  
Sample Size:  Subjects will enter this pr otocol from the AURORA 1 study  in order to provide the 
opportunity of an additional 24 months of treatment (total of  
36 months of treatment); no sample size calculation is required.  
Statistical Methods:  Analysis:  
All statistical summaries and analyses will be undertaken at study closure once the 
last subject has completed the Visit 24  safety follow -up visit. A complete description 
of the statistical analyses to be performed will be presented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
The stud y will incorporate an unblinded, interim analysis of both safety and efficacy 
data. The timing of this interim analysis is expected to be 3 months post the final subject final visit of the AURORA 1 study (i.e. , when the last subject reaches V isit 16 
of the AURORA 2 continuation study).  
Populations : 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 10 of 102 
 The safety analysis set will consist of all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study 
drug in the continuation study.  
The efficacy analysis set will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) principles and will 
consist of all consented subjects.  
Safety Endpoints : 
The analysis and summary of the safety endpoints will be conducted on the safety 
set. 
Adverse events will be aggregated by System Organ Class and preferred term and 
presented as summary tables.  
Laboratory values (based on results from the central laboratory), vital signs and other 
safety parameters will be summarized by visit as absolute values and change from  
AURORA 1  baseline. Laboratory values outside of defined normal ranges will be 
summarized.  
Efficacy Endpoints : 
All the secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT set. Data for each 
visit (as well as change from AURORA 1 study baseline as required) will be 
summarized by treatment group and visit for each secondary endpoint.  
The f ollowing key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT 
population using logistic regression with terms for treatment group, baseline UPCR, 
biopsy class and MMF use at baseline (from AURORA 1)  in the model.  
• Proportion of subjects in renal  response at Months 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36.  
• Proportion of subjects in partial renal response at Months 12, 18, 24, 30, and 
36. 
The results will be expressed as an odds ratio (and associated two sided 95% 
confidence interval  [CI]) for Orelvo compared to pla cebo. Odds ratios greater than 
unity show the odds of response are greater for Orelvo than for placebo and therefore 
indicate a benefit of the Orelvo treatment arm.  
The proportion of subjects with renal and extra -renal flares (as adjudicated by the 
CEC) wi ll be analyzed in a similar fashion to the proportion of subjects achieving 
response.  
The following secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a Mixed Effect Model Repeated Measures (MMRM). The MMRM model will include terms for treatment, 
visit, treatment by visit interaction , 
and baseline. Results will be expressed as 
differences between treatment arms (along with the associated 95% CI).  
• Change in UPCR, eGFR, urine protein, a nd serum creatinine from 
AURORA  1 baseline  at each visit . 
• Change in immunology pa rameters (C3, C4, and anti -dsDNA) from 
AURORA  1 baseline  at each visit . 
• Change in HRQoL  (SF-36) from AURORA 1 baseline  at Months 12, 18, 24, 
30, and 36.  
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 11 of 102 
 • Change in SELENA -SLEDAI scores by visit at Months 12, 18, 24, and 36.  
Healthcare Resource Utilization at Months 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, and 3 6. Key 
aspects will be summarized by visit and changes over time will be explored.

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options – Lupus 
Nephritis  
Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common serious manifestation of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). Lupus nephritis is divided into different classes according to the level of 
treatment required, using a classification system for renal biopsy pathology originally 
developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) . The classification of LN has evolved 
and the “International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 Classification of 
Lupus Nephritis” is now widely used and has a higher level of inter -observer reproducibility 
than the original classification  (see Appendix 3) . For subjects  with Class III, IV (proliferative), 
or V (membranous), or combinations of these forms of LN, the standard of care is treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. 
Lupus nephritis manifests as diverse patterns of immune compl ex-mediated renal disease 
affecting glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and vascular compartments. It can lead to permanent 
and irreversible tissue damage within the kidney, resulting in end- stage renal disease (ESRD), 
and thus making LN a serious and potentia lly life -threatening condition. In subjects  with LN, 
renal damage results in proteinuria and/or hematuria and a decrease in renal function as evidenced by reduced creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and 
increased serum creatinine levels.  
In LN  as in other serious renal diseases, the main  clinical outcome s are progression to ESRD 
(i.e., the need for long -term dialysis or transplantation)  and death. The current standard of care 
for LN, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, has improved the prognosis of the disease considerably. Incidence rates of ESRD in LN, however, appear to have been stable over recent 
years, possibly reflecting the limits of effectiveness of current treatments or lack of adherence 
to treatments by subjec ts. The most recent studies have reported 10- year survival rates of over 
90% and, although the overall risk of developing ESRD in subjects  with LN is approximately 
15%, the 5- year risk of developing ESRD has been found to be as low as 5% [1]. Recently, 
10-year follow -up data of LN subjects treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) for 
active disease followed by maintenance treatment with azathioprine (AZA) found rates of 
ESRD to be approximately 7% [ 2]. 
1.1.1 Limitations of Current Treatment 
The current treatment paradigm for LN includes 2 goals, based on the severity of disease. The first goal of treatment in subjects with LN is intended to bring the disease under control as 
quickly as possible to limit the potential for extensive renal scarring or loss of life. This phase of treatment is particularly critical for those subjects at highest risk for ESRD (i.e., subjects 
with clinical or laboratory indicators of active nephritis, such as biopsy evidence of 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 26 of 102 
 proliferative nephritis, active urinary sediment, elevated serum creatinine, and/or proteinuria). 
In subjects with severe LN, the achievement of complete or partial remission, as demonstrated 
by stabilization or improvement in renal function, improvement in proteinuria, and 
normalization of active urinary sediment, has been shown to be assoc iated with better patient 
and renal survival. Treatment of LN (i.e., induction treatment) typically consists of high doses of both corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. 
The second goal of treatment, after the patient successfully responds to treatment, is to 
maintain remission by preventing renal flares and any resulting deterioration in renal function. 
In this second phase of treatment, lower doses of both corticosteroids and immunosuppressants 
are used.  
Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment in SLE, and have been the standard since the 1950s to treat both renal and non- renal manifestations. Intravenous (IV) steroid pulse therapy 
is widely used to rapidly treat relapsing LN, but does not provide long- term management. Oral 
corticosteroids taken for prolonged periods and at high doses are often needed, but have 
potentially severe, and at times irreversible adverse effects including risk of infection, 
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, diabetes, and accelerated atherosclerosis. 
Induction treatment recommendations advocate the use of immunosuppressants in conjunction 
with high -dose oral corticosteroids, to enable a rapid taper to a lower maintenance dose of 
steroids. Steroid- sparing therapies are needed in order to treat disease activity and also 
minimize cumulative and high -dose steroid exposure. 
Intravenous cyclophosphamide, while classically considered the standard of care for induction therapy, is still associated with significant potentially life -threatening toxicities, such as the 
increased risk of severe infections including sepsis, malignancy, and major morbidity, such as permanent gonadal failure.  
Recent studies have shown that induction treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has similar efficacy to that of IVC. The authors of a recent meta -analysis concluded that MMF is 
as efficacious as IVC and is not associated with the risk of infertility, which is a significant toxicity of IVC in this patient population [3]. In the Aspreva Lupus Management Study 
(ALMS), a comparison of MMF and IVC in the treatment of active LN, 50.4% subjects with active LN entering the study had nephrotic -range proteinuria (>3  g/day) [4]. Intravenous 
cyclophosphamide and MMF reduced proteinuria to a similar extent. However, even after 
24 weeks of therapy with either MMF or IVC in the setting of a clinical study , subjects had 
substantial residual proteinuria. At the end of 24 weeks of therapy, normal (<500 mg/24  hours) 
protein excretion levels were observed in only 27% of subjects who recei ved IVC  and 23.8% 
of subjects  who received MMF  [5]. The findings from ALMS indicate that there exists a 
substantial unmet medical need for more effective treatments for active LN with heavy 
proteinuria.

 The importance of proteinuria and reduction of proteinuria as prognostic factors for renal 
flares, ESRD and death in subjects with LN is well documented. Proteinuria in itself is related 
to progression of renal disease through effects on the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium  [6]. In 
observational studies, proteinuria has been shown to be a predictor of adverse renal outcomes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in subjects with non- diabetic proteinuric 
nephropathies [ 7]. 
1.2 Rationale for the  Use of Calcineurin Inhibitors in Lupus Nephritis  
1.2.1 Mechanism of Action 
Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are a class of immunosuppress ants which reversibly inhibit 
immunocompetent lymphocytes, particularly T -lymphocytes in the G 0 and G 1 phase of the 
cell-cycle, and also reversibly inhibit the production and release of lymphokines. Voclosporin, 
a CNI, mediates its suppressive effects by binding to a ubiquitous intracellular protein 
cyclophilin. This complex, in turn, inhibits the calcium- and calmodulin- dependent 
serine/threonine phosphatase activity of the enzyme calcineurin. Calcineurin inhibition then prevents the activation of various transcription factors necessary for the induction of cytokine 
genes during T -cell activation, such as interleukin -2, inte rleukin- 4, tumor necrosis factor -α, 
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, and interferon- γ. 
1.2.2 Use of Immunosuppression in Lupus Nephritis 
Calcineurin inhibitors are standard treatment to prevent acute rejection in subjects who have 
received trans plants. Since the development of cyclosporine in the early 1980s, standard 
immunosuppression regimens to prevent rejection post -transplantation have included steroids 
and a CNI; more recently other immunosuppressants, such as MMF, have been added to 
standard therapy. The rationale for use of CNIs in autoimmune diseases include potent effects 
on T-cell activation and immunomodulatory effects. AT- cell mediated immune response is an 
important feature of the pathogenesis of many of these diseases, including LN. Calcineurin 
inhibitors also have specific anti -proteinuric effects. The podocyte is a key cell in the 
glomerular capillary wall that maintains the integrity of the filtration barrier and prevents the development of proteinuria in healthy individuals, while being the primary target of injury in 
proteinuric kidney disease. Podocyte injury is an important factor in the progression of LN. It 
typically occurs due to immune complex deposition but may also occur in the absence of this 
histologic feature [8]. Podocyte function depends on a complex and unique structure that, in 
turn, depends on a tightly regulated actin cytoskeleton. Synaptopodin acts as a ke y stabilizer 
of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes. When synaptopodin is phosphorylated, it binds to 
another protein, 14-3- 3, and is thus protected from degradation. Calcineurin dephosphorylates 
synaptopodin allowing its degradation, thus promoting proteinuria by destabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Expression of activated calcineurin in podocytes leads to 
proteinuria. By inhibiting activated calcineurin, tacrolimus thus exerts a specific 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 28 of 102 
 anti-proteinuric effect by preventing the degradation of the podocyte -stabilizing protein 
synaptopodin. Taken together, these data suggest that the anti -proteinuric effects of CNIs may 
be explained by their direct effect on the podocyte actin cytoskeleton as well as 
immunomodulatory effects on T-lymphocytes [ 9]. 
1.2.3 Clinical Studies of Calcineurin Inhibitors in Lupus Nephritis 
Bao et al, 2008 [10] performed an open- label study in 40 subjects with Class V+IV LN. 
Subjects were randomized to either IVC and prednisolone or “multi -target therapy” with MMF 
plus tacrolimus (4 mg/day) and prednisolone. In the multi- target group, 50% achieved 
complete remission compared with 5% in the standard IVC group at 6 months. Estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized in both groups, but there was a significantly larger 
reduction in proteinuria in the multi- target th erapy group.  
Miyasaka et al, 2009 [11] evaluated the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in 63 subjects 
receiving glucocorticoid therapy for LN in a double- blind, placebo -controlled, randomized 
trial. Subjects with persistent nephritis requiring 10 mg/day prednisone were randomized to receive 28 weeks of treatment with tacrolimus (3 mg/day) or placebo. There was a statistically 
significant improvement in the primary endpoint, the Lupus Nephritis Disease Activity Index, 
in the tacrolimus group compared to the placebo group. Daily urinary protein excretion (the percentage of subjects with urine protein <0.3 g/day at the final evaluation) also showed a 
significant decrease in the tacrolimus group. However, measures of glucose intolerance were 
more frequent in tacrolimus -treated subjects. The authors conclude d that tacrolimus should be 
considered one of the options to treat LN. On the basis of the results of  this study , tacrolimus 
was approved for the treatment of LN in Japan. 
In an observational study conducted by Cortes -Hernandez et al, 2010 [12], 70 subjects who 
had received MMF as continuous therapy were followed over a 5- year period. Tacrolimus was 
added as rescue therapy in 17 subjects who were treatment failures or had renal flares on 
treatment with MMF. The authors reported a significant reduction in proteinuria at 3 months, 
and after 2 years of follow -up, it was concluded that tacrolimus was a safe and effective 
treatment for MMF non- responsive cases.  
Several smaller pilot studies and case series in subjects with LN, including subjects with 
membr anous nephropathy, have suggested a treatment benefit of tacrolimus with or without 
MMF [13-19]. 
The available data suggest a plausible mechanism of action by which CNIs may provide 
treatment benefits in LN. The clinical evidence is suggestive of improvement in measures of 
response in active L N and improvement in extrarenal manifestations of SLE and immunologic 
parameters.

 1.2.4 Voclosporin 
Voclosporin is a next -generation CNI developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and 
for use in the prevention of organ graft rejection. Voclosporin is str ucturally similar to 
cyclosporine A ( CsA) except for a novel modification of a functional group on the amino acid 1 
residue of the molecule. This alteration has changed the binding of voclosporin to calcineurin 
leading to a 3 - to 5- fold increase in potency  when compared to CsA. This modification has 
also shifted metabolism away from amino acid  1, the major site of metabolism for CsA, thus 
altering the metabolic profile. This in turn has led to faster elimination of metabolites resulting 
in lower measured metabolite exposure as compared to CsA. The combination of increased potency and decreased measured metabolite exposure, for voclosporin as compared to CsA, 
has led to better pharmacokinetic (PK)/  pharmacodynamic predictability.  
During the development of this investigational product the legacy names of voclosporin, VCS, 
 are referenced in discussions related to historical usage. However, for the LN Phase 3 
clinical development program, the name of the investigational product will be referred to as 
Orelv o, the proposed trade name. These legacy names should all be considered interchangeable 
unless specifically identified as different.
 
Prior to the LN clinical development program, approximately 2,200 subjects received 
investigational products containing voclosporin  in 14 Phase 1 and 10 Phase 2/3 clinical studie s 
in the indications of transplant rejection, psoriasis and non- infectious uveitis. An overview of 
the data for these clinical studie s are presented in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.2.4.1 Pharmacokineti c Considerations  
Voclosporin approximates linear multiexponential PKs. Exposure to voclosporin was 
dose- related with maximum concentrations occurring ≤2 hours with a terminal elimination 
half-life (t 1/2) of ≥30  hours. Drug accumulation was minor with accumulation factors of 
approximately 2  hours after twice daily (BID) dosing. Administration of voclosporin oral 
solution with either low - or high- fat meals decreased both the rate and extent of absorption 
which appeared to be related to the fat content of the meal. It is therefore recommended that 
Orelvo (voclosporin) be administered on an empty stomach to ensure adequate absorption. 
Voclosporin has been shown to be a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). 
Concomitant administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, led to a 6 -fold 
increase in maximum concentration (C max) and an 18- fold increase in area under the curve 
between 0 and 12 hours (AUC 0-12) for voclosporin. Concomitant administration of rifampin, 
an inducer of CYP3A4/5, resulted in  a decrease in exposure to voclosporin. Maximum 
concentration  decreased approximately 70%, the area under the concentration curve decreased 
approximately 90%, and t 1/2 decreased 85%. Consequently, both ketoconazole and rifampin 
are contraindicated with Orelvo (voclosporin). Concomitant administration of voclosporin and

 midazolam, a model substrate of CYP3A4/5 and potential inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, did not 
result in statistically significant changes in the rate or extent of exposure to midazolam or 
α-hydroxy- midazolam.  
Voclosporin is both a substrate for and an inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Concomitant 
administration of verapamil, a known inhibitor of P -gp, demonstrated an approximate 3-fold 
increase in C max and AUC 0-12 of voclosporin. Concomitant administration of digoxin, a P -gp 
substrate, resulted in statistically significant increases in digoxin C max and area under the curve 
between 0 and 24 hours (AUC 0-24) and a decrease in clearance. Therefore concomitant 
administration of P -gp substrates with voclosporin would be expected to result in increased 
exposure to the substrate. Clinicians are advised to consider the benefit/risk of concomitant P-gp substrate drugs carefully.  
1.2.4.2 Lupus Nephritis Clinical Development  
The AURA- LV study (Protocol AUR -VCS -2012-01) was a randomized, controlled, 
double- blind Phase 2 study comparing the efficacy and safety of voclosporin (23.7 mg BID  or 
39.5 mg  BID) with placebo in achieving remission in patients with active LN. All patients 
received background therapy with MMF  and c orticosteroid taper. The duration of the study 
was 48 weeks  with 265 subjects randomized; the study has completed. The primary endpoint 
of complete remission was defined as: urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) of ≤0.5 mg/mg at 
24 weeks (using first morni ng void [FMV] ) and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m
2 or no confirmed 
decrease from baseline in eGFR of ≥20%. In addition, patients could not receive rescue 
medications for LN (defined as >10 mg prednisone/day for >3 consecutive days or >7 days 
total from Weeks  16-24) to be considered for complete remission.  
The 24- week pr
imary endpoint assessment for the AURA -LV clinical study demonstrated that 
the groups were generally well balanced for age, gender and race, with a trend to higher 
proteinuria and lower eGFR da ta in the  low-dose voclosporin arm. The low dose achieved a 
statistically significant benefit over placebo for the primary efficacy assessment of c omplete 
remission at 24 weeks (odds r atio (OR)  [95% confidence intervals [CI]] = 2.03, [1.01, 4.05], 
p=0.045) , without a statistically significant improvement seen in the high dose. The results 
were confirmed by 24 -hour urine collections (p= 0.047). Both the  low- and high-dose 
voclosporin were statistically superior to placebo in partial remission, time to complete 
remission , and time to partial remission. A mean reduction in serum creatinine was seen in 
both arms (0.2 mg/dL low, 0.1 high ; p<0.001). In the vocl
osporin groups, eGFR fell by a 
median of 8- 9 mL /min by Week 4 and then stabilized over the course of the s tudy. Blood 
pressure  (BP) did not vary by group. The correlation of 24- hour urine protein and using the 
FMV  was assessed from the results of the AURA -LV study demonstrating a high degree of 
correlation (Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.92). 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 31 of 102 
 Over 90% of subjects experienced at least 1 adverse event  (AE) ; the most comm on being 
infectious disease (56.2% low -dose , 63.6% high-dose and 50.0% placebo ), GI disorders 
(41.6% low -dose , 52.3% high-dose and 36.4% placebo ). More serious adverse events (SAEs) 
occurred in the voclosporin groups (25.8% low -dose , 25.0% high-dose , 15.8% placebo ), and 
were consistent with those observed in LN patients. There were 13 (4.9%) deaths  during the 
study. There were more deaths in the voclosporin low- dose arm (10) than in either the 
voclosporin high-dose (2) or placebo (1) arms, with the majority (11/13) occurring in Asia. All 
deaths were assessed by the Investigators as unrelated to study treatment.  
In summary, 
no new or unexpected safety signals were observed with the use of voclosporin 
in LN subjects; voclosporin was generally well  tolerated  over a 48- week period . The overall 
safety profile is consistent with the expectations for the class of drug, the patient population, 
and concomitant therapies.  
The AURION study (protocol AUR -VCS -2014-01) was an exploratory open- label Phase 2 
study assessing the short -term predictors of remission of voclosporin 23.7 mg BID in 
combination with standard of care in patients with active LN. All subjects received background 
therap y with MMF and corticosteroids. The duration of the study was 48 weeks with 
10 subjects randomized; the study has completed . The AURION stu dy showed that 
7 (70.0%) subjects showed early UPCR reduction of at least 25% from baseline while 
4 (40.0%) subjects had early normalization of anti -dsDNA and 2 (20.0%) subjects each showed 
early normalization of C3 and C4 at Week 8. The results suggest that a combination of early 
reduction of UPCR and early normalization of complement C3 and C4 may be useful in 
predicting response. Treatment with voclosporin 23.7 mg BID in combination with MMF and 
corticosteroids resulted in complete remission in 7/10 (70.0%) subjects at 24 weeks and 4/8 
(50.0%) subjects at 48 weeks. Improvements in UPCR, anti -dsDNA, C3, C4, urine protein, 
and serum albumin levels from baseline were observed during treatment, with stable GFR. These findings suggest that voclosporin in combination with MMF and corticosteroids is 
beneficial for patients with active LN.  No new or unexpected safety signals were observed 
with the use of voclosporin in LN patients; voclosporin was well -tolerated over a 48 -week 
period. The overall safety profile was consistent with the expectations for the class of drug, the patient population, and concomitant therapies. 
1.2.5 Potential Toxicities  
Voclosporin has been studied in numerous disease states. When examining LN, there were a 
small proportion of voclosporin treat ed subjects that experienced an early drop of ≥30% in 
eGFR, however that proportion then remains stable over time. None of these 
treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were classed as serious. The majority of TEAEs 
of decreased GFR were classed as mild or moderate, and resulted in permanent discontinuation 
of study drug in 1 (1.1%) placebo subject, 6 (6.7%) voclosporin low -dose subjects and 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 32 of 102 
 5 (5.6%) voclosporin high- dose subjects. There were more TEAEs of hypertension seen in the 
voclosporin- treated pati ents compared to placebo however, overall mean systolic and diastolic 
BP decreased in all groups, without statistically significant differences seen between groups. 
Overall, only 1 (1.1%) subject, in the voclosporin high- dose group, had a TEAE of 
hypertension that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug.  
There was evidence of an increased incidence of TEAEs over placebo and with increased dose 
of voclosporin in the System Organ Classes of Infections and Infestations, Gastrointestinal  
(GI) Disor ders, and Vascular Disorders. 
There were more deaths in the voclosporin low -dose arm (10) than in either the voclosporin 
high-dose (2) or placebo (1) arms, with the majority (11/13) occurring in South- East Asia. All 
deaths were assessed by the Investigator  and Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) as 
unrelated to study treatment. A full description of AEs can be found in the IB.

 2. RATIONALE  
The rationale for the development of Orelvo  and the choice of doses is to introduce a novel 
CNI to the LN patient population, with meaningful efficacy while minimizing toxicities 
common to other CNIs. In clinical studies, a favorable efficacy/safety profile for Orelvo  has 
been demonstrated in the prevention of renal transplant rejection. 
As evaluated in nonclinical and clinical studies (healthy volunteers, moderate to severe 
psoriasis, renal transplantation, and uveitis) Orelvo  is well tolerated and exhibits AEs that are 
typical of other CNIs yet seen to a lesser extent than that seen historically with other CNIs.  
The aim of the Phase 3  continuation study (AURORA 2)  is to assess the  long- term safety and 
tolerability of  Orelvo , added to the standard of care treatment in LN, for an additional 
24 months, following a treatment period of 52 weeks in the AURORA 1 study 
(AUR -VCS -2016-01). All subjects will continue to receive background therapy of MMF 
and/or oral corticosteroids starting at the same dose as at  the end of the AURORA 1 study . 
When clinically indicated, subjects are allowed to be completely titrated off of oral corticosteroids; the sites will contact the Medical Monitor if the dose of oral corticosteroids is 
to be increased. Subjects  with LN,  who have completed 52 weeks of treatment with study drug 
in the AURORA 1 study , will be eligible to enter the study; subjects who had a temporary 
interruption and successfully restarted study drug during the AURORA 1 study will be allowed with Medical Mon itor approval. The long -term safety and tolerability of the drug combination 
will be assessed from its  safety profile  while  demonstrating the continued ability to achieve  
and maintain  long- term renal response, by reducing the level of proteinuria (as measu red by 
UPCR) , for up to an additional 24 months. The primary endpoint of the AURORA 2  study will 
be the AE profile and biochemical and hematological assessments at 24 months.  
2.1 Dose Rationale  
The AURORA 2 study  is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerab ility of Orelvo 23.7 mg 
BID versus placebo, for an additional 24 months following a treatment period of 52 weeks in 
the AURORA 1 study . Orelvo and/or placebo are herein referred to as study treatment. 
Subjects will continue to receive the same treatment as  assigned by randomization in the 
AURORA 1  52-week study (either Orelvo or matching placebo). Subjects will continue to 
receive treatment with study drug at  the same dose administered at Week 52 of the AURORA  1 
study (see Section  7, Study Treatments ).   
Orelvo 23.7 mg BID will continue to be administered as a fixed dose without the use of 
therapeutic drug monitoring. After 12 months treatment in the AURORA 2 Continuation Study 
(i.e., 24 months treatment in total), subjects with controlled UPCR (in the Investigator’s 
opini on), taking the 23.7 mg (3  capsules) BID dose will be permitted to reduce the dose of 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 34 of 102 
 Orelvo to 15.8 mg (2 capsules) BID if considered appropriate and at the discretion of the 
Investigator and after consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
Population PK anal yses of voclosporin concentrations from the clinical development program 
(including healthy subjects, subjects with renal impairment, subjects with hepatic impairment, 
renal transplant, and plaque psoriasis) demonstrated that weight did not have a signific ant 
effect on the PKs of voclosporin. The protocol contains provisions for management of dose 
based on safety concerns, in particular, BP and renal function. The safety data from the use of 
voclosporin demonstrates that these risks are dose -related, revers ible, and can be managed by 
dose reduction and temporary interruption.

 4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, prospective, placebo- controlled, double -blind, parallel -group, 
24-month continuation s tudy to the AURORA 1 study (AUR -VCS -2016- 01). Subjects who 
have completed 52 weeks of treatment with s tudy drug in the AURORA  1 study  and meet all 
of the inclusion criter ia and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to consent into the 
study.   
Using an Interactive Response Technologies  (IRT) system , eligible subjects will continue to 
receive either oral Orelvo 23.7 mg BID or matching placebo , as randomized in the AURORA 1 
study , using the same subject number, for up to 24 additional months, i.e ., maximum 36 months 
in total (12 months in AURORA 1 plus 24 months in AURORA 2). After 12 months treatment 
in the AURORA 2 Continuation Study (i.e., 24 months treatment in total), subjects with 
controlled UPCR (in the Investigator’s opinion) taking the 23.7 mg BID dose will be permitted 
to reduce the dose of Orelvo to 15.8 mg BID, if considered appropriate and at the discretion of 
the Investigator and  after consultation with the Medical Monitor . All subjects will continue to 
receive background therapy of MMF and/or oral corticosteroids starting at the same dose as at the end of the AURORA 1 study . When clinically indicated, subjects are allowed to be 
completely titrated off of oral corticosteroids; the sites will contact the Medical Monitor if the 
dose of oral cor ticosteroids is to be increased  (see Section  7.2.2.2, Corticosteroids  and 
Section  7.2.2.3, Mycophenolate Mofetil (Background Therapy) ).   
Assessments at Month 12 will be provided from the results of the Week 52/ End of Treatment 
Visit in the AURORA 1 study (AUR -VCS -2016-01). All subjects will return for assessment 
of safety and efficacy  in Months 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, and 36. See  Schedule of Events , 
for detailed information regarding visits.  
All subjects, completed or withdrawn, will complete the End of Treatment/Early Termination 
assessments ( Visit 23) at Month  36 or at the time of early termination. All subjects will have a 
safety follow -up visit (Visit 24) at Month  37 after the last dose of study drug, to collect any 
new AEs and concomitant medications. At the follow -up visit, UPCR and eGFR w ill be 
assessed as well. An assessment of vital status will occur at 6 and 12  months post study. For 
subject withdrawal procedures and criteria, see Section  5.5, Withdrawal of Subjects . 
4.2 Duration of Subject Participation and Study  
The expected duration of subject participation is approximately 25 months . An assessment of 
vital status will occur at 6 and 12  months post study . The treatment duration is 24  months with 
a further follow -up visit 4 weeks after last dose (completion or early termination).

 5. SELECTION , WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS AND PERMANENT 
DISCONTINUATION OF DRUG 
5.1 Number of Subjects  
Subjects will consent to enter this protocol from the AURORA 1 study and will continue to 
receive treatment with study drug at the same dose administered at Week  52 of the AURORA  1 
study.  
5.2 Inclusion Criteria 
The following inclusion criteria must be met for each subject:  
1. Written info rmed consent before any study -specific procedures are performed.  
2. Male or female subjects who have completed 52 weeks of treatment with study drug in the 
AURORA 1 study. Subjects who had a temporary interruption and successfully restarted 
study drug during the AURORA 1 study will be allowed with Medical Monitor approval. 
3. In the opinion of the Investigator, subject requires continued immunosuppressive therapy. 
4. Women of childbearing potential must continue to use effective contraception and have a negative urine pregnancy test at Month 12. Two effective forms of contraception must be 
used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Subjects must use effective contraception during the study (see Section 5.4, Adequate/Effective Contraception ). 
5. Subject is willing to continue taking oral MMF for the duration of the study. 
5.3 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Subjects unable or unwilling to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study 
procedures. 
2. Currently taking or known need for any of the medications or food items listed in Section  7.8, Prohibited Therapy and Concomitant Treatment  during the study.  
3. Subjects currently requiring renal dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or expected to require dialysis during the study period. 
4. A planned kidney transplant within study treatment period. 
5. Subjects with any medical condition which, in the Investigator’s judgment, may be 
associated with increased risk to the subject or may interfere with study assessments or 
outcomes. 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 39 of 102 
 6. Subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or, if of childbearing potential, not using 
adequate contraceptive precaution s. 
7. Vaccines using live organisms, virus or bacterial, while taking the study treatment.  
5.4 Adequate/Effective Contraception  
Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Month 12. Two 
effective forms of contraception must be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen 
method. Effective contraception must be used before beginning study treatment , during study 
dosing, and for 6 weeks following discontinuation of study treatment  or MMF dosing, even 
when there has been a history of infertility, unless due to surgical sterilization. Women not of 
childbearing potential are defined as women without menses for at least 12 consecutive months 
or surgically sterilized.  
Sexually active men, both reproductively competent and vasectomized, are required to use 
condoms during treatment and for at least 90 days after cessation of study treatment  or MMF. 
In addition, female partners of male subjects are recommended to use an effective contrac eption during their partner’s treatment and for at least 90 days after the last dose of 
study treatment or MMF. Male subjects are to refrain from making sperm donations during 
treatment and for at least 90 days after cessation of study treatment or MMF.  
An effective and medically acceptable method of birth control means the chance of pregnancy, 
when using that type of birth control, is less than 1% per year if used correctly. These birth control methods (i.e., reliable forms of contraception) include birth control pills (combined 
oral contraceptives), hormone implants, hormone shots , and some intrauterine contraceptive 
devices. The use of MMF in this study can also reduce the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill.  
Barrier methods ( e.g., condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap/sponge) when used alone are not 
considered highly effective.  
Although abstinence, when adhered to, is an effective method of birth control, other additional 
effective contraception methods should be used where there is any doubt. The  method of 
contraception needs to be discussed with the Investigator throughout the study period in order to confirm the method used is considered effective.  
5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time for any reason. 
Alternatively, subjects may be withdrawn at the Investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s 
best interest.  
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 40 of 102 
 Every effort should be made for subjects who withdraw from the study, either voluntarily or at 
the Investigator’s discretion, to undergo end of study assessments (Visit 23), if possible. If 
possible, the subject should also be advised to come for the Safety Follow -up V isit 4 weeks 
after last dose (Visit 24) . If a subject refuses end of study procedures, the reason for refusal 
should be fully documented in the subject’s source document and recorded in the study specific 
electronic case report form ( eCRF ). It is the subject’s right to withdraw from the study without 
providing a reason. In this case, the source documents and the eCRF should document the reason for discontinuation as “withdrawal of consent .” Withdrawn subjects will not be 
replaced.  
5.6 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
If any subject is discontinued from study treatment , the reason for discontinuation will be 
documented in the eCRF . If the reason for discontinuing study treatment is an AE or an 
abnormal laboratory test result, the specific event or test will be recorded in the eCRF. Except for cases involving pregnancy , subjects who are discontinued from study treatment should 
undergo all study visits and assessments up to and including Month 36 or Early Termination 
Visit – Visit 23, if possible. T he subject should also be advised to come for the Sa fety 
Follow-up V isit 4 weeks after last dose (Visit 24) . Guidance on when study treatment must be 
discontinued is in Section 7.6, Orelvo/Placebo Dose Modification .  
5.6.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment  Due to Renal Flare or 
Non-response to Therapy 
If the subjects require treatment with IV methylprednisolone or any rescue medication other 
than that permitted in the protocol  (see Section 7.2.2.2, Corticosteroids ), they should be 
permanently discontinued from the study treatment and will be considered a treatment failure. 
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from study treatment will be treated a s deemed 
appropriate by the Investigator. 
5.6.2 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  Due to an Adverse Event  
Subjects may be permanently discontinued from study treatment because of the appearance of 
an unacceptable AE. It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject withdrawn because of 
an AE. In any case, every effort must be made to evaluate protocol -specified safety follow -up 
procedures (see Section  10.3, Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs, and Pregnancy ). If a subject 
is withdrawn due to an AE, the event should be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilization has occurred. All AEs should be followed until 
resolution, stabilization or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted.

 6. RANDOMIZATION , BLINDING AND UNBLINDING PROCEDURES  
6.1 Randomization  
On the Month 12 visit  (Week 52/ End of Tre atment Visit of AURO RA 1 study ), subjects 
meeting the required eligibility criteria will continue to receive either oral Orelvo  23.7 mg BID 
or matching placebo, as randomized in the AURORA  1 study . Subjects will be allocated the 
same subject number assigned in the AURORA 1 study .  
All subjects enrolled must be identifiable throughout the study. The Investigator will maintain 
a list of subject numbers and subject names to enable records to allow subject numbers to be 
linked to patient medical records, if required.  
6.2 Blinding  
Study drug treatment in the continuation study will remain blinded.  
In order to preserve the double-blind design, subjects that  consented  to the placebo group will 
be matched to the active dosage groups. Dosing schedule in the placebo group will be the same 
as that of the active treatment group . To this end, the double -blind nature of this study preserves 
the blind with respect to active study treatment and placebo.  
All study personnel and subjects will be blinded to the study treatment administered during the 
study. Orelvo and placebo will be identical in taste, smell, and appearance. The site staff, 
monitors, and study subjects will rema in blinded until the end of the study. In case of 
emergency, the unblinding process below should be followed. 
6.3 Unblinding  
In the rare event that an AE or pregnancy occurs for which knowledge of the identity of the 
study treatment administered is necessary t o manage the subject’s condition, the IRT code for 
that subject may be broken and the test substance identified. Procedures for unblinding will be provided in a separate manual. 
Should emergency unblinding be required, the Investigator should call the  
 Medical Monitor  before unblinding  wherever possible ; however, t he 
Investigator is responsible for the medical care of the individual study subject, and does not 
require the agreement of the Medical Monitor before unblinding. The reason for unblinding 
must be documented. The information on study treatment should only be used for decision 
making in the subject’s  further treatment. Details on unblinded treatment assignments should 
not be shared with the S tudy Monitor and project tea m.

Placebo; 3 capsules administered BID in combination with MMF and oral corticosteroids from 
consent onwards. 
After 12 months treatment in the AURORA 2 Continuation Study (i.e., 24 months treatment 
in total), subjects with controlled UPCR  (in the Investigator’s opinion), taking the 23.7 mg 
(3 capsules ) BID dose will be permitted to reduce the dose of Orelvo to 15.8 mg (2 capsules ) 
BID if considered appropriat e and at the discretion of the I nvestigator  and after consultation 
with the Medical Monitor . 
7.2.2 Dosing Guidelines 
7.2.2.1 Orelvo/ Placebo – Study  Treatment  
Study treatment will be taken BID with water on an  empty stomach as close to a 12 hour 
schedule as possible, and with a minimum of 8 hours between doses. If the subject misses a 
dose of study treatment by less than 4 hours from the anticipated dosing time, the missed dos e 
will be taken immediately. The next dose will be taken at the originally scheduled time. If a missed dose of study treatment is greater than 4 hours from the expected dosing time , the 
subject will skip the dose and take the next dose at the originally scheduled time. The variation in dosing will be recorded in the eCRFs. The dose/doses of study treatment  may be held at the 
discretion of the Investigator. Subjects must avoid consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit -containing juice (e.g., pomelo) for the du ration of their participation in the study.  
Possible dose adjustments:  If GI or other disturbances occur with study treatment , then study 
treatment  dosing may be reduced or interrupted, and/or appropriate treatment may be initiated 
(e.g., addition of a proton pump inhibitor  (see Appendix 6)  and Section  7.6, Orelvo/Placebo  
Dose Modification). 
All unused study treatment s (and any empty containers) dispensed to the subject will be 
returned at each study visit  for capsule counts to check compliance. The Investigator will count 
the returned study treatment  and this information will be used to assess subject compliance. 
This study treatment count must be documented in the eCRF and source documentation. 
7.2.2.2 Corticosteroids  
All subjects will continue to receive oral corticosteroids starting at the same dose as a t the end 
of the AURORA 1 study . When clinically indicated, subjects are allowed to be completely 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 44 of 102 
 titrated off of oral corticosteroids.  The sites will contact the Medical Monitor if the dose of oral 
corticosteroids is to be increased.  
7.2.2.3 Mycophenolate Mofetil (Background Therapy)  
All subjects will continue to receive background therapy of MMF starting at the same dose as 
at the end of the AURORA 1 study.   
• Subjects must be reminded  on the risk of pregnancy whil e taking MMF and the need 
for adequate contraceptive precautions (see Section 5.4, Adequate/Effective 
Contraception).  
All s ubjects will take MMF BID (morning and evening), before meals (i.e., on an empty 
stomach), with a glass of water. If a d ose is missed, the subject should take the next correct 
dose rather than “doubling up” at the next dosing time point. A stable dose of MMF will be maintained throughout the study. Dose changes or interruptions are permitted for clearly 
documented safety re asons only. 
• Approval by the Medical Monitor is required for subjects taking a dose other  than 
2 g/day MMF  from consent onwards (e.g. , total daily dose of 1 or 3 g/day). 
• If GI disturbance or other side -effects occur with MMF, the 1  g BID dosing may be 
changed to 500 mg four times daily. 
• If a subject has an absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) <1,500/mm
3 at any study visit, the 
dose of MMF  should be decreased or interrupted. If a subject has an ANC <1,000/mm3 
at any visit, the dose should be discontinued and only recommenced when the ANC 
reaches 1,500/mm3. If the subject has a dose interruption of MMF of >14 days , then 
permanent discontinuation of MMF , therefore the study,  should be considered after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
• If deemed necessary by the Investigator on account of leukopenia or other adverse 
effect, or if the subject weighs 50 kg or less, the dose of MMF may be decreased to a 
minimum of 500 mg BID. 
7.3 Package and Labeling  
All study treatments provided by Aurinia will be  packaged and labeled for Aurinia by 
appropriately qualified vendors according to all applicable local and country regulatory 
requirements. All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to GMP and 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 45 of 102 
 Study- treatment  wallets provided to sites and to subjects will be labeled in the appropriate local 
language, according to local regulatory requirements.  
Wallet label information will be appropriately documented in the Drug Accountability Form 
after the container has been dispensed to the subject. 
7.4 Study Treatment Allocation  
The IRT system utilized in AURORA 1 will continue to be used for AURORA 2. 
7.5 Site Supply, Storage, Accountability  
7.5.1 Site Supply  
Once a site has been approved for study initiation, the site will be supplied with an initial stock 
of study treatment . The need for study treatment  resupply will be assessed on a regular basis 
taking into account the number of subjects enrolled at the site. 
7.5.2 Storage 
Orelvo  softgel caps ules and matching placebo capsules will be supplied in cartons containing 
168 capsules in 4 wallets of 42 capsules each. 
The Investigator must ensure the availability of proper storage conditions. All study treatment  
supplies provided for this study will be stored in a secure area with restricted access at the 
study site. The capsules must be stored at a controlled room temperature between 15 and 30°C 
(59-86°F). The Investigator must document and inform the Site Monitor about temperature 
deviations outside the acceptable range. Subjects will be instructed to store the study treatment 
at room temperature between 15 and 30°C (59- 86°F). 
Each site should have a thermometer that records minimum and maximum temperatures daily. 
Maint enance of a temperature log is mandatory. The log should be updated by site personnel 
during normal working hours. This log must be available for review by the Site Monitor during 
on-site monitoring visits.  
7.5.3 Accountability 
The Investigator at each site is r esponsible for study treatment supplies. The Investigator will 
ensure that adequate records of the receipt, dispensing , and return of the study treatment  are 
kept and that the study treatment is used only for subjects enrolled in the study. All data 
regard ing the study treatment  must be recorded on the relevant forms provided. 
Each study site will maintain a drug inventory/dispensing record for all drugs dispensed and 
returned. At the end of the study, 1 copy of the drug inventory/dispensing record should be 
sent to Aurinia for the central study file. The original will be kept in the site files.  
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 46 of 102 
 After completion of the study, or if it is prematurely terminated, all unused materials will be 
returned to Aurinia. The decision to destroy study treatment  at a site must be made by Aurinia. 
If the study treatment  is destroyed at a site, the Investigator must receive Aurinia approval of 
the process and forward the certificate of destruction to Aurinia.  
Records of oral corticosteroids and MMF must be maintained (prescribed dose, dose adjustments and reasons) in the source notes and must be transcribed into the eCRF. 
7.6 Orelvo/Placebo  Dose Modification  
If GI or other disturbances occur with study treatment, then study treatment dosing may be 
reduced or interrupted, and/or appropriate treatment may be initiated (e.g., addition of a proton 
pump inhibitor (see  Appendix 6).  
After 12 months treatment in the AURORA 2 Continuation Study (i.e., 24 months treatment 
in total), subjects with controlled UPCR  (in the Investigator’s opinion), taking the 23.7 mg 
(capsules ) BID dose will be permitted to reduce the dose of Orelvo to 15.8 mg (2 caps ules) 
BID if considered appropriate and at the discretion of the Investigator  and after consultation 
with the Medical Monitor . 
Where a dose reduction is considered, the following guidance should be considered: 
AURORA 2: Week 52 Dose AURORA 2 : Reduced Dose  
23.7 mg BID and UPCR ≥1.5 mg/mg No reduction  
23.7 mg BID and UPCR <1.5 mg/mg 15.8 mg BID  
<23.7 mg BID  No reduction  
Notes:  BID = Twice daily; UPCR = Urine protein creatinine ratio  
For any subject receiving an Orelvo (or matching placebo) dose of <23.7 mg BID and 
presenting with 2 consecutive clinically relevant (in the opinion of the investigator ) increases 
in UPCR , a dose increase of voclosporin (to a maximum of 23.7 mg BID) or appropriate rescue 
therapy per the Investigator’s discretion and current treatment g uidelines should be considered. 
Dose modifications for background therapy (MMF and corticosteroids) are detailed in Section  7.2, Drug Dosage and Administration. 
7.6.1 Deterioration in Renal Function 
Serum creatinine and eGFR utilizing the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 
(CKD- EPI) formula will be used for the assessment of renal function at every visit 
(Visits  15-24 and unscheduled visit(s)). Baseline values from the AURORA 1 study will be 
used in this study.  
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 47 of 102 
 It is recognized that eGFR may be unreliable at higher values (>100 mL/min/1.73 m2). Lupus 
nephritis subjects with nephrotic range proteinuria frequently have wide fluctuations in serum 
creatinine (and therefore eGFR) which are not representative of true renal dysfunction. Chronic 
kidney disease is defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for ≥3  months [20], with or without 
kidney damage.  
7.6.1.1 Decrease in eGFR > 30% and eGFR <60 mL/min /1.73 m2 
During the treatment period, any subject experiencing a >30% decrease in eGFR from 
AURORA 1 baseline  to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, will have study treatment interrupted until a 
repeat test can be performed (unscheduled visit to be completed). If the d ecrease is confirmed  
and not due to potential contributing factors (e.g., high baseline eGFR, the addition or 
modification of non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers  (ARBs) , a concurrent state of 
dehydration, overdosing with study treatment, lupus renal flare, etc.) , the case should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor, the study treatment should be withheld, and eGFR retested within 48 hours. If the eGFR decrease is not confirmed, the study treatment can be 
restarted at  2 capsules BID and increased as tolerated with discussion with the Medical 
Monitor. 
7.6.1.2 Decrease in eGFR ≤30% and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m
2 
During the treatment period, any subject having a ≤30% reduction in eGFR from AURORA 1 
baseline to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, should have the influence of potential contributing factors 
(as described in Section 7.6.1.1, Decrease in eG FR >30% and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
ruled out and appropriate corrective action taken. Any subject having a >20-≤30% reduction 
compared to baseline in eGFR to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 will have a confirmation measurement 
done within approximately 2 weeks (at a planned study visit, if any, or an unscheduled visit is to be completed). The subjects will be managed in the most medically appropriate manner in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor. The  management of the decrease in eGFR may include 
reduction of dose or temporary interruption. 
7.6.1.3 Decrease in eGFR ≤20%  
During the treatment period, any subject having a ≤20% reduction in eGFR  from AURORA 1 
baseline will be followed  by the Investigator. 
7.6.1.4 Decrea se in eGFR >30% and eGFR ≤90 mL/min/1.73 m
2 
During the treatment period, any subject having a >30% reduction in eGFR  from  AURORA 1 
baseline to ≤90 mL/min/1.73 m2, should have the influence of potential contributing factors 
(as described in Section 7.6.1.1, Decrease in eGFR >30% and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
ruled out and a confirmation measurement done within approximately 2 weeks (at a planned 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 48 of 102 
 study visit, if any, or an unscheduled visit is to be completed). The subjects will be managed 
in the most medically appropriate manner in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
7.6.1.5 Decrease in eGFR >30% and eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 
During the treatment period, any subject having a  >30% reduction in eGFR  from  AURORA 1 
baseline to >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (i.e., within normal range)  should be monitored by the 
Investigator for further decline in eGFR. Should further eGFR changes occur, t he subjects will 
be managed in the most medically appropriate manner in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor and the guidance above.   
7.6.1.6 Recovery of eGFR  
Subject s experiencing a decrease in eGFR with resultant decrease in dose should be reassessed 
for recovery  of renal function. If the repeated eGFR is >80% of AURORA 1 baseline, the dose 
should be increased by 1 capsule BID and eGFR assessed within 2 weeks. 
7.7 Proced ures for Overdose  
Based on clinical experience with Orelvo , symptomatic treatment of AEs or overdoses is 
indicated. Treatment for renal dysfunction, hypertension, and infection may include dose 
reduction or dose discontinuation. Magnesium supplementation may be required for hypomagnesemia. Treatment for GI complaints and biochemical/hematological abnormalities, 
and all other expected AEs, should be based on symptoms, with care taken to rule out other causes.  
7.8 Prohibited Therapy and Concomitant Treatment  
Any concomitant treatment given for any reason during the course of the study must be 
recorded in the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents, including dosage, start and stop dates , and reason for use. 
Any class of medications not mentioned below and with the potential to interfere with 
evaluation of the study treatment must be discussed and documented with the Medical Monitor. 
7.8.1 Prohibited Medications 
The same medications prohibited in the AURORA 1 study will be prohibited in this study.  
The following medications cannot be taking during the study: 
• IV corticosteroids unless approved by the Medical Monitor 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential

administered per protocol 
• AZA or mycophenolate sodium  
• Ketoconazole or rifampin  
• Concomitant use of other CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers should be discussed with the Medical Monitor 
Appendix 7 contains a summary of additional treatment and food restrictions. 
7.8.2 Allowed Concomitant Medications 
These medications are permitted during the study:  
• Topical steroids (e.g. , nose, scalp, skin, inhaled) 
• Antimalarials should be prescribed when clinically indicated  
• Herbal supplements can be used with caution and depending on active ingredients 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 50 of 102 
 Treatments which may be used as medically indicated, according to the judgment of the 
Investigator can be found in Appendix 6.  Treatments not included in this list may be acceptable 
in the study; such treatments should be verified with the Medical Monitor prior to use. A 
summary of treatment and food restrictions can be found in Appendix 7. 
7.9 Increased Blood Pressure  
For all subjects, the target systolic pressure is ≤130 mmHg and the target diastolic pressure is 
≤80 mmHg. Investigators should use all means possible permitted in the protocol to maintain 
the BP within these limits. If no further adjustment of antihypertensive therapy is possible, the 
subject should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
If on any study day, systolic BP is >165 mmHg or diastolic BP is >105 mmHg and i s associated 
with symptoms of hypertension ( i.e., persistent headache, altered mental status, shortness of 
breath, chest pain consistent with angina pectoris, symptoms of heart failure, evidence of renal 
insufficiency of new onset, evidence of hypertensive  retinal injury [ hemorrhages, 
papilledema ]), study treatment should be withheld, the Medical Monitor contacted, and the 
subject treated as per Investigator local practices and best judgment. The subject will continue 
with all study visits per the  Schedule of Events . Study treatment must not be reintroduced 
without prior discussion with the Medical Monitor.

 9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
9.1 Description of Study Assessments  
9.1.1 Laboratory Assessments 
Analysis of all samples for hematology, chemistry, hepatic function, lipid profiles , proteinuria, 
and urinalysis will be performed at a central laboratory using standard validated methods (see 
the laboratory manual). All study data analyses involving laboratory values will be based on 
results from the central laboratory. 
The UPCR will be calculated both from the FMV  and from standard urinalysis results. If the 
FMV  is for some reason not available , then standard urinalysis from a 24-hour urine collection 
may be substituted as an exception but only after agreement is reached with the Medical 
Monitor. 
Blood and urine samples for the following efficacy and safety assessments (See  Table 1) will 
be drawn in accordance with the  Schedule of Events .

9.1.2 Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Events . 
The physical examination will include a review of SLE -related manifestations which will also 
be recorded.  An abbreviated  physical examination will be conducted at Month 12 from the 
results of the Week 52/ End of Treatment Visit in the AURORA 1 study , and at Month 36 End 
of Study or Early Termination  as per the Schedule of Events .  
The abbreviated examination will consist of checking the normality or abnormality of the 
following body systems: general appearance, cardiovascular system , and pulmonary system. 
Any abnormalities will be recorded in th e eCRF and reported as an AE.  Because the 
investigational medication is an immunosuppressant, physical examination will include clinical examination for tumors.  
Subject weight will also be recorded at each physical examination; however, height is not 
required . 

 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 55 of 102 
 9.1.3 Vital Signs 
The following vital signs will be measured  at all visits  in accordance with the Schedule of 
Events : 
• Resting BP (systolic and diastolic)  
• Resting HR  
• Body temperature (°C or °F) 
To avoid variability, the same method of obtaining body temperature should be used 
throughout the study. 
9.1.3.1 Blood P ressure Management  
BP and heart rate ( HR) will be measured with the subject in a sitting position after 5 minutes 
of rest. The procedure for standardized measurement  of BP is detailed in  Appendix 2.  
If the BP measure is confirmed to be >130/80 mmHg (i.e., by the mean  of the second and third 
repeats of 3 readings),  the subject’s BP will be managed  per local practice. If the BP remains 
uncontrolled with the maximal doses of first and second -line antihypertensive therapies 
referenced in  Appendix 1, then the Investigator should contact the  Medical Monitor to consider 
dose adjustment  of the study treatment. See Section 7.9, Increased Blood Pressure for 
manag ement of increased BP.  
9.1.4 Standard 12 -lead Electrocardiogram 
The electrocardiogram ( ECG ) will be a standard 12- lead tracing performed at the 
investigational site, assessed by a qualifie d physician at the investigational site, and retained 
as a source document. Any abnormalities will be recorded in the eCRF. ECGs  will be recorded 
after the subject has been in a resting, supine position for at least 5 minutes. Abnormal ECG 
tracings can be reviewed by the  Medical Monitor. Significant abnormalities, including findings 
that may prompt discontinuation of study treatment , must be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor. 
ECGs  will be measured at Month 12 from the results of the Week 52/ End of Treatment Visit 
in the AURORA 1 study, and at Month 18, 24, and 36/ End of Study or Early Termination  as 
per the Schedule of Events . 
9.1.4.1 Procedures to Manage a Treatment -Emergent Increase in QTc 
In the event that a subject has a QT interval duration corrected for heart rate using method of 
Fridericia (QTcF ) value exceeding 500 msec, or an increase >60 msec from AURORA 1 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 56 of 102 
 baseline, the Medical Monitor must be informed. The subject will be asked to return for  an 
unscheduled visit within 24 hours and the ECG will be repeated (confirmed), i n triplicate 
(i.e., three 10 -second ECGs in rapid succession within 1 minute). If the repeat measurements 
confirm that the QTcF is >500 msec or >60 msec f rom baseline, the subject will be withdrawn 
from treatment with the study treatment and followed until the QTcF value either returns to 
baseline (or as appropriate) or until, in the judgment of the Investigator, further evaluation is 
not clinically indicated ; study treatment will not be restarted.  
If study treatment is discontinued, the subject should continue in the study for all remaining 
scheduled study visits. 
9.1.5 Lupus Disease Activity Assessments  
The Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National As sessment ( SELENA )- Systemic 
Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index ( SLEDAI ) assesses disease activity within the 
last 10 days. Twenty -four items are scored for 9 organ systems, and summed to a maximum of 
105 points. A score of 6 is considered clinically significant. See  Appendix 5. 
Assessments for SELENA -SLEDAI will be conducted at Month 12 from the results of the 
Week 52/ End of Treatment Visit in the AURORA 1 study, and at Months 18, 24, and 36/End of Study or Early Terminat ion. 
9.2 Schedule of Assessments  
A detailed schedule of assessments (including all protocol -required assessments, visits , and 
visit windows) is located on the  Schedule of Events . No study related assessments will be 
performed (including changes to current medications to meet study eligibility) until the subject 
has provided signed and dated informed consent. Every effort will be made to keep the subject 
within the requested visit schedule. If a subject is seen outside of the visit window listed on the Schedule of Events , the reason must be clearly documented in the source notes. The 
Investigator (or designee) should contact Aurinia for assistance with getting the subject’s 
schedule back on track in order to avoid large variances in treatment exposure or to avoid delaying overall study timelin es. 
9.2.1 Screening Visit Procedures 
Screening will take place in the AURORA 1 study. In this continuation study, subjects who 
have completed 52 weeks of treatment  with study drug  in the AURORA 1 study  and have 
provided signed and dated informed consent will be entered into this study. 
Month 12 refers to Week 52/ End of Treatment Visit of the AURORA 1 study.

 9.2.2 Treatment Procedures  
Subjects who satisfy all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for consent into 
the AURORA 2 study. 
Month 12 refers to Week 52/ End of Treatment Visit of the AURORA 1 study. All subjects 
will continue to receive background therapy of MMF and/or oral corticosteroids starting at the 
same dose as at the end of the AURORA 1 study.  When clinically indicated, subjects are

 10. EVALUATION , RECORDING AND REPORTING OF AES AND 
SAE S 
10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1  Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment is an AE. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
10.1.2  Adverse Drug Reaction 
In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medical product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 
The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be 
ruled out. 
10.1.3  Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE (experience) or reaction is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria : 
• Results in death (Note: death is an outcome, not an event) 
• Is life -threatening (Note: the te rm “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe)  
• Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a con genital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event or reaction  
The definitions and reporting requirements of International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions, and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to. 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 63 of 102 
 Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These will also usually be considered serious. 
Hospitalizations for elective or previously  scheduled surgery for pre -existing conditions, 
which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, will not be classed as SAEs. Previously 
scheduled hospitalizations must be documented in the subject’s source documents before the 
subject signed the informed consent form ( ICF). A kidney biopsy performed as part of the 
study to verify eligibility will not be considered a n SAE. Any complication experienced during 
a kidney biopsy procedure resulting in hospitalization or a prolongation of the hospitalization 
requires SAE reporting. 
10.1.4  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
Any ADR that is both serious and unexpected (per the IB) that, based on the opinion of the 
Investigator or Aurinia, is felt to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to a medicinal product is a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction . 
10.2 Adverse Event Descriptors  
10.2.1  Intensity/Severity Categorization 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); however , the event itself may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
In general, the intensity of a particular AE to be recorded is the worst intensity experienced by 
the subject during the c ourse of the event. The medical assessment of intensity will be 
determined by using the following definitions: 
Mild:  The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with usual activity. 
Moderate:  The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to function.  
Severe:  The AE is incapacitating and the subject is unable to work or complete usual 
activity.  
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 64 of 102 
 10.2.2  Causal Relationship Categorization 
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to 
the study treatment  for each AE and SAE. The Investigator must decide whether, in his or her 
medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study treatment. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE/SAE must 
be classified as not related. Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or 
untested, for suspecting a cause -and-effect relationship between the study treatment  and the 
occurrence of the AE/SAE, then the AE/SAE will be  considered related. For SAEs, the 
Investigator must provide a brief comment explaining the rationale of his/her assessment of causal relationship on the SAE reporting form. 
The following additional guidance may be helpful: 
Term  Relationship  Definition  
Related  Yes The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study  drug administration 
indicates a causal relationship , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed 
event.  
Not related  No The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study  drug administration does 
not indicate a causal relationship , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 
If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and the study treatment is determined to be 
“related”, the event will be considered to be related to study treatment for the purposes of 
expedited regulatory reporting. In circumstances where the Investigator  has not yet provided 
his/her assessment about the relationship, the event will be considered as “related” and qualify 
for expedited regulatory reporting. 
10.2.3  Outcome Categorization 
Outcome may be classified as recovered without sequelae; recovered with sequelae; improved; 
worsened; ongoing; ongoing at End of Study; fatal; or unknown. If the outcome is reported as 
recovered with sequelae  for a n SAE , the Investigator should specify the  kind of sequelae on 
the SAE reporting form. SAEs  that are ongoing at the time of death will have an outcome of 
“unknown” recorded.  SAEs resulting in a fatal outcome will have an outcome of “fatal” 
recorded.  
10.2.4  Symptoms of the Disease Under Study 
Symptoms and fluctuations in laboratory parameters related to  the disease under study will not 
be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation of the disease. 
An explanation of these circumstances must be written in the source documents. 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 65 of 102 
 Worsening of the symptoms or laboratory parameters however, will be recorded as an AE, and 
clearly marked as worsening or by the subject’s worst observed intensity. The Investigator will 
be required to assess the relationship to disease under study for ea ch AE as related or not 
related. An AE will not be able to be assessed as related to both disease under study and related 
to study treatment.  
10.2.5  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
A change in the value of a safety laboratory investigation can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant in the opinion of the Investigator or if, during treatment with the study 
treatment , a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to a pathological value, or a 
further worsening of an already pathological value.  
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are pathological laboratory values which were not 
present at baseline, further clinical or laboratory investigations will be performed until the 
values return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation (e.g., concomitant 
disease) is found for the pathological laboratory values. 
If the Investigator considers such an AE as serious it must be reported as an SAE. 
10.2.6  Abuse, Misuse, Overdose and Medication Error 
All AEs of special interest such as study tr eatment abuse, misuse, overdose, and medication 
error have to be documented in the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. If any 
occurrence of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors leads to any event that fulfils any 
seriousness criteria, the event has to be reported as an SAE. 
10.3 Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs , and Pregnancy  
10.3.1  Adverse Events 
All AEs either observed by the Investigator or one of his/her medical collaborators, or reported by the subject spontaneously, or in response to a direct question, will be noted in the AE section 
of the subject's eCRF and source documentation. This applies to all AEs regardless of 
presumed relationship to the study treatment. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of 
study treatment must be collected.  
If any AE is reported, the date of onset, relationship to disease under study, relationship to 
study treatment, any action taken, date of resolution (or the fact that it is still continuing or has 
become chronic), outcome, and whether the AE is serious or not , will be recorded. Use of 
colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided. Only 1 AE term should be recorded in the 
event field on the AE eCRF. Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis rather 
than signs and symptoms or abnormal laboratory  values. However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 66 of 102 
 time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AE eCRF. If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established,  all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be 
nullified  by the Investigator  and replaced by one AE report based on the single diagnosis, with 
a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual 
diagnosis. 
The AE reporting period begins at the time the ICF is signed by the subject. The AE reporting 
period ends a t the study follow -up visit (Visit 24). Adverse events persisting at the time of 
study completion will be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilization has occurred (or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be 
contacted) and recorded in the source documents . If the subject reports an AE, it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to acquire sufficient information in order to assess causality. This 
may require additional laboratory testing, physical examin ations, telephone contacts, etc. In 
circumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written statement to Aurinia confirming that the subject is lost to 
follow-up. 
In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked a non- leading question, such 
as “How are you feeling?” It is also important to question the subject in a non- leading way 
about changes in their health or concomitant medication usage since their last visit. This 
inform ation should be collected prior to completion of assessments at all study visits. In 
addition, any symptoms/conditions reported during assessments and deemed to be clinically significant by the Investigator will be considered AEs. 
10.3.2  Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs occurring after the signing of the  ICF will be reported to  
within 24 hours of the Investigator, designee, or site staff’s knowledge of the event regardless of relationship to study treatment  or relationship to disease under study . All SAEs are to be 
reported on the eCRFs. 
In the event that the site experiences a temporary disruption of the EDC system a back -up 
paper SAE Report ing Form will be available for site staff to complete.  
• Site staff will complete the paper SAE report for m and e- mail it within 24 hours to the 
following address:  
• Only in cases where the email system is unavailable, site staff will send the SAE by fax 
to:  (US) and  (Outside US). 
If notification is made via email or fax, site staff must enter the SAE information into the EDC 
system as soon as the system becomes available.  

 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 67 of 102 
 All SAEs , regardless of causality, will be reported from the time the ICF is signed until 30  days 
follo wing the last study visit or 30  days after last study treatment administration  in subjects 
who withdraw or discontinue prior to study completion. No formal study visit is required but 
Investigators must report any SAEs that occur during this 30 day period on the eCRF . If the 
Investigator has not seen the subject at a clinic visit at the end of the reporting period, the 
Investigator must make reasonable efforts to contact the subject to inquire about SAEs. 
All recorded SAEs, regardless of relationship to disease under study  or relationship to study 
treatment , will be followed up until resolution, stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow -up 
and cannot be contacted. In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact 
with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written statement to Aurinia confirming that 
the subject is lost to follow -up. 
Any SAE considered to have a causal relationship (i.e., “related”) to the study treatment and 
discovered by the Investigator at any time after the study will be reported.  A rationale for the 
assessment of a causal relationship must be provided by the Investigator. The Investigator will 
also be required to assess the relationship to disease under study for each SAE as related or not 
related. An SAE will not be able to be as sessed as related to both disease under study and 
related to study treatment. Any safety information that is obtained after  the Follow-up Visit 
(Visit 24) will be documented in the safety database only. 
A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator within 
30 days after the last study visit (including the Follow -up Visit) or until 30  days after the last 
study treatment  administration, whichever is longer, whether considered treatment -related or 
not, must be reported t o Aurinia. If the subject  died, the SAE report should include the cause 
of death as the event term and whether or not the death was related to study treatment, as well as the autopsy findings, if available. Preliminary reports will be followed by detailed 
descriptions which will include copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports/certificates and other documents when requested and applicable. 
Additional follow-up information must be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours of awareness 
following Investigat or (or site) awareness of the information.  The Investigator should not delay 
reporting a n SAE in order to obtain additional information. Additional information, when 
available, should be reported to  by the reporting procedures 
describ ed above.  
The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the study Medical Monitor when the issue of 
seriousness is unclear or questionable. 

 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 68 of 102 
 An Investigator who receives an I nvestigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information ( e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 
The sponsor or its representative will be responsible for determining and, in turn, reporting 
SAEs to regulatory authorities according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
10.3.3  Pregnancy 
Pregnancy occurring in a female subject or in the partner of a male subject should be reported 
to  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event using the 
pregnancy e CRF . The Investigator should counsel the subject, and in the case of a male subject, 
the subject’s partner, discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. A female sub ject must immediately inform the Investigator if she becomes 
pregnant during the study. Monitoring of the pregnancy in a female subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. In case of a pregnancy in the partner of a male subject, the 
Investig ator should obtain informed consent of the pregnant partner prior to monitoring of the 
pregnancy. 
Women who have a positive pregnancy test during the study will be withdrawn from the study 
treatment  and the procedures for withdrawal will be completed. The Medical Monitor must be 
contacted immediately to break the blind (if applicable). 
All pregnancies , subject or partner of a subject, that  occur during the study or come  to the 
attention of the Investigator within 30 days after the last study visit (includin g the Follow -up 
Visit) or until 30 days after last study treatment administration, which ever is longer, must be 
reported to  by the reporting procedures described above. 
The outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal births) should be followed up and 
documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the study. Every effort should be made 
to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 90 days (or otherwise as 
appropriate) post -partum. It will be the responsibility of  Aurinia, together with the appropriate 
support of the Investigator, to obtain this information. 
Complications of pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or induced), premature birth, or 
congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and should be reported fol lowing the reporting 
procedures as outlined in Section 10.3.2, Serious Adverse Events . In the event that the site 
experiences a temporary disruption of the EDC system, a back -up paper Pregnancy Reporting 
Form will be available for site staff to complete.

 11. CLINICAL ENDPOINTS COMMITTEE  
A CEC  will be constituted to adjudicate the following secondary endpoints for subjects in this 
study:  
• Renal flare  
• Extra -renal flare  
The CEC will adjudicate the endpoints  by reviewing blinded data. Aurinia will establish a 
charter document explaining the working procedures and responsibilities of the CEC. All 
adjudication decisions of the CEC will be appropriately documented.

 12. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD PROCEDURES  
A DSMB  will be constituted to protect the safety of study participants. The DSMB  will receive 
blinded eCRF data in the form of tables and listings (prepared by an independent statistician), 
and review subject status changes and dosing decisions (where appropr iate).  Where 
appropriate, the DSMB  may receive unblinded data (on a subject level or treatment group 
level) that should be reviewed in a closed session. Examples of the data that may be included 
are: disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics , AE data, SAE data (by severity and 
causality), laboratory data, dose adjustments, protocol adherence, and su bject withdrawals. 
The DSMB  will evaluate the progress of the study , assess data quality and timeliness, 
participant recruitment, accrual and retention , and participant benefit  versus risk. In addition 
the DSMB  will monitor external factors relevant to the study , for example scientific and 
therapeutic developments that may affect participant safety or ethical status. Based on the 
observed benefits or adv erse effects, the DSMB  will make recommendations to Aurinia 
concerning continuation, termination, or modifications of the study. 
Aurinia will establish a charter document explaining the working procedures and 
responsibilities of the DSMB . All deliberations  and decisions of the DSMB will be 
appropriately documented.

 13. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
13.1 Statistical Methods  
Complete details of the statistical and analytical methods will be provided in a formal 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to the database lock . A general 
description of the planned methods is provided below. Any deviation from the SAP will be 
noted and explained in the clinical study report. 
13.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
Subjects will enter this protocol from the AURORA 1 study in order to provide the opportunity 
of an additional 24 months of treatment (total of 36 months of treatment); no sample size 
calculation is required.  
13.3 Populations  
13.3.1  Intent -to-Trea t Set  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) set will be based on ITT principles and will consist of all subjects 
who are consented  to treatment. This group will be analyzed based on the t reatment to which 
the subject was randomized  in the AURORA 1 study . 
13.3.2  Safety Set  
The safety set will consist of all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study drug in the 
continuation study. The subjects in this group will be analyzed based on the treatment they 
received. Subjects who receive treatment from more than 1 arm will be assigned to the Orelv o 
arm. 
13.4 Background and Demographic Characteristics  
Demographic and clinical disease characteristics will be summarized by treatment arm in a 
descriptive manne r but no statistical tests will be performed.  
13.5 Study Treatment 
Compliance to the study treatment will be determined by dividing the number of softgel 
capsules taken by the expected number of softgel capsules to be taken (based on prescribed 
dose) over the subject’s participation in the study.  
Results will be summarized by means of descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) and frequency tables, by treatment arm.

13 October 2017  Page 73 of 102 
 13.7.2.2 Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Change in immunology parameters (C3, C4, and anti -dsDNA) from AURORA 1 
baseline.  
• Change in HRQoL  (SF-36) from AURORA 1 baseline. 
• HRU. 
13.8 Statistical and Analytical Methods  
13.8.1  Safety Analysis 
The primary safety  endpoint s are the AE profile and routine biochemical and hematological 
assessments at Month 36 (S ection  13.7.1, Primary Safety Endpoint ).  
13.8.2  Efficacy Analysis 
All the secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT set . Data for each visit (as 
well as change from AURORA 1 study baseline as required)  will be summarized by treatment 
group and visit for each secondary endpoint.   
13.8.2.1 Response Endpoints  
The following key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT population 
using logistic regression with terms for treatment group, baseline UPCR, biopsy class , and 
MMF use at baseline (from AURORA 1)  in the model.  
• Proportion of subjects in renal response at Months 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36. 
• Proportion of subjects in partial renal response at Months 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36. 
The results will be expressed as an odds ratio (and associated two sided 95% CI) for Orelvo 
compared to placebo. Odds ratios greater than unity show the odds of response are greater for 
Orelvo than for placebo and therefore indicate a benefit of the Orelvo treatment arm. 
13.8.2.2 Renal flare and Extra -renal flare  
The proportion of subjects with renal and extra -renal flares (as adjudic ated by the CEC) will 
be analyzed in a similar fashion to the proportion of subjects achieving response. 13.8.2.3 Change from Baseline Endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a Mixed Effect Model Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) . The MMRM model w ill include terms for treatment, visit, treatment by 
visit interaction , and baseline.  Results will be expressed as differences between treatment arms 
(along with the associated 95% CI).

baseline at each visit . 
• Change in immunology parameters (C3, C4, and anti -dsDNA) from AURORA 1 
baseline at each visit . 
• Change in HRQoL  (SF-36) from AURORA 1 baseline  at Months 12, 18, 24, 30, and 
36. 
• Change in SELENA- SLEDAI scores by visit  at Months 12, 18, 24, and 36. 
13.8.2.4 Health care Resource Utilization  (HRU)  
• Healthcare Resource Utilization at Months 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, and 36. Key 
aspects will be summarized by visit and changes over time will be explored.

• Biochemical (including liver function tests) and hematological laboratory tests  
• AE profile and routine biochemical and hematological safety parameters  
• Vital signs (BP, HR, temperature) at specific time points and change from baseline 
• Standard 12- lead ECGs change from baseline  
• Discontinuations from treatment  
• Concomitant medications  
Laboratory values, vital signs , and other safety parameters providing numeric data will be 
summarized by visit as absolute values and change fr om baseline. Laboratory values outside 
of defined normal ranges will be summarized. 
Adverse events will be coded using the latest available version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities, the version of which will be provided in the clinical s tudy report.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by treatment arm, system organ class , 
and preferred term. SAEs, SAEs that led to death, and SAEs/AEs that led to withdrawal will

The ICF used for the study must comply with the Declaration of Helsinki, federal regulations, 
and ICH guidelines; and must have been approved by the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Ethics Committee ( EC)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) prior to use. The 
Investigator or an authorized associate must explain the nature of the study and the treatment 
in such a manner that the subject is aware of potential benefits and risks. Subje cts must also be 
informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. Subjects must be provided sufficient time to consider participation, 
including discussion with family members prior to signing the ICF. Documentation of the 
discussion and the date of informed consent must be recorded in the source documentation. 
After signing the ICF, subjects will be enrolled into the study and assigned the same subject 
identification number from the AURORA 1  study, that will be used on all subject 
documentation. 
The informed consent can be signed  on the Month 12 visit  (Week 52/ End of Treatment Visit 
in the AURORA 1 study).  
14.2 Institutional Review Board or EC/IEC  
The protocol, any protocol amendments and consent  form for the proposed clinical study and 
any other documents required by the local IRB/EC/IEC must be submitted by the Investigator

The Investigator must ensure that all study- related site source data, study -related documents , 
and reports will be available, and that the provision of direct access for monitoring and auditing 
by Aurinia or its designees will be permitted. In addition, the Investigator must ensure that all 
study- related site source data, study -related documents, and reports will be made available for 
inspection by the appropriate Regulatory Authority and review by the IRB/EC/IEC. 
The Investigator is responsible for notifying Aurinia in advance of an impending regulatory 
inspection. He/she may request that Aurinia provide support for preparation, if necessary. The 
Investigator is required to provide updates to Aurinia on the ongoing activities during the 
inspection, respond to any citations/objectionable findings (i.e., U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration Form 483) and to share any follow up responses from the Regulatory 
Authority. 
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross -check of the 
eCRFs against the Investigator’s records by the Study Monitor (source document verification). 
The Monitor will also review the Investigator’s drug accountability records to ensure that the 
drug supplies are stored and dispensed appropriately. A comprehensive validation program will verify the data and queries will be generated for resolution by the Investigator. Throughout 
the study, Aurinia or its  designates may review data as deemed necessary.

commission or omission on the part of such Investigators or third parties and that are not in accordance with accepted common medical practices ( lege artis  procedures). Aurinia will 
reimburse the subject for all study -related injuries provided that the injury does not arise from 
the subject’s misuse of the study treatment or failure to follow the Investigator’s instructions. 
16.1.3  Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by representatives of Aurinia (or designee, which may include a 
contract research organization ). If not monitored by Aurinia, documentation of delegation will 
be described in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  It is understood that the responsible Monitor will 
contact and visit the Investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the 
various records of the study (eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject 
confidentiality is maintaine d in accordance with local requirements.  
It will be the Monitor's responsibility to inspect the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study (frequency outlined in a separate procedural document), to verify the adherence to the 
 
 
AURORA 2 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -02), Version 1.0  Confidential  
13 October 2017  Page 79 of 102 
 protocol and the completeness, consistency , and accuracy of the data being entered on them. 
The Monitor must have access to laboratory test reports and other subject records needed to 
verify the entries on the eCRF. The Investigator (or his/her deputy) agrees to co- operate with 
the Monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are 
resolved. 
16.2 Investigator’s Responsibilities  
16.2.1  Reporting and Recording of Data 
All required study data must be entered in the e CRF created for the study. Training on the  
system will be provided to all sites, including instructions on how to address missing data, 
corrections, query procedures , and electronic signatures. Only individuals who are identified 
on the authorized signature page may enter/correct data in the eCRF.  For those subjects who 
withdraw before completion of the study, all available efficacy and safety data must be entered 
in the eCRF. Incomplete or inconsistent data on the eCRF will result in data queries addressed 
to the Investigator for resolution. 
16.2.2  Investigator Training 
All Investigators and their study personnel will receive training regarding the study procedures, 
study treatments, and GCP/regulations specific to the conduct of clinical studie s. This training 
will take place prior to enrollment of the first subject at the study site, and must be documented 
and filed in the Investigator’s Study Site File.  
16.2.3  Source Documentation 
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the 
study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. 
Subject clinical source documents would include subject hospital/clinic records, physician’s 
and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, X -ray, pathology and 
special assessment reports, signed ICFs, consultant letters, and subject enrollment logs. These 
are to be separate and distinct from eCRFs. All data for the study must be available in source 
documentation, including oral and written communication with the subject regarding the study 
treatme nt (including the risks and benefits of the study). The date of informed consent must be 
recorded in the source documentation. 
The Investigator must arrange for the retention of all study documentation (such as eCRFs, 
research files, and master files) for the duration specified in their respective site contract. The 
Investigator must keep these documents on file after completion or discontinuation of the study according to local governing guidelines. Archived data may be held electronically, provided 
that a  back -up copy exists and that a hard copy can be generated if required.

 17. PROCEDURE FOR MODIFICA TION OF PROTOCOL OR 
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY  
17.1 Protocol Waivers, Deviations and Violations  
Protocol waivers shall not be permitted.  
The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without 
written agreement from Aurinia and prior documented approval/favorable opinion from the 
IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study . If th e Investigator must implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects without prior written approval , the 
implemented deviation or change and the reasons for it should be submitted in a timely ma nner 
to Aurinia and to the IRB/IEC as required by applicable local requirements.  
The Investigator, or person designated by the Investigator, will document and record the preventative and/or corrective measures for any deviation from the approved protocol. 
Accidental deviations from the protocol including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be assessed as minor or major on a case- by-case basis. The criteria describing the 
deviation(s) and how they will be handled will be documented in the SAP. 
Any amendment to the protocol requires written approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC 
prior to its implementation, unless there are overriding safety reasons. In some instances , an amendment may require a change to the ICF. The Investigator must 
receive an IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion concerning the reviewed document prior to 
administering to study subjects.  
17.2 Study Termination  
Aurinia reserves the right to terminate the study in its entirety or at a site at any time. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to  the following : unsatisfactory subject 
enrollment with respect to quality and/or quantity, site is unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol or GCP, or data recording is inaccurate and/or incomplete. 
In terminating the  study, Aurinia and the Investigator will assure that adequate consideration 
is given to the protection of the subject s. Both parties will arrange the procedures on an 
individual basis after review and consultation and in accordance with the study contract.

Aurinia is committed to the timely communication of data from clinical research trials, 
following the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America principles [24]. Where 
possible, authorship will be agreed at the beginning of the study. The authors will form a publication committee and this committee will propose and develop appropriate scient ific 
manuscripts or abstracts from the study data. Investigators may not present or publish partial or complete study results individually. Any manuscript or abstract proposed by the 
Investigators must be reviewed and approved in writing by Aurinia before submission for 
publication. Names of all Investigators participating in the study will be included in the 
publication. 
The publication committee for a study will comprise of authors selected in adherence with the 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria [25] for authorship. If studies are 
multicenter, it may be appropriate to assign group authorship. 
In addition, certain Aurinia employees involved in the design and conception of the protocol, 
study management and data analysis and interpretation are qualified authors and will be 
included in the publication committee.

 Appendix 1 Drug Therapy for the Treatment of Hypertension  
Antihypertensive drug therapy for subjects who develop hypertension while on study treatment  
may include the following : 
• Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine) 
• Alpha-1-adrenergic blocking agents (e.g., doxazosin) 
• Alpha- beta-blockers (e.g., carvedilol, labetalol) 
• Thiazide diuretics ( e.g., chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide) 
Excluded Drugs: While the ARBs and ACE inhibitors may also be effective in CNI -associated 
hypertension, their dose adjustment or commencement is not permitted in this trial (see 
Section  7.8.1, Prohibited Medications ). 
Recommended First  and Second Line Therapies for Treatment  of Hypertension  
Titrate the following according to the timeframe given in the respective drug label:  
First Line - select from one of the following:  
• Amlodipine, 5 mg daily to achieve BP <140/90 mmHg; titrate to 10  mg daily if 
satisfactory results not obtained within 2 weeks 
• Nifedipine XL, 30 mg daily; titrate to 60 mg and possibly 90 mg daily within 2 weeks 
• 12.5 to 25 mg/day of chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide 
Second Line - may add from among the following to the first line therapy if a partial re sponse 
is obtained: 
• Labetalol, 100 mg BID; titrate to 200 mg BID, then 300 mg BID 
Note: If the BP remains uncontrolled with the above -referenced maximum doses of first and 
second -line antihypertensive therapies, reduction of study treatment dose may be considered 
or it may be decided to discontinue study treatment  and utilize antihypertensive therapies to 
achieve control of BP. 
If at any time, in the judgment of the treating physician in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor, the response to treatment is in adequate, the study treatment  may be 
discontinued.

 Appendix 2 Measurement of Blood Pressure  
1. Whenever possible, BP measurements should be undertaken by the same study site 
personnel at each clinic visit.  
2. Whenever possible, the BP determinations should be undertaken at approximately the same 
time of day for each study visit and at the same time in relation to prior study treatment 
ingestion. 
3. The measurements should be undertaken prior to blood collection. 
4. Prior to measuring BP, the study subject should be seated in a quiet room for at least 
5 minutes, in a chair with his/her back supported and feet comfortably resting on the floor. 
5. Due to the likelihood each arm can have a slightly different BP, it is strongly encouraged 
to use the same arm for all measurements, supported at heart level.  
6. No restrictive clothing should encircle the arm in which BP measurements are determined.  
7. An appropriately sized cuff will be required wherein the cuff bladder encircles at least 80% 
of the upper portion of the arm. 
8. Three serial BP readings will be undertaken with a minimum of 2 minutes between 
readings and with the cuff fully deflated between each determination.  
9. The mean  of the second and third of these 3 readings will be used as the study day BP 
value.  
10. All measurements , along with the calculated mean  value, will be recorded in the source 
documents. The mean  of the second and third readings will be calculated within the EDC  
as the study day result.

(ISN/RPS) 2003 Classification of Lupus Nephritis 
Class I  Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis  
Normal glomeruli by light microscopy, but mesangial immune deposits by 
immunofluorescence  
Class II  Mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis  
Purely mesangial hypercellularity of any degree or mesangial matrix expansion by light microscopy, with mesangial immune deposits 
May be a few isolated subephithelial or subendothelial deposits visible by 
immunofluorescence or electron microscopy, but not by light microscopy 
Class III  Focal lupus nephritisª  
Active or inactive focal, segmental or global endo- or extracapillary glomerulonephritis involving <50% of all glomeruli, typically with focal subendothelial immune deposits , with or without mesangial alterations  
Class III (A)  Active lesions: focal proliferative lupus nephritis  
Class III (A/C)  Active and chronic lesions: focal proliferative and sclerosing lupus nephritis 
Class III (C)  Chronic inactive lesions with glomerular scars: focal sclerosing lupus 
nephritis 
Class IV  Diffuse lupus nephritis
b 
Active or inactive diffuse, segmental or global endo- or extracapillary 
glomerulonephritis involving ≥50% of all glomeruli, typically with diffuse 
subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations. This class is divided into diffuse segmental (IV -S) lupus nephritis when ≥50% of 
the involved glomeruli have segmental lesions, and diffuse global (IV- G) 
lupus nephritis when ≥50% of the involved glomeruli have global lesions. 
Segmental is defined as a glomerular lesion that involves less than  half of the 
glomerular tuft. This class includes cases with diffuse wire loop deposits but 
with little or no glomerular proliferation.  
Class IV -S (A)  Active lesions: diffuse segmental proliferative lupus nephritis  
Class IV -G (A)  Active lesions: diffuse g lobal proliferative lupus nephritis 
Class IV -S (A/C)  Active and chronic lesions: diffuse segmental proliferative and sclerosing lupus nephritis

 Class IV -G (A/C)  Active and chronic lesions: diffuse global proliferative and sclerosing lupus 
nephritis 
Class I V-S (C)  Chronic inactive lesions with scars: diffuse segmental sclerosing lupus 
nephritis 
Class IV -G (C)  Chronic inactive lesions with scars: diffuse global sclerosing lupus nephritis 
Class V  Membranous lupus nephritis  
Global or segmental subephithelial im mune deposits or their morphologic 
sequelae by light microscopy and by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy, with or without mesangial alterations  
Class V lupus nephritis may occur in combination with class II or IV in which case both will be diagnosed 
Class V lupus nephritis show advanced sclerosis  
Class VI  Advanced sclerosis lupus nephritis  
≥90% of glomeruli globally sclerosed without residual activity

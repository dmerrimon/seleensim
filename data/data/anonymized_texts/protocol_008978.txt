Abstract  11 
Background:  Syphilis  rates  have  been  increasing  both in  the US and internationally  with  12 
incidence higher  among men-who-have- sex-with-men and people  living  with  human 13 
immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) infection. Currently, benzathine  penicillin  is the recommended  14 
treatment  for syphilis  in all patients . Global  shortages  and cost increases  in benzathine  penicillin  15 
call for alternative  treatment options. This  study evaluates  the efficacy  of oral cefixime  for the  16 
treatment  of early  syphilis.  17 
Method s: We are conducting a  randomized, multisite,  open- label,  non- comparative clinical  trial 18 
in Los Angeles  and Oakland , California.  Eligible  participants  are ≥18 years  old, with  primary,  19 
secondary  or early  latent  syphilis  (Rapid  Plasma  Reagin  [RPR]  titer ≥1:8).  Patients  with  HIV  20 
infection  must  have  a viral  load  ≤200 copies/mL  and CD4+  T cell count  ≥350 cells/μl during the  21 
past 6 months. Participants  are randomized to  receive  either  2.4M  IU benzathine  penicillin  G 22 
intramuscularly  once  or cefixime  400mg orally  twic e a day for 10 days.  Participants  return  at 3, 6, 23 
and 12 months  post -treatment  for follow -up RPR serological  testing.  The primary  outcome  is the 24 
proportion of  participants  who  achieve ≥4 -fold RPR titer  decrease at  3- or 6-months  post - 25 
treatment.  26 
Discussion:  Clinical trials  evaluating  the efficacy  of alternative  antibiotics  to penicillin  are urgently 27 
needed .  28

Background  and rationale  {6a}  40 
Syphilis  rates  have  been  increasing  both in  the US and internationally,  with  incidence higher  among 41 
men-who-have- sex-with-men and people  living  with  human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) 42 
infection  (2-4). Currently, benzathine  penicillin  is the recommended  treatment  for syphilis  in all 43 
patients,  including those  living  with  HIV  infection. Doxycycline  and tetracycline are available 44 
alternative  treatments  for non- pregnant  patients  who  are allergic  to peni cillin  (5-8).  Injectable  daily  45 
ceftriaxone is  another  alternative  treatment  that may  be considered and  is safe in  pregnancy, as a 46 
recent  review  from  our team  showed (9).  47 
Existing  alternative  treatment  recommendations  are based  on clinical  experience,  a limited  number  48 
of small clinical  trials,  and case series  (5-7, 10). However,  each regimen  poses  clinical  challenges.  49 
Doxycycline/tetracycline  require  14 days of treatment  by mouth, with tetracycline  requiring four 50 
daily  doses. Ceftriaxone  is administered  intramuscularly,  just like penicillin,  but it requires  daily  51 
injections  for 10-14 days, making adherence potentially  problematic.  In pregnancy, only benzathine  52 
penicillin  is recommended  due to potential  toxic  effects  of the alternatives  or due to insufficient  53 
efficacy  data (WHO).  Shortages  of benzathine  penicillin  worldwide  have  led to the use of unproven  54 
non-penicillin  alternatives  (10-12).  55 
Considering the high cost and time required  for developing and approving  new antibiotics  that can 56 
treat syphilis  in patients  with and without  HIV infection, a new approach  for identifying new, safe, 57 
and efficacious  antibiotic  treatments  for syphilis  is necessary.  Previously Food and Drug  58 
Administration  (FDA) -approved antibiotics,  that are safe and efficacious  in other  infections  and have 59 
a favorable  pharmacologic  profile  suggesting activity  against  Treponema pallidum , may be effective  60 
alternatives  for treating  syphilis.  61 
Cefixime  is an FDA -approved orally  administered  third -generation  cephalosporin with spectrum  of 62 
activity  and pharm acokinetic  profile  similar  to that of ceftriaxone,  a drug which  has been  used for the 63 
Page 6 of 20 treatment  for syphilis  (13). Cefixime  is clinically  used for uncomplicated urinary  tract infections,  64 
upper  respiratory  tract bacterial  infections  and in the treatment  of uncomplicated  Neisseria  65 
gonorrhoeae  genital  infection  (14).  To  our knowledge, it has never  been  studied as a treatment  for 66 
early  syphilis.  67 
Cefixime  has a well-studied pharmacokinetic  profile  (14-19). Unlike  other  alternatives  for syphilis, 68 
adverse event  profiles  are favorable  with cefixime in non-pregnant  as well as pregnant  patients  (20, 69 
21) . Nearly  40-50% of the dose is absorbe d when  it is given orally, whether  administered  with or 70 
without  food. Peak  concentrations  occur  between  2 and 6 hours  following oral administration  of a 71 
single  400mg tablet.  A single  400mg tablet  produces  an average  peak  concentration  of approximately  72 
3.7μg/mL  (range  1.3-7.7μg/mL). Typical  blood levels  of cefixime  after a single  dose of cefixime  400 73 
mg by mouth are 4.84 μg/ml maximum at 4 hours  and above  1.0 μg/ml at 12 hours. Serum  protein  74 
binding is concentration  independent  with a bound fraction  of approximately  65%. Cefixime  is 75 
moderately  distributed  into extracellular  water/tissue  pools.  Its  half-life averages  to 3-4 hours  but 76 
may range  up to 9 hours  in healthy  volunteers. Approximately 50% of the absorbed dose is excreted  77 
unmodified in  the urine  within 24 hours  and nearly  10%  is excreted  in bile (10) .  78 
We therefore  believe that cefixime’s  pharm acokinetic  similarity  to ceftriaxo ne and its safety  in the 79 
treatment  of pregnant  women  could potentially  make it a viable  option in the treatment  of early  80 
syphil is.  81 
 82 
Objective {7}  83 
The primary  objective  of our study is to determine  the efficacy  of cefixime  400mg, taken  orally  two 84 
times  a day (BID)  for 10 consecutive  days. Our hypothesis  is that cefixime would be an efficacious  85 
treatment  for early  syphilis.   86 
 87 
Trial  design  {8} 88 
Page 7 of 20 This is a randomized, open- label,  non- comparative pilot clinical  trial. Participants  will be randomly 89 
assigned  (1:1 allocation)  to receive either  the standard  of care benzathine penicillin  injection  or 10- 90 
days of oral cefixime.  The study will require  2 years  to be completed  and each participant  will be part 91 
of the study for one year.  92

Who will take  informed  consent?  {26a}  120 
Patients  must  provide  written,  informed  consent  before  any study procedures  occur  (randomization, 121 
blood sample  collection,  treatment) . Consent  will be  obtained by a  study team  member  in a private  122 
exam ination  room .  123 
 124 
Additional  consent  provisions  for collection  and use of participant  data  and biological  125 
specimens  {26b}  126 
Patients  will also  sign a  Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability  Act (HIPAA)  release form  127 
allow ing access  to clinical  and laboratory  data, including their  HIV  test results.   128 
 129 
Interventions  130 
Explanation  for the choice of  comparators  {6b} 131 
This is a pilot,  non- comparative clinical trial designed  to collect  preliminary  efficacy  data.  It 132 
includes  an “experimental  arm” of  participants  receiving cefixime  and a contemporaneous  “control  133 
arm” of  participants  receiving  benzathine  penicillin.  The study was  not designed to  be adequately  134 
powered  to show  a statistically  significant  difference in  the efficacy  between  the penicillin  and 135 
cefixime  arms.   136 
 137 
Intervention  description  {11a}  138 
Page 9 of 20 Eligible  participants  who  provide  their  consent  are randomized  to the two arms  of the study. 139 
Initially , the study team  collects  demographic  (age,  gender, race,  ethnicity,  contact,  sexual  140 
orientation ) and clinical  information (most  recent  RPR titer,  CD4  T cell count, HIV  viral  load). A 141 
venipuncture  blood sample  is collected  by trained  clinic  staff  and it is sent to the laboratory for 142 
testing . Testing  is conducted on serum  using the  Arlington scientific  RPR test  kit (Arlington, 143 
Virginia ) (22) . Participants  are randomly assigned  to the two treatment  groups. Participants  144 
assigned  to the penicillin  arm will receive 1 dose  of 2.4M  IU benzathine penicillin  G on the  day of 145 
enrollment.  Participants  who  are assigne d to the cefixime  arm will be  given 20 capsules  of oral 146 
cefixime  400mg on the  day of enrollment  to take for the following 10 days.  Study staff  observed 147 
receipt  of the first dose. Subjects  in the cefixime  arm will then  be asked  to return  for a clinical  148 
assessment  or have a  phone  call assessment  with  the study team  member  2 weeks  following 149 
enrolment .  150 
Study staff  will follow  up with  all participants  at 3, 6, and  12 months. In  each follow  up, 151 
participants  are asked  questions  regarding symptoms, antibi otic use in the past 3 months  and 152 
number  of sex partners  with  whom  they  had condom -less sex in the past 3 months.  A  new  153 
venipuncture  blood sample  is also collected  for RPR testing  154 
  155 
Criteria  for discontinuing  or modifying allocated  interventions  {11b}  156 
Participants  may  request  to leave the  study or  they  may  be withdrawn  due to study- related  adverse 157 
events . If a subject  is discontinued from  study participation  due to an adverse event,  they  will be  158 
evaluated  by the  study clini cians  for the  need  of additional  treatment  for syphilis.  Safety  data will 159 
be collected  on any subject  who  is withdrawn  from  the study. 160 
Participants  in both study  groups  may  receive additional  treatment  with  penicillin,  if they  show  no 161 
response  to treatment (stable  or absence of  4-fold decline at  6 months).   162 
 163 
Page 10 of 20 Strategies  to improve  adherence to  interventions  {11c}  164 
To ensure  retention  of participants,  follow -up visits  will be  scheduled  to coincide  with  routine  clinic  165 
appointments  for HIV  care or  preventive  sexual  health  appointments, which  occur  every  three 166 
months . In addition, st udy staff  will contact  participants , either  over  the phone  or via text mess age, 167 
before  their scheduled  follow -up appointment. Finally,  participants  will receive reimbursement  for 168 
their time  and transportation in  the form  of a gift card . 169 
 170 
Relevant  concomitant  care permitted  or prohibited during  the trial  {11d}  171 
Usual  HIV  care and  treatment  for the  participant  will continue  throughout  the trial.  Concomitant  172 
antibiotic  use during the  participation  in the study duration of  the trial will be  recorded .  173 
 174 
Provisions  for post -trial care {30} 175 
Once participants  complete  the study, they  will be  able to  continue  receiving  clinical  care from  the 176 
clinics.  Participants  study records  will be  reviewed  and if necessary,  additional  treatment  for 177 
syphilis  will be  administered  according  to the standard  of care protocol.  178 
 179 
Outcomes  {12}  180 
The primary  outcome  is the successful  treatment  of early  syphilis  by the  3-, or 6-month follow -up. 181 
The participants’  RPR titer  will be  used  as the primary  measure of  outcome. Successful  treatment  is 182 
defined  as an equal  or greater  than  4-fold RPR titer  decrease, from  baseline to  3 or 6 months  after  183 
treatment .  184 
 185 
Participant  timeline  {13}  186 
Participants  will be  part of the study for 12 months. Study evaluations  will occur  at 3, 6- and 12- 187 
months  post -treatment.  See Figure  1 for the  participant  timeline  for the  trial.   188

Sample  size {14}  193 

Page 12 of 20 The primary analysis will compute the proportion of subjects with a 4- fold decrease (from study 194 
entry RPR) in RPR titer from baseline at 6 months in the per protocol analysis population. If we 195 
assume a sample size of 40 and the proportion of subjects with a 4 -fold decrease in RPR from 196 
baseline at 6 months to be 0.9 (90%), we would have a 95% confidence interval of ( 0.76, 0.97) . To 197 
calculate the number of subjects required to enroll to reach 40 evaluable subjects in the PP analysis 198 
population, the assumptions that 20% of subjects will be excluded from the PP analysis population 199 
(due to loss to follow -up or non- compliance with study medication schedule). Under that 200 
assumption, enrolling 50 subjects will provide 40 subjects in the PP analysis population.  201 
 202 
Recruitment  {15}  203 
Participant  recruitment will occur  in 4 AID S Healthcare Foundation (AHF)  Clinics  based  in Los 204 
Angeles,  California  and Oakland, California . Study clinicians  will review  the medical  and 205 
laboratory records  of syphilis  cases  returning for treatment  before  the scheduled clinical  visit and  if 206 
the participant  fulfil s the eligibility  criteria,  they  will be  invited  to participate  in the study.  207 
 208 
Assignment  of interventions:  randomization  209 
Sequence  generation  {16a}  210 
After  consent, participants  are randomly assigned  to the study arms  with  a 1:1 allocat ion. We will 211 
use a simple  randomization method with  a shuffled  deck  of sealed  envelopes  that contain  a card  212 
with the assigned  treatment. The  cards  are created  before  the enrollment  period and  distributed  to 213 
each of the study sites.   No other  factors  will be  taken  into consideration  for randomization.  214 
Concealment  mechanism  {16b}  215 
The envelope s containing the  randomization cards  are sealed,  thus  the team  member  conducting 216 
enrollment  does  not know  the content  of the envelope. 217 
Page 13 of 20 Implementation  {16c}  218 
The study staff  will ask  the participant  to select  a sealed  envelope  from  the shuffled  deck.  After 219 
selecting  the envelope,  the participant  will reveal  the treatment  to themselves  and the study staff.   220 
 221 
Assignment  of interventions:  Blinding  222 
Who will be  blinded {17a}  223 
This is an open label  clinical  trial,  while  neither  the participants  nor the study staff  will be  blinded 224 
to the  assigned  treatmen t, staff  performing statistical analyses  will be  masked  to treatment  225 
assignment . 226 
Procedure for unblinding  if needed  {17b}  227 
Not applicable.  228 
Data  collection  and management  229 
Plans  for assessment  and collection  of outcomes  {18a}  230 
A venipuncture  blood sample  will be  collected  at 3, 6, and  12 month visits  and it will be  tested  for 231 
RPR titer. . Study data collected  on baseline include  basic demographic  information , sexual  history, 232 
laboratory tests  (CD4  count, viral  load, RPR titer ). On each  follow  up visit,  sexual  history, 233 
antibiotic  use, symptoms  and the RPR titer  will be  collected.  Data will be  collected  on paper  data 234 
collection  forms  and will be entered  into Research  Electronic  Data Capture  (REDCap ) (23, 24) .   235 
Plans  to promote  participant  retention  and complete follow -up {18b}  236 
Study follow -up visits  are scheduled  to coincide with routine  clinic  appointments  within  AHF.  237 
Study staff  will send  participants  a 1 month, 2 week,  and 1 day  notification  prior  to their  follow -up 238 
appointment.  239 
Data  management  {19}  240 
Page 14 of 20 Participant  data will be  collected  on paper  data collection  forms  and entered  into RedCap.  Data that  241 
will be  entered  into RedCap  include  participant  information (name,  date of  birth, medical  record  242 
number, contact  information)  and laboratory results.   243 
Confidentiality  {27}  244 
Redcap  servers  are encrypted,  HIPAA -compliant,  password protected  and accessible only by 245 
designated  study members.  Hard copy data collection  forms  will be  stored  into a locked  cabinet  246 
with limited  access  only to  designated  members.   247 
 248 
Plans  for collection,  laboratory evaluation  and storage  of biological  specimens  for genetic or 249 
molecular analysis  in this trial/future  use {33}  250 
There are no plans  in this trial to  evaluate or  store  biological  specimen  for genetic or  molecular  251 
analysis  for future  use.  252 
 253 
Statistical  methods  254 
Statistical  methods  for primary  and secondary  outcomes  {20a}  255 
The primary  analysis  for the main  outcome  will be  conducted on the  “Per Protocol”  (PP)  256 
population. This  will include  participants  who  satisfy  the inclusion and  exclusion criteria,  257 
completed  treatment  (i.e. received  the penicillin  injection  or received  all of the cefixime  pills),  258 
report  no adverse events,  returned  for follow -up visits  (3 and/or  6 months)  and have  an evaluable 259 
RPR result.   260 
For each  treatment  group, we  will calculate  the proportion of  PP participants  who  achieved  a 4-fold 261 
RPR titer  decrease at 3, or  6-months  post -treatment  and the exact  binomial  95%  confidence 262 
interval.   263 
 264

Plans  to give  access  to the full protocol, participant  level -data  and statistical  code {31c}  269 
The protocol  of the study  is publicly available on clinicaltrials.gov  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Deidentified  270 
data will be  available upon request  to the study Primary  Investigator.  271 
 272 
Oversight  and monitoring  273 
Composition  of the coordinating center and  trial  steering  committee {5d}  274 
The immediate  study research  team  based  in the University  of California  of Los Angeles  meet  on a  275 
weekly  basis.  The immediate  team  is joined by a  wider  team  of AHF  study clinicians , based  in 276 
study clinics,  who  also meet  on a  weekly  basis.   277 
 278 
Composition  of the data  monitoring committee,  its role and  reporting  structure {21a}  279 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring Board  (DSMB) will be  composed of  a physician, biostatistician,  280 
regulatory affairs  specialist /ethicist and  will oversee the  study throughout  the 2-year study period. 281 
They  will review  study activities  every  6 months. The  committee  will review  safety  data and  282 
clinical  efficacy  reports  and report  their decision to  the Primary  investigator.  283 
 284 
Adverse event  reporting  and harms  {22}  285 
The study site investigators  will report  serious  adverse events  and adverse  events  to the responsible  286 
IRB for that study site in accordance with respective IRB policies  and procedures. Follow -up 287 
Page 16 of 20 information  to a reported  adverse  event  will be submitted  to the IRB as soon as the relevant  288 
information  is available.   289 
 290 
Frequency  and plans  for auditing  trial  conduct  {23} 291 
The trial and  individual  clinic  sites  will be  audited  at least  once  during the  duration of  the study by 292 
the study sponsor  (AIDS  Healthcare Foundation).  293 
 294 
Plans  for communicating  important  protocol  amendments  to relevant  parties  (e.g. trial  295 
participants,  ethical  committees)  {25}  296 
Amendments  will be  submitted  to the IRB  according  to policies  and guidance . Any  protocol  297 
changes  will be  promptly  communicated  to the IRB,  the DSMB  and the study team.   298 
 299 
Dissemination  plans  {31a}  300 
We plan  to disseminate  study results  through peer -reviewed  journal  publications  and conference  301 
presentations. Study findings  will also  be shared  with relevant  clinical  and scientific  groups.  302 
 303 
Discussion  304 
This is a randomized, non- comparative,  pilot  study evaluating  the efficacy  of daily  oral cefixime  305 
400mg for 10 days  for the  treatment  of early  syphilis. To  our knowledge, this  is the first study 306 
assessing the  efficacy  of cefixime  for early  syphilis . As syphilis  rates  increase and  penicillin  307 
shortages  continue  to occur  in the United  States  and worldwide , alternative  treatments  that are 308 
efficacious  for both pregnant  and non- pregnant  populations , regardless  of HIV status  are needed  (6- 309

Data from  this pilot study could be used  as a foundation to  assess the clinical effectiveness  for 312 
cefixime  in early  syphilis treatment.   Currently, our study is  being conducted among non-pregnant 313 
individuals. However,  subsequent clinical  studies should also  include women  and pregnant women  314 
to address  the gap  in the treatment  of maternal  syphilis.   315

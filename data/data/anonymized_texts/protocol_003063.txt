Randomized Controlled Trial Design:   
 
Objective and Specific Aims: 
The objective of this project was to address the problem of silo interventions and to improve 
accessibility to intervention that both reduces maternal depression and improves infant social 
emotional and communication development. To achieve this objective the following specific 
aims were addressed:  
1. Embed core components of the Mom-Net Internet intervention into the Internet based
virtual coaching intervention, Baby Net, to create Mom and Baby Net, an instructionally sound
program geared to reduce the internal demands of depressed mothers postpartum.
2. Evaluate the impact of the Mom and Baby Net (MBN) program, as compared to a parallel
Internet remote coaching intervention: Depression and Developmental Awareness (DDAS), via a
randomized controlled trial. Depressed mothers during the postpartum period and their infants
(N=180 dyads) will be randomized to the MBN or DDAS . Impact will be examined relative to:
2.1 Change in parenting behavior, attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, and stress; 
2.2 Infant social-emotional behavior and development change;  
2.3 maternal depressive symptoms change; and 
2.4 Concomitant change in parenting, infant social-emotional, and maternal depressive 
symptom outcomes as a result of intervention. 
3. Evaluate moderating influences on parent and infant behavior within the context of
depression during
the post partum period. We will focus on:
3.1 The extent to which maternal depression prior to intervention, including current 
depression symptoms as well as depressive history and chronicity, relate to dosage 
within the MBN program;  
3.2 How dosage moderates parent and infant behavioral change as well as maternal 
depressive symptom change; and 
3.3 The extent to which contextual risks surrounding mothers (maternal isolation, social 
support and relationship status and conflict) not only relate to maternal depressive 
symptoms and MBN program dosage/skill acquisition but also moderate parenting, 
infant, and maternal depressive symptom change. 
4. Assess maintenance of the program effects at 1-, 3- and 6-months after intervention. These
trajectories for mothers and infants will allow for building a preliminary view of intervention
effects as infants move into the next stage of development to determine if intervention early in
infancy produces continued positive effects as these infants age.

you’ve been feeling over the past 2 weeks. I’m going to read 2 statements with some answer choices for
each one.
Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things? Not at all,
several days, more than half the days, or nearly every day?

5. PARTICIPANTISELIGIBLE
Based on the information you just gave me, you are eligible to participate in the program at this time.
Before finalizing eligibility, we will confirm at our first visit that there is Sprint wireless coverage at your
home. If you are interested in participating, the first step will be for us to come to your home to
complete the first assessment. During that visit we will also go over the consent form, which will explain
all the project details again. It will review exactly what you are being asked to do as well as the risks
and benefits of being in this research study. We can answer any questions you have then before
continuing.
What questions do you have right now? Answeranyquestions.
Scheduleassessmentvisit: I’d like to go ahead and set up a time to come visit for the first assessment.
It’s possible to finish all of the assessment in one visit, but that really depends on how long it takes for
you to complete the questionnaire. We found it’s best to block up to 2 hours of time for the visit. Then,
we can just play it by ear. If you’re not finished after an hour or so, we can schedule a second visit to
finish up. Or, if you want to just power through and finish it in one visit, that’s your choice as well.It’s important to remember that the assessment visits are VERY different than the intervention.
It’s about gathering information about you and your baby – as compared to the intervention
where you are going through an iPhone app on your own while learning information and
watching fun videos of other moms and babies.
When scheduling the 1stvisit, it would be best to schedule this visit at a time of day when your
baby is usually awake and alert since we will record you and your baby playing together.
When is good for you? Is there a day or time that works best for you? Do you prefer mornings or
afternoon?

Is this the best number to call to follow up with you?
Can we leave a message at this number? Ifit’sacell# askifyoucantextherappointment
reminders.
If for some reason I can’t get a hold of you, it would be helpful to have some contact names and
numbers of people who would be able to reach you. Do you have one or two people who
typically stay in touch with you and know how to locate you even if you move or change
numbers? Can I get their names and phone numbers?

Informed Consent
Title: Mom & Baby Net
Principal Investigator: Kathleen Baggett, Ph.D.
Sponsor: NIH/NICHD
I. PURPOSE
You are invited to participate in a research study. The purpose of this study is to learn about
how it works to put two programs together. One program is for helping parents learn how to
change thoughts and actions to help themselves feel better. The other program helps parents
learn ways to help their babies’ development. We want to find out if putting these two
programs together and giving moms an iPhone to complete the program helps moms and
babies. You are invited to be a part of the study because you have said that you have been
feeling down and you want to help your baby grow in a healthy way. A total number of 180
moms will be recruited for this study. The study will take about 27 hours of your time over up
to 12 months.
II. PROCEDURES
If you decide to participate, you will be asked to complete the following:
1) Pre-Assessment Calls (2 hours, 20 minutes):  You will have calls to complete
enrollment in the study:
Call 1 (20 minutes): A research team member will have a call with you to read
the consent form. You will follow along on your own copy. The team member
will ask you to say what you understand about the project and allow you to ask
questions. The research staff will answer your questions. If you agree to
participate, you will be given an iPhone that will dropped off at your house or
mailed.
Call 2 (split, 1 hour each):
Call 2a: The research staff will record a 10-minute video of you and your
baby through a video call. The video will be divided into two parts. The
first part will be playing with your baby as usual at home. The second part
will be looking at a book with your baby. You can ask to stop the video at
any time if needed. You will then answer the first part of questions about
you and your baby while on a video call. You will be able to answer the
questions on your iPhone. Questions can be read aloud to you while you
wear ear phones. If you don’t want to answer a question, you can skip it.
Call 2b: This call will be completed within a few days of the first call. You
will continue to answer questions on your iPhone about you and your
baby.

Page 2 of 5
Version date: 05/08/20202) Training Call (1.5 hours):  You will receive one of two parent programs on the iPhone.
Both programs are set up the same way, but have different information. We want to
find out which program helps parents and babies the most. We will show you, through a
video call, how to use the phone. You don’t have to know how to use an iPhone before
you start the program.
Also during this call, you will use your iPhone to go to one of two parent program apps. 
A research staff person will show you how to use the program. You have an equal 
chance of being in either program. This will help us find out if one program works better 
than the other. Each program has the same number of sessions and the main activities 
are the same as described below under weekly program activities.
3) Weekly Program Activities (14 sessions, 1.5 hours each):   You will use the iPhone to
go through one of the two parent programs. Each program has 14 weekly sessions. You
will have up to 8 months to complete the app program to make sure you have plenty of
time to complete it.  We understand that sometimes things come up and you may not
be able work in the program each week.
Each of the 14 sessions will take about an hour to complete. You do not have to 
complete the activities all at the same time. Instead you can go through each session at 
your own speed. You can stop and start again when it’s best for you. After each session 
you will have a 30-minute call with your coach.
During each session you will do the following: Listen to parent information
Watch videos of other moms and babies
Make a plan to use the skills for yourself and your baby
Make a video of you and your baby
Have a weekly call with your coach on your iPhone to talk about what you are
learning in the program and watch the video that you made with your baby. Calls
are recorded for quality assurance.
Tell us what you think about the program session
During some sessions you will answer questions about how you are feeling. In between 
sessions, your coach may send messages to check in.
4) Post-Assessment Call (1.5 hours):   After you finish the iPhone program, we will
schedule a time to have a video call to answer survey questions and record a video of
you and your baby. You will keep the iPhone (valued at $350) at the end of this meeting.
If possible, this meeting can be done in person.
5) Follow-Up Questionnaire (10 minutes):  At 6 months after the program, you will use
your iPhone or other device to answer questions about parenting. You will receive $10

Page 3 of 5
Version date: 05/08/2020for completing this.
Moms who are not making progress and cannot be reached after 2 weeks will be sent a letter 
to confirm their continued participation. All participants will be given the opportunity to 
complete the post-assessment.
III. Risks
There are possible risks to being involved in any research study. Though we believe these risks to
be small, we want you to know what they are and the steps we take to protect against them.
1) You will be asked personal information about you and your baby. You should wear
headphones during the surveys. Only take the surveys in a private location where others
cannot see the device screen. You might feel uncomfortable answering questions about
your child or making a video. If you are uncomfortable, you may talk about your
concerns with the project staff.
2) Everything on the Internet is at risk to be seen by someone unexpected. There is a
chance that someone who is not supposed to see information about you will
accidentally see it.  On our part, any information you give us will not have your name on
it, but will be marked by a number instead, and the staff has been trained to keep
information private. Although recordings will be labeled by a number, videos are facially
identifiable, and someone who views them could recognize you or your baby.
3) We will not give information to anyone unless you give us signed permission or unless
we observe or you tell us of a concern about:  1) abuse, neglect, or endangerment of a
child or elder; or 2) that anyone is in immediate danger of seriously hurting
himself/herself or someone else.  Such reports will be made, with or without your
consent, as required by the law and for the safety of all persons, to the appropriate
authorities. If there is a concern about child safety, Child Protection services are called
as required by law. If there is concern about the immediate safety of an adult
emergency medical services are contacted, as required by law. If any person threatens
to harm another, the police are called, as required by law.
4) Because you will have an iPhone with Internet access, there is the chance that you or
others will be able to see sites that you don’t want to. It is your responsibility to use
your iPhone safely. We will show you how to lock and use a password to keep your
phone safe and to store your phone safely. Don’t give your password to anyone.
IV. Benefits
Participation in this study may benefit you personally. Some parents like learning about their
baby’s development. They sometimes say that they feel better and their relationship with their
baby has gotten better. Overall, we hope to gain information to help us make the program
better for other mothers and babies in the future.

Page 4 of 5
Version date: 05/08/2020V. Compensation
You will have the iPhone to use at no cost to you during the study. The cost of the phone is
$350 for the research project to buy it. If the phone breaks, we will have it fixed or replaced. If
your phone is stolen, we will file a police report and remotely lock and wipe your phone. If your
phone is lost, we will remotely lock and wipe the phone. We may give you a new phone to
finish the study after we talk about keeping the phone safe. If you choose to stop being in the
study, a member of the research team will retrieve your phone.
You will keep the phone when you complete study activities through visit 3 but we will not 
continue to pay for phone service. You can use the phone’s wireless Internet anyplace that you 
have Wi-Fi (for example, many coffee shops, parks, libraries, and schools).
You will receive $10 for completing the Follow-Up Questionnaire.
VI. Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal
Participation in research is voluntary. You do not have to be in this study. If you decide to be in
the study and change your mind, you can stop being in the study at any time. You may skip
questions or stop being in the study at any time. Whatever you decide, you will not lose any
benefits or services that you receive. However, you will have to return the iPhone.
VII. Confidentiality
We will keep your records private as allowed by law. Dr. Baggett and her research team will
have access to the information you provide. Information may also be shared with those who
make sure the study is done correctly (GSU Institutional Review Board, the Office for Human
Research Protection, NIH).  We will use a study number rather than your name on all study
records. A code sheet will be used to identify research participants. The code sheet will be
stored in a password-protected file on a locked computer in a locked office and is destroyed at
the end of the study. All information uploaded on the iPhone app is secured and the Internet
connections are secured. We use the same approach as banks and online stores (e.g.
Amazon.com). Your coach and your coach’s supervisor are the only people who will see the
weekly session videos that you make and send to your coach.  All video recordings are stored on
a secure server accessible only by the project director and assigned staff using a special code.
You can also ask that the video be deleted after it is sent. Five years after the study is finished,
all videos and recordings will be deleted.
Your name and other facts that might identify you will not be used when we present this study 
or publish its results. The findings will be summarized and reported in group form. You will not 
be identified personally. 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, as required by 
U.S. Law. This website will not include information that can identify you. At most, the website 
will include a summary of the results. You can search this website at any time.

2. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Introduction: Georgia State University about a
new research project called Mom & Baby Net.
Y d. 
Thank you for your interest! I would like to tell you a little more about the project and see if you would
be interested in participating and ask you a few questions to see if you are eligible. It will take about 15
20 minutes. You can stop the call at any time or tell me if you do not want to answer any questions. Is
now a good time?
About the project:  quickly share with you about the Mom & Baby 
Net project  
The purpose of this research project is to test two iPhone-based program for moms who have
been feeling down and their babies. We hope to use this information to improve our program in
order to help more moms.
Participants in our study will be given an iPhone to access the program during the course of the
study.  There is no cost to your family for the loan of the iPhone for free data, texting, and phone
calls to use while you are participating in the study.  Upon completion of the program and
assessment visits, participants will be able to keep the iPhone.
Participating in this project will not affect any other services you currently receive.
We have two different programs that provide information to mothers.
Mom & Baby Net Recruitment Script RCT Both of the programs include 14 sessions with one session to be covered each week.  Most
moms spend between 40-60 minutes each week using the iPhone to work on the program and
you can start and stop as needed. It will save your place. Each mom will be assigned an
individual coach who will provide support through a video call each week. The call will involve
watching a video that was created during the session. Each call will last about 20-30 minutes.
Participants will be asked to complete 4 remote assessment calls: 2 assessment calls at the
beginning of the project and 2 assessment calls at the end. Each assessment call will last about
1 hour.  On those calls, we will make a video of you and your baby playing together and looking
at books. We will also complete some online questionnaires that asks questions about you and
your baby.
Once you complete the assessment calls, we will schedule one more call to show you how to use
our app on the iPhone. This call will last about 1 hour. Then you will begin completing sessions
on your own with the support of your coach.
There may be some benefits to mothers who participate in the program.
You may find that answering questions about parenting your baby is helpful and
interesting.
You will have the iPhone with free data, texting, and calls to use during the study.
You will be able to keep the iPhone upon completion of the study. Although we will not
continue to pay for phone service, you can use the phone through wireless Internet if you
have access to it.
You will have the videos on the iPhone that you created during on the program.
You will be helping researchers to learn whether the program you receive is helpful for
mothers of infants.
There are few risks to being in the program.
You may feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions asked today or during the
project. You can stop this call at any time and skip any questions during the project that
you do not want to answer.
All information we collect is stored in a secure, locked office or database that is only
accessible by approved research staff. We will use a study number rather than your
name on all study records. There is only one code sheet use to identify research
participants and it is stored securely in a password-protected file on a locked computer
in a locked office.
If you have any concerns or complaints, you can find IRB contact information at gsu.edu/irb

Stressful Situations 
Sometimes families are experiencing stressful situations in their lives that can make it hard for them to 
be a part of a study such as this, either because the situation makes it burdensome for the family to 
participate in the study and/or because the family may need help that cannot be provided within the 
study.  I am going to read you a list of some situations that families experience that make it a good idea 
for them to NOT participate in this study for the reasons that I just mentioned.  
me which of these situations apply to you if any do. When I finish reading the list,  if any of these 
situations describe you.  
1)You have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

M B N R e m o t e P r o c e d u r e sMom & Baby Net Remote Assessment & Training Procedures 
Schedule Consent Call (10 minutes) [PROJECT COORDINATOR] 
1. Explain changes in procedures (moms on wait list)
a. Hi! This is [name] with the Mom & Baby Net project. Do you have about 10 minutes to
talk? I was calling to let you know that we have a spot open for you in the project but
our procedures will be a little different since we cannot do home visits right now. Are you
are still interested in participating and hearing what the next steps will be?
i.If no:  If mom
is too overwhelmed right now, offer to leave her on the waitlist and check back
again when the next spots are open.
ii. If yes: continue with script
b. Great! If you remember, the usual next step would have been to do the first home visit,
but due to coronavirus, we are not doing home visits. Instead, we will do everything via
phone or video call. We will walk you through each step along the way. After this call,
you will be in touch with your coach, who you will be working with you for the rest of the
program.
2. Explain sending consent and iPhone agreement
a. I will email 
the purpose of the Mom and Baby Net project, what you will be doing in the project, and
how we will keep your information safe. We are taking necessary precautions to keep
you, your family, and our staff healthy during the Coronavirus pandemic. The Pre-
assessment and training visits will be conducted remotely using Zoom  an app that
allows us to have a video call. I will later explain how Zoom works if you choose to
participate.
b. The iPhone agreement form will also be emailed to you. This document covers
expectations of loaning you the iPhone to complete the Mom and Baby Net project. Your
phone service will be covered while you are participating in the program. We will
monitor your progress on a month to month basis. If you are making progress and
staying in communication with your coach, we will renew your service for the next
month. If we lose contact with you, or you are not making progress in the program, your
phone service may be discontinued; If we cannot reach you and your phone is not
returned, it will be reported as lost or stolen.
c. I will also mail a copy of both of these forms to your home. Have you still been receiving
mail and packages as usual during this time?
d.What questions do you have? [answer any questions]
e.The next step is to schedule a call to talk about the Consent and iPhone agreement forms
after you receive them in the mail. You will do this call with your Coach, who will be with
you for the rest of the program. She will go over both of these forms, answer any
questions you have, and explain the next step which will be sending the iPhone and
materials to you. Please think about a time where you will be able to talk for about 15
minutes and she will reach out tomorrow to schedule that call.
M B N R e m o t e P r o c e d u r e s3. Confirm email and mailing address
After Consent Scheduling Call 
Assign participant ID and enter into Access
Notify coach ASAP to reach out to participant to schedule consent call.
Mail & email Consent and iPhone agreement
Note to add in email/envelope: We will review these documents on our next call. After
all your questions are answered, you will sign them, take a picture of each signature
page, and will text them to the project staff member who you speak with on that call.
Day Before Consent Call 
1. Call or text mom to confirm she received the consent & iPhone agreement in the mail
2. Confirm time of call for next day
a. Reschedule if necessary (update Access and Matriculation table)
Consent Call (20 minutes) [ASSIGNED COACH]

copy)
2. Review iPhone agreement the same as you would at a home training visit (mom looking along
on own copy)
3.What other questions do you have about either of these documents or the program?  [answer
questions]
4.Are you still interested in participating?
1.If yes: Great! Please go ahead and sign both pages. As soon as we get off the phone,
take a picture of  and text them to
the number I am calling from ###-###-####.
2. If no: I am sorry to hear that. Can I ask why you changed your mind?
5. Explain drop off or mailing of phone/accessories/manual
1. The next step is to drop off or mail your iPhone, accessories, and materials. We will
sanitize all materials before getting them to you. In the bag you will find two baby
books, your Mom and Baby Net handbook, iPhone, charger, headphones, and a tripod
stand. Inside your Mom and Baby Net handbook in the front pocket of the binder, you
will find a card with information about how to connect on Zoom.
2.If dropping off (if they have experienced issues getting UPS packages, this will be the
best option):  To minimize contact and keep with social distancing, I will call once I have
arrived outside and parked. I will remain on the phone with you, place your bag at the
door, and let you know when to retrieve it. While you are on the phone, we will select a
time for us to have our next call.
3.If mailing:  I will track the package and call or text to confirm it has arrived.
6. Explain Zoom Training & Preassessment calls
M B N R e m o t e P r o c e d u r e s1. After you receive everything, we will have another call. We will connect via Zoom video
chat and you will get an instruction card for that in your materials. Once you are familiar
, on that
call, we will record 2 5-minute videos of you and  playing together and
looking at some books that we will send. We will also begin the surveys, which are split
into 2 parts. We will likely not finish everything on one call, so we will go ahead and
schedule 2 separate calls for the same week.
7. Ask mom some questions to determine the best time and way to complete the pre assessment
remotely
1. Do you have laptop or tablet that is on data and/or wifi?
i. If yes: Great  if you would like, you can use your laptop/tablet to do the surveys.
You can connect to Zoom on the project iPhone.
ii. If no: That is fine  you will be able to use the project iPhone to complete
everything.
2. The videos need to be created away from other people so that the interaction will not be
interrupted by other people in the home; The video will need to be created away from
kitchen, television, or street) . Where do you think the best place will be in your home to
make the video?
3. Ask questions to help mom determine when would be the best time to do the call to
record videos and complete the surveys. Some moms may know exactly when a good
time is while others may need to think through some of these questions to figure it out.
The purpose of these is to prime mothers for a successful video capture call.
i. We want to make sure that we schedule the call at a time when your baby has
been recently fed, is not sleepy and is feeling well AND when your other children
are busy doing something fun that they like to do.
ii. If there are other children in the home: Was there a time yesterday when your
older children were busy doing something that they were having fun with? What
was it?  If it was appropriate, find out the details so you can encourage it for the
call. If it is not appropriate or feasible, then help her think of something that is
(i.e. watching an appropriate movie/show, playing a game). When did they do
that? Where? How long?  If the mother identifies something realistic and doable,
encourage her to do that and have her set the specific reminder on her phone
to get the other kids set up doing that activity 15 minutes BEFORE your
scheduled call.
8. After working through these questions, schedule 2 1-hour sessions on different days, as close
together as schedules allow (e.g., Wednesday & Thursday or Wednesday & Friday) with the
mom to complete the pre assessment procedures. They should be 4-5 days after you drop off
box of materials at UPS.
1. Ask the mother to schedule the appointment times in her phone and show you:
i. 15 min before Call 1: Activity for other children
ii. Time of Part I Call (videos & Part 2 Qs)
iii. 15 min before Call 2: Activity for other children
iv. Time of Part II Call (Part 1 Qs)
M B N R e m o t e P r o c e d u r e s9. Confirm shipping address (for UPS packages) or physical address (if dropping off materials)
10. iPhone Customization Form
1. The last information we need from you is to set up your iPhone before we send it. We
will create an Apple ID for the phone and you will get the password for that once you
finish the program. That means you will not be able to add apps once you get the phone.
We have to control the space on the phone to make sure there is enough space for our
app to run smoothly while you are in the program. I am texting you a link to an online
form where you can choose up to 10 apps to have on the phone. We will add those when
we set it up.
2. Text mom link to iPhone customization form: [link & add to preassessment links page]
11. Wrap up & signature reminder
1. Do you have any final questions? [answer questions]. We are excited to have you in the
program and thank you for your patience. Remember to sign the consent form and
iPhone agreement and send me a photo of every page as soon as we get off the phone
and complete the iPhone customization form using the link. Once we have that, we will
get the phone and materials ready to send to you.

and they will be able to do everything through the project iPhone
b. Ask questions to help mom determine when would be the best time to do the call. Some

some of these questions to figure it out. The purpose of these is to prime mothers for a
successful video capture call.
i. If possible, we want to schedule the call at a time when your baby is napping or
resting or can be with another adult so you can focus on the call and follow
along in the app.
ii. If you know there are other children in the home: How did the activity for your
older children work during these pre assessment calls?  What was it?  If it was
appropriate, find out the details so you can encourage it again for the next call.
If it is not appropriate or feasible, then help her think of something that is (i.e.
watching an appropriate movie/show, playing a game). When did they do that?
Where? How long?  If the mother identifies something realistic and doable,
encourage her to do that and have her set the specific reminder on her phone
to get the other kids set up doing that activity 15 minutes BEFORE your
scheduled call.

Schedule Post Assessment 
1. Coach will schedule post-assessment with mom during session 14 (or last) Coach Call as usual
a. Typically, we would do the last visit in the home, but due to the coronavirus we will
complete post assessments using Zoom as we did for our coach calls. Just as we did at
the pre-ass
you and your baby. To get ready for our Post-
information from you.
2. Ask mom some questions to determine the best time and way to complete the post assessment
remotely
a. Do you have laptop or tablet that is on data and/or wifi?
b.Do you have headphones to use with your phone ? (if no, mail new ones)
c.Do you have the books we gave you at pre-assessment  (pink and yellow Colors &
Animals books)?
i. If yes, have them show them to you.
ii. If no: Can you show me some books you use at home with your child?  (if they
have board books or soft books 
appropriate books, we can mail some if mom is still able to receive UPS
packages). Confirm mailing address and send to Katy to mail books.
d. The videos need to be created away from other people so that the interaction will not be
interrupted by other people in the home; The video will need to be created away from
kitchen, television, or street) . Where do you think the best place will be in your home to
make the video?
M B N R e m o t e P r o c e d u r e se. Ask questions to help mom determine when would be the best time to do the call to
record videos and complete the surveys. Some moms may know exactly when a good
time is while others may need to think through some of these questions to figure it out.
The purpose of these is to prime mothers for a successful video capture call.
i. We want to make sure that we schedule the call at a time when your baby has
been recently fed, is not sleepy and is feeling well AND when your other children
are busy doing something fun that they like to do.
ii. If you know there are other children in the home: Was there a time yesterday
when your older children were busy doing something that they were having fun
with? What was it? If it was appropriate, find out the details so you can
encourage it for the call. If it is not appropriate or feasible, then help her think
of something that is (i.e. watching an appropriate movie/show, playing a game).
When did they do that? Where? How long?  If the mother identifies something
realistic and doable, encourage her to do that and have her set the specific
reminder on her phone to get the other kids set up doing that activity 15
minutes BEFORE your scheduled call.
3. After working through these questions, schedule 2 1-hour sessions on back to back days (e.g.,
Wednesday & Thursday) with the mom to complete the post assessment procedures.
a. Ask the mother to schedule the appointment times in her phone and show you:
i. 15 min before Call 1: Activity for other children
ii. Time of Part I Call (video & Part 2 Qs)
iii. 15 min before Call 2: Activity for other children

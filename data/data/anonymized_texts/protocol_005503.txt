detected during each examination visit to obtain information about any 
medical occurrence that meets the definition of an AE.
 
Any subject with a treatment related AE that is ongoing at the time of study 
completion will be followed until that AE is resolved or stabilized.  Any AE 
assessed as related to the study product  with onset after 
subject partic ipation in the study is over, and that the Investigator becomes aware 
of should be reported to the Sponsor.

Page 21of 37It is the responsibility of the Investigator to determine severity of the AE and relatedness of the event to 
the study product and/or injection procedures. Adverse Events must be repor ted as outlined below in 
section 7.2.4.
 
7.2 Adverse events
7.2.1 Definition of an adverse event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other personsI, whether or not related to 
the study product.
This definition includes:
events related to the investigational product or the reference product
events related to the procedures involved
7.2.2 Definition of a serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that:
led to death,
led to serious deterioration in the health of the su bject, that either resulted in
a life -threateningIIillness or injury, or
a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, or
in-patient or prolonged hospitalizationIII, or
medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function,
led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect
An AE does not need to be recorded as a SAE if it only represents a relapse or an expected change or 
progression of the condition that was the cause of the treatment, without the development of new 
symptoms and signs.
In cases of doubt, whether an AE fulfils a serious criterion or not, there should bea predisposition to 
report as a SAE rather than not report as such (see Section 7.2.5 ).
IFor users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the investigational product.
IIThe term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk ofdeath atthetime
oftheevent; itdoes notrefer toanevent which hypothetic allymight have caused death if itwere more severe. (Source: ICH -
E2A clinical safety data management: definitions and standards forexpedited reporting).
IIIPlanned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the CIP, without serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a SAE. (Source: ISO14155:2011).
7.2.3 Recording instructions
Each subject with an AE occurring after enrollment through study exit should be fully recorded in the 
source document(s) for further transcription to the eCRF.  Each subject should be questioned about AEs 
at each study visit following study entry. The question asked should be: “Since your last clinical visit 
have you had any health problems?” Information on AEs can also be obtained from signs and sympt oms

Page 22of 37detected during each examination, observations made by the study site personnel, or spontaneous reports 
from the subjects or their relatives.
Exceptions from AE reporting are normal fluctuations in pre -existing diseases. However, pre-existing 
illnesses that deteriorates (in intensity or frequency) shall be reported as AEs.
7.2.3.1 Intensity
Intensity will be recorded for each reported AE. The following definitions of intensity are to be used:
Mild: Awareness of symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated (acceptable )
Moderate: Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity (disturbing)
Severe: Incapacity to work or to do usual activity (unacceptable)
If the intensity changes within one day, the maximum intensity of the AE during that day shall be
recorded.
7.2.3.2 Causal relationship and seriousness
 
 
 
 
7.2.4 Reporting of adverse events
Adverse event reporting on each subject shall start upon enrollment (singing of the informed consent) in 
the study. 
The reporting shall continue during each follow -up visit (including any telephone contacts and extra 
visits between planned visits) until the last scheduled visit in the study.
All AEs, non -serious as well as serious, are to be reported as an AE in the eCRF.
7.2.5 Reporting of serious adverse events
The Investigator shall report any SAE to the Contract Research Organization ( CRO )immediately but 
not later than 24 hours of awareness of the event .  This initial report can be made via e-mail or submitted 
via the eCRF.
In case of difficulty to obtain all the required information within 24 hours, an initial report can be 
submitted, with the following information as a minimum, irrespective of whether some of it is regarded 
aspreliminary:

Follow -up information and data missing in the initial SAE reporting shall be gathered as soon as 
possible and reported to the CRO immed iately but not later than 24 hours of awareness of the new data. 
Complete and adequate information on each SAE is required. All attempts to obtain this information, 
including dates for follow -up activities, must be documented by the Investigator or designa ted study
staff.

Page 29of 379Data Handling and Management
9.1 Data management
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities def ined to achieve safe routines to enter clinical 
data information into a database, efficiently and avoiding errors. The data management routine includes 
procedures for handling eCRFs database set -upand management, data entry and verification, data 
validati on, and documentation of the performed activities including information of discrepancies in the 
process. The data management process will be described in detail in the data management plan (DMP).
The database, the data entry screens and program will be des igned in accordance with the CIP and the 
eCRF. Data validation will be performed by computerized logical checks and manual review. Drugs and 
events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) Drug and medical 
dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) dictionaries asspecified in the DMP. SAEs in the clinical 
database will be reconciled against the data in the safety database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in the 
database is as correct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study data will be 
transferred to SAS datasets, which thereafter will be write- protected. Statistical analyses will be 
generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.
9.2 Electro nic case report forms
An electronic data capture application, compliant with regulatory requirements for software validation 
US FDA 21CFR11 will be used to collect, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit study data. 
An eCRF is required and shall be completed electronically for each subject and all visits.
The eCRF includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to 
identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Study data shall be enter ed directly 
from the source documents, which are to be defined at each site before inclusion of the first subject.
Authorized study site personnel designated by the PI shall complete data collection. Appropriate training 
and security measures has been comp leted with all authorized investigation site personnel prior to the 
pivotal study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any subject. Appropriate 
training and security measures with any potential new investigation site personnel wil l be completed 
prior to their involvement in the study.
The study data is the sole property of the Sponsor and shall not be made available in any form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of appropriate RA, without written permission fro m the 
Sponsor. At the end of the study, electronic data are kept at the Sponsor and a copy (provided by the 
vendor) at the study site as part of the Investigator file.
Any delegation of collection of data shall be specified and recorded.
9.2.1 Data entry
All dat a shall be entered in English. The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations on the 
subjects participating in the study. Therefore, every effort should be made to complete the eCRFs within 
a reasonable time frame after the subject’s visit. The subject’s identity must always remain confidential, 
i.e. the name and address of the subjects must not be registered in the eCRFs or in the database. The 
Investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some assessment s 
are not done, or if certain information is not available, not applicable or unknown, the Investigator shall 
indicate this in the eCRF. The Investigator shall electronically sign off the study data. By signing, the 
Investigator takes responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and legibility of the data reported to the 
Sponsor in the eCRF.
9.2.2 The query process
The monitor shall review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency. Each eCRF 
shall be compared with the respective source docu ments to ensure that there are no discrepancies 
between critical data. All entries, corrections, and alterations shall be made by the PI or his/her

Page 30of 37authorized designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once study data have been submitted 
to the central server via the eCRF, corrections to the data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the 
reason for change, the name of the person who made the change, together with time and date will be 
logged. Roles and rights of the site personnel responsibl e for entering study data into the eCRF shall be 
determined in advance. If discrepant data is detected during review of the data, either by the Sponsor or 
byits representatives, the responsible data manager or monitor shall raise a query in the electronic data 
capture application. The query shall state the question or data to be changed and shall be resolved in the 
system by the PI or his/her authorized designee. The appropriate study site personnel shall answer the 
queries in the eCRF within a reasonable timeframe Answered queries will be audit trailed by the 
electronic data capture application meaning that the name of study site personnel, time, and date is 
logged. Answered queries will then be closed by the appropriate study personnel (i.e. data manager, site 
monitor, etc.)
9.2.3 User identification
eCRF records will be automatically appended with the identification of the creator, by means of their 
unique User ID. Specified records shall be electronically signed by the Investigator to document his/her 
review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are accurate. This will be facilitated by means of 
the Investigator’s unique User ID and password; date and time stamps will be added automatically at 
time of electronic signature. If an entry in an eCRF requir es change, the correction shall be made in 
accordance with the relevant software procedures.
9.2.4 Audit trail
All changes will be fully recorded in a protected audit trail and a reason for the change shall be stated. 
Once all data have been entered, verified, and validated, the database will be locked.
9.3 Source documents
Source documents are all documents used by the Investigator or hospital that relate to the subject’s 
medical history, that verifies the existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and all 
records covering the subject’s participation in the study. They include laboratory notes, memoranda, 
material dispensing records, subject files, etc.
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These shall be made av ailable for 
inspection by the monitor at each monitoring visit. The Investigator must submit a completed eCRF for 
each subject for whom signed informed consent has been collected.
All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, shall be 
clearly identified with the CTN and subject number. Any personal information, including name, shall be 
removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality.
9.4 Record keeping and access to source data
The In vestigator/Institution shall permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and RA 
inspections and shall provide direct access to the source data/medical record including the identity of all 
participating subjects (sufficient information to link re cords, i.e. eCRF, medical records, original signed 
informed consent forms and detailed records of study product accountability). The records shall be 
retained by the Investigator as required by local legislation and international guidelines. Any transfer o f 
responsibility for storage of the records shall be documented and the Sponsor shall be informed in
writing.
The Sponsor shall verify that each subject has consented in writing to direct access to the original 
medical record/source data (by the use of wri tten subject information and signed informed consent). The 
data recorded in the eCRFs will be checked for consistency with the source documents/medical record 
by the monitor during monitoring (source data verification; SDV). In order to be able to perform SDV, 
information about each subject’s participation in the study has to be detailed in the medical record.

Page 31of 379.5 Document and data retention
All records pertaining to the conduct of the study, including signed eCRFs, informed consent forms, 
study product account ability records, source documents, and other study documentation must be retained 
for as long as is specified in the CTA. Measures shall be taken to prevent accidental or premature 
destruction of these documents (e.g. protection against damage and unauthorized access, preferably by 
storage in a fire- proof cabinet).
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to inform the Sponsor in writing if the Investigator file is moved or 
if the responsibility for the documents is transferred to someone else.

11 Protection of personal data
All processing of personal data must be carried out in accordance with national legislation concerning 
the protection of personal data. The Institution and the Inve stigator are responsible for complying with 
all requirements pursuant to national legislation in which the Institution and the Investigator are located. 
The Sponsor will ensure that all requirements for data processing are fulfilled.
The Investigator under stands that clinical studies  conducted  under an  IDE  areexempt from the  study 
subject identifier confidentiality provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA), and the study subject should be made aware of this exception in the informed consent. 
The Institution and Investigator arejointly responsible for providing sufficient information to all 
subjects to enable them to give their informed consent not only to the participation in the investigation, 
but also to theprocessing of Personal Data. Such information includes information regarding the 
purposes of the processing, the length of time during which Personal Data will be stored, the right of
access to stored Personal Data and the right to correction or purgin g of incorrect or obsolete Personal 
Data. A subject may also withdraw his or her consent at any time.
A subject who withdraws his  or  her  consent  to  the  processing  of  Personal  Data must be considered 
to have withdrawn from the investigation but the data collected until the consent was withdrawn may be 
used in the statistical analyses.
Authorized representatives from the Sponsor or a RA may visit the investigational site to perform 
audits/inspections, including source data verification, i.e., compari ng data in the subjects’ medical 
records and the eCRF. Data and information will be handled with strict confidentiality.
The study shall include collection and processing of personal data as specified in the Regulation (EU) 
2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) on the protection of individuals with regard to 
the processing of personal data. For the purposes of the study, Sponsor will be considered the data 
controller, and Institution and PI will both be considered data processors.
12Quality Cont rol and Quality Assurance
12.1 Quality control
On-site monitoring of the study will be arranged by the Sponsor according to GCP guidelines to verify 
that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protected, the reported data are accurate, complete, 
verifiable from source documents, and that the conduct of the study complies with the approved CIP, 
subsequent amendment(s), GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements.
Any CIP deviation shall be documented appropriately, verified, discussed, and colle cted by the monitor 
and appropriate actions will be taken. The PI is responsible for promptly reporting any deviations from 
the CIP that affects the rights, safety or well -being of the subject or the scientific integrity of the study, 
including those that occur under emergency circumstances, to the Sponsor as well as the IRB if required 
by national regulations. Deviations will be reviewed to determine the need to amend the CIP.
12.2 Quality assurance
The study site may be subject to quality assurance (QA) audit by the Sponsor as well as inspection by 
appropriate RA. It  is important that the Investigator and other relevant study site personnel are available 
during the monitoring visits, possible audits, and inspections, and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
monitoring process.
Each participating member of the study site team shall provide a curriculum vitae (CV) or equivalent 
that demonstrates their qualifications to conduct the study.
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all personnel involved in the study are fully 
informed of all relevant aspects of the study, including detailed knowledge of and training in all

their function in th e study on the signature and delegation log.
12.3 Changes to the C linical I nvestigational Plan
The PI and other site personnel involved in the study must not implement any changes to the CIP 
without agreement with the Sponsor and prior review and documented approval from the IRB and RA, 
if applicable, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects. All changes to 
the final CIP must be documented in a dated and version -controlled written CIPamendment. However, 
administrative changes may be documented in the Sponsor file without requiring a CIPamendment. The 
Sponsor will asse ss if the changes require prior FDA approval, and inform the Investigator when such 
approval has been received.
13Financing, Indemnification, and Insurance
The CTA outlines the compensation and payment terms of the study. The CTA must be signed before 
the fi rst subject is screened in the study. If there are differences between the CTA and the CIP regarding 
certain rights and obligations, the CTA is the prevailing document . The Sponsor’s obligations in this 
clinical study are covered by Galderma’s global gener al liability program. An insurance certificate will 
be provided upon request. The Institution/Investigator is obligated to maintain insurance coverage for 
their obligations in the clinical study according to the CTA.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15Suspension or Premature Termination
The Sponsor will suspend or terminate the study when so instructed by the IRB or RA, or if it is judged 
that the subjects are subjected to unreasonable risks, or for valid scientific or administrativ e reasons, or 
for business reasons. 
The Sponsor may also decide to close a single study site due to unsatisfactory subject enrolment or non -
compliance with the CIP, GCP, or applicable regulatory requirements. 
In the event of premature termination, Q -Med AB will provide information on the handling of currently 
enrolled subjects who have not completed the study.

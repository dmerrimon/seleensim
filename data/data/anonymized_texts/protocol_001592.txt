Study Objectives Primary Objective: 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of VIS649 in healthy su bjects 
Secondary Objectives: 
 To characterize the PK  profile of VIS649 
 To evaluate the effect of ethni city on the pharmacokinetic (PK)  
profile of a single intravenously (IV) administered dose of VIS 649 
in healthy Japanese and n on-Japanese subjects 
 To characterize the levels  of anti-drug antibodies 
 To characterize the effect of VI S649 on pharmacodynamic (PD) 
parameters including: 
o changes in serum total IgA, IgG and IgM concentrations 
and time to recovery  
o changes in circulating lymphocyte populations in cohorts 1-4 (this assessment will be done for all lymphocytes, and also for lymphocyte subsets that are noted to show changes 
from baseline). 
o assess ADA status impact on VIS649 PK parameters 
 
  
  
  
  
Study Design This is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled,  double-blind, single 
ascending dose study of IV VIS649 in healthy subjects. 
Potential subjects will be carefully screened for eligibility p rior to study 
enrollment. Randomization and blinding will occur according to a core 
randomization list administered b y the site’s unblinded pharmac ist. 
The stud y will enroll up to 51 sub jects and will be conducted in five

VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 10 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 sequential dosing cohorts. Cohorts 1-4 will have four different  dose levels 
(0.5, 2.0, 6.0 and 12 mg/kg respectively), enrolling 9 subjects  per cohort. 
Cohort 5 will be on 6.0 mg/kg only and will enroll up to 15 sub jects. 
Subjects will be randomized to VI S649 or placebo in a ratio of 7:2 (7 active, 
2 placebo), except for cohort 5, which will be a ratio of 10:5.  Back-up 
subjects who are not randomized into the cohort, but otherwise meet 
eligibility, may be re-screened after discussion among the Principal 
Investigator, Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. 
Eligible subjects will report to the Clinical Pharmacology Unit  ( C P U )  a t  
study check-in (Day -1) and will be required to stay in the CPU  until Day 2 
(24 hours post infusion). On Day 1, a single dose of VIS649 or placebo will 
be administered IV in the morning after a light meal (as per th e clinical unit 
standard). Pharmacokinetics sampling will occur on Day 1 starti ng with a 
collection prior to the start of infusion, at the end of infusi on (60 minutes), 
and at 2 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours post end of infusion. All subjects will 
have PK samples drawn on Days 1-3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 1 12. 
Pharmacodynamics sampling (serum immunoglobulin levels) will oc cur at 
baseline, Day 3 and weekly thereafter through the Week 8 visit,  then once 
every two weeks through Week 16 (i.e., Weeks 10, 12, 14, and 16 ). 
Sentinel subjects will be utilized in cohorts 1-4; the first tw o subjects in each 
cohort will be randomized to recei ve either VIS649 (n=1) or pla cebo (n=1) 
and will receive study drug at l east 24 hours before the remain ing subjects in 
the cohort (7 subjects) are dosed. These 2 subjects shall remai n confined to 
the study center for 24 hours after study drug administration. The safety profile of these subj ects over the 24-hour post-admi nistration 
period will be reviewed to determine whether it is appropriate to proceed 
with enrollment of the remaining subjects in the cohort as plan ned. This will 
occur for each dose escalation. T he remaining 7 subjects in coh orts 1-4 will 
be randomized to receive VIS649 (n=6) or matched placebo (n=1).  Cohort 5 
does not require sentinel subjects as the dose of VIS649 has al ready been 
evaluated in cohort 3. 
The maximum duration of participation (Screening through End-of -study) 
for individual subjects will be approximately 20 weeks (5 months) with the 
possibility to extend up to 28 weeks (7 months). Each subject w ill participate 
in a Screening period lasting 1 to 28 days (0 to 4 weeks), an i n-house stay for 
2 to 3 days, and a post-administration period of 16 weeks. The scheduled 
final visit will occur 16 weeks post-dosing (112 days); however , two 
additional follow-up visits may be performed, at Weeks 20 and 
24 post-dosing, if serum immunoglobulins have not returned to>l ower limits 
of normal by the Week 16 visit or if emerging trial data sugges t a value of 
later follow-up (i.e., for detection of anti-drug antibody resp onses). 
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) A single dose of VIS649 administered IV over approximately one hour, at 
four different dose levels: 0.5, 2.0, 6.0 and 12 mg/kg respecti vely, with a 
fifth cohort, to receive a 6.0 mg/ kg single dose of VIS649 admi nistered 
intravenously on Day 1 in one arm and a single intramuscular in jection of 
TENIVAC® vaccine o n Day 28 into th e opposite arm. 
Number of Subjects Up to 51 subjects may be enrolled. A total o f 16 Japanese subjects 
(4 subjects each in cohorts 1-4) and 20 non-Japanese subjects (up to 
5 subjects each in cohorts 1-4) may be enrolled and randomized to receive a 
single dose of VIS649 or placebo.  No more than one Japanese sub ject per 
cohort may be randomized to recei ve placebo in cohorts 1-4. Up to 15 
subjects are expected to be enr olled in cohort 5 with targeted but 
non-mandatory enrollment of up to 5 Japanese subjects. No more than two 
Japanese subjects may be randomized to receive placebo in cohor t 5.

0) extrapolated to infinite time  
 
 AUC  0-112d: Area under the concentration-tim e curve from pre-dose (time 
0) to the concentration on Day 112 
 AUC 0-last: Area under the concentration- time curve from pre-dose (time 
0) to the last quantifiable concentration 
 t1/2: Apparent terminal elimination half-life 
 Vd: Apparent volume of distribution  
 CL: Apparent clearance

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background 
VIS649 is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG 2) monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks 
the biological actions of the B-cell growth factor, APRIL (A Pr oliferation Inducing Ligand), 
preventing binding to its receptors, transmembrane activator an d CAML interactor (TACI) and 
B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). Through these receptor intera ctions, APRIL regulates B-cell 
mediated immune responses through several mechanisms, including  the induction of class switch 
recombination as well as promotion of plasma cell survival.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VIS649 binds human APRIL with picomolar affinity/avidity as measured by antigen-binding 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant trimeric AP RIL. VIS649 blocks 
recombinant APRIL-APRIL receptor interactions, thereby inhibiti ng APRIL-mediated signaling 
and B-cell proliferation. VIS649 also binds cynomolgus monkey A PRIL, with similar affinity 
and inhibition of APRIL mediated signaling in both species. The physiological and toxicological effects of VIS649 were therefore evaluated in cynomolgus monkey s, in three preclinical studies. 
In an initial non- Good Labor atory Practice (non-GLP) in-vivo  toxicology study, weekly 
administration of IV VIS649 at a dose of 25 mg/kg for 8 weeks resulted in an approximately 70% reduction in serum IgA levels (in comparison with control a nimals) with minimal effect on 
serum IgM, and an approximately 40% reduction in serum IgG leve ls. Hematology assessment 
did not reveal significant pertu rbation in white blood cell (WB C), lymphocyte, or leukocyte 
counts and there were no signifi cant differences between treatm ent groups noted in the 
peripheral blood and tissue immune profiling, which included markers for total T cells, helper T

 cells, cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells. In  a subsequent, non-GLP dose range-
finding study, VIS649 was administ ered weekly over 4 weeks to g roups of cynomolgus monkeys 
at doses of 0 (control), 0.5, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg, with an 8-week recovery observation period. 
Following treatment with 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg doses, there was a  
reduction from baseline in serum IgA levels. Monkeys treated wi th 10 mg/kg doses had an 
 reduction in serum IgA levels, similar to the  e f f e c t  o b s e r v e d  i n  t h e  p r i o r  
study with 25 mg/kg dosing for 8 weeks, and thus providing evid ence that APRIL inhibition does 
not completely suppress IgA pr oduction. Serum IgA level suppres sion was reversible, with a 
dose response in time to recovery during the 8-week follow-up p eriod. The observation of a 
maximal suppressive effect of VIS649 on serum IgA levels  
 in monkeys was further supported in the third toxicolog y study, described below. There 
was a lesser effect of VIS649 on serum IgG levels , and IgM levels were not 
altered notably, in comparison wi th control animals. Peripheral  blood lymphocyte counts were 
not significantly affected, incl uding the following cell popula tions: T-lymphocytes (including 
T-helper and cytotoxic T-cell subsets), natural killer cells, m onocytes, and B-lymphocytes 
(including naïve, resting memory and activated memory B-lymphoc yte subsets). 
These studies led to the conduct of a United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) 
GLP-compliant 4-week repeat-dos e IV toxicology study of VIS649 in cynomolgus monkeys, 
with a 20-week recovery peri od. Monkeys received weekly VIS649 in jectio n s f o r 4  w eek s,  at 
doses of 0 mg/kg (control), 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg. 
VIS649-related reductions in total serum IgA levels were observ ed in all VIS649-treated animals 
 and the reductions were reversible as trends towards return to baseline were 
observed at all doses. All 3 dose levels demonstrated maximal pharmacologic effect that were 
consistent with previous studies in reduction in serum IgA and IgG levels with a minimal effect 
on IgM levels in VIS649 treated a nimals in comparison to the co ntrols. 
Serum IgG levels were moderately reduced,  
, for a majority of animals at all timepoints. Se rum IgM concentrations did not 
differ significantly between groups, including control animals.  
There was no effect of VIS649 on measured plasma cytokine conce ntrations in the monkey 
toxicology studies (nor did VIS649 stimulate significant cytoki ne release in an in vitro  human 
peripheral blood lymphocyte c ytokine release assay). 
To test the effect of VIS649 on de-novo humoral immune responses to a novel (T-cell dependent) antigen challenge, monkeys were vaccinated with keyh ole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)

VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 23 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 at Day 7 during dosing, with measurement of KLH-specific IgG an d IgM levels through 21 days 
post immunization. The kinetics of IgM and IgG responses were similar between VIS649 treated 
and control animals, with moderate suppression of KLH-specific IgG levels which was 
consistent with the non-specific suppression seen in total IgG levels. 
Based on results from this piv otal toxicology study, the no-obs erved-adverse-effect level 
(NOAEL) was considered to be 100 mg/kg/dose  
 
. The 
100 mg/kg dose is 5-fold greater than the 
highest dose (20 mg/kg) permitted in this first-in-human study and 200-fold greater than the 
lowest dose (0.5 mg/kg) to be admin istered in this first-in-hum an (FIH) study. 
 
 
  
 
 
The relatively selective and reversible effect of VIS649 on serum immunoglobulin levels 
 with maximal (but not completely  suppressive) effect on IgA 
suggests that APRIL inhibition ma y be uniquely suited as a ther apeutic strategy for IgA 
nephropathy.

 In this study, TENIVAC® will be used as a vaccine challenge to evaluate the effect of VIS649 
on recipients’ ability to generate an effective response to ant igen exposure, as measured by 
anti-tetanus toxoid and anti-dipht heria toxoid IgG and IgM resp onses.  
1.2. Rationale for the Clinical Study 
This FIH study will assess the safety and tolerability, pharmac okinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics 
(PD) of VIS649, a humanized IgG 2 mAb that binds to and blocks the biological actions of the 
B-cell growth factor, APRIL. 
The study is being conducted to e stablish a dose range that is well tolerated by the majority of 
study subjects and to provide exploratory data on the potential  f o r  t h e  t r e a t m e n t  o f  I g A N ,  a n  
autoimmune glomerulonephritis characterized by the deposition o f IgA-containing immune 
complexes in the kidney. The results of the clinical study will  inform the design and dose 
selection of subsequent studies. 
1.3. Risk-benefit Assessment 
While VIS649 has not been evaluated in humans, the known effects of mAbs in humans suggest 
the following potential toxicitie s for single dose administrati on: 
1. Infusion reactions: Anaphylaxis, fever, chills, rigors, nausea,  vomiting, pain, headache, 
dizziness, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, hypotension, hype rtension, pruritus, rash, 
urticaria, angioedema, diarrhea , tachycardia, and chest pain 
2. Delayed allergic reactions: Serum sickness (i.e., urticaria, fe ver, general glandular 
enlargement, joint pains) 
3. General: Injection site reaction 
Mechanism based potential toxicities that might be anticipated based on VIS649 mechanism of 
action and preclinical  studies include: 
IgA suppression risks: VIS649 treatment is expected to reduce human IgA levels, with  a  
predicted maximal reduction (with repeated dosing) to approxima t e l y  7 5 %  b e l o w  b a s e l i n e .  I n  
this single-ascending dose study, this degree of suppression is  unlikely to be achieved, but it is 
anticipated that at least in the  higher dose cohorts, IgA level s will be reduced below baseline, 
with effect persis ting over weeks.

 The normal range for serum IgA is approximately 70 to 400 mg/dL  in adults  
 
 
Selective IgA deficiency (defined as persistently undetectable IgA,  is 
the most common inherited immunodeficiency syndrome (occurring in about 1 in 500 Caucasian 
individuals). []. While this condition has heretofore been cons idered generally benign and is 
asymptomatic in the majority of patients, there is increasing r ecognition that selective IgA 
deficiency may be associated w ith recurrent sinopulmonary infec tion, allergy, autoimmunity and 
gastrointestinal microbiome perturbation [ 4, 5]. The risk for occurrence of these complications in 
the current study is low for multiple reasons: 1) IgA is expect ed to be suppressed, but not 
reduced to undetectable level s, 2) in this single dose-study, the effects on IgA levels are expected 
to be transient, and 3) the syndrome of selective IgA deficienc y is often associated with 
additional immunologic impairments including T-cell disorders a nd common variable 
immunodeficiency syndrome. 
IgG suppression risks:  VIS649 is expected to have a moderate effect on serum IgG leve ls (with 
approximately 40% suppression-below-baseline nadir values predi cted). 
The normal range for serum IgG i s approximately 600 to 1600 mg/ dL in adults,  
 
 
In common variable immunodeficien cy (CVID), also known as acqui red 
hypogammaglobulinemia, total IgG levels are typically below 250  mg/dL with median values at 
diagnosis in two recent US cohort studies of 210 mg/dL and 120 mg/dL, respectively [ 6]. The 
condition is of heterogenous ori gin, with loss of function mutations in an APRIL receptor, TACI, 
identified as one causal association [ 7]. Proposed diagnostic criteria for CVID include: presence 
of hypogammaglobulinemia  plus a history of recurrent or 
chronic infection or autoimmunity and with associated IgA defic iency  or IgM 
deficiency [8]. Common variable immunodeficiency  is associated with recurrent 
otitis media, chronic sinusitis,  and recurrent pneumonia often resulting in bronchiectasis [ 9]. 
Longitudinal studies have demonstr ated high rates of lymphoma a nd diseases of autoimmunity 
[10]. The risk of these complications in the current study is cons idered quite low, given the 
moderate and transient reductions  in IgG levels that are antici pated. 
Non-specific immunosuppression risks: In preclinical toxicology studies, de-novo humoral 
immune responses to a novel antig en were not suppressed, and pe ripheral blood myeloid cell line

VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 26 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 populations were unaffected. Howeve r, there is the possibility of non-specific immunodeficiency 
with potential risk of exacerbation of pre-existing latent infe ction or poor response to new 
infection. These risks are consid ered minimal due to the single -dose design of this trial, and the 
expected transient nature of effects. 
Pharmacodynamic data including measurement of changes in serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels in 
relation to VIS649 exposure will provide valuable information f or refinement of the human 
PK/PD model and selection of appropriate doses for a repeat-dos e study. Predicted maximal 
effects on serum IgG, IgA and IgM levels versus normal range, i nclusion criteria thresholds, and 
stopping rule IG thresholds are summarized in Table 1 .

 3. OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY 
3.1. Overview 
This is a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind , single ascending dose study to 
investigate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD of the IV administr ation of VIS649 in healthy subjects. 
The study will be conducted in five sequential dosing cohorts. Cohorts 1-4 will enroll 9 subjects 
per cohort. Cohorts 1-4 will enroll 4 Japanese subjects and wil l be randomized to VIS649 or 
placebo in a ratio of 7:2 (7 active, 2 placebo). No more than o ne Japanese subject per cohort may 
be randomized to receive placebo. The fifth cohort will enroll up to 15 subjects with targeted but 
non-mandatory enrollment of up to 5 Japanese subjects. The subj ects in cohort 5 will be 
randomized to VIS649 or placebo in a ratio of 10:5 (10 active, 5 placebo). No more than two 
Japanese subjects may be random ized to receive placebo in cohor t 5. 
The study is comprised of: 
 A Screening Visit up to 28 days before dosing 
 An in-house stay for approximately 2-3 days, with admission to the study center on 
Day -1, dosing on Day 1, and discharge in the morning of Day 2 
 A post-administration period of 16 weeks 
 Outpatient visits, on Day 3 (+1 day), 7 (± 1 day), 14, 21, 28, 31 (± 1 day) (cohort 5 only), 
35, 42, 49 (cohorts 1-4 only), 56, 70, 84 and 98 (for all visit s not otherwise specified, ± 3 
days) 
 A final Follow-up visit on Day 112 (± 3 days); Two additional f ollow-up visits may 
occur, at Weeks 20 and 24 post-dosing, if serum immunoglobulins  have not returned to 
>lower limits of normal by the W eek 16 (Day 112) visit, or if e merging trial data suggest 
a value of later follow-up (i. e., for detection of ADA response s). 
The total duration of the clini cal study per subject will be up  to approximately 20 weeks 
(5 months), including the Screen ing period with the possibility  of duration exte nding to 28 weeks 
(7 months) if follow-ups visits are required. 
Potential subjects will be carefully screened for eligibility p rior to study enrollment. 
Randomization and blinding will occur according to a core rando mization list administered by 
the site’s unblinded pharmacist. Back-up subjects who are not r andomized into the cohort, but 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 30 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 otherwise meet eligibility, may be re-screened after discussion  among the Principal Investigator, 
Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. 
Eligible subjects will report to the Clinical Pharmacology Unit  (CPU) at study check-in (Day -1) 
and will be required to stay in the CPU until Day 2 (24 hours p ost infusion). On Day 1, a single 
dose of VIS649 or placebo will be administered intravenously in  the morning after a light meal 
(as per the clinical unit standard). Pharmacokinetics sampling will occur on Day 1 starting with a 
collection prior to the start of infusion, end of infusion, and  at 2 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours post 
end of infusion. Pharmacokinetics samples will be collected on Days 1-3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 
and 112. Pharmacodynamics sampling (serum immunoglobulin levels, lymphocytes and sub Ig 
types) will occur as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (s ee Table  10). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
The initial cohort will be dosed with 0.5 mg/kg of VIS649. Escalation to next dosing level (2.0 mg/kg) will occur after review of blinded safety data thro ugh Day 14 by the Safety 
Monitoring Committee (SMC) comprised of the Principal Investigator, an independent Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. Cohort 3 was reviewed after Day 56 da ta was collected to commence 
enrollment in cohort 4. Assessment of safety will be determined  by evaluation of: 
 Vital sign measurements 
 Physical examinations 
 Hematology, chemistry, and urinal ysis laboratory testing 
 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) 
 Adverse events, and 
 Serum immunoglobulin levels

VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 31 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 Pharmacokinetic data will not be available for dose escalation decision making. Pharmacokinetic 
data will be reviewed in a blinded fashion after each cohort is  available, and may result in a dose 
adjustment for subsequent cohorts. Any adjustments will be revi ewed and approved by the 
Principal Investigator, Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. 
If dose escalation is stopped bas ed on available blinded safety  data, the current dose level will be 
considered as the minimum intolerable dose (MID). The dose just below the MID will be 
regarded as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If the dose escal ation is stopped due to reaching 
exposure limit without dose lim iting safety findings, the MTD w ill not be determined. Dose 
de-escalation may occur in additi onal cohorts, to further refin e clinically relevant dose levels. 
Stopping rules are described in Section 3.4 . 
Procedures related to the clini cal study are detailed in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table  
10). 
Doses will be administered intravenously to subjects in approximately 5 dose cohorts (see Table  
2). Cohorts are planned as follows: 
Table 2 Cohorts and Dose Administration 
Cohorts Number of Subjects Treatment 
Cohort 1 N=7 VIS649 0.5 mg/kg1

1 After all subjects have completed  assessments through Day 14, blinded safety data will be reviewed and a dose 
escalation decision for the subsequent cohort will be made by t he SMC. If dose escalation is stopped, dose 
de-escalation may occur in additional cohorts, to further refin e clinically relevant dose levels. 
2 After all subjects have completed  assessments through Day 28, blinded safety data will be reviewed and a dose 
escalation decision for the subsequent cohort will be made by t he SMC. If dose escalation is stopped, dose 
de-escalation may occur in additional cohorts, to further refin e clinically relevant dose levels.

3.3. Justification of the Study Design 
This 
study evaluates the safety,  tolerability, and PK/PD of asc ending single doses of VIS649 
administered as an IV infusion. The design is standard and is c onsidered appropriate to meet the 
objectives of the study. 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled study is appropriate and standard for a single ascending dose 
study. This design will minimize bias and provide reference dat a (i.e., data from placebo-treated 
subjects) which will aid in the interpretation of results. The SMC will review available blinded safety, tolerability, and Ig level data after each cohort to co nfirm whether it is safe to proceed 
with the next planned dose, whether the dose escalation should be stopped or if the dose should be lowered, repeated, or titra ted in the subsequent cohort. 
The safety assessments for the s tudy are accepted measures for ensuring safety of subjects during 
a clinical trial. The PK sampling schedule is considered approp riate given the information 
available. The rationale for  dose selection is discussed in Section 5.3 .

 3.4. Stopping Criteria for the Clinic al Study and Dose Escalation Cr iteria 
If any of the dose limiting toxicities listed below are met, th e relevant subject(s) data may be 
unblinded. If the toxicity is present in ≥ 1 subject randomized  to active drug, then  dose escalation 
will pause. Depending upon the nature of the event, a decision may be made to resume dosing, to 
proceed into the next cohort at  a lower dose level, or to stop the study. 
Based on safety criteria, the dose adjustment/stopping criteria  are as follows: 
 Adverse event stopping criteria: 
 Any AE of severe intensit y and related causality 
 Any SAE of rela ted causality 
 Vital sign stopping criteria: 
 Symptomatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <85 mmHg). If 
symptomatic hypotension that is related to the study drug is ob served during the 
study, then a minimum of two repeat BP measurements should be o btained over a 
brief period. The mean of the three SBP measurements will be used to determine 
stopping criteria 
 Tachycardia defined as heart rate >120 beats per minute (bpm) l asting longer than 
30 minutes or with impaired consciousness 
 Electrocardiogram stopping criteria: 
 QT interval  >500 msec 
(If a prolonged QTc interval is observed during the study, then a minimum of two 
repeat ECGs should be obtained over a brief period. The mean of  the three ECGs will 
be used to determine stopping criteria.) 
 Clinical laboratory stopping criteria: 
 Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3 times the upper limit of norm al (ULN) 
 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥3 times the ULN 
 Serum creatinine >1.5 times the ULN 
 A decrease from baseline in hemoglobin concentration >3 g/dL 
 White blood cell count <1,500/mm3 
 Platelets <50,000/mm3

4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement 
While subjects are encouraged to complete all study evaluations , they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason. Every effort will be made  to determine why any subject 
withdraws from the study prematurely. All subjects who withdraw  from the study with an 
ongoing AE must be followed until the event is resolved or deem ed stable. If a subject withdraws 
prematurely after dosing, all data  to be collected prior to dis charge from the clinical site should 
b e  c o l l e c t e d  a t  t h e  t i m e  o f  p r e m ature discontinuation or at the  scheduled discharge. Subject 
participation may be terminated pr ior to completing the study and the reason recorded as follows: 
1.  Adverse event 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 42 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 2.  Protocol violation 
3.  Loss to follow-up 
4.  Subject withdrew consent at own request 
5.  O t h e r  
A genuine effort must be made to determine the reason(s) why a subject fails to return for the 
necessary visits or is discontinue d from the study. If the subj ect is unreachable by telephone, a 
registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the subject requesting him/her to contact the 
clinic. 
Subjects can be replaced, and a replacement randomization number will be generated. The same 
treatment will be allocated t o the replacement subject. 
4.5. Termination of the Clinical Study 
If the Principal Investigator, the Sponsor, or the Medical Monitor becomes aware of conditions or events that suggest a possible hazard to subjects if the cli nical study continues, then the 
clinical study may be terminated after appropriate consultation  among the involved parties. The 
clinical study may be terminated at the Sponsor’s discretion al so in the absence of such a finding. 
Conditions that may warrant termination of the clinical study include, but are not limited to: 
 The discovery of an unexpected, relevant or unacceptable risk t o the subjects enrolled in the 
clinical study; 
 Failure to enroll subjects at the required rate; 
 A decision of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development  of the study drug. 
Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whate ver reason, all documentation 
pertaining to the study and VIS649 must be returned to the Spon sor. Any actions of PAREXEL 
required for assessing or maint aining subject safety will conti nue as required, despite termination 
of the study by the Sponsor.

 healthy cynomolgus monkeys at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg IV once weekly over 28 days. VIS649 
was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys with no VIS649-related clinical findings up to 100 mg/kg; the NOAEL from t his study was 100 mg/kg. 
A maximum recommended starting dose of 5 mg/kg was identified b y considering the NOAEL 
of 100 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, which translates to a human  equivalent dose of 
100 mg/kg for monoclonal antibody t herapeutics. Applying a safe ty factor of 2X that accounts 
for the measured affinity difference of VIS649 for monkey and h uman APRIL, and an additional 
10X safety factor to account for  potential interspecies differe nces and other unknowns arrives at 
a NOAEL justified starting dose of 5 mg/kg, which is expected t o be well tolerated in humans 
based on cynomolgus monkey studies.

 Simulations using the previously described PK model [ 2] were performed under the conservative 
assumption of zero nonlinearity for the purpose of the safety m argin calculation.  
 
   
 
5.4. Supply, Packaging, Labeling and Storage 
Investigational m
edicinal products will be packaged and labeled  according to applicable local 
and regulatory requirements. 
VIS649 is formulated at a concentration of 25 mg/mL  
will be supplied in vials containing a nominal 10 mL. 
All supplies of study drug VIS649 must be stored between≥2°C an d ≤8°C and protected from 
light. The study drug VIS649 will be stored in a securely locke d area, accessible to authorized 
persons only. 
5.5. Drug Accountability, Dispensing and Destruction 
The Principal Investigator or designee is responsible for maint aining accurate accountability 
records of the study drug and TENIVAC® vaccine throughout the clinical study. The drug 
accountability log includes infor mation such as, randomization number, amount dispensed and 
amount returned to the pharmacy ( if any). Products returned to the pharmacy will be stored under 
the same conditions as products not yet dispensed. The returned  products should be marked as 
‘returned’ and kept separate fr om the products not yet dispense d. 
All dispensing and accountability records will be available for Sponsor review. When the Study Monitor visits PAREXEL, he/she will reconcile the drug accounta bility log with the products 
stored in the PAREXEL pharmacy.

VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 47 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 The PAREXEL pharmacist (or designee under the direction of the pharmacist) will dispense 
study drug and TENIVAC® vaccine in a blinded manner for each su bject according to the 
protocol, randomizati on list and pharmacy manual, if applicable . 
After receiving Sponsor approval in writing, PAREXEL is respons ible for returning all unused or 
partially used study drug to the Sponsor or designated third pa rty or for preparing the study drug 
for destruction via carbonization. 
5.6. Subject Identification and Randomization 
5.6.1. Screening Numbers 
All screened subjects are assigned a unique 3-digit subject ide ntification (SID) number 
(001 - 999). The SID numbers identify subjects from time of Scr eening until time of 
randomization. Enrolled subjects  who drop out of the clinical s tudy before randomization will 
retain their SID numbers. 
5.6.2. Randomization Numbers 
Prior to dosing on Day 1, eligible subjects will be assigned a randomization number in 
accordance with the randomization code generated by PAREXEL International. The 
randomization code will be maintai ned in a room with restricted  access to pharmacy personnel 
only. The randomization code will include 4-digit subject numbe rs  Cohort 
and randomization numbers are listed in Table 6 . 
Table 6 Randomization Numbers and Treatment Assignment 
Dose 
Group Randomization 
Numbers Replacement 
Numbers Treatment Assignment 
Cohort 1 0.5 mg/kg VI S649 (N=7) Placebo (N =2) 
Cohort 2 2.0 mg/kg VI S649 (N=7) Placebo (N= 2) 
Cohort 3 6.0 mg/kg VI S649 (N=7) Placebo (N= 2) 
Cohort 4 12 mg/kg VIS6 49 (N=7) Placebo (N=2 ) 
Cohort 5 6.0 mg/kg VI S649 (N=10 ) Placebo (N =5) 
Once a randomization number has been allocated to one subject, it may not be assigned to 
another subject. If subjects wit hdrawn prematurely from the stu dy and are replaced under the 
direction of the Sponsor, then a  replacement randomization numb er will be assigned. 
A replacement randomization code will be generated such that re placement subjects are assigned 
to the same treatment as the discontinued subjects. The replace ment randomization code will 
differ only in randomization numbers, which will be 4-digit num bers .

Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 48 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
  
 
No m
ore than one Japanese subject per cohort may be randomized to receive placebo in cohorts 
1-4. 
The full randomization code will be broken for purposes of fina l data analysis and reporting of 
final TLFs after final database lock. This will occur once all final data have been entered into the 
database and all data queries have been resolved, coding is com plete, the assignment of subjects 
to the analysis sets has been completed and the database has be en locked. 
5.7. Administration of Investigational Medicinal Products 
The amount of VIS649 will be calculated on a per subject weight  basis and administered diluted 
in 100 mL of 0.9 % sodium chloride. Subject weight will be capt ured after admission to the 
research unit (Day -1) and will be used by the pharmacy staff f or subject-specific dose 
calculation. VIS649 will be administered intravenously using a volumetric pump and through a 
0.22µm in line IV filter at a rate of 100 mL/hr over the course  of one hour. A saline flush is 
performed after the infusion is complete to ensure that any dru g product remaining in the 
infusion line is administered. Placebo will be 100 mL of 0.9% s odium chloride administered IV 
in an identical manner. For cohort 5 participants, on Da y -1, a single dose of VIS649 o r placebo will be administered 
intravenously in one arm and on Day 28, a single dose of tetanu s/diphtheria vaccine will be 
injected intramuscularly into the opposite arm. Refer to the pharmacy manual for specific details on storage, h andling, and preparation 
information. 
5.8. Compliance 
Dosing will be performed by trained, qualified personnel design ated by the Principal 
Investigator. The date, time and volume of the administered dose will be documented. Comments 
will be recorded if there are a ny deviations from the planned d osing procedures. 
5.9. Blinding and Breaking the Blind 
The clinical study will be performed in a double-blind manner, for clinical research unit staff 
interacting with study participa nts, with the exception of the persons involved in the preparation 
of the IMPs. These persons w ill not be involved in any other study activities. 

Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 49 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 Prior to scheduled unblinding as  described below, the study bli nd should not be broken except in 
a medical emergency (where knowledge of the study drug administ ered would affect the 
treatment of the emergency). The decision to break the blind wi ll be made on a case-by-case 
basis, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator in colla boration with the Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor. The applicable Standard operating procedure (SOP) will  be followed for blind breaking 
procedures. 
As participants in each dosing cohort complete their Week 16 visit, data clean-up and soft-lock 
will be performed for cohorts 1-4 only, in order to allow inter im assessments of blinded data. 
PK/PD analysts will have access to unblinded data at all times,  but those individuals will not be 
involved in study participant interactions. Summaries of treatm ent specific PD responses 
(principally, individual immunogl obulin levels over time and group mean, median, minimum and 
maximum parameters by treatment assignments) will be prepared a nd shared with the Sponsor, 
in a manner that does not unbli nd individual pati ent treatment assignments. A registry of dummy 
subject identifiers will be cr eated. A physician who is not inv olved in the study will review Ig 
results to maintain the blind for  the Principal Investigator. 
5.10. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Any medicinal product, prescribed or OTC, including herbal and other nontraditional remedies, 
is considered a concomitant medication. Prior and concomitant m edication use will be recorded 
for the 30 days prior to the Scr eening Visit until the End-of-s tudy Visit. Prior and concomitant 
medication use is not permitted during the last 30 days or 5 ha lf-lives, whichever is longer, 
preceding baseline (Day -1) until end-of-study (including presc ription or non-prescription 
[over-the-counter]) medication, except for acetaminophen, ibupr ofen, hormonal contraceptives, 
topical medications, vitamins, di etary or herbal remedies). How ever, concomitant medication use 
may be warranted for the treatment of AEs. The use of concomita nt medications to treat AEs 
should be discussed between the Pri ncipal Investigator and the Medical Monitor. 
5.11. Treatment of Overdose 
Standard symptomatic support measures should be used in the cas e of excessive pharmacological 
effects or overdose. No an tidotes are available.

 6.2. Safety Variables 
6.2.1. Adverse Events 
Adverse event reporting will begin for each subject from baseline (Day -1) and will continue 
until the End-of-study Visit. 
6.2.1.1. Definitions 
6.2.1.1.1. Definition of Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical invest igation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a ca usal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintende d sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whethe r or not related to the medicinal (investigati onal) product. 
Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study will be recorded as AEs, 
e.g. those occurring during treatment-free periods (including p ost-dosing periods), in association 
with study-related procedures a nd assessments, or under placebo. For study drugs, lack of 
efficacy may be an expected potential outcome and should not be  reported as an AE unless the 
event is unusual in some way, e.g., greater in severity. Concomitant illnesses, which existed prior to entry into the cl inical study, will not be considered 
AEs unless they worsen during the treatment period. Pre-existin g conditions will be recorded as 
part of the subject’s  medical history. 
6.2.1.1.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence that at an y dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening; this means that the subject was at risk of  death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused d eath if it were more severe 
 Requires in-patient hospitaliza tion or prolongatio n in existing  hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
 Is another important medical event (see below) 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 52 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 Important medical events that do not result in death, are not l ife-threatening or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropria te medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and ma y require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or in a phys ician’s office, blood dyscrasias 
or seizures that do not result i n in-patient hospitalization, a nd the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
A distinction should be drawn betw een serious and severe AEs. S everity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria above. For examp le, a mild degree of 
gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospitalizatio n for monitoring purposes would be 
considered an SAE, but is not necessarily severe. Similarly, an  AE that is severe in intensity is 
not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed a s severe in intensity but would 
not be considered an SAE. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding  if an AE is serious and if 
expedited reporting is appropriate. 
6.2.1.1.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
An adverse event of special interest (serious or non-serious) i s one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which  ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the Principal In vestigator to the Sponsor can be appropriate. Such an event 
might warrant further investigation in order to characterize an d understand it. Depending on the 
nature of the event, rapid communication by the Sponsor to other parties might also be 
warranted. 
Examples of these are all AEs of  Infusion reactions: Fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pa in, headache, dizziness, 
shortness of breath, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, p ruritus, rash, urticaria, 
angioedema, diarrhea, tac hycardia, and chest pain 
 Delayed allergic reactions: Serum sickness (i.e., urticaria, fever, general glandular 
enlargement, joint pains) 
 General: Injection site reaction 
 Any documented infection

Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 53 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 6.2.1.2. Recording of Adverse Events 
Adverse events should be collected and recorded for each subjec t from the baseline (Day -1) 
until the end of their participation in the study, i.e. the sub ject has discontinued or completed the 
study. 
Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject,  or discovered by the study 
staff during physical examinations or by asking an open, non-le ading question such as ‘How 
have you been feeling since you were last asked?’ All AEs and a ny required remedial action will 
be recorded. The nature of AE, date (and time, if known) of AE onset, date (and time, if known) 
of AE outcome to date, severity  and action taken of the AE will be documented together with the 
Principal Investigator’s assessm ent of the seriousness of the A E and causal relationship to study 
drug and/or study procedure. All AEs should be recorded indi vidually in the subject’s own wo rds (verbatim) unless, in the 
opinion of the Principal Investigator, the AEs constitute compo nents of a recognized condition, 
disease or syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease  or syndrome should be named 
rather than each individual symptom. The AEs will subsequently be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 21.0 or hi gher). 
6.2.1.3. Assessment of Adverse Events 
Each AE will be assessed by the Principal Investigator with reg ard to the categories discussed in 
the following sections. 6.2.1.3.1. Intensity 
The Principal Investigator will assess all AEs for severity in accordance with the following 
standard ratings.  Mild: Ordinarily transient sympt oms, does not influence perform ance of subject’s daily 
activities. Treatment is no t ordinarily indicated. 
 Moderate: Marked symptoms, sufficient to make the subject uncom fortable. Moderate 
influence on performance of subj ect’s daily activities. Treatme nt may be necessary. 
 Severe: Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial inf luence on subject’s daily 
activities. May be unable to cont inue in the study and treatmen t may be necessary. 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently th an once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted for that day. Any chang e in severity of signs and 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 54 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 symptoms over a number of days will be captured by recording a new AE, with the amended 
severity grade, and the date (a nd time, if known) of the change . 
6.2.1.3.2. Causality 
The Principal Investigator will assess the causality/relationsh ip between the study drug and the 
AE. One of the categories described in Table 7  should be selected based on medical judgment, 
considering the definitions below and all contributing factors.  
Table 7 Assessment of Relationshi p of Adverse Events to Investi gational Product/and 
or Vaccine 
Related A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, occurs  in a plausible time 
relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the tre atment (de-challenge*) 
should be clinically plausible. The event must be definitive ph armacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re-challenge† procedur e if necessary. 
Probably related A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to c oncurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals, and which follows  a clinically reasonable respons e on withdrawal 
(de-challenge). Re-challenge information is not required to ful fil this definition. 
Possibly related A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the treatment, but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals. Information on treatment withdrawal m ay be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely to be related A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to 
treatment administration which makes a causal relationship impr obable, and in which other 
drugs, chemicals or underlying di sease provide pl ausible explan ations. 
Unrelated A clinical event, including lab oratory test abnormality, with l ittle or no temporal relationship 
with treatment administration. May have negative de-challenge and re-challenge information. Typically explaine d by extraneous factors (e.g., c oncomitant disease, 
environmental factors or other drugs or chemicals). 
*De-challenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE is disco ntinued. If the symptoms of the AE disappear 
partially or completely, within a reasonable time from drug dis continuation, this is termed a positive 
de-challenge. If the symptoms continue despite withdrawal of th e drug, this is termed a negative de-challenge. 
Note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear up on discontinuation of the drug, yet drug-
relatedness clearly exists (for example, as in bone marrow supp ression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia). 
†Re-challenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE in a sp ecific subject in the past is re-administered to that 
subject. If the AE recurs upon exposure, this is termed a posit ive re-challenge. If the AE does not recur, this is 
termed a negative re-challenge. 
6.2.1.3.3. Seriousness 
Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defin ed by the criteria in 
Section 6.2.1.1.2. 
6.2.1.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
The Principal Investigator will review each SAE and evaluate th e intensity and the causal 
relationship of the event to st udy drug. All SAEs  will be recor ded from signing of the ICD until 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 55 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 the End-of-study Visit. Serious AEs occurring after the End-of- study Visit and coming to the 
attention of the Principal Inves tigator must be reported only i f there is (in the opinion of the 
Principal Investigator) reasona ble causal relationship with the  study drug. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing notific ation to the Clinical Research 
Organization (CRO)/Sponsor of an y SAE, whether deemed IMP-relat ed or not, that a subject 
experiences during their par ticipation in study within 24 hours  of becoming aware of the event. 
As a minimum requirement, the  initial notific ation should provi de the following information: 
 Study number 
 Patient number 
 Sex 
 Date of birth 
 Name of Principal Investigator and full clinical  site address 
 Details of SAE 
 Criterion for classification as ‘serious’ 
 Study drug name, or code if unblinde d, and treatment start date  
 Date of SAE onset 
 Causality assessment (if suffici ent information is available to  make this classification) 
The CRO/Sponsor will request clarification of omitted or discre pant information from the initial 
notification. The Principal Inve stigator or an authorized deleg ate is responsible for emailing or 
faxing the requested informati on to the CRO/Sponsor within 24 h ours of the request. 
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detailed de scriptions, including clear 
photocopies of other documents as necessary (e.g. hospital repo rts, consultant reports, autopsy 
reports), with the subject’s personal identifiers removed. All relevant information obtained by the 
Principal Investigator through review of these documents will b e recorded and faxed to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the information. If a new  SAE Report Form is faxed, then 
the Principal Investigator must sign and date the form. The CRO /Sponsor may also request 
additional information on the SAE, which the Principal Investig ator or an authorized delegate 
must fax to the Sponsor with in 24 hours of the request.

6.2.1.5. Follow-up of Adverse Events 
All AEs experienced by a subject, irrespective of the suspected  causality, will be monitored until 
the event has resolved, until a ny abnormal laboratory values ha ve returned to baseline or 
stabilized at a level acceptable to the Principal Investigator and Medical Monitor, until there is a 
satisfactory explanation for the changes observed or until the subject is lost to follow-up. 
6.2.1.6. Pregnancy 
The Sponsor has a responsibility to monitor the outcome of all pregnancies reported during the 
clinical study. 
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a susp icion that the study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medic ation. Elective abortions without 
complications should not be regarded as AEs, unless they were t herapeutic abortions (see 
below). Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newbor n should not be considered an 
SAE. Each pregnancy must be reported by the Principal Investigator t o the Sponsor within 24 hours 
after becoming aware of the pre gnancy. The Principal Investigat or must follow-up and document 
the course and the outcome of all pregnancies even if the subje ct was withdrawn from the 
clinical study or if the clinical study has finished. All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported by the Principal Inv estigator to the Sponsor on the 
pregnancy outcome report form within 24 to 48 hours after he/sh e has gained knowledge of the 
normal delivery or elective abortion. Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SA E Report Form (e.g., 
maternal serious complications , therapeutic abortion, ectopic p regnancy, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24  hours in accordance with the 
procedure for reporting SAEs.

 Abnormal laboratory results should  be recorded as AEs (e.g., Pr incipal Investigator judgment or 
outside the specific reference range). 
Any value outside the normal range will be flagged for the atte ntion of the Principal Investigator 
or designee at the site. The Pri ncipal Investigat or or designee  will indicate whether or not the 
value is of clinical significance. If the result of any test (o r repeat test, if done) from the samples 
taken during the Screening peri od is indicated as clinically si gnificant, the subject will not be 
allowed into the study without permission of the Medical Monito r. Additional testing during the 
study may be done if medically i ndicated. If a clinically signi ficant abnormality is found in the 
samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the End-of-study Visit, it should be 
recorded as an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalized or stabilized, at the discretion of  the Principal Investigator. 
6.2.2.1. Anti-drug Antibody Response 
The serum samples to measure the presence of ADA will be collec ted on Days 1, Week 4,8,16 
and if required Weeks 20 and 24. The presence or absence of ADA will be determined in the serum samples using validated bioanalytical methods. Blood samp les for ADA analysis will be 
collected up to Week 16 from all subjects. Samples for anti-VIS 649 antibody titers and 
neutralizing capabilities will be drawn according to the Schedu le of Assessments (see Table 10). 
Further procedures for sample collection, shipment, processing and storage will be described in 
the Laboratory Manual. 
6.2.3. Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be assessed at the time points detailed in the  Schedule of Assessments (see Table  
10). The following vital si gns will be measured: 
 Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic [mmHg]) 
 Pulse (bpm) 
 Respiratory rate (breaths per minute) 
 Temperature 
Blood pressure and pulse recordings will be made after the subject has been in a seated or supine 
position and at rest≥ 5 minutes.

Standard safety 12-lead ECGs will be performed at the time poin ts detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessments (see Table 10) . 
The12-lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has been re sting supine for≥ 5 minutes. The 
ECG will include all 12 standard leads and a Lead II rhythm str ip on the bottom of the tracing. 
The ECG will be recorded at a  paper speed of 25 mm/sec. The fol lowing ECG parameters will be 
collected: PR interval, QRS inter val, RR interval, QT interval and QTc interval (QTcF). 
All ECGs must be evaluated by a qualified physician or physicia n’s assistant for the presence of 
abnormalities. 
6.2.5. Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations will be performed at the time points deta iled in the Schedule of 
Assessments (see Table 10) . 
Full physical examination: An assessment of general appearance and a review of systems (de rmatologic, head, eyes, ears, 
nose, mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, 
extremities, musculoskeletal, neurologic and psychiatric system s). 
Brief physical examination: 
An assessment of the general appearance, skin, cardiovascular system, respiratory system and 
abdomen. 
The brief physical examination may be extended to a full physic al examination if considered 
necessary by the Principal Investigator. Other evaluations may be performed as deemed 
necessary by the Principal Investigator. This will be commented  upon in the clinical study report 
(CSR), if performed. 
6.3. Pharmacokinetics Variables 
6.3.1. Blood Sample Collection 
Blood for the analysis of VIS649 will be collected at the time points detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessments (see Table 10) . 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 Page 61 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 Blood sample collection, processi ng and shipping details will b e outlined in a separate laboratory 
manual. In brief, PK sampling will occur on Day 1 starting with a collection prior to the start of 
infusion, at the end of infusion (60 minutes) and at 2 hours, 8  hours and 24 hours post end of 
infusion. Pharmacokinetics samples will also be drawn on Days 3 , 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 112. 
Serum samples for determination of the concentration of VIS649 will be analyzed under the 
responsibility of the Sponsor. Further procedures for sample co llection, shipment, processing, 
and storage will be described in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.4. Pharmacodynamics Variables 
For assessing the effect of VIS649 on PD parameters, serum samp les will be drawn and 
evaluated for immunoglobulin levels (total IgA, IgG and IgM), i mmunoglobulin subtypes (IgA 
and IgG), and lymphocytes.  
 
 Sample s for PD parameters will be 
collected at the time points det ailed in the Schedule of Assess ments (see Table 10 ). Further 
procedures for sample collecti on, shipment, processing, and sto rage will be described in the 
Laboratory Manual. 6.5. Total Amount of Blood 
The approximate volume of blood (440.5 mL) planned for collecti on from each subject over the 
course of the entire study (from the Screening Visit to the End -of-study Visit, but not including 
repeat or additional tests ordered by the Principal Investigato r) presents no undue risk to the 
subjects. 
For all subjects enrolled, the approximate blood volumes to be collected during the study are 
outlined in Table 9 .

 7. STUDY CONDUCT 
7.1. Schedule of Assessments 
The study will be comprised of: 
 A Screening Visit up to 28 days before dosing 
 An in-house stay for approximately 2 to 3 days, with admission to the study center on 
Day -1, dosing on Day 1 and discharge in the morning of Day 2 
 A post-administration period of 16 weeks 
 Outpatient visits, on Day 3 (+1 day), 7 (± 1 day), 14, 21, 28, 31 (± 1 day) (cohort 5 only), 
35, 42, 49 (cohorts 1-4 only), 56, 70, 84 and 98 (for all visit s not otherwise specified, ± 3 
days) 
 A final Follow-up visit on Day 112 (± 3 days); however, two add itional follow-up visits 
may be performed, at Weeks 20 and 24 post-dosing, if serum immu noglobulins have not 
returned to > lower limits of normal by the Week 16 (Day 112) v isit or if emerging trial 
data suggest a value of later f ollow-up (i.e. detection of ADA responses). 
The total duration of the clini cal study per subject will be up  to approximately 20 weeks 
(5 months), including the Screen ing period with the possibility  of duration exte nding to 28 weeks 
(7 months) if follow-ups visits are required. For a detailed Schedule of Assessments, see: Table

presented, by treatment (dose of VIS649 or pooled placebo), bas ed on the safety analysis set. In 
addition, the ADA titers (n, median, minimum and maximum) will be summarized by treatment 
(dose of VIS649 or pooled placebo) for all subjects with a posi tive confirmatory assay at each 
time point; this tabulation will include a summary of the highe st titer across all time points for 
each subject.  
8.12. Assessment of Response to Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccination 
Data of assessment of response to tetanus/diphtheria vaccinatio n will be listed by subject for 
cohort 5. 8.13. Interim Data Reviews 
As participants in each dosing cohort complete their Week 16 visit, data clean-up and soft-lock 
will be performed for cohorts 1-4 only, in order to allow an in terim assessment of PK, PD and 
safety data. PK/PD analysts will be permitted access to unblind ed data, to facilitate preparation 
of blinded data summaries for p resentation to the Sponsor. The randomization code will be 
provided to the bioanalytical laboratories responsible for the analysis PK and PD endpoints. 
Following analysis of the samples but prior to provision of the  data to PAREXEL’s statistician, 
the laboratory will re-code the data back to the corresponding original unique sample ID

 9. ETHICAL, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS 
9.1. Data Quality Assurance 
The monitoring of the study will be conducted under the respons ibility of the Sponsor by the 
CRO. The monitor will perform on-site and/or remote monitoring visits as frequently as 
necessary per the individual study monitoring plan. 
The Principal Investigator must prepare and maintain adequate a nd accurate records of all 
observations and other data pertinent to the clinical study for  each study participant. Frequent 
communication between the clinica l site and the Sponsor is esse ntial to ensure that the safety of 
the study is monitored adequately. The Principal Investigator w ill make all appropriate safety 
assessments on an ongoing basis. The Medical Monitor may review  safety information as it 
becomes available throughout the study. All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored with respe ct to Good Clinical  Practice (GCP) 
and SOPs for compliance with applicable government regulations.  The Study Monitor will be an 
authorized individual designated by the Sponsor. The Study Moni tor will have access to all 
records necessary to ensure integrity of the data and will periodically review the progress of the 
study with the Principal Investigator. The Sponsor will be enti tled to audit the facilities used in 
the clinical and laboratory parts of the study, as well as to a ccess all the data files pertaining to 
the study. Similar procedures may also be conducted by agents o f any regulatory body, either as 
part of the national GCP complia nce program or to review the re sults of this study in support of a 
regulatory submission. The Prin cipal Investigator should immedi ately notify the Sponsor if they 
have been contacted by a regulator y/ethics agency concerning an  inspection. 
9.2. Institutional Review Board 
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed ICF and HIPAA authorization, and 
other information given to study volunteers must be reviewed by  the IRB of the study site. A 
signed and dated statement that the protocol and ICF and HIPAA authorization have been 
approved by the IRB must be given to the Sponsor before study i nitiation. The name and 
occupation of the chairperson and t h e  m e m b e r s  o f  t h e  I R B  o r  t h e  IRB’s Health and Human 
Services (assurance number mu st be supplied to the Sponsor). 
9.3. Access to Source Data/Documents 
PAREXEL will use an electronic data capture system to manage da ta collection during this trial. 
The electronic data capture system (ClinBase) is a software too l designed to ensure quality 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 (Draft) Page 77 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 assurance and facilitate data cap ture during clinical trials. Through a system regulated workflow 
that includes barcode scanning and interfaces to medical equipm ent to avoid manual data entry, 
study operations performance is controlled and captured in real  time. The system is fully 
CFR 21 part 11 compliant. 
The Principal Investigator will ensure the accuracy, completene ss and timeliness of the data 
reported to the Sponsor. Data col lection processes and procedur es will be reviewed and validated 
to ensure completeness, accuracy, reliability and consistency. A complete audit trail will be 
maintained of all data changes. The Principal Investigator or d esignee will cooperate with the 
Sponsor’s representative(s) for the periodic review of study do cuments to ensure the accuracy 
and completeness of the data capture system at each scheduled monitoring visit. Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to identify any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the respective study sites by 
means of electronic or manual queries. 
The Principal Investigator or designee will prepare and maintai n adequate and accurate study 
documents (medical records, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication  reporting, raw data 
collection forms, etc.) designed to record all observations and  o t h e r  p e r t i n e n t  d a t a  f o r  e a c h  
subject receiving study drug. The Principal Investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized 
regulatory authority inspectors and the IRB/IEC to have direct access to all documents pertaining 
to the study. 
9.4. Archiving Study Documents 
According to ICH SOP guidelines, essential documents should be r e t a i n e d  f o r  a  m i n i m u m  o f  
2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no 
pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region  or at least 2 years have elapsed 
since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the  study drug. However, these 
documents should be retained for a longer period if required by t h e  a p p l i c a b l e  l e g a l  requirements. 
9.5. Good Clinical Practice 
The procedures set out in this clinical study protocol are desi gned to ensure that the Sponsor and 
the Principal Investigator abide  by the principles of the ICH g uidelines on GCP. The clinical 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 (Draft) Page 78 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 study also will be carried out in keeping with national and loc al legal requirements in accordance 
with US investigational new dr ug [IND] regulations [21 CFR 56]). 
9.6. Informed Consent 
Before each subject is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
from the subject according to the regulatory and legal requirem ents of the participating country. 
As part of this procedure, the P rincipal Investigator must expl ain orally and in writing the nature, 
duration and purpose of the study and the action of the drug in  such a manner that the subject is 
aware of the potential risks, inconveniences or AEs that may oc cur. The subject should be 
informed that he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time. He/She will receive all 
information that is required by federal regulations and ICH guidelines. The Principal Investigator 
or designee will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB/IEC -approved ICD prior to the start 
of the study. 
The ICD must be signed and dated; one copy will be handed to the subject, and the Principal 
Investigator will retain a copy as part of the clinical study r ecords. The Principal Investigator will 
not undertake any investigation sp ecifically required for the clinical study until written consent 
has been obtained. The terms of t he consent and when it was obt ained must also be documented. 
If a protocol amendment is requi red, then the ICD may need to b e revised to reflect the changes 
to the protocol. If the ICD is revised, it must be reviewed and  approved by the responsible 
IRB/IEC, and signed by all subjects subsequently enrolled in th e clinical study as well as those 
currently enrolled in t he clinical study. 
9.7. Protocol Approval and Amendment(s) 
Before the start of the clinical study, the clinical study prot ocol and other relevant documents 
will be approved by the IRB/IEC,  in accordance with local legal  requirements. The Sponsor must 
ensure that all ethical and lega l requirements have been met be fore the first subject is enrolled in 
the clinical study. 
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol,  amendments must be written, 
which must be released by the responsible staff and receive IRB /IEC approval prior to 
implementation (as appropriate). Administrative changes may be made without the need for a forma l amendment, but will also be 
mentioned in the integrated CSR. All amendments will be distrib uted to all study protocol 
recipients, with appr opriate instructions. 
Visterra Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
VIS649-101 CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Amendment 2, Version 3.0 (Draft) Page 79 of 80 12 Mar 2019 
 All protocol deviations will be documented and reported in the final CSR. 
9.8. Confidentiality Data Protection 
All clinical study findings and documents will be regarded as c onfidential. Study documents 
(protocols, IBs and other material) will be stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality. 
The Principal Investigator and members of his/her research team  (including the IRB/IEC) must 
not disclose such information w ithout prior written approval from the Sponsor, except to the 
extent necessary to obtain informed consent from subjects who w ish to participate in the trial or 
to comply with regulat ory requirements. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Sub jects will be specified on study 
documents by their subject number, initial or birth date, not b y name. Documents that identify 
the subject (e.g., the signed ICD) must be maintained in confid ence by the Principal Investigator. 
9.9. Publication Policy 
By signing the clinical study prot ocol, the Principal Investiga tor agrees with the use of results of 
the clinical study by the Sponsor for the purposes of national and international registration, 
publication and information for medical and pharmaceutical prof essionals. If necessary, the 
regulatory authorities will be notified of t he Principal Invest igator’s name, address, qualifications 
and extent of involvement. 
The Principal Investigator shall not publish any data (poster, abstract, paper, etc.) without the 
express written consent of the Sponsor.

TITLE:  
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double  Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Assess the Safety  and Efficacy  of 
Natroba™ (spinosad) for the Treatment of Scabies  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
SPN-304-15 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  
Natroba™ (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9%  U.S. IND No.  
66,657  
PHASE:  
3 
INDICATION:  
Treatment of scabies  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective is to assess  the safety and efficacy of topical Natroba™ (spinosad) versus 
Placebo for the complete  cure of scabies after  a single treatment.  
 
ENDPOINTS:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of “index” subjects completely cured of scabies by Day 
28. The “index” subject is defined as the youngest infested household member (≥4 years). Complete 
cure is defined as demonstration of both clinical cure (all signs and symptoms have completely 
resolved, including  burrows, inflammatory /non-inflammatory lesions and  pruritus) and microscopic or 
dermatoscopic cure demonstrating the absence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala, and negative 
dermatoscopy for burrows.  
Safety endpoints include the evaluation of adverse events, general skin and eye irritation, clinical 
laboratory assessments, vital signs, and use of prior and concomitant medications.  
POPULATION:  
Approximately 360 subjects  will be enrolled in the study. The approximate 360 total is based on:  
120 households, each with an “ index ” subject  and approximately 2 additional subjects per household 
(infested or not) for 360 total. The 120 “index” subjects with confirmed scabies infestation  will 
comprise the primary efficacy population in order to achieve , with attrition, 48  subjects completed  per 
treatment group (Natroba™ versus P lacebo).  In this study, “index” subjects will be defined as the 
youngest infested household member (≥4 years). All household members  of the “ index ” subject will be 
randomized to the same treatment.   
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
This is a double blind, two -arm, 28 -day, placebo -controlled study with approximately 120 infested 
“index” subjects randomized 1:1 to Natroba™ or Placebo.  All members of a household (no more than 
6 individuals) with a suspected “index”  subject must be screened at the first visit. In this study, “index” 
subjects are defined as the youngest infested household member (≥4 years). If the members have an 
active sc abies infestation and meet all other criteria,  they must agree to participate in the study. 
Household members who do not present with scabies at the screening visit must also agree to apply the 
same blinded investigational product  (IP) as household members  who present with scabies (see Table 
6-1 Schedule of Procedures for status assessment). All infested household members must agree to 
participate in the study or none will be enrolled. Screening procedures include informed consent, 
medication and medical history, urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential, scabies 
assessment  (visual evidence of burrows , inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritus),

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  microscopic exam ination of skin scraping,  or dermatoscopy , to de monstrate the presence of mites, 
eggs, and/or scybala (dermatoscopy must confirm burrows), vital signs, general skin and eye 
assessment, randomization, and IP dispensing and instruction.  
After screening on Day 1, all randomized subjects  will be dispensed I P (Natroba™  or Placebo) to apply  
at home  later the same day  as a single treatment over the entire body from the neck down to the toes 
(including  the soles of the feet ) and to the scalp (if balding) or hairline, temples and forehead on the 
same day. Subject s less than 12 years of age should be assisted with administration by a parent, 
guardian or caregiver. Subjects will rub the treatment into the skin followed by a 10 -minute wait period 
before getting dressed. Showering or bathing must not occur earlier tha n 6 hours after treatment and no 
later than at lea st 1 hour prior to Day 2 visit.  
On Day 2 (Visit 2), all household members  will return for general skin and eye assessments  of possible 
irritation, and to confirm that all IP was left on for a minimum of 6 hours before bathing or showering.   
If a subject reports an  adverse event assessed as related by the PI on Day 2 (Visit 2) then a follow -up 
visit with the investigator must be scheduled within 7 days of visit.  All household members will 
receive a well -being phone call o n Day 14  to continue to emphasize inst ructions to prevent re -
infestation, determine if any concomitant medications have been used , and check for adverse events.   If 
a subject reports an adverse event assessed as related by the PI on the Day 14 well -being phone call, 
then a follow -up visit with the investigator must be scheduled within 7 days of phone call.   . 
On Day 28  (Visit 3) , all household members  will return t o the clinic for safety and efficacy 
assessments . The  primary endpoint of complete  cure will be assessed in the  “index” subject and any 
infested household members . If the infested subject is c ompletely  cured at Day 28, he or she will have 
completed the stu dy and termination procedures will be conducted.  If the subject is not c ompletely  
cured at Day 28 (with Natroba™ or P lacebo), the subject will receive 5% Permethrin  and will be 
directed to their primary care physician for follow -up. 
Safety assessments will  be made for all household members and will include monitoring of adverse 
events (AEs) throughout the study, vital signs recording (Days 1 and 28), clinical laboratory analyses 
(Days 1 and 28), and general skin and eye irritation assessments (Days 1, 2, an d 28).  The Day 28 
procedures will also be completed for early termination (ET) except subjects will not receive rescue 
Permethrin but will be directed to follow -up with their primary care physician.  
The trial design is presented in the Study Flow Diagram ( Figure 3-1) and the visit assessments are 
described in the Schedule of Procedures ( Table 6-1).

the toes (including the  soles of the feet ) and to the scalp (if balding) and/or hairline, temples, and 
forehead.  
EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
The primary e fficacy assessment  is the  proportion of “index ” subjects completely cured of  scabies by 
Day 28.  Complete cure is defined as demonstration of clinical cure (all signs and symptoms have 
completely resolved, including burrows, inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritis)  and

Page 8 of 61 
ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  SAFETY ASSESSMENTS:  
Safety assessments include monitoring of AEs on study Days 1, 2, 14 (phone call) and 28, general skin 
and eye irritation assessments on Days 1, 2 and 28, v ital signs on Days 1 and 28, laboratory 
assessments on Days 1 and 28, prior medications on Day 1 and concomitant medications on Days 2 and 
Day 28. For early termination (ET), the Day 28 procedures will also be completed.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of “index”  subjects completely  cured of scabies by Day 
28. The primary analysis set will be the “index” intent -to-treat (ITT) population  which is defined as all 
randomized “index”  subjects regardless of whether they have had any post -baseline assessments and 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of “index”  subjects completely cured  of scabies by 
Day 28 . The number and percentage of “index”  subjects who exhibit complet e cure (Yes or No) by 
Day 28 will be presented by treatment group.  A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel general association test 
stratified by study site (possibly pooled) will be used to compare the complete cure rates between the 
two treatment groups.  The primary a nalysis will be performed at a significance level of 0.05.  
The safety endpoint s include  the evaluation of adverse events , general skin and eye irritation 
assessments , vital signs, and use of prior and concomitant medications.  Additionally, the  descriptive  
changes from baseline  (pre-dose)  to final assessment (Day 28) will be calculated for applicable  
parameter s. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
For the primary efficacy analysis, approximately 120 “index” subjects will be enrolled (including 
possible 20% attritio n) from 120 households and randomized 1:1 to each of Natroba™ (spinosad) and 
Placebo control. The index subject will be the youngest infested member of a household (≥4 years). 
Referencing to the Sponsor’s Proof of Concept (POC) study (SPN -401-12) and publi shed literature,5-10 
out of 60 complet ed subjects, the cure rate is 70% for Natroba™ and 30% for Placebo control.  Based 
upon a reasonable assumption of 60% cure rate for Natroba™ and 30% for placebo, a sample size of 48 
study -completed “index” subjects per group will provide 80% power to decl are the non -equivalency 
using a delta of 30% and Type I error rate of 0.05.   Fisher exact test was used to calculate the sample 
size and the specified power in the following Table 8 -1 (PASS 14; 2015, NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, Utah, 
USA. www.ncss.com ). 
SITES:  
This study will be conducted at approximately 5-10 sites in the United States.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  1 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Human scabies is caused by an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei 
var. hominis). The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it 
lives and lays its eggs. The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching an d a pimple -
like skin rash. The itching and rash each may affect much of the body or be limited to common 
sites such as the wrist, elbow, armpit, webbing between the fingers, nipple, penis, waist, belt -
line, and buttocks. The rash also can include tiny blis ters (vesicles) and scales. Scratching the 
rash can cause skin sores; sometimes these sores become infected by bacteria. Tiny burrows 
sometim es are seen on the skin  which  are caused by the female scabies mite tunneling just 
beneath the surface of the skin.  These burrows appear as tiny raised and crooked (serpiginous) 
grayish -white or skin - colored lines on the skin surface. Mites are often few in number s (only 10 -
15 mites per person)  and the burrows may be difficult to find. The  burrows  are found most often  
in the webbing between the fingers, in the skin folds on the wrist, elbow, or knee, and on the 
penis, breast, or shoulder blades. The head, face, neck, palms, and soles often are involved in 
infants and very young children, but usually not adults and olde r children.1,2 
The scabies mite is usual ly spread by direct, prolonged, skin -to-skin contact with a  person who 
has scabies. Scabies occurs worldwide and affects people of all races and social classes. 
Worldwide prevalence has been estimated at about 300 million cases yearly.2 Scabies can spread 
rapidly under crowded conditions where close body contact is frequent. Institutions such as 
nursing homes, extended -care facil ities, and prisons are often sites of scabies outbreaks.  Current 
treatment recommended by Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is a single overnight topical 
application of 5% Permethrin .1 
Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9% has been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of head lice in patients 6 months of age and older .3 Spinosad is 
derived from the fermentation of a soil actinimycete bacterium, and acts by causing neuronal 
excitation in insects. After periods of hyperexcitation, the lice become paralyzed and  die. This 
same mode of action applies to the scabies mite. After topical application in infested pediatric 
subjects, spinosad levels in plasma were below the limits of quantitation. Preclinical testing for 
carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fer tility were negative. Clinical studies with 
subjects infested with head lice showed  Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9% to be 
more effective than Permethrin  14 days after treatment .3

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  1.2 Rationale  
ParaPRO conducted a proof -of-concept trial that was a double -blinded, two -arm 28 -day placebo 
controlled study of subjects randomly assigned 3:1 to NatrobaTM or Placebo .4 Subjects applied a 
single treatment over the entire body from the neck down to the toes (including the  soles of the 
feet) in-clinic on Day 1, rub bing the investigational product ( IP) into the skin  and waiting 10 
minutes before getting dressed. Showering or bathing was to occur no earlier than  6 hours after 
treatment. Efficacy assessments included visual skin assessment of scabies  infestation (visua l 
assessment of burrows, lesion counts, and presence of new lesions), skin  scraping for 
microscopic examination (for evidence of mites) and a pruritus score by a  subjective scale. The 
scabies scores were changed by -1.4 with Natroba (p=0.0020), compared to  -1.0 with Placebo  
(p=0.2500). The count of lesions was significantly decreased with Natroba ( -28.1, p=0.0020), 
however, not with Placebo  (-9.8, p=0.6250). Microscopy showed significant improvement, 13/15 
negative with Natroba (p=0.0074), compared to 3/5 w ith Placebo  (p=1.000).  
The design for th e current Phase 3  trial is similar to the phase 3 trials evaluating efficacy of 
Natroba™ Topical Suspension for treatment of head lice , although subjects in this trial received 
only one application of the Natroba™ To pical Suspension .3 In the two phase 3 studies of 
individuals with lice, all subjects who were treated on Day 0 returned for efficacy evaluation at 
Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second treatment. Subjects who were 
lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation. Subjects  with live lice and who 
received a second treatment on Day 7 were to return on Days 14 and 21  for evaluation. Efficacy 
was assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice 14 days after the 
initial/final treatment.  
Based on the safety and efficacy of Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9% in the 
treatment of head lic e,3 the present study is designed to evaluate  pivotal phase 3 data on the 
safety and efficacy of the topical suspension against scabies, an infesta tion by Sarcoptes scabiei 
var. hominis . The effect of the Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9% will be  compared 
to that of a Placebo  control.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  All members of a household (no more than 6 individuals) with a suspected “index” subject must 
be screened at the first visit. In this study, “index” subjects are defined as the youngest infested 
household member (≥4 years). If the household has  at least on e member with  active scabies 
infestation and meet all other criteria, they must all agree to participate in the study. Household 
members who do not present with scabies at the screening visit  must also agree to apply the same 
blinded investigational produc t (IP) as household members who present with scabies (see Table 
6-1 Schedule of Procedures for status assessment). All household members must agree to 
participate in the study or none will be enrolled. Screening procedures include informed consent, 
medication and medical history, urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential, 
scabies assessment  (visual evidence of burrows, inflammatory/non -inflammatory les ions and 
pruritus) , microscopic exam ination of skin scraping  or dermoscopy to demonstrate the presence 
of mites, eggs, and/or scybala  (dermatoscopy must confirm burrows ), vital  signs, general skin 
and eye assessment, randomization, and IP dispensing and in struction.  
After screening on Day 1, all randomized subjects will be dispensed IP (Natroba™ or Placebo) 
to apply at home later the same day as a single treatment over the entire body from the neck 
down to the toes (including the soles of the feet ) and to t he scalp (if balding)  or hairline , temples 
and forehead on the same day. Subjects less than 12 years of age should be assisted with 
administration by a parent, guardian or caregiver. Subjects will rub the treatment into the skin 
followed by a 10 -minute wai t period before getting dressed. Showering or bathing must not 
occur earlier than 6 hours after treatment and no later than at least 1 hour prior to Day 2 visit.  
On Day 2 (Visit 2), all household members will return for general skin and eye assessments of 
possible irritation, and to confirm that all IP was left on for a minimum of 6 hours before bathing 
or showering. If a subject reports an adverse event assessed as related by the PI on Day 2 (Visit 
2) then a follow -up visit with the investigator must be sc heduled within 7 days of visit . All 
household members will receive a well -being phone call on Day 14 to continue to emphasize 
instructions to prevent re -infestation, determine if any concomitant medications have been used, 
and check for adverse events.   If a subject reports an adverse event assessed as related by the PI 
on the Day 14 well -being phone call, then a follow -up visit with the investigator must be 
scheduled within 7 days of phone call.  
On Day 28 (Visit 3), all household members will return to the  clinic for safety and efficacy 
assessments. The primary endpoint of complete cure as well as the key secondary endpoint to 
determine improvement based on lesion count will be assessed in the “index” subject and any 
infested household members. If the infes ted subject is completely cured at Day 28, he or she will 
have completed the study and termination procedures will be conducted. If the subject is not 
completely cured at Day 28 (with Natroba™ or Placebo), the subject will receive 5% Permethrin 
and will be  directed to their primary care physician for follow -up.

adverse events (AEs) throughout the study, vital signs recording (Days 1 and 28), and general 
skin and eye irr itation assessments (Days 1, 2, and 28).  
The Day 28 procedures will also be completed for early termination (ET) except subjects will not 
receive rescue Permethrin but will be directed to follow -up with their primary care physician.  
The trial design is pre sented in the Study Flow Diagram (Figure 3-1) and the visit assessments 
are described in the Schedule of Procedures  (Table 6-1). 
3.2 Discussion of Study Design  
The phase 3 study design is a generally accepted clinical approach  to provide sufficient pivotal 
results for the evaluation of safety and efficacy.  The design for this trial is similar to the phase 3 
trials evaluating efficacy of Natroba™  Topical Suspension for treatment of head lice  except that 
in this study the subjects will receive only one application of Natroba™  Topical Suspension .3 In 
the two phase 3 studies of individuals with lice, all subjects who were treated on Day 0 returned 
for efficacy evaluation at Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a seco nd 
treatment. Subjects who were lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation. 
Subjects with live lice and who received a second  treatment on Day 7 were to return on Days 14 
and 21 for evaluation. Efficacy was  assessed as the proportion of pri mary subjects who were free 
of live lice 14 days after the initial  and/or final treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be  the proportion of “index ” subjects c omplete ly cured of 
scabies by Day 28  after a single application of IP on Day 1 . In househol ds where efficacy results 
are likely to be correlated , selecting one subject  (“index”  subject)  from each  unit provides for 
efficacy results that are more independent . These subjects are  selected according to a consistent 
criterion ; in this study “index” subjects will be defined as the youngest (≥4 years) infested 
member of the household. Thus the primary analysis population  will be the “index” intent -to-
treat ( I-ITT) population  which is defined as all randomized “index”  subjects regar dless of 
whether  they have had any post -baseline assessments and the primary efficacy endpoint will be  
the proportion of “index”  subjects c omplete ly cured of scabies by Day 28 . 
A large open -label, randomized, comparative, parallel clinical trial conducted in 315 patients 
with uncomplicated scabies assessed the efficacy and safety of topical Permethrin , oral 
ivermectin, and topical ivermectin.5 The fir st group received Permethrin  5% cream as single 
application, second group received tablet ivermectin 200 mcg/kg as single dose, and third group 
received ivermectin 1% lotion as single application. All the patients received anti -histaminic for 
pruritus. The  patients were followed up at intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. Primary efficacy 
variable was clinical cure of lesions. Statistical analysis was done by chi square test and one -way

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  ANOVA test. At the end of first week, cure rate was 74.8% in Permethrin  group, 30% in oral 
ivermectin group, and 69.3% in topical ivermectin group (P < 0.05). At the end of second week, 
cure rate was 99% in Permethrin  group, 63% in oral ivermectin group, and 100% in topical 
ivermectin group (P < 0.05). At the end of third week, 100% cure rate was observed in 
Permethrin  and topical ivermectin group while 99% in oral ivermectin group (P = 0.367). While 
oral ivermectin was found to be significantly less effective than the 2 topical treatments, there 
was no difference in effectivenes s of topical Permethrin  and topical ivermectin , each achieving a 
faster cure rate than oral ivermectin  with one treatment.  
Based on the safety and efficacy of Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension  (0.9% ) in the 
treatment of head lice,3 and published trials of other scabicides,6,7,8 the present study is  designed  
to evaluate pivo tal phase 3 data on the safety and efficacy of a single topical application of 
NatrobaTM.  The effect iveness  of Natroba™  (spinosad) will be compared to that of a Placebo  
control  at 28 days . If complete cure  is not attained at 28 days , 5% Permethrin  will be 
administered to those subjects and the subjects will be directed to their primary care physician 
for follow up .

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  All IP will be shipped to the study site(s). The Principal Investigator or designee will inventory 
and acknowledge receipt of all  shipments of IP. The Principal Investigator or designee must keep 
accurate records of IP  via the master IP accou ntability logs and the subject IP  accountability 
logs. The PI or designee must also maintain a record of all IP  supplied to all subjects . The P I or 
designee must also maintain a record of 5% Permethrin  supplied to household members for use 
as a rescue medication. Supplies of IP  will be checked and accountability records will be 
reviewed by the Clinical Research  Associate (CRA) at monitoring visit s. The original, completed 
accountability logs will be  collected by the CRA at the close of the study. At the end of the 
study, all unused, partially used, empty or unopened kits or bottles will be returned to ParaPRO 
LLC or its designee for destruction. A  written explanation will be required for any missing 
product.  
Investigational supplies are to be used only in accordance with this protocol and under 
supervision of the Principal Investigator. All records must be available for inspection by 
Concentrics Re search  and ParaPRO LLC personnel or their designees, and are subject to 
inspections by the regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA) at any time . 
5.3 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
As “index” subjects and other infested  or non -infested  household me mbers become eligible for 
randomization at Visit 1 (Day 1), the site will locally assign a unique subject number to each of 
the qualified household members that combines a 3 -digit site number (xxx), a 2 -digit household 
number (yy), and a 2 -digit household member number (zz). For example, the first subject of the 
first household at site 101 would be randomized to subject number 101 -01-01, the second 
member to 101 -01-02, the third member to 101 -01-03, and so on. Since all household members 
receive the same tr eatment, each household is randomized to either Natroba™ (spinosad) or 
Placebo  control.  Non-infested household members will be assigned the same IP treatment as the 
infested members and will be assigned a subject number and randomization number. The 
assign ed subject numbers to each household will correspond to unique bottle numbers on a 
scheme that unblinded site personnel will assign and distribute to ensure approximately equal 
randomization of households to either treatment. Subject numbers must not be re -used once 
assigned, even if the subject does not take the IP. 
5.4 Administration of Investigational Product  
For both treatment groups, the blinded Natroba™  (spinosad ) or Placebo  control will be 
administered by the subject on Day 1 at the subject ’s home . All “index” and other infested and 
non-infested household members will be assigned the same IP treatment, either blinded 
Natroba™  (spinosad) or Placebo  control . The “index”  subject s and all household members  will 
be instructed to apply the IP over entire body from the neck down  to the toes (including the soles

shower for at least 6 hours after application.  Subjects less than 12 years of age  should be assisted 
with administration by a parent, guardian or caregiver.  
If complete  cure is not achieved by Day 28 visit, 5% Permethrin  will be  dispensed to all uncured 
subjects  and they will be directed to their primary care physician for follow up . All uncured 
subjects  will be instructed to apply the  5% Permethrin  as per manufacturer’s instructions . 
Subjects who early terminate (ET) will not receive 5% Permethrin and will be directed to their 
primary care physician for follow  up. 
5.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
At Visit 1 , each subject’s bottle of IP will be weighed and recorded (application instructions 
provided) as well as the height and weight of the subject before each subject takes the IP home. 
All household members will be provided with the same blinded stu dy treatment . The IP  will be  
applied at the subject’s home.  
Each subject’s bottle will be  returned the next day at Visit 2.  An accounting of the amount of IP 
used by the subject (by weight) will be documented by the clinic staff. At Visit 2, subjects will 
be asked to confirm that IP was applied from neck down  and to the scalp (if balding)  or hairline, 
temples, and forehead  and washed/rinsed off no earlier than 6 hours after application , and no 
later than at least 1 hour before Visit 2. The used IP bottle will be collected at Visit 3 if not 
returned at Visit 2.  
If subjects are not completely  cured by Visit 3 (Day 28), the 5% Perm ethrin  and application 
instructions will be provided at this visit  and subjects will be directed to follow -up with their 
primary care physician . 
5.6 Blinding and Unblinding Method  
Eligible households  will be assigned to either Natroba™  (spinosad) or Placebo  control, by 
pre-specif ied un -blinded site personnel. The un -blinded site personnel will assign all eligible 
members from the same househol d to the same treatment group. While t he treatment bottles for 
each household will have unique numbers , the numbers f or that household will correspond to a 
specific treatment , Natroba™  (spinosad) or Placebo  control. Un-blinded site staff will maintain 
the randomization sche me with treatment code  and associated bottle numbers , and will not reveal 
the information to the su bjects, blinded study personnel or ParaPRO LLC until after the database 
lock.  
In an emergency, the study blind may be broken only if:

6.7 Early Termination Procedures  
The term "Early  Termination"  refers  to a subject’s  non-completion  of a study  whether  by his  or 
her own choice  or the investigator’ s decisio n or due to discontinuatio n of the study  by ParaPR O 
LLC.  In the absence  of a medical contraindicatio n or significan t protocol violation,  every  effort  
will be made by the Investigator to keep  the subject in the study.  Should  the subject  decide  to 
withdraw,  an early  termination  visit should be conducted , which will include  all procedures

refer the subject to their primary care physician for follow -up. 
The primary reason  for a subject  withdrawing  prematurely  should  be selected  from  the 
following  categories: 
Adverse  Event  or Serio us Adverse  Event —events that are associated  with discontinuation.  
Noncompliance  with protocol —the subject  failed  to adhere  to the protocol  require ments.  The 
deviation  necessitated  premature termination  from  the study.  
Withdrawal  of Consent —subjec t desire s to withdra w from further  participation in the study  in 
the absence  of an adverse  event or a medical  need  to withdraw.  
Lost to Follow -up—the subject  did not return  for one or more follow -up visit(s)  followin g 
dispensin g of test drug. The reaso n was unknown  and appropriate due diligence was exerted 
by the investigator to contact the subject and encourage their return . 
Other —causes  of premature  termination  from  the study  other  than the above,  such as theft  or 
loss of IP, termination  of study  by ParaPRO  LLC,  etc. The details of the premature 
termination in this “other” category should be documented fully .

the study  is stopped  at his/her site by the IRB or if the investigato r elects to stop the study.  
6.8 Subject Completion Criteria  
Successful completion of the study by “index”  subjects will occur at Day 28 (Visit 3) if the 
“index”  subject is  completely cured  of scabies . Other household members will complete the 
study at Day 28 after safety assessments are completed.  
6.9 Protocol Deviations  
This study  is intended  to be conducted  as described  in this protocol.  Any changes/deviations  to 
the protocol  must  be reported  to the IRB (Schulman IRB Cincinnati, OH 45242 ). In the event  of a 
significant  deviation  from  the protocol  due to an emergency,  accident,  or mistake,  the investigat or

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  7 DETAILED DESCRIPTION  OF ASSESSMENTS  
7.1 Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from subjects who are 12 years of age and older as 
well as the parent or legal guardian of subjects who are 4 -17 years of age before any study 
proced ures are performed. In addition to the parent or legal guardian signing the informed 
consent, verbal and written assent will be obtained from subjects who are between the ages of 7 -
11 years of age. Assent is not required for subjects 4 -6 years of age; howe ver, the parent or legal 
guardian must sign consent . All potential subjects for the study (or their legal guardians) will be 
given a copy of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved informed consent form to read. 
The IRB is Schulman IRB (Cincinnati, O H 45242).  
The assent and/or consent forms will be discussed in detail with each potentially eligible subject 
and the parent or legal guardian of subjects 4 -17 years of age, if applicable. The PI or qualified 
designee will explain all aspects of the study i n lay language and answer all the subject's 
questions regarding the study. The PI or designee will inform the subject as to the nature, aims, 
duration, potential hazards, and procedures to be performed during the study and that his or her 
medical records m ay be reviewed. The PI or designee will also explain that the subject is 
completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time. Subjects who 
refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice.  
No study procedures will be performed nor IPs released to any subject who has not signed the 
assent or IC form or whose parent or legal guardian has not signed the IC form.  
7.2 Medical History  
A complete medical history  will be obtained at Screening (Visit 1).  
7.3 Prior Medications and Concomitant Medications  
Investigator’s need to be aware that patients often have severe prurit us and will be prescribed 
medication s as well as take OTC med ications to treat this condition . The PI needs to  inform 
the subject of  prohibit ed topical medications used for itching or other indication , including 
over-the-counter (OTC) cortisone products , as these may interfere with efficacy evaluations . 
Non-medicated lotions are allowed  after IP is washed off  (e.g., non -scented, hypoal lergenic, 
etc.). Subjects  will be instructed  not to take any oral prescription  medications  without  prior  
consultation  with the Investigator unless their primary physician  otherwise instru cts. Oral 
Benadryl ® (diphenhydramine) and other oral OTC anti-pruritics are allowed  for itch relief . 
Subjects  will be instructed  to tell their primary physi cian of their participation  in this study  if 
they consult  their physicia n durin g the study . Any therapy  taken  by the subject  in the 4 week s 
before  rando mization  (Visit  1) will be reported  as prior  medication.  Any therapy  started  or

7.4 Prohibited Medications  
Subjects should not use any scabicide within 4 weeks before Visit 1, or use any scabicide, or 
rescue Permethrin, prescription or OTC medicated lotions, other than the IP during the study, 
through Day 28.  There will be no washout of prohibited medications, subjects will be exclude d 
or withdrawn from the study for use of prohibited medications.  
7.5 Pregnancy and Contraceptive Use  
Urine  pregnancy  tests will be cond ucted on women of childbearing  potential  at screening  (Visit  
1) and end of study  (Visit  3/ET). Such  subjects  should  be willing  and able to practice  an 
accepta ble method  of contraception  during  the study.  Examples of acceptable  contraceptive  
methods  include  abstinence,  intrauterin e device (IUD),  double  barrier  method,  oral or 
implantable or injectable  contrace ptives . Must have  been  using  syste mic (oral, injectable, or 
implantable)  contraceptives  for at least 3 months.  If abstinence is their primary method of birth 
control they should be instructed to use a double barrier method if they become sexually active  
with another household member . 
7.6 Scabie s Assessment  
Skin will be examined at Visits 1  and 3/ET to establish positive or negative evidence of active 
scabies infestation.  
• Scabies diagnosis – active scabies infestation confirmed by clinical signs and symptoms  
(evidence of burrows or presence of scabies inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and 
pruritus) as well as by microscopic exam ination of skin scraping  or dermatoscopy to 
demonstrate the presence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala. If dermatoscopy is used it s hould 
also confirm there are burrows on the skin.

(all signs and symptoms have completely resolved, including burrows, 
inflammatory /non-inflammatory lesions and  pruritu s) and microscopic or dermatoscopic 
cure with demonstration of the absence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala, and dermatoscopy 
negative for burrows.  
7.7 General Skin  and Eye  Assessment s 
At Visit 1, the skin will be assessed to determine eligibility – no evidence of crusted scabies, 
normal skin in non -infested areas. At Visit s 1, and 2 , the skin and eye assessment s will include 
documentation  of presence or absence of irritation, and verbal subject -reported verification  that 
the treatment topical suspension remained  on for at least 6 hours before being washed off.  At 
Visit 3 /ET, skin and eye assessment s will include evidence of irritation.  
Eye irritation will be rated:  
0 no irritation  
1 mild scleral, lid and/or conjunctiva injection  
2 moderate scleral and or lid inje ction with conjunctival erythema  
3 severe scleral and/or lid injection with conjunctival erythema and purulent drainage  
7.8 Application of IP  
The bottle will  be weighed before and after application. One bottle of IP  (blinded Natroba™ 
[spinosad ] or Placebo  control ) contains 4 -oz. of treatment product. The subject should use as 
much of one bottle as needed. The subject should apply a thin layer of IP from the neck down to 
the toes (including soles of the feet)  and to the scalp (if balding)  or hairline, templ es, and 
forehead at their home on the same day it is dispensed on Visit 1 . The IP should be allowed to 
soak into the skin or dry for 10 minutes before getting dressed. Subjects less than 12 years of age  
should be assisted with administration by a parent, g uardian or caregiver. Showering or bathing 
should occur no earlier than 6 hours after treatment and no later than at least 1 hour before Visit 
2. 
7.9 Vital Signs  
Height  (Visit 1 only) , weight,  resting  blood  pressure  (BP) and heart  rate will be measured at 
Visit s 1 and 3/ET.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  Screen Failure: A screen failure is defined as a subject who consented but who has not bee n 
randomized. Screen failures may re-screen after review and approval by the sponsor. Re-
screening may also be necessary due to timing/scheduling  or washout of other treatment s (except 
scabicides which exclude the subject)  that may have occurred within the  prior 4 weeks . 
7.11 Randomization and Treatment Assignment  
Eligible subjects will be assigned to either treatment group , Natroba™ (spinosad) or Placebo  
control, by pre -specified un -blinded site personnel  that may perform no other study specific 
duties. The un -blinded site personnel will assign all members from the same household to the 
same treatment group.  The assigned s ubject  numbers in each household will co rrespond to 
unique bottle numbers on a scheme that unblinded site personnel will assign and distribute  to 
ensure approximately equal randomization of households to either treatment.  Subjects, blinded 
site personnel and ParaPRO LLC will remain blinded to the treatment until after database lock.  
Randomization will be stratified by study site.  
7.12 Counseling to P revent Re -Infestation   
Subjects should be informed about methods to minimize risk of re -infestation: including 
avoiding skin contact with others who are infested and avoiding bedding or linens of an  infested  
person, and simultaneous treatment of all household contacts. The following information from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used as reference:  
“When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for  up to 
two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they 
do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin -to-skin contact with 
an infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norweg ian) scabies can spread the 
infestation by brief skin -to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture 
that he/she has used.  
Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin -to-skin contact with an infested person or with items 
such as cl othing or bedding used by an infested person. Bedding and clothing worn or used next 
to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried 
using the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry -cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or 
laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies 
mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults 
usually can return to child care, school, or w ork the day after treatment.”

8.1 Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 120 “index” subjects will be enrolled (includ ing possible 20% attrition) from 120 
households and randomized 1:1 to each of Natroba™ (spinosad) and Placebo  control. The index 
subject will be the youngest  infested  member of a household  (≥4 years).  Referencing to  the 
Sponsor’s Proof of Concept (POC) study (SPN -401-12) and published literature,5-10 out of 60 
completed subjects , the cure  rate is 70% for Natroba™ and 30% for Placebo  control .  Based 
upon  a reasonable  assumption  of 60% cure rate for Natroba™  and 30% for placebo , a sample 
size of 48 study -completed “index” subjects per group will provide 8 0% power to declare the 
non-equivalency using a delta of 30% and Type I error rate of 0.05 .  Fisher exact test was used to 
calculate the sample size and the specified power in the following Table 8 -1 (PASS 14; 2015, 
NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, Utah, USA.  www.ncss.com ).

Assuming a drop -out rate could be at most 20%, 120 subjects should guarantee at least 48 
evaluable subjects for each treatment group at Day 28 assessment.  
8.2 Randomization  
This study  will investigate 2 treatment  groups: Natroba™  (spinosad)  Topical  Suspen sion, 0.9%  
or Placebo  control.  A rando mization  scheme will be used locally at each site  (stratified by study 
site) to obtain  a balanced  allocation of treatments (approximately 1:1) to the households.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  8.3 Analysis Populations  
Safety Population  
The safety population will comprise all subjects who received one dose of IP.  Subjects will be  
analyzed as treated.  The safety population includes the “index”  subjects along with any 
household members enrolled in the study.  All safety analyses will utilize the safety population.  
Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will comprise all subjects who were randomized  regardless 
of whether they have post -baseline assessments . Subjects will be analyzed as randomized.  This 
population includes the “index”  subjects  along with any household members enrolled in the 
study.  
Index  Intent -to-Treat Population  
The “index” intent -to-treat ( I-ITT) population will comprise all index subjects who were 
randomized . Subjects will be analyzed as randomized. T he index subject will b e the youngest 
infested member of a household  (≥4 years). This analysis population will be used for the efficacy 
analysis.  
Index Per Protocol Population  
The “index” Per Protocol (I -PP) population is a subset of the I -ITT population. Index subjects 
will be excluded from the I -PP population for the following reasons:  
1. Protocol deviations that would be in violation with the established Inclusion or 
Exclusion Criteria.  
2. Protocol deviations that could confound the evaluation of efficacy outcomes:  
o Scabies assessme nt not performed (i.e. burrows, lesions, pruritis, skin 
scraping) .  
o Subject received the wrong treatment.  
o Discontinuation prior to acquisition of Visit 3 (Day 28) efficacy 
measurements.  
3. Protocol deviations that are a result of subject non -compliance:   
o Missed Day 2 appointment.  
o Use of another scabicide during the study.  
o Use of prescription or OTC medicated lotions during the study.  
Prior to database lock, a memo will be generated identifying any subjects that were excluded 
from the I -PP population along with the reason why they were excluded.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  8.4 Missing Values  
There will be no imputation for missing events and assessments in handling safety data.  
If a subject has observed data for complete cure at Day 28, the observed cases (OC) will be used 
at Day 28.  If a subject discontinues the study before Day 28, the imputation method for 
complete cure at Day 28 depends on the reasons of missing, i.e. informative or non -informative 
missing.  Please refer to the SAP for more details.   
For other missing efficacy data at  Day 28 (e.g., clinical cure, microscopic cure, new lesions and 
total lesions), Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation will be used.  
Details of imputation rules for efficacy analyses and other missing data handling conventions 
will be included  in the SAP.  
8.5 Statistical Analyses  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), in addition to this section of the study protocol, will describe 
statistical methodology for analyses  and data reporting. A version of the SAP will be prepared  at 
the same time as the pro tocol  is finalized . However, the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints and analyses on them will not be altered unless agreed upon with the FDA. SAP will 
be finalized before the database is unblinded.  
Data collected in this study will be presented using summary tables, figures, and subject data 
listings. Summary tables will present data by treatment group and, if applicable, by scheduled 
time of data collection. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, 
presenting  the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum , and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. Figures may be used 
to support the presentation of certain data.  
For efficacy analyses, small study sites may be pooled together . Details on the pooling 
algorithms are provided in Section 8.5.3.3.  
All statistical tests and confidence intervals will be 2 -sided at an alpha level of 0.05.

8.5.3 Efficacy Analyses  
8.5.3.1 Primary Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of index subjects completely  cured of scabies by 
Day 28.  Complete cure is defined as demonstration of clinical cure (all signs and symptoms have 
completely resolved,  including burrows, inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritus) 
and microscopic or dermatoscopic cure with demonstration of the absence of mites, eggs, and/or 
scybala, and dermatoscopy negative for burrows.  
The primary analysis will be based  on the data by Day 28 from the I-ITT population . The 
number  and percentage of index subjects who exhibit complete cure (Yes or No)  at Day 28  will 
be summarized  by treat ment group. A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel general association test adjusted 
by study site (small sites pooled) stratification will be performed to compare the complete cure 
rates between  the two treat ment groups.  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on the primary efficacy endpoint to evaluate the 
robustness of the results using different methods of analysis.  
A logistic regression analysis will be used assessing the treatment group differences.  The model  
will include clinical site and treatment group as fac tors, and possibly additional  baseline 
characteristics  or a covariate , if appropriate .   
Other additional sensitivity analyses include repeating the above analyses on I -PP population and 
ITT population.  
8.5.3.2 Exploratory Efficacy  
All exploratory efficacy  endpoints will be summarized by the treatment group  at each scheduled 
visit.   Desc riptive statistics for continuous variables consists of mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, numbers and percentages will be 
summarized.

Microscopic Cure  
Microscopic cure is defined as microscopic or dermatoscopic demonstration of  the absence  of 
mites, eggs, and/ or scybala , and negative for burrows.  
The number and percent of subjects who exhibit microscopic cure (Yes or No)  at Day 28  will be 
presented by treatment group.  
Additional analyses can be performed on the I -ITT population by applying a logistic regression 
model adjusted for baseline  factors.  
Number of New  Lesions  
The number of new lesions at Day 28 will be analyzed using  a negative binomial regression 
model to compare the treatment difference. The model will include treatment group and study 
site (small sites pooled) as fixed factor s, and baseline total lesion count as a covariate.   
This analysis will be performed on the I -ITT population .  
Total Lesion  Counts  
Total lesion counts will be calculated as the sum of pre -existing lesions and new lesions. The 
baseline captures the  total lesions  on the day of first study drug administration.  
The change from baseline to Day 28 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment  and study site (small sites pooled) as factors and baseline total 
lesion counts as a covariate.

This is a study conducted at multiple study sites.  Every effort will be made to have each site 
enroll at least 8 subjects per arm.  In case there are “small” sites with few er-than-8 “index” 
subjects , these sites will be  pooled toget her as a single, combined site for efficacy analyses if the 
combined site has at least 8 “index” subjects per arm.  In the situation when the combined site 
still has less than 8 “index” subjects per arm, the smallest site with at least 8 “index” subjects p er 
arm will be pooled to this combined site for efficacy analyses.  The complete cure rates at Day 
28 will be summarized descriptively by treatment groups and by sites before and after pooling 
the sites.  Assessment of site -to-site variability will be cond ucted on the original sites prior to 
pooling .  In addition, the above demographics and baseline characteristics will be presented by 
site before and after pooling sites.

9.1 Definition  
An AE is defined  as any untoward  medic al occurrence  in a subject  or clinical  investigation  
(vital signs, physical change,  etc.) following  the subject’s  first dose of IP that does not 
necessarily  have  a causal relationship  with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable  or 
unintended  sign (including  an abnor mal finding  on vital signs , physical change, etc.), 
symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of an IP, whet her or not related  to the 
IP. 
This includes  any adverse occurrence  that is new in onset or aggravate d in severit y, duration  or 
frequency  from  the baseline  condition  (including  the physi cal examination),  or abnor mal results  
of diagnostic  procedures  (including  vital sign  abnor malities).  
Examples of untoward medical events  that should  be considered  AEs are those that : 
• result ed in discontinuation  from  the study,  
• require d treatment or any other  thera peutic  intervention,  
• require d further  diagnostic  evaluation  (excludin g a repetitio n of the same 
procedure  to confirm  the abnor mality), 
• are associated  with clinical  signs  or symptoms judged  by the Investigator  to 
have  a significant  clinical impact.  
Examples of what an AE is not: 
• A surgica l procedure  
• A situation  where  an untoward  event  did not occur,  (e.g. a social  hospitalization)  
• The disease  being  studied,  unless  progress ion is more sever e than anticipated  
• Lack of efficacy 
• Baseline  conditions  that have  not worsene d in severit y or frequency  
• Abnormal findings or test results (unless considered clinically significant in the 
opinion of the investigator  or specifically defined elsewhere in the protocol ) related 
to the disease  being  studied  (unless  more severe  than expecte d). 
9.2 Procedures  
Subjects will be que ried at every visit through  the last visit regarding the occurrence and nature 
of any AEs. All AEs will be reported, whether or not they are deemed to be related to IP.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  A description of the event or diagnosis including dates, severity, relationship to the IP, action 
taken and outcom e, and whether or not the event was also serious, must be reported on the AE 
Case Report Form ( CRF ) for each adverse event recorded in the subject’s chart.  
9.3 Severity  
Adverse events are graded according to seriousness and severity.  The seriousness of an even t is 
determined by the regulatory criteria in Section  9.7.  
The Investigator will evaluate the severity  of each AE. Adverse event  severity  will be graded as  
follows:  
Mild:    Awareness of symptoms but easily tolerated  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to interfe re with but not prevent daily activity  
Severe:  Unable to perform usual activity  
9.4 Relationship  
The Investigator will judge the likelihood that the AE was related to the IP according to the 
following criteria : 
• Not related: There is no possible temporal and/or causal relationship to the IP. 
• Related: There is a possible temporal and/or causal relationship to the IP. 
9.5 Action Taken  and Outcome  
The Action Taken with IP for every AE will be reported as Dose Not Changed or Dose 
Withdrawn. The Outcome of each AE will  be entered as either: Recovered/Resolved, 
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae, Not Recovered/Not Resolved, Fatal, or Unknown.  
9.6 Adverse Event Follow -up 
Investigators will follow unrelated AEs until the final study visit (Day 14 or Day 28).  All SAEs, 
and AEs de emed by the Investigator to be related to IP or treatment , will be followed until the 
event has resolved.  
9.7 Serious Adver se Events  
An AE that results in any of the following outcomes  is serious : 
• Death (note that death is the outcome of an SAE  and the cause of death should be listed as 
the AE)  
• Life-threatening event . An event, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, which 
places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. (It does not include an adverse event

Page 53 of 61 
ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if the investigator brochure referred only t o elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentione d 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.”  
The study sponsor will expedite reporting all serious unexpected suspected adverse reactions 
(SUSARs): initial reporting by the sponsor for nonfatal or non -life-threatening SUSARs must be 
submitted as soon as possible but no later than within 15 calendar days following the sponsor’s 
initial receipt of the information, and for fatal or life -threatening SUSARs, initial reports must be 
submitted no later than 7 calendar days following the spon sor’s initial receipt of the information. 
Any relevant additional information obtained by the sponsor that pertains to a previously submitted 
IND safety report must be submitted as a Follow -up IND Safety Report without delay as soon as 
the information is a vailable but no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor receives the 
information.  
Such expedited reports will comply with the applicable regulatory requirements and with the 
FDA’s Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
BA/BE Studies  (21 CFR 312.32 ). 
9.9 Pregnancy  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator must notify the Medical Monitor 
immediately upon learning of the pregnancy.  The outcome of any pregnancies occurring on the 
study must b e followed up to term.  The investigator will be provided with a Pregnancy Outcome 
Form by the Medical Monitor.  This form must be completed fully and returned to the Medical 
Monitor. Any spontaneous miscarriage or congenital anomaly or birth defect must b e recorded as 
a Serious Adverse Event and full details will be requested. Any complications during pregnancy

10.1 Ethical and Regulatory Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, 21 
CFR Parts 11, 50 Subparts A and B, 54, 56, and 314, and the Consolidated Guidance for 
Industry, GCP E6, April 1999; and 1996 ICH GCP E6.  
10.2 Institutional Review Board  
The Concentrics Research  will ensure that an appropriately constituted Institutional Review 
Board (IRB), in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 56, reviews and approves the 
clinical study before the study is initiated. IR B approval must refer to the study by exact protocol 
title, number, and amendment number (if applicable), identify the documents reviewed, and state 
the date of review.  
Concentrics Research will ensure that ParaPRO LLC approves any changes to the IC templa te 
prior to submission to the IRB.  
Should changes to the IC form become necessary during the study, Concentrics Research will 
ensure that the changes are approved by ParaPRO LLC prior to submission to the IRB. Should 
changes to the study protocol become ne cessary, Concentrics Research will ensure that the 
protocol amendment is approved by the IRB prior to implementation. Concentrics Research will 
ensure that protocol administrative changes have been reviewed by the IRB.  
Concentrics Research must be copied o n any correspondence initiated by the site to the IRB 
during the course of the study.  
10.3 Informed Consent  
A properly  executed,  written  IC, in complianc e with 21 CFR Part 50 and HIPAA authorizati on, 
will be obtained  from  each subject prior  to enroll ment and the initiation  of screening  
evaluations  required  by this protocol.  A copy  of the IC form planned  for use will  be reviewed 
by ParaPRO  LLC for acceptability and submitted by or on behalf  of the Investigator,  together  
with the protocol,  to the IRB for review and approval  prior  to the start of the study.  Consent  
forms will be written  in language  fully comprehensible  to the prospective  subject.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  10.4 Subject Confidentiality  
All communications, reports, and subject samples will be identified only by a coded number 
and/or initials to maintain subject confidentiality. All records will be kept confidential to the 
extent permitted by law. If a waiver or authorizati on separate from the statement in the IC is 
required for permitting access to a subject’s medical records (e.g. HIPAA), the investigator will 
obtain such authorization prior to enrolling a subject in the study. The Principal Investigator 
should keep a sepa rate log of subjects, codes, names, and addresses. Documents which identify 
the subject by name (for example, the IC form) should be kept in strict confidence.  
ParaPRO LLC and its business associates agree to keep all subject information confidential. 
Only  coded, blinded data will be released. Data resulting from analyses will be entered into a 
database that is not accessible to the public. Subject data will be identified only by the subject 
screen number, randomization number and initials, and not by any o ther annotation or 
identifying information.  
ParaPRO LLC and its business associates will take every possible step to reduce the risk of 
releasing information to the public that would enable subjects to be personally identified .

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  11 STUDY MONITORING  
11.1 Clinical M onitoring  
An initiation meeting will be conducted by Concentrics Research  or an approved representative. 
At this meeting the protocol, the procedure for completing the eCRFs, and pertinent aspects of 
the eCRFs will be reviewed with the Principal Investigat or and all study staff.  
Monitoring visits will be conducted during the study. The Principal Investigator will make a 
reasonable amount of time available to the CRA on reasonable notice to assist with monitoring.  
At each visit, the CRA will review the eCRFs  and source documents to ensure that all items have 
been completed and that the data provided are accurate and obtained in the manner specified in 
the protocol . 
11.2 Auditing Procedures  
In addition to the monitoring visits outlined above, an investigational sit e may undergo a quality 
assurance audit. Concentrics Research  or ParaPRO LLC representatives or a regulatory agency 
such as the FDA may conduct the audit. If a regulatory agency requests an audit of the study site, 
the Investigator is required to inform Concentrics Research  (or ParaPRO LLC) immediately .

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  13 SOURCE DOCUMENTS, CASE REPORT FORMS AN D RECORD RETENTION  
13.1 Source Documents  
The Investigator will complete and maintain source documents for each subject participating in 
the study. The source documents should con tain all demographic and medical information, 
including vital sign  data. The subject’s source documents file should also indicate that he /she is 
participating in the clinical study, refere ncing the study number and the IP . All information 
required by the p rotocol should be documented in the source records. An explanation must be 
given for any omissions. Each evaluation recorded will be performed at the time specified in the 
protocol . 
13.2 Electronic Case Report Forms  
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be used in this study. The Investigator is responsible 
for the quality of the data recorded in the eCRF. The data recorded should be a complete and 
accurate account of the subject’s record collected during the stud y.  
The Investigator and other staff who have been delegated responsibility for entering data into the 
eCRF at each visit will be trained in the use of the eCRFs before the first subject at that site is 
enrolled. The Investigator must review all entries fo r completeness and correctness. The 
electronic data capture system will keep an audit trail of all changes made after the eCRF pages 
are initially completed and submitted.  The study monitor will review the eCRFs for 
completeness and adherence to the protoc ol 
13.3 Record Retention   
The Principal Investigator will maintain adequate records so that the conduct of the study can be 
fully documented and monitored. Copies of protocols, test result originals, all IP accountability 
records, correspondence, subject I nform ed Consent  forms, and any other documents relevant to 
the conduct of the study will be kept on file by the Principal Investigator. Study documents will 
not be destroyed. For regulatory inspections, it will be necessary to have access to complete 
study subject records, provided that subject confidentiality is maintained.  
Per the Clinical Development Agreement between ParaPRO LLC and Concentrics Research , 
investigators must retain subjects’ records for a period of 2 years after FDA approval or until 
written a pproval to destroy the documentation is provided by ParaPRO LLC. The documentation 
must be retained longer if so required by local law. Investigators must notify Concentrics 
Research  and ParaPRO LLC, in writing, of changes in address, sales of practices or  site closures 
in order to make arrangements for the maintenance of study files .

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of liver associated morbidity and 3 
mortality.  Currently available first -line therapies for treatment of chronic hepatitis B include 4 
pegylated interferon -alpha and the nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs ) entecavir and tenofovir. These 5 
were shown to effectively suppress viral replication , but their ability to induce durable off -treatment 6 
response is limited to a small subset of patients.  Combination treatment with peginterferon and 7 
NUCs  has been attempte d in several randomized controlled trials , with no apparent advantage over 8 
either agent given alone. In these studies however, treatment with peginterferon was initiated either 9 
simultaneously or shortly after NUCs  administration. The efficacy of peginterfe ron following long - 10 
term viral suppression with NUCs  was only tested in one small pilot study, nevertheless showing 11 
60% HBsAg loss rate.  12 
The underlying mechanisms responsible for improved efficacy of peginterferon in this setting  are 13 
unknown  and warrant further investigation. In this single arm study we propose to evaluate the 14 
efficacy and mechanisms associated with response to peginterferon add -on therapy following a 15 
minimum of 192 weeks  of viral suppression induced by NUCs  in a group of chro nic HBV infected 16 
patients. Sixty patients with either HBeAg positive ( n=30) or negative ( n=30) chronic  HBV infection 17 
will be enrolled to this study. After medical evaluation and pretreatment liver biopsy , treatment with 18 
subcutaneous injections of pegylated  interferon alpha -2a 180 μg per week will be given for  a total of 19 
24 weeks , followed by an off -treatment evaluation period of 48 weeks. A second liver biopsy will be 20 
performed six hours following the first peginterferon injection. Primary end -point for thi s study will 21 
be the change in interferon -stimulated -genes response before and after first interferon injection in 22 
responders versus non -responders to treatment.  The responsiveness to IFN -based therapy of 23 
treatment responders vs nonresponders will addition ally be evaluated by studying intrahepatic and 24 
peripheral blood natural killer cells. The study will also assess HBeAg and HBsAg loss and 25 
seroconversion rates in comparison to historical controls treated with either peginterferon or NUCs  26 
monotherapy .  Fina lly, we will assess whether treatment responders develop an HBV -specific T cell 27 
response similar in quantity and quality to that of patients who spontaneously resolve HBV infection.  28

BACKGROUND  2 
 3 
 4 
It is estimated that there are over 350 million persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 5 
worldwide  [1] Globally, chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular 6 
carcinoma accounting for ~620,000 deaths annually  [2] Epidemiological studies have demonstrated 7 
a strong association between high viral levels and worse outcome of chronic HBV infection  [3, 4]. 8 
Thus, the goal of therapy is long -term, sustained suppression of HBV replication. Current first line 9 
recommendations for treatm ent of chronic HBV infection include entecavir, tenofovir (nucleos(t)ide 10 
analogues) or peginterferon -alpha  [1, 5, 6].  11 
 12 
 NUCs with potent activity against the HBV reverse transcriptase and high barrier to resistance  have 13 
been  very effective at suppressing viral replication and were  shown to be associated with improved 14 
clinical outcomes including reversal of cirrhosis  [7, 8]. However, discontinuing therapy after one year 15 
is associated with high relapse rates and therefore mo st patients require long -term therapy to 16 
maintain suppression of viral replication  [9-11]. Even with long -term use of NUCs , only about 50% of 17 
persons who were initially HBeAg positive undergo HBeAg seroconversion (the endpoint of therapy 18 
for HBeAg positive persons) [12, 13]and among those who were initially HBeAg negative, only about 19 
1%-2% experience HBsAg seroconversion (the endpoint of therapy for HBeAg negative persons)  [14, 20 
15] Unfortunately, there are substantial costs associated with long -term therapy and there is the 21 
potential for serious side effects including renal toxicity and possibly loss of bone mass  [16-20] Thus, 22 
new agents or approaches are needed to manage patients with chronic HBV infection. One approach 23 
that has been taken to  improve HBsAg loss was  to combine the two most potent NUCs . In one notable 24 
trial, the efficacy and safety of entecavir monotherapy was compared to the combination of entecavir 25 
and tenofovir in persons with HBeAg positive and negative chronic HBV infection. After 96 weeks of 26 
therapy, a comparable proportion of patients in each stu dy arm achieved the primary end point of a 27 
level of HBV  DNA <50 IU/mL (83.2% vs 76.4%, respectively), indicating no benefit of a combination 28 
NUC approach over potent monotherapy [21]. Another approach was to combine a nucleoside 29 
analogue with peginterferon. This strategy is theoretically appealing as the combined effect of 30 
peginterferon, an immunomodulator, and a nucleos(t)ide analogue, a potent inhibitor of viral 31 
replication, may result in a synergistic anti -viral effect. However,  several trials comparing the efficacy 32 
of combination peginterferon -NUCs  therapy to either agent alone failed to  show a clear advantage of 33 
combination therapy over either agent alone. Four randomized controlled trials comparing 34 
peginterferon alfa and NUCs  (either lamivudine  or adefovir)  to peginterferon alone or NUCs  alone 35 
have been conducted in per sons with HBeAg positive and negative chronic HBV infection. [22-25]. All 36 
 6 
studies reported greater on -treatment viral suppression with the combination regimen compared to 1 
either agent alone , but  higher rates of sustained off -treatment viral suppre ssion with the 2 
combination regimen were only achieved in comparisoin to NUCs  alone but not to peginterferon 3 
alone. Thus, there is really no advantage of combination peginterferon and lamivudine  or adefovir  to 4 
peginterferon alone , when treatment with the tw o agents is initiated simultaneously . 5 
 6 
Studies assessing baseline predicto rs of response to peginterferon have shown that high viral levels 7 
are associated with a less favorable response in both HBeAg positive and negative HBV infected 8 
patients [26, 27]. In this context, it may be postulated that high viral titers may inhibit the action of 9 
peginterferon and that combination peginterferon plus a nucleos(t)ide analogue may be more 10 
effective if the peginterferon is preceded by a lead -in period of the nucleos(t)ide analogue. In one 11 
study  testing t his strategy,  185 persons with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B were randomized to 12 
receive either entecavir monotherapy for 48 weeks or a lead -in period of 24 weeks of entecavir 13 
followed by 24 weeks of combination entecavir plus peginterferon  [28]. At end -of-treatment  more 14 
patients in the combination arm, 19%, achieved the primary endpoint of HBeAg seroconversion 15 
compared to the entecavir monotherapy arm, 10%. This difference  however  was not statistically  16 
significant  (p=0.095) , and there was no peginterferon monotherapy arm. However, in a prespecified 17 
multiva riate analysis adjusted for differences in HBV DNA at the start of the randomized therapy 18 
phase, add -on peginterferon was significantly associated with a 4.78 -fold increase in response rate 19 
(P = .004). It is possible though that a longer period of viral su ppression is required to improve the 20 
efficacy of peginterferon therapy in combination with a NUCs . Indeed in a small pilot study in which 21 
peginterferon was added after a minimum period of 3 years of entecavir therapy with complete viral 22 
suppression , showed  that 60% of persons developed HBsAg loss [29]. These provocative results 23 
suggest that a peginterferon add -on strategy following a substantial period of nucleos(t)ide induced 24 
viral suppression, may result in high rates of HBsAg seroconversion. The underlying mechanisms 25 
responsible for improved efficac y of peginterferon in this setting, are unknown , or for that matter the 26 
mechanism of action of peginterferon in chronic HBV infection and warrant further investigation.  27 
 28 
IFN-α is a naturally occurring cytokine with broad anti -viral activity. Its anti -viral  effect is mediated 29 
through induction of a diverse set of target genes, referred to as IFN -stimulated genes (ISGs) [30]. 30 
This results in inhibition of HBV replication through a variety of mechanisms including a block of 31 
RNA-containing core particle formation, an accelerated decay o f replication -competent core particles, 32 
and degradation of the pre -genomic R NA [31-33]. Recently, IFN -α was also shown to inhibit HBV 33 
replication by decreasing R NA transcription from cccD NA. This effect was mediated through 34 
epigenetic repression of cccD NA (via histone hypoacetylation), as well as b y active recruitment to the 35 
cccD NA of transcriptional co -repressors  [34]. 36 
 7 
In addition to its direct anti -viral activity, IFN -α is also a potent immunomodulator with robust 1 
effects on cells of the innate immune system, such as natural killer cells  (NK).  NK cells consistitute 2 
the largest lymphocyte population in the liver and can exert antiviral function via direct cytotoxic 3 
mechanisms and via indirect cytokine (e.g. IFN -gamma  mediated) mechanisms.  NK cell s respond to 4 
IFN-a and we have previously shown that the response of peri pheral blood NK cells to  Peg-interferon 5 
correlates well with the overal response and clinical outcome of PegIFN -based regimens in chronic 6 
HCV infection  [35, 36].  Interferon also modulates the adaptive, T cell -mediated response.  T cells are 7 
typically impaired in their antiviral function  in chronic HBV infection  This impairment has been 8 
attributed to upregulation of inhibitory molecules such as PD -1, Tim -3, CTLA -4 and others due to 9 
chronic T cell receptor stimulation by HBV antigens resulting in downregulation of virus -specific T 10 
cell response of infected patients [37].  In this protocol we will determine whether a decrease in HBV 11 
titer by NUCs  improves the innate and adaptive immune response to PegIFN.  12 
 13 
We postulate that in patients with chronic HBV infection, who have long -term viral suppression due 14 
to NUCs  therapy, the addition of peginterferon will lead to HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion. We plan 15 
to explore the clinical response and possible mechanisms i nvolved during therapy with 16 
peginterferon alfa when added to long -term nucleoside therapy in patients with chronic HBV 17 
infection (both HBeAg -positive and -negative). We hypothesize that the extended p retreatment with 18 
NUCs  will modify the responsiveness to peginterferon . These effects will be studied by analyzing the 19 
expression pattern of ISGs , the response of NK cells prior to and after peginterferon injection 20 
resulting in improved  transcriptional control of cccD NA , the induction of antibodies against HBe and 21 
HBsAg and T cell responses.  22 
Primary endpoints of this trial will be  the changes in expression levels of ISG’s, intrahepatic total HBV 23 
DNA and cccD NA content  , changes in NK cell  effector cell function measured before and following a 24 
single dose of pegi nterferon stratified by treatment response  and the rates of HBeAg and HBsAg loss 25 
and seroconversion in HBeAg positive patients, HBsAg loss and seroconversion rate in HBeAg 26 
negative patients . Secondary endpoints will be  the induction of HBV -specific memory T cell 27 
responses . A post -hoc analysis will stratify reponse rates upon available viral genotype data and 28 
duration of NUC therapy prior to study enrollment. Other secondary end -points will include changes 29 
in quantitative HBeAg and HBsAg levels during therap y and safety of the combination regimen. 30 
Serological response rates, qHBsAg kinetics  and safety end -points will be compared to historical 31 
controls of published multicenter randomized trials comparing the efficacy of peginterferon and 32 
NUCs  in eAg positive a nd negative HBV carriers   33 
 34

HYPOTHESIS  1 
 2 
In patients with chronic hepatitis B infection,  under  long -term viral suppression maintained by NUCs  3 
treatment , peginterferon  add-on therapy  will result in a greater proportion of subjects achi eving 4 
serological response  compared to before peginterferon was added . We hypothesize that response to 5 
treatment will be accompanied by measurable changes in host -response gene transcription  profile , 6 
immune cell activation and function, and quantitative viral bi omarker levels .  7 
 8 
SPECIFIC AIMS  9 
 10 
1. To assess the changes in ISG profile and NK cell function after a single dose of peginterferon 11 
in patients receiving long -term NUCs with maintained  viral suppression  12 
2. To determine rates of HBeAg and HBsAg loss with or without seroconversion  and induction 13 
of HBV -specific memory T cells t o peginterferon  add-on treatment in eAg positive and 14 
negative HBV carriers  on long -term NUC  treatment.  15 
3. To identify pre - and on -treatment predictors o f serological response to peginterferon  add- 16 
on/nucleos(t)ide combination therapy.   17 
4. To determine if there are differences in epigenetic regulation of cccDNA between HBeAg 18 
positive and negative CHB at baseline and following a single dose of peginterferon tr eatment  19 
 20 
PROTOCOL  OVERVIEW  21 
 22 
We intend to enroll a total of 60 patients with HBeAg positive ( n=30) and HBeAg negative ( n=30) 23 
chronic HBV infection , who have been on -treatment  with one or more nucleos(t)ide analogues  for at 24 
least 192 weeks  prior to study enrollment  with maintained viral suppression (HBV DNA level <100 25 
IU/ml) . After a thorough medical evaluation and liver biopsy, participants will receive therapy  with 26 
subcutaneous injections of peginterferon -alpha 2a at a dose of 180mcg per week for  a total of 24 27 
weeks . A second liver biopsy will be performed 6 hours following the first peginterferon  injection for 28 
the purpose of assessing ISG s, intrahepatic NK cel l quantity and function and intrahepatic viral 29 
biomarker response patterns. Most i nterferon induced genes achieve  maximal response in the liver 30 
and periphery within 4 hours, beg in to decline by 8 hours, and return to  baseline levels by 24 hours 31 
post -admini stration of interferon. Because peginterferon is slower to be absorbed we have selected 32 
the six hour rather that a four hour time point. [38] 33 
 9 
Patients will be followed carefully on weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12  and 24 during treatment and at 12 week 1 
intervals thereafter until  48 weeks post -treatm ent.  2 
During study visits patients will be assessed  for compliance with study medications , as well as  the 3 
development of any treatment related side effects  and/or adverse reactions . In addition, blood will 4 
be drawn periodically for the assessment of routine blood tests, quantitative viral biomarker levels, 5 
serological response markers and immune cell functional status.  6

Admission for pretreatment liver biopsy  12 
 13 
Once patients are deemed eligible to participate in the study based on results of the screeing 14 
labs, they will have 12 weeks to complete the liver biopsy and to begin add -on therapy with 15 
peginterferon. Eligible  patients will be admitted to 5NW to undergo a percutaneous liver biopsy. 16 
The initial l iver biopsy will be mostly for research purposes to measuring baseline levels of  ISG 17 
expression, pregenomic and cccD NA concentration and frequency and activity of liver in filtrating 18 
HBV -specific NK cells  but will also be used for the purpose of grading and staging of liver disease 19 
before treatment and will provide useful information to the clinician and patient on whether the 20 
liver disease is improving o n current therapy . Grading and staging of the liver biopsy will 21 
performed  by an expert hepatopathologist blinded to the clinical information using the modified 22 
Ishak scoring system. This includes the histological  activity index (HAI) for inflammation and 23 
necrosis (scores ranging from 0 to 18). Fibrosis will be staged  using the Ishak scoring system  (0- 24 
6, 0=no fibrosis, 6=cirrhosis ). Slides will also be immuno stained for HBsAg, HBcAg, and HDV 25 
antigen by peroxidase -antiperoxidase techniques and scored as 0, 1, 2 or 3+ based upon the 26 
percent of cells reactive for each viral antigen  (0=none, 1=10%, 2=11% to 50% and 3= 51% of 27 
hepatocytes) .  28 
Liver -infiltrating lymphocytes  will be assessed for frequency  and  function of NK cells .  m-RNA 29 
levels of  ISG’s, immune ce ll markers and chemokines/cytokines will be quantitated by real -time 30 
PCR  or nanostring . Intrahepatic pregenomic and cccDNA will also be quantitated by Southern 31 
blotting or real -time PCR.  32

mL aliquots)   12 
11) Liver biopsy cut into four sections, one (at least 1.5 cm) placed in formalin for routine light 13 
microscopy and the other 3 (.3cm, .5cm and 1 cm) placed in R NA later and flash frozen in 14 
liquid nitrogen 24 hours later for R NA and protein analyses and flow cytometry.   A liver 15 
biopsy fragment of > 5 mm will be used to assess the frequency and  function of NK cells.  16 
12) Discharge from hospital  17 
 18 
 19 
Initiation of Treatment  20 
 21 
Patients will be stratifie d on the basis of HBeAg status into 2 groups of 30 patients each, to receive 22 
peginterferon -alpha 2a (PEGASYS ®, Roche), 180 mcg per week  administered by subcutaneous 23 
injection for a total of 24 weeks. Patients will continue treatment with their previous nucleosi(t)ide 24 
analogue regimen during the treatment and follow -up phases of this study.  25 
Patients will be seen in the outpatient clinic at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24, during treatment phase, at 26 
12 week intervals thereafter up to 48 weeks post -therapy  27 
Compliance will be monitored by medication diaries and counting of the residual vials  returned at 28 
outpatient visits.  The side effects will be monitored regularly at each visit during the treatment phase 29 
of the study  by symptom questionnaires . Peginterferon alfa -2a will be dose reduced or stopped per 30 
the dose reduction and stopping rules for peginter feron alfa -2a. Peginterferon alfa -2a treatment can 31 
be restarted if the adverse event resolves and the patient is willing to re -start the medication .  32 
 33 
On-treatment liver biopsy  34 
 35 
 14 
At day 0, all patients will be readmitted to the NIH Clinical Center to start therapy with peginterferon 1 
alfa-2a and to undergo a repeat liver biopsy.  Biopsy will be scheduled  at 6 hours following the first 2 
injection of peginterferon , for the purpose of assessing ISG response pattern following the initial 3 
exposure to peginterferon . Liver tissue will also be subjected to routine histopathological grading 4 
and staging as well as for immune cell , quantitative viral kinetic and cccDNA epigenetic studies as 5 
previously described.  6 
 7 
Since the hypothesis to be tested in this study is that r esponse to treatment peginterferon (i.e. loss of 8 
HBeAg and HBsAg or both) is mediated by changes in hepatocyte gene transcription profile, it is 9 
necessary to obtain liver tissue at two time points -before and 6 hours after the first dose of 10 
interferon. Perf orming two liver biopsies within 12 weeks or even as short as 24 hours has been 11 
performed in other Liver Disease Branch studies and has not been associated with an increase in the 12 
complication rate or lower patient acceptance.  13

DOSE CHANGES  5 
 6 
Stopping peginterferon therapy:  7 
 8 
Add -on peginterferon  will be discontinued early  for any of the following reasons:  9 
a) Toxicity - the dose of peginterferon will be modified or discontinued according to Table 1: 10 
Peg-Interferon Alfa -2a Dose Modification Guidelines (see below).  11 
b) Withdrawal of informed consent  (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason.  12 
c) Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness , which in the 13 
opinion of the investigator indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the 14 
best interest of the subject. If any of the following laboratory or clinic al criteria is obtained 15 
for any subject, the result must be repeated/confirmed within 72 hours. If the results are 16 
confirmed, the subject must discontinue treatment. Clinical criteria must have Principal 17 
Investigator or Sub -Investigator assessment prior to  permanent discontinuation.  18 
− Evidence of confirmed hepatic decompensation (Child -Pugh Class B or C, Score > 6) 19 
(discontinue all treatment);  20 
− Platelets < 25 x 109 cells/L;  21 
− Hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL  22 
− Absolute neutrophil count < 250 mm3/ml 23 
− Severe neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms (including depression) for both new and 24 
worsening events that are considered clinically significant by the investigator.  25 
 26 
d) Pregnancy women of childbearing potential must contact the investigator or study staff 27 
immediately  if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual period) at 28 
any time during study participation. If subjects  become pregnant the research staff will stop 29 
peginterferon, but subjects  may continue taking their anti viral oral agent at the  discretion of 30 
the study doctor. The investigator will discuss possible management options  with the 31 
subject . Subjects who do become pregnant  will continue to be followed for the outcome of 32 
the pregnancy. The NIH will not cover  any aspects of obstetrical, child or related care.  33

STATISTICAL A NALYSIS  1 
 2 
Power calculation  3 
 4 
It is not possible to calculate power for the primary endpoints.  We have calculated power for the 5 
secondary endpoints of the rates of HBeAg and HBsAg loss. Response rates in patients in both groups 6 
will be compared to historical controls of HBeAg positive  and negative. It is assumed that if these 7 
patients were followed for an additional year without peginterferon, only 10% of the HBeAg positive 8 
patients would become HBeAg negative and 5% of the H BeAg negative patients would become 9 
HBsAg negative. A sample size of 29 HBeAg positive and 27 HBeAg negative patients will provide the 10 
study with a statistical power of 80%  to detect a difference of  25% (35% versus 10% for HBeAg loss 11 
and 30% versus 5% for HBsAg loss) . The sample size was increased to 30 patients in each arm to 12 
allow for withdrawals . 13 
 14 
Variables to be analyzed in association with a serological response will include: baseline ALT and 15 
HBV DNA level, liver histology, HBV genotype, IL28B genotype, duration of NUC therapy, and ISG 16 
levels. Patients with missing data or who drop out of the stud y will be considered as treatment 17 
failures on an intention to treat basis. For comparison of means, Student’s t -test will be used. All 18 
reported p -values will be 2 -sided.  19 
 20 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  21 
 22 
The following will be summarized for trea ted subjects:  23 
• Demographics: age, race, gender, geographic region, ethnicity;  24 
• Disease characteristics at baseline: HBV DNA level, HBV genotype, IL28B SNP genotype and 25 
cirrhosis status, duration of NUC therapy;  26 
• Physical measurements at baseline; height , weight, body mass index, hip and waist circumference;  27 
• Laboratory tests at baseline;  28 
 29 
Analysis plan  30 
 31 
To address the primary hypothesis that ISG levels are related to virological response to 32 
peginterferon, the ISG analysis of the on treatment liver biops y at 6 hours after the first dose of 33 
interferon  will be correlated with off -peginterferon serological outcome (HBeAg loss/seroconversion 34 
and HBsAg loss). To address the hypothesis that ISG levels are related to HBsAg levels, the ISG 35 
analysis of the on trea tment liver biopsy will be correlated with HBsAg levels at week s 4, 12, 24. . The 36 
 24 
analyses will be stratified by HBV genotype and duration of NUC therapy.  1 
 2 
Analysis methodology  3 
 4 
The analysis will be based on standard approaches to analysis of microarray data. Since the software 5 
and approaches change frequently in this field, we will provide a broad outline of the approach 6 
rather than detailed, specific steps.  7 
a) We will perform qual ity control and background normalization of the gene array data.  8 
b) Expression value estimates will be obtained and quantile normalization and median scaling 9 
of the genes will be performed.  10 
c) A list of genes up - or down -regulated >2 -fold with p>0.05 will be p repared using the 11 
following procedure:  12 
1. For each patient, genes up - or down -regulated >2 -fold in the second biopsy 13 
compared to the first will be identified.  14 
2. Lists will be prepared of genes that are up - or down -regulated >2 -fold for any of the 15 
subjects.  16 
3. A pa ired t -test will be used to identify genes from this list that have a p value <0.05 17 
(Difference is not equal to zero).  18 
4. The subset of the genes in (3) that are up - or down -regulated in >50% of patients in 19 
groups defined relapse and/or presence of cirrhosis will be identified.  20 
5. This procedure will be repeated with p < 0.01, but the primary analysis will be 21 
based on the genes selected using p < 0.05.  22 
d) The false discovery rate (FDR) of the t test will be estimated.  23 
A more detailed statistical analysis plan will b e developed prior to the start of data analysis.  24

 26 
HAZARDS AND DISCOMFORTS  27 
 28 
The risks and discomforts of frequent phlebotomy .  29 
To document stable levels of biochemical and serologic markers of chronic hepatitis and to monitor 30 
the effects and toxicities of the combination of peginterferon alfa -2a and the nucleos(t)ide analogue  31 
frequent blood sampling will be required. Patients will  have between 11 and 12 venipunctures 32 
during the study. Each venipuncture will be for approximately 20 to 75 cc of blood. The total amount 33 
of blood drawn during an 8 week period will not exceed 10.5 ml/Kg or 550 mls, whichever is smaller . 34 
 35 
The risks and discomforts of HIV testing .  36 
 25 
Patients will have blood tested for anti -HIV at entry.  Mention of anti -HIV is made in the consent form 1 
which includes the exact language used in the standard consent form used for anti -HIV testing at the 2 
Clinical Center. It is  important to test for HIV infection as many of the drugs used to treat hepatitis B 3 
(tenofovir , tenofovir and emtricitabine , lamivudine and entecavir ) have activity against HIV and a 4 
treatment regimen using only two drugs against HIV would not be considere d standard of care.  5 
 6 
The risks and discomfort of percutaneous liver biopsy .  7 
Patients will undergo up to two liver biopsies in this protocol: one before therapy  and a second six 8 
hours after the initial injection of peginterferon alfa -2a. Patients with inad equate platelet counts 9 
(<70,000/mm3) or coagulation parameters (prothrombin time > 15 seconds, INR>1.7) will undergo 10 
transjugular liver biopsy after correction of the laboratory abnormalities as a part of this protocol. 11 
Patients requiring liver biopsy will  be admitted to the Clinical Center for two days for this procedure 12 
and other blood testing. The major side effects of liver biopsy are pain, bacteremia, puncture of 13 
another organ and bleeding. Local pain and discomfort at the liver biopsy site occurs in a bout 20% of 14 
persons undergoing percutaneous liver biopsy. This is transient (lasting one to twelve hours) and is 15 
usually mild, rarely requiring analgesics.  Bacteremia occurs in 1 -2% of persons undergoing liver 16 
biopsy.  In the absence of bile duct obstruct ion, this is almost always self -limited and is rarely 17 
symptomatic.  Significant bleeding after liver biopsy is the most serious side effect of this procedure.  18 
In the absence of a blood coagulation defect or hepatic malignancy, significant bleeding is rare , 19 
occurring in less than one in a thousand cases of liver biopsy.  Death due to bleeding after liver 20 
biopsy has been reported in less than 1/10,000 cases.  At the NIH Clinical Center, the Liver Diseases 21 
Branch has performed approximately 150 liver biopsies  each year for the last 20 years. During this 22 
time, only two patients died as a complication of biopsy.  One of these patients had cirrhosis and 23 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and the second had severe coagulation disorders. Both bled from 24 
the liver bio psy site and died after surgical attempts to stop the bleeding were unsuccessful.  25 
 26 
The risks and hazards of Peginterferon therapy   27 
Local pain and erythema at the site of subcutaneous injection . This is usually mild and is no greater 28 
than the pain and irritation associated with other subcutaneous injections. Severe local reactions 29 
have been described but are rare  30 
A syndrome of fever, malaise, headaches and muscle aches . These influenza -   like symptoms occur 31 
typically after the first injection and decre ase in severity with subsequent treatments. Fever can be as 32 
high as 40oC. The fatigue often persists or reappears with prolonged therapy with interferon and is 33 
often the dose -limiting factor in therapy. These symptoms abate  34 
with discontinuation of treatmen t, but may last for up to 2 weeks after the    final injection of 35 
interferon. There is considerable variation in the occurrence and severity of these symptoms.  36 
Gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomi ting, diarrhea and anorexia  are common with high doses 37 
 26 
of interferon. These are rarely severe enough to warrant discontinuation or alteration in interferon 1 
therapy.  2 
 3 
Hair loss  is noted by 20 -25% of patients treated with interferon for more than two months. This is 4 
always temporary.  5 
 6 
Bone marrow suppression  occurs with the dose of interferon used to treat chronic hepatitis. 7 
Leukopenia and granulocytopenia are the most frequent findings and a 20-50% decrease in white 8 
blood cell counts is typical during therapy. This effect is always temporary and is dose related. 9 
Folliculitis and sinusitis, as well as more serious infections such as dissemination of cellulitis and 10 
bacterial peritonitis have occurred in patients receiving interferon. Indeed, among the more than 400 11 
patients with chronic viral hepatitis trea ted with alpha interferon at the NIH, two died of infections 12 
(spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) during therapy. Both patients had hepatitis B and end -stage liver 13 
disease. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a common complication of end -stage  liver diseas e. Other 14 
instances of severe and rare forms of infection have been reported in patients receiving interferon. It 15 
appears that most of these severe infections are more related to the underlying condition than the 16 
leukopenia induced by interferon, but interf eron may increase susceptibility to infections and severe 17 
outcomes. For these reasons, all patients will be cautioned, about infectious complications and 18 
advised to contact their physician or the investigators if they develop fever. Thrombocytopenia also 19 
occurs with interferon treatment, the platelet count falling by 13-52% of the pretreatment values. 20 
Serious bleeding episodes have not been reported with interferon therapy. Finally, mild anemia with 21 
a decrease in hematocrit and hemoglobin of 3 -5% is also se en commonly with interferon therapy. 22 
The effects of interferon on the bone marrow have been temporary and rapidly reversible with 23 
discontinuation of therapy.  24 
 25 
Significant cardiac side effects  have included idiopathic and reversible heart failure. This is r eversible 26 
with conventional management.  This occurs with a frequency of <1%.  27 
  28 
Pulmonary disorders: Dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans, 29 
interstitial pneumonitis and sarcoidosis, some resulting in respiratory failure and/or patient deaths, 30 
may be induced or aggravated by interferon therapy.  Pulmonary complications are rar e and occur 31 
with a frequency of <1%.  32 
 33 
Altered liver enzymes:  Interferon can cause mild elevations in serum aminotransferases in patients 34 
who do not  have liver disease. In patients with chronic viral hepatitis, these possible elevations in  35 
aminotransferases may  be obscured by the pre -existing liver disease.  Transient ALT elevations are 36 
common during hepatitis B therapy with interferon . Twenty -five percent and 27% of subjects 37 
 27 
experienced elevations of 5 to 10 x ULN and 12% and 18% had elevati ons of greater than 10 x ULN 1 
during treatment of HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive disease, respectively. Flares have been 2 
accompanied by elevations of total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase and less commonly with 3 
prolongation of PT and reduced albumin l evels. Eleven percent of subjects had dose modifications 4 
due to ALT flares and less than 1% of subjects were withdrawn from treatment . Of note these data 5 
refer to patients not receiving concomitatnt oral antiviral agents. We believe the chance of significa nt 6 
ALT flares (>10x ULN) would be rare in the setting of combination therapy.  7 
 8 
 9 
Renal effects : Interferon may have minor renal toxicities. A case of interstitial nephritis during alpha  10 
interferon therapy has been reported. We have had one patient develop a cute renal failure  while on 11 
alpha interferon. This was only partially reversible. We have treated many patients with renal 12 
disease using alpha interferon without any adverse effects on renal function. Renal complications are 13 
rare and occur with a frequency  of <1%.  14 
 15 
CNS Effects: Confusion has been noted with very high doses of interferon (>50 mu)69. At the doses 16 
used in our trials (180 mcg per injection) the only central nervous system side effects have been mild 17 
headaches, irritability, depression and psych ological changes. Many patients complain of being short - 18 
tempered and irritable while on interferon. Approximately 18% of patients develop emotional 19 
lability and depression. These side effects are closely monitored and reverse with decrease in the 20 
interferon dosage. Another 5% of patients treated with interferon in our studies developed more 21 
severe psychiatric side effects including paranoia, delusional thinking and marked anxiety. We have 22 
found this side effect largely in patients with pre -existing  psychiatric or neurological problems6. 23 
These side effects reverse within one to two weeks after discontinuing interferon therapy.  24 
 25 
Seizures  may occur in patients receiving alpha interferon. These have been described as  grand mal 26 
seizures that were self -limited and stopped once interferon was discontinued. We have reported that 27 
there is a 1 -2% incidence of seizures during interferon therapy. These seizures occurred near the end 28 
of therapy and did not recur. Several patients were hospitalized for the seizure s and evaluated; no 29 
abnormalities were detected on neurological examination or imaging studies, and none are currently 30 
receiving anti -epileptic medication.  31 
 32 
Neuropsychiatric:  Life-threatening or fatal neuropsychiatric reactions may manifest in all patients  33 
receiving therapy with interferon and may include suicide, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, 34 
relapse of drug addiction, and drug overdose. These adverse effects occur in <1% of treated subjects. 35 
These reactions may occur in patients with and without previous psychiatric illness.  36 
 28 
  1 
Autoimmune phenomena: Development or exacerbation of autoimmune disorders including 2 
myositis, hepatitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, 3 
psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, interstitia l nephritis, thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus 4 
have been reported in patients receiving alpha interferon.  These occur in less than 1% of patients.   5 
 6 
RISK /DISCOMFORTS  IN RELATION TO BENEFIT  7 
 8 
Protection against risks  9 
The risks of study medication regimen administration can be generalized into 3 areas, teratogenicity, 10 
changes in hematological parameters, and non -specific side effects.  To protect subjects from 11 
teratogenicity, pregnancy tests will be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2  months, then every 12 
month thereafter. Additionally, wome n should practice 2 forms of contraception.  CBC’s will be 13 
performed every 2 weeks to monitor for hematologic changes, and symptoms or side effects will be 14 
monitored at every visit, which may result i n a study medication regimen dose modification.  Another  15 
major risk to subjects who agree to participate in this study is the risk of undergoing 2 liver biopsies 16 
(as outlined in Risks and hazards #3 ). Since a major endpoint of the study is to understand ho w 17 
peginterferon may lead to HBeAg or HBsAg loss, the timing of the biopsies were chosen to maximize 18 
our ability to demonstrate changes in interferon stimulated genes in the liver -up to 12 weeks before  19 
and 6 hours after the first dose of peginterferon. Know ledge gained from this analysis may inform on 20 
how best to use peginterferon in patients with chronic hepatitis B and identify new approaches to 21 
induce HBeAg and HBsAg loss -highly desirable endpoints that may permit cessation of treatment.  22 
 23 
Potential benef its 24 
For patients with chronic hepatitis B, the strategy of add -on peginterferon offers a potential benefit 25 
of loss of either HBeAg or HBsAg or both with the possibility of discontinuing all therapy and removal 26 
of the risks associated with long term nucleoside analogue use -predominantly renal toxicity and 27 
bone loss with tenofovir and cancer risk with entecavir.  Thus, there is a prospect of overall clinical 28 
benefit from participation in this study.   29 
 30 
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  31 
 32 
The adequacy of data acquisition and storage of samples and the monitoring of safety in this trial will 33 
be performed by the principal investigator in collaboration with the associate investigators. Data and 34 
safety are reviewed weekly in clinical research rounds by the Liver Diseases Branc h, NIDDK.  These 35 
rounds are separate from regular clinical rounds and consist of review of all study patients including 36 
 29 
flow sheets of major safety and efficacy measurements without knowledge of which therapy is used.  1 
Monitoring of this study will also be  conducted by the statistical department of NIDDK who will have 2 
knowledge of the patient allocation. Reports of serious adverse events are made to the Clinical 3 
Director NIDDK, and the IRB as outlined below.   4 
 5 
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  6 
 7 
Definitions  8 
 9 
Protocol  Deviation : Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved research protocol .  10 
Unanticipated Problem: Any incident, experience or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  11 
 1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) given (a) the research procedures 12 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB approved research protocol 13 
and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied.  14 
 2. Related or  possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there 15 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by the 16 
procedures involved in the research); and  17 
 3. Suggests that the research place s subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 18 
physical, psychological, economic or social harm) than was previously known or recognized).  19 
Expected Adverse Events become unanticipated problems when they occur at a greater frequency or 20 
severity t han was previously known.  21 
 22 
Adverse events, protocol deviations, unanticipated problems (UP), Unanticipated Adverse Device 23 
Effects (UADEs), serious adverse events, sponsor and serious, are defined as described in NIH HRPP 24 
SOP 16 (“Reporting Requirements for Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events and Protocol 25 
Deviations.”).  All adverse events at least possibly related to the patient’s participation in the 26 
research protocol, including those observed by or reported to the research team, will be  recorded.  27 
Serious unanticipated problems and serious protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB and CD 28 
as soon as possible but not more than 7 days after the PI first learns of the event.  Not serious 29 
unanticipated problems will be reported to the I RB and CD as soon as possible but not more than 14 30 
days after the PI first learns of the event.  31 
 32 
Non -serious protocol deviations will only be reported to the IRB (within 14 days after the PI first 33 
learns of the event) if they represent a departure from NIH  policies for the conduct of human subjects 34 
research, adversely affect the health care of the subject(s) or compromise the interpretation or 35 
integrity of the research.  Non -serious protocol deviations that result from normal subject scheduling 36 
 30 
variations o r technical issues as sociated with sampling that do  not impact the health of the subject or 1 
the interpretation of the study data will not be reported.  2 
 3 
Adverse events that are expected as a part of treatment or procedures outlined in the protocol will 4 
not be reported unless they occur at a rate or severity greater than known to occur in patients 5 
undergoing the treatment or procedures. If AEs associated with the treatment and procedures in the 6 
study occur at a rate or severity greater than known to occur, th ey will be reclassified as a UP and 7 
reported as such. AEs with known relation to the natural history of chronic hepatitis B or to other 8 
pre-existing conditions will not be reported unless they occur at a rate or severity greater than 9 
known to occur in pati ents with hepatitis B or the subject’s other pre -existing conditions. AEs that 10 
are unrelated to the research will not be reported. The PI is responsible for summarizing all 11 
reportable serious adverse events and adverse events at least possibly related at the time of 12 
Continuing Review. Deaths  will be reported to the Clinical Director and IRB within 7 days after the PI 13 
first learns of the event.  14 
 15 
 16 
 17 
 18 
 PROTOCOL  MONITORING PLAN  19 
 20 
Study procedures will be subject to audits and/or monitoring visits to ensure compliance 21 
with the protocol and applicable regulatory requirements consistent with the Liver 22 
Diseases Branch quality assurance program plan.  Audit and/or monitoring visits results 23 
will be reported to the Principal Investigator for further reporting as ap propriate.  Study 24 
documents and pertinent hospital or clinical records will be reviewed to verify that the 25 
conduct of the study is consistent with the protocol plan . 26 
 27 
ENROLLMENT OF CHILDREN, WOMEN AND MINORITY INDIVIDUALS  28 
 29 
The current protocol excludes chi ldren (age limit > 18 years) as the Liver Diseases Branch does not 30 
currently treat children. The number of children on long -term nuclos(t)ide analogue therapy would 31 
expected to be  small and the requirement for two liver biopsies may be prohibitive.  32 
 31 
Chronic  HBV infection  is about twice as common among men than women.  We expect to include 1 
women in the proportions that occur in this disease.  Thus, we expect 30% to 40% of patients to be 2 
women.  The exclusion of women interested in getting pregnant or who are not able to practice 3 
adequate birth control would be the only possible bias introduced in attaining adequate 4 
representation of women in this study.    5 
The distribution of minority individuals in our ongoing  hepatitis B study (07 -DK-0207) are as 6 
follows: 73 % of subjects were considered minorities, 82% of whom were Asian  and 14% African - 7 
American based on self -reported race and ethnicity and NIH, HHS guidelines for defining minority 8 
race. Thus, we believe minority individuals will be adequately represented in this study.  9 
 10 
Additional Potentially Vulnerable Subject Populations  11 
This study does not plan to accrue subjects who are prisoners nor adults who are or may be unable 12 
to provide consent. These populations are excluded as this is a more than minimal risk study due to 13 
the requirement for two liver biopsies. NIH employees are not categorically recruited, but in the 14 
event that an eligible subject presents who happens to be an NIH employee, we will follow the 15 
guidelines outlined in the inclusion of employees i n NIH intramural research studies.  16 
RESEARCH USE, STORAGE AND DISPOSITION OF HUMAN SAMPLES AND DATA  17 
 18 
Patients will have serum stored from selected time points during this study.  These specimens will be 19 
used for repeat virological testing and special tests as needed (such as for viral levels, or 20 
measurement of serum levels of cytokines or interferon induced genes).  Samples may be used to 21 
assess factors associated with response or non -response to antiviral therapy.  Liver biopsy tissue 22 
may be stored if  residual tissue is available after samples are taken for routine histo logical staining 23 
and evaluation, ISG determination  and immunological testing .  ISG and immunological determination  24 
will be evaluated in the Liver Diseases Branch and the routine histolo gical evaluation by the surgical 25 
pathology services of the Clinical Center. Patient  participation in this study will be kept confidential.  26 
No one other than study personnel at the clinic will be given the subject’s  name, address, and other 27 
personal identi fying information. Some study -related forms such as the consent form will be kept in 28 
the medical record and have subject name and other personal identifying information on it. Other 29 
research forms such as study diaries and flowsheets will also contain subj ect name and personal 30 
identifying information. These records will be kept in locked files or computers that are password 31 
protected. Liver tissue samples will be stored in the pathology department and will have personal 32 
identifying information on it. Howeve r, other study material such as blood samples will be labeled 33 
with only an identifying number and code. Any study material that may be shared with investigators 34 
outside the NIH will not contain any personal identifying information. Only the study personnel  at 35 
 32 
the Liver Diseases Branch, Clinical Center can link your name or other personal identifiers to this 1 
code. We plan to collaborate  with Dr. Gavin Cloherty, Abbott Diagnostics, to obtain  the quantitative 2 
HBsAg testing , specified as a secondary aim of this  study. Dr. Cloherty will receive ten to eleven 250 3 
ul aliquots of sera from each subject for quantitative HBsAg testing. The results will be used for 4 
research and as part of a planned publication.  5 
 6 
Research records and data as well as liver biopsy slides,  biopsy reports, liver tissue and sera with the 7 
patient’s name and a unique identifier will be stored indefinitely in our locked offices and freezers, 8 
the medical record department and the pathology department.  These materials will be protected and 9 
tracke d by standard operating procedures in the medical record and pathology departments as well 10 
as a compulsive filing system in our locked offices and freezers.  There will be redundant storage of 11 
clinical information in the medical record department and our o ffices. Likewise, there will be 12 
redundant storage of biopsy information and materials in the pathology department and our offices.  13 
This should minimize the risk of loss or destruction of information and specimens. If that were to 14 
occur we would report it to the IRB.  We do not plan to destroy this personal medical information or 15 
the liver biopsy specimens or research subject sera after completion of the study because it may be 16 
critically important for physicians (here or elsewhere) to have access them when  caring for these 17 
patients in the future.  18 
 19 
RECRUITMENT PLAN  20 
 21 
Potentially eligible HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative subjects evaluated under protocol 91 -DK- 22 
0214 and 07 -DK-0207 will be informed of this tr ial and offered enrol lment in this study.  It is 23 
anticipated that the majority of subjects (~85%) will be recruited from within the Liver Diseases 24 
Branch Outpatient Clinic. For the remaining subjects, we will plan to send a recruitment letter to area 25 
Internists and Gastroentero logists to refer suitable candidates for the trial. Finally, we will advertise 26 
through the NIH patient recruitment office. All recruitment material will be submitted to the IRB 27 
review prior to dissemination.   28 
 29 
PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  30 
Potentially eligi ble subjects will be identified through their enrolment in 91 -DK-0214  and 07 -DK- 31 
0207  and will be informed of this study at the time of a scheduled visit or by phone to notify them of 32 
their potential eligibility.  Subjects will discuss protocol eligibility with the principal investigator or 33 
an associate investigator, and associate investigators  will continue to be involved in research 34 
activities throughout subjects’ participation in this study. Information collected about subjects will be 35 
obtained through routine clinical interactions including documentation in the subjects’ medical 36 
 33 
charts and t hrough questionnaire completion, patient diaries and telephone calls. We will verbally 1 
verify with subjects their partner’s compliance with subject reported reproductive contraception use, 2 
but this information will not be documented in the subjects’ medica l charts as these individuals are 3 
not considered subjects under this study.  The information collected from subjects is primarily 4 
required to manage the subjects’ clinical care under the current study.  Data collected for research 5 
only is the minimal infor mation required to complete analysis for primary and secondary aims.  6 
 7 
 8 
CONSENT PROCESS  9 
 10 
Potential study subjects will be informed of study rationale, design, participation burden, risks, 11 
benefits and side effects of therapy during routine LDB clinic visits  and will have an opportunity to 12 
ask questions about the proposed study. They will be provided a copy of the study consent form to 13 
take home and review in more detail. .  Consent will be obtained by the Principal Investigator, or an 14 
Associate Investigator following the subject’s review of the provided consent documentation during a 15 
subsequent clinic visit. If a subject indicates a desire to participate in the research study, he/she will 16 
have all screening laboratories, radiologic imaging and if necessary, l iver biopsy, performed through 17 
this protocol . The initial liver and second liver biopsy for participation in this study will be for 18 
research purposes. Patients who refuse either  liver biopsy will be excluded from further 19 
participation in the study, since one of the primary endpoint s of the trial is based on analysis of 20 
change in ISG levels comparing the second to the first liver biopsy. Potential study subjects who meet 21 
study inclusion and exclusion criteria will sign the consent form to participate in this  study during a 22 
scheduled LDB clinic visit prior to screening .   23 
 24 
We do not plan to enroll non -English speaking subjects; however they are not excluded from 25 
participation either.  Should a non -English speaking subject be enrolled, IRB approval will be 26 
obta ined to use the short form process in the absence of a fully translated consent 27 
document.  Requests for IRB approval will be obtained prior to implementing the short form consent 28 
process.  The short form consent process will be incompliance with SOP 12.9.1  and 45 CFR 29 
46.117(b)(2).  30 
 31 
COMPENSATION  32 
 33 
 34 
Patients enrolled in this trial will not be offered compensation since they will be receiving study 1 
medications and all required monitoring at no personal cost. In addition patients stand to derive 2 
clinical benefit from participation in the study.  3

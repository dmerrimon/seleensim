Disease whil e receiving Proton Pump Inhibitors 
Study Centers: Approximately 100 centers in the United States and Canada 
Development Phase:  3 
Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IW -3718 
administered to patients with GERD who continue to have persistent symptoms, such as 
heartburn and regurgitation, while receiving once -daily (QD), standard -dose proton pump 
inhib itors ( PPIs). 
Methodology: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -
group, 8-week study, consisting of 4 distinct periods as illustrated in the figure below. The 
study will enroll patients who have GERD and continue to experience GERD symptoms while 
receiving QD, standard -dose PPI therapy. Eligible patients will continue to take their PPI and 
will be randomized to placebo or to 1500 mg IW-3718 BID.

Confidential  Pa ge 3 of 106 Screening Period:  The Screening Period star ts with the signature of the informed consent form 
(ICF) and may last for up to 35 days. During this period, patients’  eligibility for entry into the 
Pretreatment Period will be determined. Two procedures will be required during the Screening 
Period in all patients (all will be done while patients continue to take their PPI):  
• An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)  
• Up to 96 hours of pH testing with the Bravo™ device, a capsule- based pH monitor 
implanted above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) 
The patient must have been adherent to their standard PPI dosage regimen  (as per product 
label)  for the 8 weeks  prior to the Screening Visit and during the entire Scre ening Period. 
Histamine -2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) should be stopped at least 5 days prior to the EGD 
and Bravo pH monitoring; antacids should be stopped at least 1 day prior to the EGD and Bravo pH monitoring. The EGD must be performed during the Screening Period and should be 
performed  at least 7 days before the start of the Pretreatment Period to allow time for pH 
collection and allow the patient to stabilize following these procedures. Upon completion of 
the Bravo testing, patients will continue to refrain from using H2RAs, but may use antacids if needed until 1 day prior to entering the Pretreatment Period. The end of the Screening Period 
coincides with the start of the Pretreatment Period.  
Pretreatment Period:  The Pretreatment Period is  defined as the 14 to 21 days immediately 
before the Randomization Visit. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria, including pH 
requirements as per the central pH read, will continue into the Pretreatment Period. During this 
period, patients will continue to use their PPI and will refrain from using other anti-reflux 
medications, including antacids and H2RAs, except for the liquid antacid that is dispensed as 
rescue medicine  (aluminum hydroxide / magnesium hydroxide). Patients will provide the 
following daily and weekly symptom assessments using a handheld electronic diary (eDiary):  
Daily Assessments 
• GERD symptoms, recorded in the evening before going to bed, using the modified Reflux 
Symptom Questionnaire Electronic Diary (mRESQ- eD; Appendix 1) 
• Use of per -protocol rescue medicine, recorded in the evening before going to bed  
• Sleep disturbance due to GERD symptoms, recorded upon getting up in the morning (Appendix 2) 
Weekly Assessments  
• Degree of relief of GERD symptoms ( Appendix 3) 
• GERD symptom bothersomeness ( Appendix 3) 
Patients will be required to complete the daily assessments for at least 5 days each week 
during the last 14 days before the Randomization Visi t and the weekly assessments at least 
once during the last 7 days before the Randomization Visit to be eligible for randomization.

Confidential  Pa ge 4 of 106 Patients will be instructed to take their PPI approximately 30 -60 minutes before breakfast each 
day, even on study visit days . Patients who satisfy the entry criteria will enter the Treatment 
Period.  
Treatment Period:  The Treatment Period begins with treatment assignment and lasts for 
8 weeks. Patients will be stratified by whether they have, or do not have, erosive esophagitis 
on the screening EGD and their baseline weekly heartburn severity score (WHSS , defined as 
the average heartburn severity score over the last 7 days prior to randomization of <3 vs. ≥ 3; 
see Criteria for Evaluation , below ) and randomly assigned within each stratum to placebo or 
1500- mg IW -3718 BID (1:1). The treatment randomization schedule will be managed by a 
central vendor. Enrollment will be monitored to ensure that no single center contributes > 10% 
of the targeted study enrollment, unless otherwise approved by the Medical Monitor. Study 
drug will be taken immediately after the morning and evening meals. Patients wi ll continue to 
take their PPI approximately 30- 60 minutes before breakfast each day and to use the eDiary to 
provide their daily assessments (GERD symptoms and assessment of sleep), weekly 
assessments (degree of relief of GERD symptoms, symptom bothersomeness, and treatment satisfaction questions). At the end of the treatment period study medication will be 
discontinued and patients will return for an End-of- Treatment (EOT) V isit. All p atients who 
have erosive esophagitis (LA classification A -D) on EGD at Screening and completed ≥4 
weeks of treatment will have a repeat EGD at the ir EOT Visit. Patients will also complete all 
End-of- Treatment assessments.  
Study Population:  The study population will consist of adult patients with diagnosed GERD 
who continue to have persistent (also referred to as refractory) symptoms, such as heartburn 
and regurgitation, while receiving QD PPI therapy and have evidence of pathological acid 
reflux during the Screening Period as determined using the Bravo device. Patients will be 
stratified for treatment assignment at the time of randomization based on the presence of erosions (erosions, no erosions) and by baseline WHSS  (<3 vs. ≥3) . The study will aim to 
enroll up to 50% of patients with esophageal erosions. Patients must be receiving PPI therapy for 8 weeks or longer, for which no further adjustments to the patient’s PPI therapy would be beneficial to the patient, per the Investigator’s opinion. PPI dosing must be consistent with 
current labelling. Approximately 550 patients ( 275 patients per treatment arm) will be 
randomized to treatment.

Confidential  Pa ge 10 of 106 Statistical Methods  
Analysis Populations : 
Screened Population  consists of all patients who signed informed consent and received a 
patient identification (PID) number. 
Randomized Population  consists of all patients who were assigned to a treatment group 
(placebo or IW-3718) via randomization. 
Safety Population  consis ts of all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population  consists of all patients who were randomized 
prior to or on 05 June 2020, and who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 
1 postbaseline primary efficacy assessment. This population will be used for the final efficacy 
analysis.  
Sensi tivity Analy sis (SA) Population  consists of all randomized patients who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 postbasel ine primary efficacy assessment.  This 
population will be used for efficacy sensitivity analysis at completion  of the study. 
General Methods  
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, and range). Categorical variables will be summarized using the count and 
proportion of patients in each category. Unless otherwise specified, all confidence intervals 
will be 2-sided and with a confidence level of 95%. Details of the data handling methods will 
be specified in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). Unless otherwise specified , the week prior 
to randomization will be considered the baseline  for efficacy analyses . For safety analys es, the 
baseline value is defined as the last non -missing value measured before administration of 
study treatment. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® Version 9.4 (or later) 
for Windows. 
Primary Ef ficacy Parameter  
Change from baseline at Week 8 in Weekly Heartburn Severity Score  (WHSS) . 
• The WHSS for a week is the average of the non -missing Daily Heartburn Severity 
Scores (DHSS) for that week.  Rules for missingness of data will be prespecified in the 
SAP finalized before database lock . 
• The DHSS for a day is the greater score of the 2 mRESQ items assessing heartburn 
severity ( “Burning feeling behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper st omach” 
and “P ain behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach” ) for that day. 
Where 1 of the 2 mRESQ heartburn severity items is missing for the day, the 
maximum will be the score of the remaining item; where both items are missing for the 
day, the DHSS will be missing.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
1. Change from baseline at Week 8 in Weekly Regurgitation Frequency Score (WRFS) 
• The WRFS for a week is the average of the non -missing Daily Regurgitation 
Frequency Scores (DRFS) for that week.  Rules for missingness of data will be 
prespecified in the SAP finalized before database lock.

frequency (“ Regurgitation [liquid or food moving upwards toward your throat  or 
mouth]” and “An acid or bitter taste in the mouth” ) for that day. 
2. Overall Heartburn Responder: a patient who is a weekly heartburn responder for at least 
4 weeks, including at least 1 of the last 2 weeks (Weeks 7 and 8), during the 8- week 
Treatment Period.  
• A weekly heartburn responder is a patient with a decrease from baseline of ≥ 45% in 
Weekly Heartburn Severity Score (WHSS).  
• Rules for missingness of data will be prespecified in the SAP finalized before database lock. 
3. Proportion of heartburn- free days  during the 8- week Treatment Period.  
• Proportion of heartburn- free days is calculated as the number of heartburn -free 
(DHSS=0) days divided by the number of diary entry days. 
Efficacy Analysis Methods  
Analysis Governance  
An analysis team composed of members from an independent contract research organization (CRO) will be formed to conduct the efficacy analyses for the primary and key secondary efficacy parameters. This independent team will be responsible for reviewing the analysis 
results and, based on prespecified criteria, providing Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
(Ironwood, the Sponsor) with the following recommendations:  
• If the efficacy results for C3718-302 provide a clear signal based on the prespecified 
criteria, the  independent team will make a recommendation either to stop or continue 
companion Phase 3 Study C3718-301. 
• If the results are inconclusive based on the prespecified criteria and cannot support a clear recommendation to stop or continue companion Study C3718-301, the independent team will make a recommendation to unblind the current study, Study 
C3718-302, in order to enable the Sponsor to conduct a full data analysis to determine 
whether to stop or continue companion Phase 3 Study C3718-301. 
This planned ef ficacy analysis is the final efficacy analysis for the study. It will be conducted 
on a database for which relevant data have been cleaned and finalized as of the efficacy cut -off 
date.  A sensitivity efficacy analysis and a final safety analysis will be p erformed on the final 
database once all enrolled patients have completed the study. A separate document (Analysis Charter) will describe the detailed plan for the independent CRO’s analysis plan and 
communications with the Sponsor. 
Analytical Methods  
For analysis of the primary efficacy and first key secondary efficacy parameters, continuous 
parameters ( eg, change from baseline), descriptive statistics (patient number [n], mean, 
standard deviation, median, and range) will be presented for each treatment group. The 
IW-3718 group will be compared with the placebo group by employing a linear mixed- effects 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) framework with week (categorical), treatment group, 
week -by-treatment group and week -by-baseline value interaction s, baseline esophagitis status 
(present vs. not present), and baseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3) as fixed -effect terms and baseline

Confidential  Pa ge 12 of 106 value as a covariate , with patient  as a random effect . An unstructured covariance structure will 
be used. Least -squares mean (LSM) for each treatment group, LSM difference between the 
IW-3718 group and the placebo group and a 95% confidence interval for the difference at 
Week 8, as well as the p -value for comparison versus placebo will be presented . 
For analys is of responder parameters ( ie, responder vs. non- responder), the counts and 
proportions of responders will be calculated for each treatment group. The proportions of 
responders between the IW-3718 group and the placebo group will be compared using a 
Cochr an-Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for baseline esophagitis status (erosive 
esophagitis vs. no erosive esophagitis) and baseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3). The CMH test is the 
primary analysis for responder parameters. The difference in the proportion of responders between the IW -3718 group and the placebo group, as well as the CMH estimate of the odds 
ratio (IW -3718 over placebo) and a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio, will also be 
presented.  
Time-dependent proportion parameters, defined as days the event of interest occurs, divided 
by the number of eD iary entry days within the 8- week Treatment Period (eg , proportion of 
heartburn- free-days), will be analyzed using a Poisson model which is appropriate for count 
data. The analysis includes the treatme nt, the baseline esophagitis status (present vs. not 
present), baseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3) , covariate of baseline proportion of event- free days, with 
the eDiary entry days adjusted in the model. In the case of overdispersion, a negative binomial 
model instea d of Poisson regression will be implemented. Model estimates in difference 
between the rates for IW- 3718 and placebo groups will be calculated with corresponding 95% 
confidence interval and p -value associated with the comparisons to placebo. 
Safety Analysis  
All safety parameters will be analyzed with descriptive statistics. Safety analyses will be 
performed on the Safety Population. The safety parameters will include AEs, clinical 
laboratory evaluations, vital signs, ECGs, and physical examination. F or each safety 
parameter, the last non -missing assessment made before the first dose of study drug will be 
used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter.  
Sample Size Determination  and Controlling for Type I Error 
The sample size  calculations for the primary and key secondary efficacy parameters are based 
on results from patients with evidence of pathological acid reflux ( positive baseline Bravo  
status ) in Study ICP-3718-202, which  had a similar study population as the current study.  
The p rimary efficacy parameter is Change from B aseline at Week 8 in WHSS, and key 
secondary efficacy parameters include:  
• Change from Baseline at Week 8 in WRFS  
• Overall Heartburn Respond er 
• Proportion of Heartburn-free Days during the 8- week Treatment Period  
Using data from patients in Study ICP-3718-202, we derived the estimated results at  end of the 
study  as follows:

The efficacy parameters will be tested sequentially according to the above order at a 2- sided 
significance level of 0.05 so that the overall type I error rate is maintained at 0.05.  
Based on bootstrap simulations, a sample size of 275 patients per group w ill provide 
approximately 96% power to detect a treatment  difference between 1500 -mg IW -3718 (while 
receiving PPIs ) and placebo  (while receiving PPIs)  for the primary efficacy parameter , 
assuming the randomized population in this study is consistent with t he selected population 
from Study ICP-3718-202. Power that is based on simulations  for all type I error controlling 
key efficacy parameters are presented in the table  below. The 2-sample t -test was used for 
continuous parameters and the Chi- square test was used for responder parameter.

a. Site personnel will intera ct with IWRS to register the  patient visit and transition the patient to the next appropriate 
study period.  
b. A physical examination should include the following assessments: general appearance; HEENT; neck; 
ca rdiovascular; respiratory; a bdomen/liver/spleen; musculoskeletal; lymph node s; skin; neurologic; and mental status. 
Breast, genitourinary, and rectal examinations are optional and may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
c. Height will be mea sured only a t the Screening Visit.  
d. During the Screening Period, patients will  washout H2RAs at least 5 days prior, and antacids 1 day prior, to the EGD 
and Bravo testing. Patients may resume antacid use upon completion of the Bravo testing, but must refrain from H2RA use for the remainder of the study. During the Pretreatment Perio d, pa tients will refra in from using a ny a nti-
reflux medications, antacids, and H2RAs, except for the  liquid  antacid that is provided as rescue medication  
(aluminum  hydroxide /  ma gnesium hydroxide) . 
e. All patients will be required to undergo an EGD during the  Screening Period. There should be a minimum of 7 days 
between the EGD and the start of the Pretreatment Period to allow for pH testing and patient stabilization. A repeat 
EGD will be performed a t the Week 8 / EOT Visit for all patients who have completed at least 4 weeks of treatment 
and had erosive esophagitis on  the screening EGD (based on the Los Angeles [LA] classification of esophagitis, see 
Appendix 5 ) as determined by either the site personnel or the central read er.  
f. Up to 96 hours of pH testing with the Bravo device. If for some reason 96 hours of testing is not possible, then 
approximately 48 hours of testing is accept able.  
g. Vita l sign mea surements include oral temperature (°C), respira tory ra te, systolic a nd diastolic BP, a nd pulse. Respiratory rate, BP, and pulse measurements must be obtained after the patient has been seated for at least 5 
minutes.  
h. 12-Lead ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been supine for at least 5 minutes.  
i. Prior medications will be collected at the Screening Visit as follows: all medicines taken by the patient during the 30 
days before the Screening Visit, most recent use of PPIs, H 2RAs, a nd antacids.  Concomitant medication s a nd 
procedures will be collected in the EDC system.  
j. Clinica l la bora tory tests include clinical chemistry, hematology (CBC), coagulation, a nd urinalysis.  If the triglyceride 
value exceeds the protocol -specified criteria and the patient was not under fasted conditions, the patient may return to 
complete a fasted lipid panel.  
k. For all female patients of childbearing potential, a negative urine  or serum  pregnancy test must be performed a nd 
document ed at the Screening Visit, and at the Randomization Visit (before dosing) in order for the patient to be 
randomized into the study. A urine or serum pregnancy test will also be obtained at the Week 4 and EOT Visits. All 
positive urine pregnancy test result s will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  
l. Patients must undergo a urine drug screen for selected drugs of abuse (cocaine, barbiturates, amphetamines, opiates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids , a nd phencyclidine ) and a serum alcohol screen at the Screenin g Visit.  
m. For randomized patients, all AEs will be captured from the time the patient signs the ICF through the Follow -up 
Phone call.  
n. Rescue medicine (a luminum  hydroxide / magnesium  hydroxide)  will be supplied to pa tients a t the Pretreatment Visit, 
and if needed, at subsequent visits.  
o. The eDiary will be dispensed at the Pretreatment Visit . Pa tients must complete daily questions at least 5 days each 
week during the 14 days before the Treatment Period and must complete the weekly questions at least once during  the 
7 days before the Treatment Period in order to be eligible for randomization. Patients should bring their eDiary to 
each visit. The eDiary will be used for daily assessments (PPI administration, mRESQ -eD, dyspepsia symptoms, 
sleep disturbance, and rescue medication use), and weekly assessments (degree of relief, symptom bothersomeness, 
symptom relief, treatment satisfaction, and questionnaires).  
p. The first dose of study medication will be administered in the clinic with liquid and a snack at the Random ization 
Visit. At a ll other visits, pa tients will ta ke study medication prior to a rriving a t the clinic but will be dispensed 
additional doses needed until the next study visit.  
q. Treatment adherence with study drug will be assessed based on return of unused  tablets.  
r. Study site will contact each patient via telephone 7 days after the EOT Visit to collect information pertaining to ongoing AEs/SAEs/concomitant medications /concomitant therapies,  and information concerning any new AEs/SAEs 
/concomitant medications /concomitant therapies  since the EOT Visit.

1.1 BILE ACIDS AND GERD 
Bile acids play an important role in the digestive process; however, data from nonclinical and 
mechanistic studies suggest that the prolonged presence or excess of bile acids in the stomach 
and esophagus can result in toxic effects on regional tissues.( 1-4) Duodenogastroesophageal 
reflux (DGER), which contains bile acids, is thought to produce symptoms such as retrosternal 
pain, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting,( 5, 6) and is associated with more severe esophageal 
pathology in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett’s esophagus , a 
precancerous change in the esophagus.( 4, 7) 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a chronic and common medical disorder with a prevalence 
estimated at approximately 20% to 40% in Western countries.( 8) A recent survey using the NIH 
PROMIS® GERD scale found that half of the North American general population reported 
heartburn symptoms in the last week, and one-third reported regurgitation symptoms in the last 
week. (9) GER D is associated with rising healthcare utilization and cost .(10) Currently, proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the standard of care for GERD; however, it is estimated that 
approximately 10% to 40% of GERD patients remain symptomatic on standard -dose PPI 
therapy.( 11) DGER is hypothesized to be a potential cause of incomplete symptom response in 
patients who continue to experience bothersome GERD symptoms despite treatment with PPIs. (12) 
There is significant evidence to support DGER as a putative mechanism for persistent GERD 
(also referred to as refractory GERD)  symptoms. Pathological bile acid reflux occurs in 
approximately 65% of patients who continue to experience bothersome GERD symptoms despite 
treatment with PPIs and is hypothesized to be a cause of their incomplete symptom response.(12) 
There is considerable clinical and nonclinical evidence that bile acid can cause esophageal damage both in conjunction with stomach acid as well as independently.( 2, 5) 
In this study we require all patients to have acid reflux as confirmed by the Brav o™ reflux 
testing system, whereby a capsule that measures pH is inserted into the patient’s esophagus at the time of the patient’s screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ). Using this criterion will

1.2 IW-3718 
Ironwood is developing IW-3718 as an adjunct to PPI therapy for treatment of pe rsistent GERD  
(also r eferred to as refractory GERD)  in patients whose heartburn and regurgitation symptoms 
are not resolved with PPI therapy alone . IW-3718 is a sustained -release engineered form of 
colesevelam hydrochloride (henceforth referred to as colesev elam), a bile acid sequestrant.  
IW-3718 tablets are formulated as a n extended -release, solid, oral -dosage form intended to 
extend the release of colesevelam into the stomach. As a result of the sustained release, 
colesevelam binds to the bile acids that are refluxed into the stomach and upper duodenum, 
forming a bile acid -colesevelam complex and preventing the free bile acids from entering the 
esophagus. Subsequently the bile acid- colesevelam complex will travel down the GI tract and be 
excreted without being absorbed. 
The extended -release formulation in IW -3718 tablets is based on Assertio’s Acuform® 
technology which utilizes swelling polymers to allow the tablet to be retained in the stomach for 
up to approximately 9 hours when dosed in the fed state, during which time the t ablet slowly 
releases the active ingredient in the stomach and upper GI tract. The tablet’s active ingredient is steadily released in the stomach and upper GI tract in a near zero -order manner. It’s theorized 
that the resulting sustained levels of coleseve lam in the stomach will prevent bile acids from 
refluxing into the esophagus. The Acuform technology is well- characterized, and currently 
utilized in several Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved drugs  such as Glumetza
® 
(metformin HCl, extended release), Proquin® XR (ciprofloxacin HCl monohydrate, extended 
release), and Gralise™ once- daily (gabapentin) tablets. 
Colesevelam is an orally administered, non -absorbed, non- digestible polymer that binds bile 
acids in the GI tra ct. Colesevelam was initially approved in 2000 in the United States (US) as the 
active ingredient in Welchol™ and indicated 1) as an adjunct to diet and exercise for reduction 
of elevated low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) in adults with primary hyperlipidemia 
(as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy), 2) to reduce LDL- C levels in boys and 
postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as

Confidential  Pa ge 28 of 106 monotherapy or in combination with a statin after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy, and 3) 
to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Colesevelam is currently 
available as an immediate-release formulation only for these indications. Colesevelam has  also 
been approved for us e in the EU as Cholestagel® (2004) and in Canada as Lodalis™ (2011). 
Colesevelam is not systemically absorbed and does not interfere with systemic drug metabolizing 
enzymes. Distribution of colesevelam is limited to the GI tract and elimination occurs through fecal excretion. The mechanism by which colesevelam is expected to reduce symptoms in GERD 
is by binding bile acids that are refluxed into the stomach and preventing the free bile acids from 
entering the esophagus and reacting with the esophageal mucos a. 
Apart from the IW -3718 development program, there are no reported clinical efficacy studies 
with colesevelam in patients with GERD, or other upper GI disorders. 
Colesevelam  (as Welchol) has been evaluated for safety in clinical studies and via post -
marketing pharmacovigilance. In general, colesevelam was safe and well -tolerated in adults with 
hyperlipidemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and in adolescents with familial 
hypercholesterolemia. Due to the large doses required for lipid lowering, and its local effects in 
the GI tract, most of the adverse events (AEs) related to colesevelam are GI in nature (constipation, flatulence, and dyspepsia). Most of these AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. 
In clinical lipid -lowering studies, the incidence of dyspepsia was greater at the higher doses (3.8 
and 4.5 g/day). 
1.3 IW-3718 CLINICAL TRIALS IN GERD PATIENTS  
IW-3718 has been evaluated in 2 clinical trials in patients with continuing GE RD symptoms 
despite their PPI treatment.  
ICP-3718-201 was a 4 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, proof -of-concept, 
Phase 2a study in patients with GERD not completely responsive to QD PPI therapy. In this 
study patients were randomized in  a 1:1 fashion to either IW-3718 1000 mg bid or placebo. 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and pH monitoring were not required, but results were collected if these procedures were performed prior to randomization or in the recent past. Symptoms were

Confidential  Pa ge 29 of 106 assessed over  the four -week period to determine severity of heartburn-related symptoms. A 
BilitecTM device was used as an optional procedure for measuring bile reflux. 
Safety and efficacy data are available for 93 patients, 46 of whom received 1000 mg IW-3718 
BID. IW -3718 was well tolerated among patients with GERD. There were no deaths or study 
medication -related serious adverse events (SAEs). Common TEAEs (>5% of patients) among 
patients who received IW 3718 or placebo included constipation (13% vs 0%) and abdominal pain (7% vs 2%).  
In this study, among all patients (Intent -to-treat [ITT] Population), severity of daytime heartburn 
showed a trend toward being numerically reduced in IW -3718 patients compared to placebo 
(p=0.124). The largest differences between IW-3718 and placebo for this parameter were seen in 
patients who underwent Bilitec monitoring. Improvements were also observed for nighttime 
heartburn severity at Week 4. A greater percentage of IW -3718- treated patients (9 patients, 
19.6%) reported an absence of heartburn during Week 4 compared with those receiving placebo (5 patients, 10.6%). 
ICP-3718-202 was an 8 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, dose -ranging, 
Phase 2b study in patients with continued GERD symptoms despite ongoing per- label QD P PI 
therapy. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 fashion to receive either IW- 3718 500 mg,  
1000 mg, or 1500 mg, or placebo twice daily while continuing their per- label QD PPI therapy. 
EGD and approximately 48 to 96 hours of pH monitoring (using the Bravo device) were required 
at Screening. Patients who either had significant acid regurgitation (pH<4 for ≥4.2 % of a 24-
hour period) or esophageal erosion noted during the EGD were eligible for randomization. Randomization to double -blind treatment was strati fied by whether patients had, or did not have, 
erosive esophagitis on the screening EGD. Bilitec monitoring of bilirubin levels was optional for all patients at selected sites.  
Patients who completed screening entered the 14 - to 21- day Pretreatment Period to promote 
patient familiarity and compliance with study procedures and to establish baseline patient -
reported outcomes for the assessment of efficacy following treatment. Patients were instructed to 
take their PPI approximately 30-60 minutes before breakf ast each day, even on study visit days. 
GERD symptoms were assessed daily using a modified version of the Reflux Symptom

during the Pretreatment Period entered the 8-week Treatment Period. The primary endpoint was 
percent change from baseline to Week 8 in 6 -point heartburn severity score (0=none, 5=severe). 
Secondary endpoints included percent change from baseline in heartburn severity score and 5-point regurgitation frequency score (0=never, 4=very often) by week, and overall heartburn 
responders and overall regurgitation responders. Responder criteria required at least a 30% decrease from baseline in weekly heartburn score (or regurgitation score) for at least 4 of 8 
treatment weeks, including ≥1 of the 2 final weeks. 
A total of 282 patient were randomized. The modified ITT P opulation included 280 patients (68-
71 patients per treatment arm), approximately half (52%) of whom had EGD confirmation of 
erosive esophagitis ( EE) at baseline  (52%). Demographics and baseline characteristics were 
generally similar across the treatment groups. For the primary endpoint, dose- dependent 
improvements were observed in Week -8 heartburn severity scores; percent changes from 
baseline  were  -46.0, -49.0, - 55.1, and -58.0 for the placebo, IW-3718 500 mg , 1000 mg , and 
1500 mg treatment groups, respectively (dose -response test nominal p-value = 0.02). T he 
treatment difference for the IW-3718 1500 mg group compared with placebo was - 11.9 ( nominal 
p-value = 0.04). Week- 8 percent  change from baseline in regurgitation frequency score was 
significantly better for the IW-3718 1500 mg group (-55.4) compared with placebo ( -37.9) 
(difference -17.5; nominal  p-value = 0.01). Numerical gains we re seen at each week of treatment 
starting at Week 2 for heartburn severity for the IW-3718 1500 mg group versus placebo. G reater 
weekly improvements were seen at this dose in EE patients. Overall responder rates for 
heartburn and regurgitation were 52.9% and 46.3% for the IW-3718 1500 mg group compared 
with 37.1% and 34.3% for the placebo group, respec tively; greater improvements compared with 
placebo  were seen in EE patients ( Table  1). Note that although a 30% reduction was defined in 
the protocol as being the criterion for a weekly improvement in WHSS and WRFS, pre- and 
post-hoc pooled anchor- based analys es suggested that a 45% reduction is better at defining a 
clinically significant response  to treatment .

Confidential  Pa ge 35 of 106 Screening Period:   The Screening Period starts with the signature of the informed consent form 
(ICF) and may last for up to 35 days. During this period, patient eligibility for entry into the 
Pretreatment Period will be determined. Two procedures wi ll be required during the Screening 
Period in all patients (all will be done while patients continue to take their PPI):  
• An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)  
• Up to 96 hours of pH testing with the Bravo device, a capsule-based pH monitor implanted 
above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)  
The patient must have been adherent to their standard PPI dosage regimen (as per product label) 
for the 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit and during the entire Screening Period. Histamine-2 
receptor antagonists (H2RAs ) should be stopped at least 5 days prior to the EGD and Bravo pH 
monitoring; antacids should be stopped at least 1 day prior to the EGD and Bravo pH 
monitoring. The EGD must be performed during the Screening Period and should be performed at least 7 days before the start of the Pretreatment Period to allow time for pH collection and 
allow the patient to stabilize following these procedures. Upon completion of the Bravo testing, patients will continue to refrain from using H2RAs, but may use antacids if needed until 1 day 
prior to entering the Pretreatment Period. The end of the Screening Period coincides with the 
start of the Pretreatment Period.  
Pretreatment Period:   The Pretreatment Period is defined as the 14 to 21 days immediately 
before the Randomizati on Visit. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria, including pH 
requirements as per the central pH read, will continue into the Pretreatment Period. During this 
period, patients will continue to use their PPI and will refrain from using other anti- reflux 
medications, including antacids and H2RAs, except for the liquid antacid that is dispensed as 
rescue medicine  (aluminum hydroxide / magnesium hydroxide ). Patients will provide the 
following daily and weekly symptom assessments using a handheld electronic diary (eDiary):  
Daily Assessments 
• GERD symptoms, recorded in the evening before going to bed , using the modified Reflux 
Symptom Questionnaire Electronic Diary (mRESQ- eD; Appendix 1) 
• Use of per -protocol rescue medicine, recorded in the evening before going to bed  
• Sleep disturbance due to GERD symptoms, recorded upon getting up in the morning

Confidential  Pa ge 36 of 106 Weekly Assessments  
• Degree of relief of GERD  symptoms ( Appendix 3) 
• GERD symptom bothersomeness ( Appendix 3) 
Patients will be required to complete the daily assessments for at least 5 days each week during 
the last 14  days before the Randomization Visit and the weekly assessments at least once during 
the last 7 days before the Randomization Visit in order to be eligible for randomization. 
Patients will be instructed to take their PPI approximately 30- 60 minutes before breakfast each 
day, even on study visit days. Patients who satisfy the entry criteria  will enter the Treatment 
Period.  
Treatment Period:   The Treatment Period begins with treatment assignment and lasts for 
8 weeks. Patients will be stratified by whether they have, or do not have, EE on the screening 
EGD , and by their baseline weekly heartb urn severity score (WHSS, defined as the average 
heartburn severity score over the last 7 days prior to randomization of <3  vs. ≥3; see Section 
3.5.7.1) and randomly assigned within each stratum to placebo or 1500- mg IW -3718 BID (1:1). 
Dose reductions are not permitted. The treatment randomization schedule will be managed by a 
central vendor . Enrollment will be monitored to ensure that no single center contributes > 10% of 
the targeted study enrollment, unless otherwise approved by the Medical Monitor. Study drug 
will be taken immediately after the morning and evening meals. Patients will con tinue to take 
their PPI approximately 30-60 minutes before breakfast each day and to use the eDiary to provide their daily assessments (GERD symptoms, assessment of sleep disturbance), weekly assessments (degree of relief of GERD symptoms, symptom bothersomeness, and treatment 
satisfaction questions). At the end of the treatment period study medication will be discontinued 
and patients will return for an End-of- Treatment visit. A repeat EGD will be performed at the 
Week 8/EOT Visit for all patients who have completed at least 4  weeks of treatment and had  
erosive esophagitis on the screening EGD (based on the Los Angeles [LA] classification of 
esophagitis, see  Appendix 5) as determined by either the site personnel or the central reader.
 
Patients will also complete all End-of- Treatment assessments.

CONTROL GROUPS  
A double- blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multicenter  study design was chosen in 
accordance with the concepts in International Conference on Harmonisation ICH) E10, Choice 
of Control Groups and Related Issues in Clinical Trials (International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, 
2001), to provide comparable treatment groups and minimal chance of selection or Investigator bias.  
This study has a 14- to 21- day Pretreatment Period to establish a baseline without test therapy 
and to familiarize patients with data collection methodology ( ie, personal digital assistants 
[PDAs]), and an 8 -week Treatment Period to compare the test treatment with a placebo control.  
3.3 SELECTI ON OF STUDY POPULATION 
The study population will consist of adult patients with diagnosed GERD whose heartburn and 
regurgitation symptoms are not resolved with once-daily (QD) PPI therapy alone and have 
evidence of acid reflux during the Screening Period as determined using the Bravo device. 
Patients will be stratified for treatment assignment at the time of randomization based on the 
presence of esophageal erosions (erosions, no erosions) and by baseline WHSS (<3  vs. ≥ 3). The 
study will aim to enroll up to  50% of patients with esophageal erosions . Patients must be 
receiving PPI therapy for 8 weeks or longer, for which no further adjustments to the patient’s PPI 
therapy would be beneficial to the patient, per the Investigator’s opinion. PPI dosing must be consistent with current labelling. Approximately 550 patients  (275 patients per treatment arm)  
will be randomized to treatment.

Confidential  Pa ge 42 of 106 A patient will be considered to have completed the study  after receiving 8 weeks of treatment 
and completing the End -of-treatment (EOT) Visit at Day 57. A window of +3 days will be 
allowed for the EOT visit; if a patient completes the EOT Visit prior to Day 57, this will be 
considered a protocol deviation. 
Patients will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any 
reason. The Investigator may remove a patient from the study if, in the Investigator’s opinion, it 
is not in the best interest of the patient to continue the study. Patients may also be discontinued 
from the study by the Investigator or the Sponsor at any time for any reason, including the 
following: 
• Adverse event(s)  
• Non- compliance with study drug 
• Protocol violation 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Symptomatic deterioration  
• Lost to follow -up  
(Note: e very effort must be made to contact the patient; a certified letter must be sent .) 
• Study termination by the Sponsor 
• Physician decision  
• Randomized in error  
• Other reasons  
 
The date the patient is withdrawn from the study and the reason for discontinuation will be 
recorded on the study termination form of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Randomized patients who discontinue from the study for any reason should complete the assessments required 
at the EOT Visit at the time of their discontinuation. Study centers should make a reasonable 
effort to follow any pregnant patients until delivery or end of the pregnancy.

hours?” 
 
3.4.1.4 Treatment Adherence 
Patie nts will be dispensed the appropriate number of Sponsor- packaged, labeled bottles 
containing 210 tablet s needed until the next study visit (see Section 3.6). Patients will be asked to 
return all bottles (including unused tablets) at each study visit for assessment of compliance with 
the dosing regimen. 
Patients will record their PPI administration each day (once daily) in their eDiary.  
3.4.2 Packaging and Labeling 
Study medication (IW -3718 and placebo tablets) will be provided by Ironwood as 210-count 
bottles. Study medication will be uniquely numbered and labeled in a double-blind fashion that 
conforms to regulatory requirements. 
3.4.3 Storage and Stability 
IW-3718 tablets and matching placebo will be shipped at controlled room temperature between 
15°C and 25°C (59°F and 77°F)  and must be stored at room temperature between 20°C and 25°C 
(68°F and 77°F); excursions are permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).  
Any deviation from these storage conditions must be reported to Ironwood and use of the study 
medication suspended until authorization for its continued use has been provided by Ironwood. 
The Investigator must ensure that the receipt and use of all study medication supplied is recorded 
and must supervise the storage and allocation of these supplies. All study medication supplies must be retained in a locked  room that may only be accessed by the Investigator, or other duly 
designated persons. Study medication must not be used outside the context of this protocol, and under no circumstances should the Investigator or study center personnel allow the supplies t o be 
used other than as directed by this protocol without prior authorization from Ironwood. 
Antacid rescue medicine (aluminum  hydroxide /  magnesium hydroxide  liquid) will be supplied 
by the clinical sites and stored in accordance with the manufacturer’s  instructions.

Confidential  Pa ge 45 of 106 3.4.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Eligible patients will be stratified by whether they have or do not have erosive esophagitis on the 
screening EGD,  and by their baseline WHSS  (<3 vs. ≥3), and then randomized through central 
randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1500 mg IW -3718 BID or placebo BID , both 
administered in addition to the patient’s per- label QD PPI therapy.    
The computer -generated randomization schedule will be prepared by an independent statistician 
not otherwise associated with the study. 
3.4.5 Selection of Dosage in the Study  
During this study, an oral dose of 1500 mg IW- 3718 BID (total daily dose of 3000 mg/day) 
given as an adjunct to QD PPI for 56 days, will be studied to eva luate the safety and efficacy of 
IW-3718 in a placebo- controlled study. Dose reductions are not permitted . This dose was 
selected for Phase 3 evaluation based on the results of Phase 2b Study ICP-3718- 202. In that 
dose-ranging study, which evaluated IW -3718 doses of 500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg BID 
compared with placebo, dose-dependent improvement compared with placebo was observed for 
the primary endpoint, percent change from baseline in heartburn severity at Week 8. The 1500 mg dose showed an improvement in heartburn severity from baseline of -58.0 compared with a 
placebo improvement of -46.0 (nominal p-value = 0.04).  Percent change from baseline in 
regurgitation frequency score at Week 8 was also significantly improved for IW-3718 1500 mg 
(-55.4) versus placebo ( -37.9) (nominal p=0.01). Additional improvement for IW -3718 1500 mg 
relative to the IW -3718 500 mg and 1000 mg doses when compared with placebo were noted for 
other endpoints, including the heartburn and regurgitation responder endpoints; greater 
improvement was also noted for the IW -3718 1500 mg dose group within the EE subpopulation. 
IW-3718 1500 mg was generally well-tolerated in Study ICP-3718-202. The incidence of TEAEs 
for the IW -3718 1500 mg group (44.1%) was comparable to the overall IW-3718 incidence 
(46.2%) and to placebo (41.4%). There was a dose -related trend in the incidence of patients who 
had nausea (2.9%, 4.2%, 5.6%, and 8.8% of patients in the placebo, 500- mg, 1000- mg, and 
1500- mg IW -3718 groups, respectively). Otherwise, no dose- related trends were noted for any 
TEAEs.

Confidential  Pa ge 46 of 106 3.4.6 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
Patients will be randomized to receive 1500  mg IW -3718 BID or placebo BID. The first dose of 
study medication will be taken with liquid and a snack in clinic at the Random ization Visit (on 
Day 1). Patients should take their second dose that evening immediately upon completion of 
dinner, ensuring that at least 8 hours have elapsed since the first dose in clinic. 
During the Treatment Period, patients will take study medicatio n BID at home, in the morning 
(immediately upon completion of breakfast) and in the evening (immediately upon completion of 
dinner), even on study visit days. The last dose of study medication will be taken the morning of the EOT Visit.  
Additionally, all patients will take their current PPI during the Pretreatment, Randomization, and 
Treatment Periods ( ie, Day -21 through Day 57 [+ 3 days]). The PPI will be taken each day, 
approximately 30- 60 minutes before breakfast. 
During completion of the daily eDiary questions, patients will be asked to confirm daily dosing 
of their PPI by responding to the following question: 
• “Did you take your PPI this morning?” 
3.4.7 Blinding  
This study is double -blind and placebo- controlled. The Sponsor, Investigator, and study center 
staff will be blinded to treatment assignments.  
Unblinding of a patient’s treatment assignment is restricted to emergency situations and should 
only be used under circumstances where knowledge of the treatment is necessary for the proper 
handling of the patient. Except in a medical emergency, the Investigator and blinded study center staff will remain blinded during the conduct of the study and until such time that all 
discrepancies in the clinical database are resolved (ie , at the time of the database lock) . 
Individual patient treatment assignment unblinding is available to the Investigator through the interactive web response system (IWRS) in the event of an emergency. The Investigator should 
make all reasonable efforts to notify and discuss the circumstanc es requiring unblinding with the 
Medical Monitor or designee in advance of breaking the blind. If the treatment blind is broken,

Confidential  Pa ge 47 of 106 the reason and the date should be recorded and signed by the Investigator and information 
regarding the unblinding should be submitted as soon as possible to the Sponsor. The patient will 
be immediately withdrawn from the study if the code is broken. 
The Sponsor may also break the blind in circumstances where unblinding is necessary for the 
safety of the patients.  
3.4.8 Prior and Concom itant Medications  
At the Screening Visit, the following information will be recorded for each patient: 
• All medications the patient is taking (ongoing) 
• All prior medications taken during the 30 days before the Screening Visit 
• Most recent use of a PPI  
• Most recent use of an H2RA 
• Most recent use of an antacid  
 
Any medication /procedure taken /undergone by a patient during the study (beginning at the 
Screening Visit through the Follow-up Phone Call), including any new medications/procedures  
added or changes  in medications /procedures  previously reported, and the reason for its use will 
be documented in the source documents and collected in the EDC system.  
3.4.8.1 Rescue Medication  
During the Pretreatment and Treatment Periods, patients may use dispensed, protocol- permitted 
liquid antacid (magnesium hydroxide 200 mg/aluminum hydroxide 200 mg per 5 mL; 15 mL up 
to 4 times/day) as rescue medicine when their heartburn becomes intolerable. Each day, patients 
will record in their eDiary the number of times that rescue medication was used.  
3.4.8.2 Prohibited Medicines  
Medicines that are not permitted during the Pretreatment and Treatment Periods are provided in  
Appendix 4.

3.5 SAFETY AND EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety will be evaluated by adverse event ( AE) reports (discussed herein), standard clinical 
laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, medical history, and ECGs. The 
timing of safety and efficacy assessments is presented in Section  3.6. 
3.5.1 Adverse Events  
3.5.1.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug- related.  
An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Note: A procedure is not an AE, but the reason for a procedure may be an AE. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening experience: An AE is considered "life -threatening" if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE that, had occurred in a more sever e form, might have caused 
death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization: AEs requiring hospital 
admissions that are less than 24 hours in duration do not meet this criterion. A scheduled

Clinical Study Protocol:  C3718 -302 Amendment 2   20 July 2020  
 
Confidential  Pa ge 49 of 106 hospitalization for a preexisting condition that has not worsened during participation in the 
study does not meet this criterion. Preplanned hospitalizations for an elective medical/surgical procedure or routine check -ups do not meet this criterion. 
• A persistent or significant disability/incap acity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is considered an important medical event: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitaliz ation may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events includ e allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an event that emerges, or a preexisting event that worsens, 
any time after administration of the first dose of study drug (Day 1). 
3.5.1.2 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator will record all AEs from the time informed consent is obtained until completion 
of the Follow -up Phone Call. At each study visit, the Investigator will inquire about the 
occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of site personnel during study visits 
and interviews of a study subject presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. 
All AEs including SAEs will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. Information to be collected 
includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product and to PPI (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), 
and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented ap propriately regardless of relationship. All S AEs will be followed to adequate 
resolution or stabilization for up to a maximum of 30 days after last dose .

Clinical Study Protocol:  C3718 -302 Amendment 2   20 July 2020  
 
Confidential  Pa ge 50 of 106 Any medical condition that is present when a subject is screened and does not deteriorate 
(worsen in severity and/or frequency) should be recorded as Medical History and not as an AE. 
However, if the study subject’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be 
recorded as an AE. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and 
duration of each episode. 
Pretreatment AEs will be collected and captured in the subject’s source documentation from the 
time the subject signs the ICF until the subject receives study drug. Pretreatment AEs in 
randomized patients will additionally be entered on the AE page of the patient ’s eCRF.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs, physical examination findings, and 12- lead 
ECG parameters should be considered AEs and reported on the AE page of the subject’s eCRF 
only if the Investigator considers them clinically significant and/or they necessitate intervention.  
3.5.1.3 Procedures for Collecting and Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator or designee is to report any SAE to Ironwood Pharmacovigilance within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the event that occurred during the reporting period. 
All SAE s will be submitted using the safety reporting tool within the EDC system. The SAE 
report file will be generate d and be available for download once the SAE is submitted by the 
investigator or designee via  the EDC system.  The investigator or designee will send by email the 
SAE report file as an attachment to Ironwood Pharmacovigilance.  The system will prompt the 
Investigator or designee to provide as much information as possible, including  the following:  
• SAE term  
• Serious criteria  
• Severity  
• Causality assessment to study drug and to PPI  
• Action taken with study drug 
• Narrative explaining the context of the SAE outcome

Confidential  Pa ge 51 of 106 If all SAE information is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up SAE reports will 
be completed and submitted within the same reporting timelines as initial reports  using the EDC 
system . If the EDC system is not available, the Investigator or designee will complete the hard -
copy SAE form , including all of the required information noted above. The complet ed form 
should then be provided to the Sponsor using the contact information below: 
Ironwood Pharmacovigilance Contact Information  
 
 
 
 
The Investigator or designee should receive confirmation from Ironwood that the SAE 
information (via EDC or hard -copy form) was  received within 24 hours after its submission.   In 
the event this receipt confirmation is not received, the Investigator or designee will alert 
Ironwood Pharmacovigilance . 
The Investigator is required to follow SAEs until resolution or stabilization  for up to a maximum 
of 30 days after  last dose . Resolution is defined as: 
• Resolved with or without residual effects (sequelae)  
• A return to baseline for a preexisting condition 
• The Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event 
• Fatal outcome: If an autopsy is performed on a deceased subject, the autopsy report and death 
certificate must be provided to Ironwood as soon as it is available. 
 
3.5.1.3.1 Reporting of SAEs to the IRB 
The Investigator will receive prompt notification of SAEs, with the use of the study product, that 
are both unexpected and related, or any finding that  suggests a significant risk for patient s. The 
Investigator will promptly inform the IRB of the notification and insert the notification in the 
Investigator’s Regulatory Binder in accordance with local regulations. 
All applicable expedited safety reports w ill be forwarded, by Ironwood, to the Investigator.

Confidential  Pa ge 52 of 106 The Investigator will inform Ironwood of any local regulatory or IRB requirements not covered 
by the procedures in this or the prior section. 
3.5.1.3.2 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any female patient  who becomes pregnant  while participating in the study will be withdrawn 
from the study. 
Information on any pregnancies in female patients, or the female partner of a male patient , will 
be collected from the Screening Visit until the completion of the Follow-up Phone Call. If the patient  or the female partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant after receiving study drug 
during the study, the Investigator will collect and record the pregnancy information on the 
Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit it via fax or e- mail to Ironwood Pharmacovigilance 
within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. (Note: If the female partner of a male patient  
becomes pregnant, the Investigator must attempt to obtain consent to collect pregnancy 
information [including status of the newborn, if applicable] before reporting information to Ironwood). If not all information on the Pregnancy Reporting Form is available at the time of the 
initial report, follow -up Pregnancy Reporting Forms will be completed and submitted via fa x or 
e-mail to Ironwood Pharmaco vigilance within 24 hours of becoming aware of new information. 
The Investigator is required to attempt follow-up on the pregnancy until the completion of the 
pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and newborn will be forwarded to Ironwood 
within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware. Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 
6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pr egnancy for medical reasons will be an SAE and reported as such. A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. 
Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post- study pregnancy and considered reasonably 
related t o the investigational product by the Investigator, will be reported to Ironwood as 
described in Section 3.5.1.3. While the Investigator is not obli gated to actively seek this 
information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

Confidential  Pa ge 53 of 106 3.5.1.4 Recording Requirements  
Severity  
The Investigator or delegated physician will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by 
recording a severity rating in the patient ’s source documentation and on the AE page of the 
patient ’s eCRF. Severity , which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is 
distinct from seriousness, which implies a patient outcome or AE- required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality. Severity will be assessed according to the 
following scale: 
Mild : A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
Moderate : A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
AEs should be recorded using the maximum intensity of the event (eg, if a patient  reported 
nausea lasting 3 days, one start date and stop date should be recorded along with the maximum intensity experienced for that event over that 3- day timeframe).  
Relationship to Study Drug and to PPI  
The Investigator must assess the relationship of each AE (including SAEs) to the use of study 
drug or to ongoing PPI therapy  using a 2- category scale (not rela ted or related) based on clinical 
judgment and using all available information, and may include consideration of the following factors:

Confidential  Pa ge 54 of 106 • Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, preexisting 
conditions, concomitant use of other drugs, and presence of environmental or genetic factors  
• The temporal association between study drug/PPI exposure and onset of the AE  
• Whether the manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the investigational product  or PPI  
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with stopping use of the study drug; judgment should be used if multiple products are discontinued at the same time  
 
The causality assessment must be recorded in the patient ’s source documentation and on the AE 
page of the patient ’s CRF. The causal relationship between study drug and the AE will be 
assessed using the categories shown in Table  2. 
Table  2. Adverse Event Causality  
Category  Definition  
Not related  An AE is not associated with study medication or PPI if: 
- Lack of a temporal relationship to study drug administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable time frame 
following administration of the study medication); and/or  
- Other causative factor(s) (eg, a preexisting clinical condition, other concomitant treatments) more likely explain the occurrence of the event, and  
- The event did not improve with stopping of the investigational product, and/or  
- The event did not recur upon re -exposure with investigational product  
Related  An AE is attributed to the study medication  or PPI  if: 
- A temporal relationship to study drug administration makes a causal relationship plausible (eg, the event occurred within a reasonable time frame following administration of study medication); and/or  
- Other causative factor(s) (eg, the patient ’s clinical condition, other concomitant 
treatments)  either do not explain the event or are less equally likely to have led to 
the occurrence of the event, or  
- The event improved with stopping of the investigational product, and/or  
- The event recurred upon re -exposure with investigational product

Confidential  Pa ge 55 of 106 Laboratory Abnormalities  
The Investigator will review clinical laboratory values for significance and consideration as an 
AE. All the following laboratory abnormalities should be captured as AEs:  
• Any laboratory test result that meets criteria for an SAE  
• Any laboratory abnormality that results in study discontinuation 
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the patient  to receive specific corrective therapy  
• Any laboratory abnormality that the Investigator considers to be clinically significant  
 
Ongoing abnormal laboratory values/conditions that are being treated at baseline will be captured 
as an AE if the condition increases in severity and/or frequency during the study or if the condition requires more f requent treatment. If a patient  is treated for an abnormal laboratory 
value just before the Screening Visit, then the medical history should reflect the severity of the condition before treatment. 
3.5.1.5 Termination of Patient s from the Study  
Patient s will be inf ormed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason, without prejudice to their medical care. The Investigator will make reasonable efforts to 
keep each patient  in the study. However, if the Investigator removes a patient  from the study or if 
the patient  declines further participation, the evaluations required at the Week 8/EOT Visit  
should be performed, if possible. All evaluations and observations, together with the description 
of the reason(s) for study withdrawal, must be recorded in the patient ’s source documentation 
and subsequently on the appropriate page of the patient ’s eCRF.  The reasons for patient 
withdrawal from the study are provided in Section 3.3.3.  
An effort must be made to determine why a patient  fails to return or is dropped from the study. 
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient  at the time of 
discontinuation of follow -up should be recorded in source documents and reported where 
applicable on the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation of treatment should be documented.

3.7.4.1 Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The primary efficacy parameter of the study is defined as the change from baseline at Week 8 in 
WHSS.  
• The WHSS for a week is the average of the non -missing Daily Heartburn Severity 
Scores (DHSS) for that week.  Rules for missingness of data will be prespecified in 
the SAP finalized before database  lock. 
• The DHSS for a day is the greater score of the 2 mRESQ items assessing heartburn 
severity (“Burning feeling behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper 
stomach” and “Pain behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach”) for that day. W here 1 of the 2 mRESQ heartburn severity items is missing for the day, the 
maximum will be the score of the remaining item; where both items are missing for the day, the DHSS will be missing.

Confidential  Pa ge 71 of 106 3.7.4.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
There are 3 key secondary efficacy parameters.  Hypothesis testing of these key secondary 
efficacy parameters (and the primary efficacy parameter) will be controlled for multiplicity.  
1. Change from baseline at Week 8 in Weekly Regurgitation Frequency Score (WRFS) 
• The WR FS for a week is the average of the non -missing Daily Regurgitation 
Frequency Scores (DRFS) for that week.  Rules for missingness of dat a will be 
prespecified in the SAP finalized before database lock . 
• The DRFS for a day is the greater score of the 2 mRESQ items assessing 
regurgitation frequency (“Regurgitation [liquid or food moving upwards toward your 
throat or mouth]” and “An acid or bitter taste in the mouth”) for that day. 
2. Overall Heartburn Responder: a patient who is a weekly heartburn responder for at least 4 weeks, including at least 1 of the last 2 weeks (Weeks 7 and 8), during the 8- week 
Treatment Period.  
• A weekly heartburn responder is a patient with a decrease from baseline of ≥ 45% in 
Weekly He artburn Severity Score (WHSS).  
• Rules for missingness of dat a will be prespecified in the SAP finalized before 
database lock . 
3. Proportion of heartburn -free days during the 8- week Treatment Period  
• Proportion of heartburn- free days is calculated as the number  of heartburn- free 
(DHSS=0) days divided by the number of diary entry days. 
3.7.4.3 Analysis Methods  for Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
3.7.4.3.1 Analysis  Governance 
This planned efficacy analysis is the final efficacy analysis for the study. It will be conducted on 
a database for which relevant data have been cleaned and finalized as of the efficacy cut -off date.  
A sensitivity efficacy analysis and a final safety analysis will be performed on the final database once all enrolled patients have completed the s tudy. A separate document (Analysis Charter) will 
describe the detailed plan for the independent CRO’s analysis plan and communications with the 
Sponsor. 
An analysis team composed of members from an independent CRO will be formed to conduct 
the efficacy an alyses for the primary and key secondary efficacy parameters. This independent

Clinical Study Protocol:  C3718 -302 Amendment 2   20 July 2020  
 
Confidential  Pa ge 72 of 106 team will be responsible for reviewing the analysis results and, based on prespecified criteria, 
providing Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ironwood, the Sponsor) with the follow ing 
recommendations:  
• If the efficacy results for C3718- 302 provide a clear signal based on the prespecified criteria, 
the independent team will make a recommendation either to stop or continue companion 
Phase 3 Study C3718-301. 
• If the results are inconclusive based on the prespecified criteria and cannot support a clear 
recommendation to stop or continue companion Study C3718- 301, the independent team will 
make a recommendation to unblind the current study, Study C3718- 302, in order to enable 
the S ponsor to conduct a full data analysis to determine whether to stop or continue 
companion Phase 3 Study C3718-301. 
3.7.4.3.2 Analy tical Methods 
For analysis of the primary efficacy and first key secondary efficacy parameters, continuous 
parameters (eg, change from baseline), descriptive statistics (patient number [n], mean, standard 
deviation, median, and range) will be presented for each treatment group. The IW-3718 group 
will be compared with the placebo group by employing a linear mixed- effects model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) framework with week (categorical), treatment group, week -by-treatment 
group and week-by- baseline value interactions, baseline esophagitis status (present vs. not 
present), and baseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3) as fixed -effect terms and baseline val ue as a covariate, 
with patient  as a random effect. An unstructured covariance structure will be used. Least -squares 
mean (LSM) for each treatment group, LSM difference between the IW -3718 group and the 
placebo group and a 95% confidence interval for the d ifference at Week 8, as well as the p -value 
for comparison versus placebo will be presented. 
For analysis of responder parameters (ie, responder vs. non- responder), the counts and 
proportions of responders will be calculated for each treatment group. The proportions of 
responders between the IW-3718 group and the placebo group will be compared using a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for baseline esophagitis status (erosive 
esophagitis vs. no erosive esophagitis) and b aseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3). The CMH test is the 
primary analysis for responder parameters. The difference in the proportion of responders 
between the IW -3718 group and the placebo group, as w ell as the CMH estimate of the odds

Confidential  Pa ge 73 of 106 ratio (IW -3718 over placebo) and a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio, will also be 
presented.  
Time-dependent proportion parameters, defined as days the event of interest occurs, divided by 
the number of eDiary entry days within the 8-week Treatment Period (eg, proportion of 
heartburn- free-days), will b e analyzed using a Poisson model which is appropriate for count data .  
The analysis includes the treatment, the baseline esophagitis status (present vs. not present), 
baseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3), covariate of baseline proportion of event -free days, with the eDiary 
entry days adjusted in the model. In the case of overdispersion, a negative binomial model instead of Poisson regression will be implemented. Model estimates in difference between the 
rates for IW -3718 and placebo groups will be calculated  with corr esponding 95% confidence 
interval and p -value associated with the comparisons to placebo. 
3.7.4.4 Controlling Type -I Error  
To maintain an overall type-I error rate of 0.05, the primary and 3 key  secondary efficacy 
parameters will be tested sequentially according to the following order, each at a 2- sided  
significance level of 0.05. 
Order  Parameter  
1 Change from Baseline at Week 8 in WHSS (primary)  
2 Change from Baseline at Week 8 in WRFS  
3 Over all Heartburn Respond er 
4 Proportion of Heartburn -free Days during the 8 -week Treatment Period  
Testing of subsequent parameters will not be performed unless all previous parameters have been 
tested statistically significant (p≤0.05). 
3.7.4.5 Sensitivity Analysis of Primary Efficacy Parameter  
For the primary parameter , change from baseline in WHSS at Week  8, a sensitivity analysis will 
be conducted ; details will be provided in the SAP.   
3.7.4.6 Handling of Missing Data  
For the primary efficacy analysis, change from baseline at Week 8 in WHSS, no imputation will 
be performed on missing data. The WHSS  will be computed as the average of daily scores for

database lock . 
A pattern -mixture model with control- based pattern imputation will be implemented as a 
multiple imputation method to explore the effects of missing data on the primary efficacy 
parameter. The details of this approach w ill be provided in the SAP. 
3.7.4.7 Exploratory Efficacy Parameters  and Anal ysis Methods  
Exploratory efficacy parameters will be explored outside of the formal testing procedures and 
not controlled for multiplicity.  
Change or percent change for continuous parameters will be analyzed using the MMRM 
approach as described for the primary efficac y parameter , change from baseline at Week 8 in 
WHSS.  
Categorical responder parameters will be analyzed using the CMH testing method as described 
for the key secondary efficacy analysis for Overall Heartburn Responder.  
Time -dependent  proportion parameters, defined as days the event of interest occurs, divided by 
the number of diary entry days within the 8- week Treatment Period (eg , proportion of heartburn-
free-days), will be analyzed using a Poisson model which is appropriate for count data .  The 
analysis is  similar to that described  for the key secondary efficacy analysis for the proportion of 
heartburn- free days during the 8- week Treatment Period.

Descriptive statistics will be calculated on ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory test results 
at each assessment time point, by treatment group. The change from baseline at each time point 
post baseline will also be summarized by treatment group. 
3.7.6 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis is not planned for this study. 3.7.7 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size calculations for the primary and key secondary efficacy parameters are based on 
results from patients with evidence of pathological acid reflux (positive baseline Bravo status) in 
Study ICP-3718-202, which had a similar study population as the current study.  
The primary efficacy parameter is Change from Baseline at Week 8 in WHSS, and key secondary efficacy parameters include:  
• Change from Baseline at Week 8 in WRFS  
• Overall Heartburn Responder 
• Proportion of Heartburn-free Days during the 8- week Treatment Period  
Using data from patients in Study ICP-3718- 202, we derived the estimated results at end of the 
study as follows:

All medicine listed in the sections below are excluded during the Screening, Pretreatment, 
Randomization, and Treatment Periods. A 1- day washout means the that the particular medicine 
is not allowed during the calendar day before the EGD and Bravo pH monitoring; a 5- day 
washout means that the particular medicine is not a llowed during the 5 days before the EGD and 
Bravo pH monitoring; a 14-day washout means that the particular medicine is not allowed during 
the 14 days before the Pretreatment Visit.  
Patients should be on a stable dose of all concomitant medications at the time of the Screening 
Visit and should intend to maintain their usual medication regimen throughout the study. Changes in concomitant medication regimens or use of a new concomitant medication other than 
as described below is not allowed during the study unless required to treat an AE or is prescribed 
by a physician to treat another emergent medical issue.  
1-DAY WASHOUT  
• Antacids  
• Sucralfate

entering into the Pretreatment Period.] 
• Tricyclic antidepressants (eg , amitriptyline, imipramine , and nortriptyline)  
[Note: Patients may take another single antidepressant (such as a selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [ SNRI ] medication) as long as the 
dose has been stable for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit and the patient plans to continue a stable dose of the medications throughout the study. Use of more than 1 antidepressant medication is exclusionary.] 
• Other gastric -retentive drugs ( eg, Glumetza, Gralise)  
 
Notes Regarding Concomitan t Medications:  
Patients must have been on once- daily (QD) PPI therapy for at least 8 weeks before the 
Screening Visit and continue to take their PPI through the EOT visit. PPIs that are formulated  in 
combination with other drugs are not permitted  (eg, Zege rid® [omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate] , 
Vimovo® [esomeprazole/naproxen]). 
Daily use of estrogens and/or low-dose aspirin (up to 162 mg/day) is permitted if, after an 
appropriate evaluation ( eg, history and physical exam), the Investigator believes these 
medications are not contributing to the patient’s symptoms. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are permitted for occasional use. Chronic use is 
not permitted. Oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were shown not to have a  
drug-drug interaction with IW-3718 (see the IW-3718 Investigator’s Brochure, Edition 5, dated 
10 March 2020). All female patients of childbearing potential may use oral contraceptives with 
the ingredients listed above as birth control without us ing another additional form of 
contraception , from the date they sign the ICF until 24 hours after their final dose of study drug 
(eg condom).

  1. SUMMARY OF THE PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
The major protocol revisions are listed below : 
• In accordance with guidance from the US FDA, the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints have been  changed . The ana lytical methods , including sequential testing to 
control Type- I error, have been updated accordingly . 
• The sample size was decreased  from  approximately 660 patients to approximately 
550 patients. S ample size calculation s based on the revised primary and key secondary 
efficacy parameters indicated that fewer patients would be required to reach comparable, 
nominal statistical power for the new primary and 2 of 3 key secondary efficacy 
parameters , individually . In addition, the concerns  associated  with conducting a clinical 
trial amid  the COVID- 19 pande mic (ie, untoward impact on patient enrollment, trial 
integrity , and ensuring patient safety) have contributed to the decision to decrease the 
sample size.  
• An analysis team composed of members from an independent contract research organization (CRO) will be formed to conduct the efficacy analyses for the primar y and 
key secondary efficacy parameters. This independent team will be responsible for reviewing the analysis results and, based on prespecified criteria, providing Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ironwood, the Sponsor) with the following recommendations:  
o If the efficacy results for C3718-302 provide a clear signal based on the prespecified criteria, the independent team will make a recommendation either to stop or continue companion Phase 3 Study C3718-301. 
o If the results are inconclusive based on the pres pecified criteria and cannot 
support a clear recommendation to stop or continue companion Study C3718-301, the independent team will make a recommendation to unblind the current study, Study C3718-302, in order to enable the Sponsor to conduct a full data  analysis to 
determine whether to stop or continue companion Phase 3 Study C3718-301. 
This planned efficacy analysis is the final efficacy analysis for the study. It will be conducted on a database for which relevant data have been cleaned and finalized as of the 
efficacy cut -off date. Sensitivity efficacy analysis and a final safety analysis will be 
performed on the final database  once all enrolled patients have complete d the study. A 
separate document (Analysis Charter) will describe the detailed plan for the independent CRO’s analysis plan and communications with the Sponsor. 
• The analysis populations definitions were modified . An additional analysis population 
(Sensitivity Analysis [SA] Population) was added , to be used for efficacy sensitivity 
analysi s at the completion of the study.

  • Endpoints listed as “Additional Secondary Efficacy Parameters” and the “Additional 
Efficacy Parameters” were consolidated into a new section “Exploratory Efficacy 
Parameters”.  New exploratory endpoints were added. 
• Changes were made to one of the study’s eligibility criteria  for consistency between the 
synopsis and body of the protocol . 
• Enrollment of patients without esophageal erosions was revised to state that the study 
will aim to enroll up to 50% of patients with esophageal erosions . 
• Updates were made to the prohibited medication and  concomitant medication guidance.  
• The Sponsor’s study contact information was updated.

Parameter  10 The Primary Efficacy Parameter  was changed from  “Overall Heartburn Responder” to :  
Change from baseline at Week 8 in Weekly Heartburn Severity Score (WHSS).  
• The WHSS for a week is the average of the non -missing Daily Heartbur n 
Severity Scores (DHSS) for that week.  Rules for missingness of data will be 
prespecified in the SAP finalized before database lock.  
• The DHSS for a day is the greater score of the 2 mRESQ items assessing heartburn severity (“Burning feeling behind the breastbone or in the center of 
the upper stomach” and “Pain behind the breastbone or in the center of the 
upper stomach”) for that day.  Where 1 of the 2 mRESQ heartburn severity 
items is missing for the day, the maximum will be the score of the remaining 
item; where both items are missing for the day, the DHSS will be missing.  
9.  Study Synopsis, Statistical

unblind the curre nt study, Study C3718 -302, in order to enable the Sponsor to 
conduct a full data analysis to determine whether to stop or continue 
companion Phase 3 Study C3718-301.  
This planned efficacy analysis is the final efficacy analysis for the study. It will be conducted on a database for which relevant data have been cleaned and finalized as

will be performed on the final database once all enrolled patients have completed 
the study. A separate document (Analysis Charter) will describe the detailed plan 
for the independent CRO’s analysis plan and communications with the Sponsor.  
 
In a new subsection, “ Analy tical Methods ”, the efficacy analysis methods from the 
previous version of the protocol were updated to reflect the new primary and key 
secondary efficacy parameters.  
Previous text : 
For analysis of the primary efficacy parameter and other responder parameters (i.e., responder vs. non -responder), the counts and proportions of responders will be 
calculated for each treatment group. The proportions of responders between the IW -
3718 group and the placebo group will be compared using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for esophagitis status (erosive esophagitis vs. no erosive esophagitis), baseline heartburn severity level (<3 vs. ≥3), and geographic region. The CMH test is the primary analysis for responder parameters. The difference in the proportion of responders between the IW -3718 group and the 
placebo group, as we ll as the CMH estimate of the odds ratio (IW-3718 over 
placebo) and a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio, will also be presented.  
For analysis of continuous parameters (e.g., percent change from baseline), descriptive statistics (patient number [n] , mean, standard deviation, median, and 
range) will be presented for each treatment group. The IW -3718 group will be 
compared with the placebo group by employing a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) framework with week (categorical), treatment group,  week -by-
treatment group, esophagitis status, and geographic region as fixed-effect terms and baseline value as a covariate (if applicable). A compound symmetry covariance structure will be used. Least-squares mean (LSM) for each treatment group, LSM 
diffe rence between the IW -3718 group and the placebo group and a 95% confidence

interval for the difference, as well as the p -value for comparison versus placebo will 
be presented.  
Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of percent change from baseline to Week 8 
in WHSS and WRFS will be plotted by treatment group. To interpret the graphical representation of the CDF across treatment, a two -sample Kolmogorov -Smirnov test 
will be conduc ted.  
Revised  text: 
For analysis of the primary efficacy and first key secondary efficacy parameters, continuous parameters (eg, change from baseline), descriptive statistics (patient number [n], mean, standard deviation, median, and range) will be present ed for each 
treatment group. The IW-3718 group will be compared with the placebo group by employing a linear mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
framework with week (categorical), treatment group, week -by-treatment group and 
week -by-baseline value interactions, baseline esophagitis status (present vs. not 
present), and baseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3) as fixed -effect terms and baseline value as 
a covariate, with patient as a random effect. An unstructured covariance structure 
will be used. Least-squares mean (LSM) for each treatment gro up, LSM difference 
between the IW -3718 group and the placebo group and a 95% confidence interval 
for the difference at Week 8, as well as the p -value for comparison versus placebo 
will be presented.  
For analysis of responder parameters (ie, responder vs. n on-responder), the counts 
and proportions of responders will be calculated for each treatment group. The proportions of responders between the IW -3718 group and the placebo group will be 
compared using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for b aseline 
esophagitis status (erosive esophagitis vs. no erosive esophagitis)  and baseline 
WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3). The CMH test is the primary analysis for responder parameters. The difference in the proportion of responders between the IW -3718 group and the 
placebo group, as well as the CMH estimate of the odds ratio (IW-3718 over placebo) and a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio, will also be presented.  
Time-dependent proportion parameters, defined as days the event of interest occurs, 
divided by the numb er of eDiary entry days within the 8 -week Treatment Period 
(eg, proportion of heartburn-free -days), will be analyzed using a Poisson model 
which is appropriate for count data . The analysis includes the treatment, the baseline 
esophagitis status (present vs . not present), baseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3), covariate of

baseline proportion of event -free days, with the eDiary entry days adjusted in the 
model. In the case of overdispersion, a negative binomial model instead of Poisson 
regression will be implemented. Model estimates in difference between the rates for IW-3718 and placebo groups will be calculated with corresponding 95% confidence 
interval and p -value associated with the comparisons to placebo.  
11.  Synopsis, Sample Size 
Determination a nd Controlling  
for Type I Error 12-13 The sample size was changed from approximately 660 patients (330 per group) to 
approximately 550 patients  (275 per group). T he sample size  power calculations were 
revised  to reflect the new primary and key secondary efficacy parameters using data 
from previously completed Phase 2b Study  ICP-3718 -202 which enrolled a similar 
study population . The revised text is as follows: 
 
The sample size calculations for the primary and key secondary efficacy parameters are based on results from patients with evidence of pathological acid reflux (positive baseline Bravo status) in Study  ICP-3718-202, which had a similar study population 
as the current study.  
The primary efficacy parameter is Change from Baseline at Week 8 in WHSS, and key se condary efficacy parameters include:  
• Change from Baseline at Week 8 in WRFS  
• Overall Heartburn Responder  
• Proportion of Heartburn-free Days during the 8-week Treatment Period  
Using data from patients in Study ICP -3718-202, we derived the estimated results a t

a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 so that the overall type I error rate is 
maintained at 0.05.  
Based on bootstrap simulations, a sample size of 27 5 patients per group will 
provide approximately 96 % power to detect a treatment difference between 
1500-mg IW -3718 (while receiving PPIs) and placebo (while receiving PPIs) for 
the primary efficacy parameter , assuming the randomized population in this study 
is consistent with the selected population from Study  ICP-3718 -202. Power  that is

analysis will be performed on the final database once all enrolled patients have 
completed the study. A separate document (Analysis Charter) will describe the detailed plan for the independent CRO’s analysis plan and communications with the Sponsor.  
An analysis team composed of members from an independent CRO will be formed to conduct the efficacy analyses for the primary and key secondary efficacy parameters. This independent team will be responsible for reviewing the analysis 
results and, based on prespecified criteria, providing Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. (Ironwood, the Sponsor) with the following recommendations:  
• If the efficacy results for C3718 -302 provide a clear signal based on the 
prespecified criteria, the independent team will make a recommendation either to stop or continue companion Phase 3 Study C3718 -301.  
• If the results are inconclusive based on the prespecified criteria and cannot support a clear recommendation to stop or continue companion Study C3718 -
301, the independent team will make a recommendation to unblind the current study, Study C3718 -302, in order to enable the Sponsor to conduct a full data 
analysis to determine whether to stop or continue companion Phase 3 Study C3718-301.  
In new Section 3.7.4.3.2, Analysis Methods, the efficacy analysis methods from the previous version of the protocol were updated to reflect the new primary and key secondary efficacy parameters.  
Previous text:  
For analysis of the primary efficacy parameter and other responder parameters (i.e., responder vs. non -responder), the counts and proportions of responders will be 
calculated for each treatment group. The proportions of responders between the IW-3718 group and the placebo group will be compared using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for esophagitis status (erosive esophagitis vs. no 
erosive esophagitis), baseline heartburn severity level (<3 vs. ≥3), and geographic 
region. The CMH test is the primary analysis for responder parameters. The 
difference in the proportion of responders between the IW -3718 group and the 
placebo group, as well as the CMH estimate of the odds ratio (IW-3718 over 
placebo) and a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio, will also be presented.

descriptive statistics (patient number [n], m ean, standard deviation, median, and

compared with the placebo group by employing a mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) framework with week (categorical), treatment group, we ek-by-
treatment group, esophagitis status, and geographic region as fixed-effect terms 
and baseline value as a covariate (if applicable). A compound symmetry covariance 
structure will be used. Least-squares mean (LSM) for each treatment group, LSM differen ce between the IW -3718 group and the placebo group and a 95% 
confidence interval for the difference, as well as the p -value for comparison versus 
placebo will be presented.  
Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of percent change from baseline to Week 8 in WHSS and WRFS will be plotted by treatment group. To aid in the 
interpretation of the graphical representation of the CDF across treatment, a two -
sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be conducted.  
Revised text:  
For analysis of the primary efficacy and first key secondary efficacy parameters, 
continuous parameters (eg, change from baseline), descriptive statistics (patient number [n], mean, standard deviation, median, and range) will be presented for each treatment group. The IW -3718 group will be compared with the placebo 
group by employing a linear mixed- effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
framework with week (categorical), treatment group, week -by-treatment group and 
week -by-baseline value interactions, baseline esophagitis status (present vs. not 
present), and baseline WHSS (<3 vs. ≥3) as fixed -effect terms and baseline value

Time -dependent proportion parameters, defined as days the event of interest 
occurs, divided by the number of eDiary entry days within the 8 -week Treatment 
Period (eg, proportion of heartburn-free -days), will be analyzed using a Poisson 
model which is appropriate for count data . The analysis includes the treatment, the 
baseline esophagitis status (present vs. not present), baseline WHS S (<3 vs. ≥3), 
covariate of baseline proportion of event -free days, with the eDiary entry days 
adjusted in the model. In the case of overdispersion, a negative binomial model 
instead of Poisson regression will be implemented. Model estimates in difference between the rates for IW -3718 and placebo groups will be calculated with 
corresponding 95% confidence interval and p-value associated with the 
comparisons to placebo.

previous version):  
 
In the primary analysis of the primary efficacy parameter Overall Heartburn 
Responder and first key secondary efficacy parameter Over all Regurgitation 
Responder – patients with a baseline WHSS ≥ 3, a patient who reported daily 
symptom severity scores for less than 4 days during a week will not be considered a 
weekly responder for that week. This approach essentially classifies the weekl y 
symptom severity score as missing for any treatment week (intermittent or post-
dropout) for which less than 4 daily scores are available. Furthermore, this approach 
imputes a weekly responder status of “non -responder” for that week.  
In the primary analysis of the key secondary efficacy parameters Percent Change 
from Baseline to Week 8 in WHSS and WRFS, no imputation will be performed on 
missing data. The weekly symptom severity score will be computed as the average 
of all available daily scores for that week, regardless of the number of daily score 
available for that week. If there is not a single daily score available for a week, then 
the weekly score for that week is missing and is included in the MMRM analysis as 
missing.  
For the primary efficacy analysis, change from baseline at Week 8 in WHSS, no 
imputation will be performed on missing data. The WHSS will be computed as the average of daily scores for that week. Rules for the average calculation will be prespecified in the SAP finalized before da tabase lock.  
A pattern -mixture model with control-based pattern imputation will be implemented 
as a multiple imputation method to explore the effects of missing data on the primary and key secondary efficacy parameter s. The details of this approach will be

The efficacy parameters will be tested sequentially according to the above order at 
a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 so that the overall type I error rate is 
maintained at 0.05.  
Based on bootstrap simulations, a sample size of 27 5 patients per group w ill 
provide approximately 96% power to detect a treatment difference between 
1500-mg IW -3718 (while receiving PPIs) and placebo (while receiving PPIs) for 
the primary efficacy parameter, assuming the randomized population in this study is consistent with the selected population from Study  ICP-3718 -202. Power that is 
based on simulations  for all type I error controlling key efficacy parameters are 
presented in the table below.  The 2 -sample t -test was used for continuous 
parameters and the Chi -square test was  used for responder parameter.

Study Administrative Structure  82 The European Union (EU) was removed from the list of countries with study centers.  
39.  Appendix 3, Weekly 
Assessments 96 For consistency with Protocol Section 3.5.7.2, the following question was added:  
“How much were you bothered by your overall GERD symptoms over the past 
7 days?”  
40.  Appendix 4, Prohibited 
Medications, 14- Day Washout  98 In accordance with results from a completed drug -drug interaction study, C3718 -103 as 
described in the Investigator’s Brochure (Edition 5, dated 10 March 2020), 
levothyroxine and digoxin were removed from the list of prohibited medications 
(strikethrough  text represents a deletion from the previous version): 
• Drugs with a known drug -drug interaction or a potential for a drug -drug 
interaction with colesevelam (cyclosporine, levothyroxine [and other thyroid 
replacement therapies], olmesartan medoxomil, phenytoin, warfarin)  
• Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. warfarin, digoxin,  theophylline)  
41.  Appendix 4, Prohibited 
Medications, Notes Regarding Concomitant Medications  99 PPIs formulated in combination with other drugs were prohibited.  
In accordance with results from a completed drug-drug interaction study, C3718-103, and as described in the Investigator’s Brochure (Edition 5, dated 10  March 2020), no 
drug-drug interaction was observed when IW -3718 was dosed in combination with oral 
contraceptives containing ethin yl estradiol and norethindrone. As such, this type of 
medication is now permitted as a single contraceptive modality.  
Changes were as follows ( italic  and strikethrough  text represent changes from the 
previous version):  
Patients must have been on once -daily (QD) PPI therapy for at least 8 weeks before 
the Screening Visit and continue to take their PPI through the EOT visit. PPIs that

Daily use of estrogens and/or low -dose aspirin (up to 162 mg/day) is permitted if, 
after an appropriate evaluation (e.g., history and physical exam), the Investigator 
believes these medications are not contributing to the patient’s sy mptoms.

patients of childbearing potential may use  using oral contraceptives with the 
ingredients listed above as birth control must agree to  use without using  another 
additional form of contraception , from the date they sign the ICF until 24 hours

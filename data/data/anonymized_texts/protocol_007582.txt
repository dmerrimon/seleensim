Criteria  Inclusion:  
• Present to an ED at participating sites  
• Complete a telepsychiatric consult as captured in the electronic medical 
record  
• Complete a telepsychiatric consult during the navigator’s hours of 
operation

Study 
Procedures  Patients are identified by a clinician in the ED as needing psychiatric evaluation 
and a referral is made to a tele -psych provider for a virtual consult.  Patients who 
complete a telepsychiatric consult in the ED can be enrolled to either the con trol or 
intervention arm based on a randomization scheme that randomly allocates days 
that navigators are available. Psychiatrists are remind ed through daily 
communication as to whether the BH-VPN program is available and the ED 
locations . The psychiatrist will make a recommendation to admit or discharge the 
patient.  For patients that have a discharge  recommend ation  on days that BH -VPN 
is available , patients will be offered the BH -VPN progra m. Enrolled patients are 
follow ed for up to 45 day s. Each patient will receive the following core 
components:  
1. Introduction to the patient follow -up process prior to discharge  
2. Follow -up evaluation within 72 hours by phone and weekly contact  
3. Confirm that an in-person  follow -up visit with an appropriate  provider or 
clinician  is scheduled. Where applicable, confirm in -network follow -up 
appointments are completed . 
4. Ongoing a ssess ment : substance use disorder, medication barriers, and 
appointment barriers  
5. Assist with community resources, crisis planning, and s upportive listening  
6. Placement into an appropriate case management program, if needed.  
 
On days where the navigator is available, all patients who meet eligibility criteria 
will be considered exposed to the intervention; whereas, on days the navigator is 
not available all patients will be considered exposed to usual car e.

  Statistical 
Analysis  Analyses will include all patients identified as having completed telepsychiatric 
consult and meeting the inclusion criteria. Baseline comparisons of the 
intervention and usual care groups will be made using univariate analyses. The 
primary outcom e, hospital admission, and secondary outcomes will be compared 
between the two groups of patients using generalized linear mixed -effects model  
with a logit link function . Results will be presented with odds ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals.

2. BACKGROUND  
The primary arena for emergency psychiatri c care is in emergency departments (ED), largely because of 
the impact of deinstitutionalization and other social forces on the mentally ill community.1,2 Lack o f 
community -based care for mental illness has contributed to increasing inpatient behavioral health 
admissions and long stays in the emergency department.3 The high volume of psychiatric patients seen and 
waiting in hospital EDs may prevent  other medical patients from obtaining timely care.4 The average delay 
for admission to a NC state hospital for psy chiatric care in 2012 was 3 days and rose to 3.5 days in 2013.5 
Other contributors to the problem of patients with psychiatric conditions crowding EDs include 
diminishing access to mental health care in the community, shrinking mental health resources, and 
increasing fragmentation  of resources.6  
 
Mental health care in rural regions is a national priority.7 In 2016, 18.7% of residents of rural counties have 
some diagnos ed form  of mental illness. In addition, 3.9%, or approximately 1.3 million residents of rural 
counties experienced serious thoughts of suicide.8 The Tennessee Hospital Authority estimates a cost of 
$9,472 fo r an inpatient admission with a behavioral health diagnosis.9 EDs servicing rural areas often do 
not have the staff to support patients presenting with a behavioral health crisis. In North Carolina, 70 of its 
100 counties have no child and adolescent psychiatrists, 28 have no practicing psychiatrists and 18 counties 
have only one psychiatrist.10  
 
Visits to EDs for behavioral health crises are common; in North Carolina, a person in behavioral health 
crisis pr esents to an ED every 2.5 minutes.11 Due to the l ack of coordinated resources and high recidivism, 
many patients are admitted to a psychiatric facility perhaps unnecessarily, rather than receiving the care 
coordination that could prevent as admission .6 Virtual care offers an efficient means for patient evaluation, 
treatment recommendations, and follow -up care due to the remoteness of rural EDs and low er volume of 
patients needing services. Integrating patient navigation into emergency mental health care delivery may 
address many of the barriers to patient success post -discharge. Patient navigation has a growing evidence 
base for improving patient outco mes.12 The use of virtual care has been shown to improve access and 
engagement of patients with their care teams. Post -discharge follow -up has also been shown to effectively 
reduce suicide attempts, with one study that evaluated periodic phone check -in after ED discharge showing 
a 30% reduction in suicide attempts.13  
 
The proposed study builds upon evidence of virtual patient navigation effectiveness among prior research. 
The novelty of this study is in its design, as prior studies have used cohort designs for cau sal inference to 
inform care delivery for patients with mental illness. This randomized trial will provide greater precision 
and rur ality to assess evidence of whether the addition of virtual patient navigation to telepsychiatric 
consults decreases initial  hospitalization, readmissions, and repeated use of the ED among patients 
presenting to rural EDs with a behavioral health crisis.

10 3. RATIONALE  
To enhance the care of patients with a telepsychiatric  consult , Atrium Health  has designed a  Behavioral 
Health Virtual Patient Navigation (BH-VPN ) program . Navigators will monitor patients and assist with 
navigation through a weekly phone call after their index ED encounter for up to 45 days post ED discharge . 
The BH -VPN aims  to improve patient outcomes through standardized approaches that leverage analytics 
and technology, while bridging care coordination. When a patient presents to a participating Atrium Health  
ED, those with a telepsychiatric consult completed on a randomiz ed intervention day, during the hours of 
operation, are provided the option of participating in the BH -VPN  program . A patient can choose not to 
receive care by a navigator post discharge.  
 
The BH-VPN program  includes  the following key components : introduct ion to the patient follow -up 
process prior to ED discharge, follow -up evaluation within 72 hours by phone and weekly contact, 
confirmation that a follow -up visit is scheduled , where applicable confirm in -network follow -up 
appointments are completed with a n Atrium Health provider, and placement  into an appropriate case 
management program, if needed . There may be cases where patients are eligible to enroll in full case 
management programs based on their insurance and other  criteria. For example, if a patient has Medicaid 
through Cardinal Innovations , a managed care organization providing local behavioral health care,  and 
meets specific  criteria , would no longer require navigation services . A patient ’s contact  with the BH-VPN  
program ends after 45 days  following ED discharge , or if there is a failure to contact,  becomes  enrolled 
with a case -management program , declines services, or the patient dies . For those patients enrolled in a 
case management program , then navigator will ensure the patient is in  contact with case management 
program staff before ending contact with the patient.  
 
This research project  is a pragmatic, randomized evaluation  of a quality improvement initiative which 
seeks to evaluate the effects of standardizing the use of a BH-VPN  program among patients with a 
telepsych iatric  consult . The outcomes evaluation of this intervention has been designed to integrate with 
routine care and minimize frontline staff burden by deploying an evaluation in a real -world setting.   
 
4. SUBJECT AND SITE SEL ECTION  
4.1. Accrual  
 
As part of current care, p atients are identified by a  provider  in the ED as needing psychiatric evaluation , 
and a referral is made to the telepsych iatric  provider for a virtual consult. Patients are eligible to be 
included in analysis for the project if they meet the inclusion  criteria  and the telepsychiatric 
consultation occurs during potential BH -VPN program hours. We will accrue patient data for 
evaluat ion during a period starting in October 2019 . Based on prior data , we estimate  about 1,100 
patients will complete a telepsychiatric consult in a 14-month period. Patients will not be accrued on 
days/times  when the navigators would be  not available  (e.g. holidays) . 
 
Version Number: 1. 3 
Version Date: 8-27-19 
  
11 Once a patient is in the intervention arm, the patient remains in the intervention arm until 45 days, or if 
there is a failure to contact (4 phone cal ls in 12 days), if the patient becomes  enrolled with a case  
management program , decline s services, or if the patient dies . 
 
4.2. Eligibility  Criteria  
4.2.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
Eligible patients must meet each of the following criteria:  
• Present  to an ED at participating sites  
• Complete  a telepsychiatric  consult  as captured in the electronic m edical record  
• Complete a t elepsychiatric consult during the navigator’s hours of operation  (Monday -Friday 
7AM to 11PM and Saturday 7AM to 7PM)  
• ≥ 18 years of age at time of ED admission  
4.2.2.  Exclusion Criteria  
• Patients currently enrolled in the BH -VPN program up on their index  ED encounter  
 
4.3. Evaluable P opulation  
Patients included in the evaluable population for this project, will contribute  data to the  final outcomes 
assessment.  All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be assessed  for the primary outcome  
(intent to treat ). Patients will have one of the following ED discharge  disposition s: (admission to the 
hospital for medical reasons , admission to a behavioral health facility by volunta ry or involuntary 
commitment, discharge from the ED, or death ). A patient will contribute to the analysis once , using 
their initial enrollment to either arm of the study.  
5. OVERALL DESI GN 
5.1. Outcome Variables  
5.1.1.  Primary Outcome Variable  
The primary outcome variable is ED to hospital admission . This is a patient that presents to an Atrium 
Health ED and then is admitted for any reason . A patient’s disposition is tracked in the electronic 
medical record. The disposition is simply indicated a s admitted or not admitted .  
 
5.1.2.  Rates and Variable Descriptions  
a. Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender)  
b. Charlson comorbidity index score  
Version Number: 1. 3 
Version Date: 8-27-19 
  
12 c. Patient -centric defined 45 -day utilization rate. This is a utilization rate among patients with an 
ED, inpatient, or observation encounter to any Atrium Health facility (<= 45 days after the ED 
admit date ) 
d. Frequency of s elf-harm diagnos es within 45 days of  the index ED encounter  at any Atrium 
Health location facility (<= 45 days after the ED admit date)  
e. Frequency of patients who return to the ED and have a telepsychiatric consult (<= 45 days after 
the ED admit date)  
5.1.3.  Reporting for the Duke Foundation  
• Count/frequency of patients presenting to an ED that have a telepsychiatric consult during the 
intervention  
• Count/frequency of patients with an admission after telepsychiatric consult in the intervention arm  
• Count/frequency of patients enrolled in the BH -VPN program  
• Count/frequency of patients enrolled in the BH -VPN program  that ha ve an encounter with a self -harm

OBS) within 45 days of their ED visit  
• Count/frequency of patients enrolled in the BH -VPN program  that return to an Atrium Health 
emergency department with a telepsychiatric consult within 45 days of their ED visit  
 
PHQ -9 are taken about every 2 weeks during a patient’s enrollment. The post PHQ -9 score will be the score 
closest to the 45 -day follow -up period.   
• Count/frequency of patients enrolled in the BH -VPN program  that improve their PHQ -9 score, among 
patients with an initial score >10

PHQ -9 (Q9>0), that no longer report suicide ideation on their last PHQ -9 (Q9=0)  
• Count/frequency of patients enrolle d in the BH -VPN program  with successful case closure (complete 
the 45-day follow -up period or have a successful referral in care)   
 
5.2. Randomization and A llocation  
Randomization will be based on days the navigators are available to  treat patients who’ve completed 
their telepsychiatric consult. Patients may be in the ED for multiple days. Their enrollment status 
depends on the day and time of their initial telepsychiatric consultation. Navigation will only be 
available for those pati ents whose consult occurs during intervention day/times . As part of the research 
design and rollout of this project, randomiza tion will occur at the day level with the days being 
identified as intervention or usual care days for the duration of the study.  Patients will accrue in both 
arms of the study  during the navigators’ days and hours of operation . Patients will not be accrued on 
days where the navigators are not potentially available such as weekends, nights, and holidays.  
Version Number: 1. 3 
Version Date: 8-27-19 
  
13  
Block randomization will be used to assign days the intervention is offered. In each 7-day period 
(Monday through Saturday) there will be three  days the program is offered and three  days where the 
program is not offered. The program is not available to patients in the ED on Sundays. The hours of 
availability are 7AM to 11PM Monday through Friday and 7AM to 7PM on Saturdays.  
 
5.3. Behavioral Health Virtual Patient Navigation  (BH-VPN)  Program  
The BH -VPN outlines  the flow of patients from initial contact  to their follow -up calls  (see Appendix 1 ). 
In the existing ED workflow , patients are identified by a clinician in the ED as needing psychiatric 
evaluation and a referral is made to a tele -psych provider for a virtual consult. Patients who complete a 
telep sychiatric consult in the ED can be enrolled to either the control or intervention arm based on a 
randomization scheme that randomly allocates days that navigators are available. Psychiatrists are 
remin ded through daily communication as to whether the BH -VPN program is available and the ED 
locations. The psychiatrist will make a recommendation to admit or discharge the patient. The ED 
physician will make the final decision on whether to admit or discharge the patient from the ED.  
Patients that have a discha rge recommendation  on days the program is available , will be offered the 
BH-VPN program. Enrolled patients are followed for up to 45 days.  
 
If a discharge recommendation is made, a patient will be approached again by the navigator virtually 
for enrollment  into the BH -VPN program . The patient has the option not to be followed by the 
navigator. Before discharge, t he navigator will complete an initial virtual behavioral health assessment. 
The initial health assessment contains information such as preferred communication method, primary 
care provider, psychiatry provider, PHQ -9 screening, collateral resources, recent ED and hospital 
utilization, substance use disorder, medication barriers, appointment barriers, community resources, and 
crisis planning.  
 
The follow -up assessments, which will occur during navigation phone calls at least weekly , may 
include information such as a suicide ideation safe ty screening, an appointment reminder, appointment 
barrier evaluations, medication obtainment follow -up, substance use disorder follow -up, PHQ -9 
screening,  supportive listening, psychoeducation, community resource follow -up, and additional crisis 
planning.  Phone calls are weekly as standard care but may be more often depending on the individual 
needs of the patient.  Appointments are dependent on a patient’s specific needs and may be with a 
therapist or psychiatrist as well as other providers in the community such as primary care or referral to 
a community provider . 
 
The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) helps identify whether someone is at risk for 
suicide, and the severity and immediacy of the risk. It also identifies level of support the person needs. 
The screening tool is administered during each phone co ntact to measure suicide ideation. If a patient is 
deemed actively suicidal , then the navigator will recommend transfer to mobile crisis, call 911 for a 
well-check, or call 911 to send the patient to the ED  as per current standard of care .  
Version Number: 1. 3 
Version Date: 8-27-19 
  
14 5.4. Follow -up 
Patients being treated in the BH -VPN program  will receive a follow -up phone call within 24 to 72 
hours from discharge, and then weekly for up to 45 days. A follow -up assessment is completed upon 
each phone call.  
 
5.5. Patient Graduation  from the BH -VPN Program  
For the intervention arm, successful completion is defined as  
• Enrolled for 45 days post ED admit date  
• Enrolled in another Care Management program  
For the intervention arm,  failure to complete is defined  as 
 
• Unable  to connect: 4 calls attempted over 12 days 
• Death  
• Declined services  initially or after enrollment  
5.6. Continuation of the I ntervention  
Participating ED sites may continue utilizing the BH-VPN  program after the study period has ended.  
 
6. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING  
Patient demographics, comorbid conditions , and utilization will be obtained from the electronic medical 
record and billing systems. Data from the initial assessment and follow -up contacts will be stored in 
HealtheCare , a care management platform in Cerner . Data wi ll be retrieved by an application specialist on 
the research team.  Data may be retrieved retrospective to a patient’s completion of the intervention or usual 
care arm of the study.  
 
A bi-monthly  report will be produced  for the intervention arm . The report will be by ED site and overall . 
• Count of patients meeting the inclusion criteria

6.1. Sample size analysis  and statistical analysis  
Given the preliminary data from our previous study, we will power the proposed study to detect at least 
an 8% absolute difference between hospital admission in the VIBRANT intervention and usual care 
groups. The usual care group i s assumed to have a 60% inpatient admission rate based on prior data. 
There is 85% power to detect this reduction with a total sample size of 1,030 (α=0.05) using a Chi -
square test for independence. To account for the possible correlation among patients se en in the ED on 
the same day, we inflated the sample size by 10% assuming the average number of patients per ED per 
day is 2 with a 0.1 intra -class correlation coefficient (design effect = 1 + (2 -1)*ICC).14 Thus, the target 
sample size is n=1,133. The power was calc ulated using PASS 15 Power Analysis and Sample Size 
Software (2017). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA, ncss.com/software/pass.  
6.2. Statistical analysis  
Prior to analysis, descriptive statistics will be calculated to screen all variables for accuracy and to 
exam ine distributions.   
 
All analyses will follow the intention -to-treat (“ITT”) principle, such that patients will be analyzed 
based on their assignment to the BH -VPN program or usual care. Balance in baseline characteristics 
between the groups will be asses sed using Student’s t -test for normally distributed data, the Wilcoxon 
rank sum test for ordinal data or interval data that are not normally distributed, and the chi -square test 
for categorical data. Normality will be assessed using the Shapiro Wilk test a nd Q -Q plots.  
 
The primary outcome, hospital admission (yes/no), is a binary dependent variable and will be compared 
between the BH -VPN and usual care groups using a generalized linear mixed -effects model with a logit 
link function. To adjust for correlati on among patients seen on the same day and in the same ED, the 
model will include a random effect term for day nested within ED. The primary predictor in the model 
is an indicator for assignment to the BH -VPN program versus usual care. Additional baseline covariates 
will be included in the model if they are either strongly correlated with the dependent variable or show 
baseline imbalance between the two groups.  
 
A similar approach will be used for the secondary outcomes to assess the patient -centric 45 -day 
utilization rate, encounters with a self -harm diagnosis rate, and ED readmission rate. The models 
assessing these measures will be generalized linear mixed -effects  models with a logit link, where 
utilization, diagnosis, or readmission, (yes/no) is the bina ry dependent variable. Independent variables 
in the models will be as described above for the primary analysis.  
 
In addition, per -protocol analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be performed to evaluate 
the effect of BH -VPN program participati on, in contrast to the ITT analysis evaluating the effectiveness 
of randomization to the program. The per -protocol analyses will include only subjects who received 
and adhered to the treatment (BH -VPN program or usual care).  
Version Number: 1. 3 
Version Date: 8-27-19 
  
16  
Other binary outcome variables (e.g., frequency of patients active in the BH -VPN program) will be 
analyzed using descriptive statistics, unadjusted odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals.  
 
All tests will be two sided and the data will be analyzed using SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) .   
  
  
6.3. Data Collection Dates  
The implementation of the BH-VPN  will begin in October  2019 among patients with a completed 
telepsychiatric consult.

8. STUDY GOVERNANCE  
This randomized  trial will be conducted at Atrium Health. It will be run jointly by the Center for Outcomes 
Research and Evaluation (CORE) and the Behavioral Health Service  Line. Wayne Sparks , MD, (Psychiatry) 
will serve as the clinical principal investigator with oversight from the Executive Committee (EC). Jason 
Roberge, PhD, MPH will serve as co -principal investigator on behalf of CORE. The EC will consist of 
leaders acro ss the System involved in the trial, quality improvement, and implementation (Table 1). The EC 
will provide  trial oversight and direction. The EC will support dissemination of project findings and next 
steps. The EC will receive progress reports from the t eam. When appropriate, ad hoc committee meetings 
will be scheduled to discuss pressing concerns.

8.1. Protocol and Pathway Training  
Background, protocol and process steps  will be presented to psychiatrists and n urse practitioners who will 
be providing virtual psychiatric consultations. The role of virtual patient navigator  and randomization  
scheme will be presented  so expectations are clear that this is not available every day/time or weekends . 
This will be  prese nted at the Department of Psychiatry meeting , which include s Emergency and 
Telepsychiatry Departments. Attendees may also include providers, w ho at some point may see patients 
who have been through this pathway but  will not be dir ectly involved in providin g evaluations. Education 
will be  provided to the emergency d epartment  staff involved in this project , so that they are aware of th e 
process and the role of the virtual patient navigator . 
9. SAFETY RISK S AND REPORTING  
The data collection  and intervention for  this project presents no more than minimal risk to patients. The 
implementation  of the BH -VPN program and its components  complement  ongoing patient care through 
virtual patient navigation  within Atrium Health . The BH-VPN  program is currently offered at 10 urban 
EDs within Atrium Health. This study is evaluating the BH-VPN  program among additional rural EDs  that 
will offer the program to their patients. The addition of an evaluation design that align s with existing 
patient care where there are limited resou rces thus confers minimal  additional risk to patients.  
Version Number: 1. 3 
Version Date: 8-27-19 
  
18 Other potential risks of participation in this project include, the risk of health information disclosure. There 
is always the risk of disclosure of a patient’s private health information (PHI) or medi cal information. 
However, the processes identified in this protocol to enable the execution of this project, do not increase 
inherent risk of disclosure. Atrium Health utilizes several hard and soft safety controls in the protection of 
patient information and medical records. Security controls include, but are not limited to, multiple system 
firewalls, access restrictions to patient records and information, locked offices and buildings housing 
research and patient data, and multiple layers of username and p assword protected computer and system 
access. The project team will ensure that appropriate handling of patient PHI follows standard Atrium 
Health procedure. In the event of PHI disclosure, the appropriate internal departments will be informed and 
processe d per legislation and privacy regulations.  
 
9.1. Data Quality Assurance  
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the study protocol, standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) of CORE and Atrium Health, and other applicable regulations and 
guidelines (e.g. GCP).  
 
9.2. Data  Monitoring by the Sponsor  
The conduct of this project will abide by standard operating procedures set forth by both Atrium 
Health and CORE. The Principal Investigators, statistician, and other team members will meet as 
needed to review enrollment and retention, study progress, and validity/integrity of the data. 
Documentation of these meetings will be kept with study records.  
 
10. RESEARCH COMPLETION  
The Principal Investigator has the right to close the project  at an y site any time.  
For any closure, the following applies:  
• Closures should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• In case of a partial study or site closure, patients still participating in the BH-VPN program , or those 
who are considered in follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
 
The study will be considered complete when one or more of the following conditions is met:  
• The enrollment period has ended, and the data collection period is complete . 
• All subjects have dropped out or discontinued from the study  after the enrollment period is 
completed, but prior to data collection cutoff . 
• The IRB  or Principal Investigator discontinues the study.  
• The Principal Investigator defines an administrative or cl inical cut -off date.  
Version Number: 1. 3

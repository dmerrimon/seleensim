1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date
Original 20 December 2016
Amendment 1 20 January 2017
Amendment 2 27 July 2017
The purpose of this amendment is to:
DUpdate to Renal Biomarker Sample and Archive Plasma Sample in 
Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures.
Rationale:   To clarify that serum samples for tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-) will not be collected and analyzed.  Instead, the Archive Plasma 
samples collected throughout the study will analyze tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (TNF- ).
DUpdate Table 9 , Signature Amino Acid Positions and the Key Subset of 
Amino Acid Positions, in Section 8.1.4 , Resistance Analyses.
Rationale: To reflect the correct analyses of the signature amino acid position 
of GT3. 
DUpdate Appendix D , Study Activities – Post-Treatment (PT) Period.
Rationale:   To further clarify that Hematology/Chemistry/Coagulation will 
only be performed if the subject discontinues prior to PT Wk 4 unless the 
patient is cirrhotic, in which labs will be collected to test INR, total bilirubin 
and albumin in the Post-Treatment Period.
DUpdate pharmacokinetics-related text in Synopsis.
Rational e:  Removed from synopsis the text that was referring to the potential
population pharmacokinetic analysis that may be performed.  Details on this 
potential analysis are provided in Section 8.1.6.
DAdministrative and terminology changes and typographical and grammatical 
errors were corrected throughout the protocol.

Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir in Renally-Impaired Adults with Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 – 6 
Infection (EXPEDITION-5)
Objectives:  
!The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy (by evaluating the percentage of 
subjects achieving SVR 12) and safety of glecaprevir/pibren tasvir (GLE/PIB) in adults with 
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 – 6 infection with or without compensated 
cirrhosis and with chronic renal impairment in both HCV treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects.  The efficacy of GLE/PIB will be assessed based on the overall population (i.e., across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status) and the safety of GLE/PIB will be assessed by treatment duration and cirrhosis status across genotypes. 
!Secondary objectives are to assess the percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic 
failure and the percentage of subjects with HCV virologic relapse across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status.
Investigators:   Multicenter trial
Study Sites:   Approximately 40 sites globally
Study Population:   Chronic HCV GT1 – 6-infected adults aged 18 years or older with chronic renal 
impairment.  Subjects with renal impairment will include Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 3b (eGFR 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m
2), Stage 4 (eGFR 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and Stage 5 
(eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2or dialysis-dependent) subjects.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 120 subjects
Methodology:   
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
GLE/PIB for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in chronic HCV GT1 – 6 infected subjects with chronic renal 
impairment, with or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve (TN) or prior treatment-experienced (TE) with interferon (IFN) or pegylated IFN (pegIFN) with or without ribavirin 
(RBV), or sofosbuvir (SOF) plus RBV with or without pegIFN.
This study will enroll approximately 120 eligible subjects at approximately 40 sites.  Subjects with renal 
impairment will include CKD Stage 3b (eGFR 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m
2), Stage 4 (eGFR 15 to 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and Stage 5 (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2or dialysis-dependent) subjects.  The 
study enrollment will be monitored to meet the following non-mutually exclusive enrollment criteria:  (1) up to approximately 40 subjects with Stage 3b CKD, (2) up to approximately 75 HCV GT1-infected subjects, (3) up to approximately 30 subjects with compensated cirrhosis.

Methodology (Continued):  
Subjects will be enrolled to one of the following treatment arms:
!Arm A:  HCV GT1, 2, 4 – 6 subjects without cirrhosis who are TN or TE and HCV 
GT 3 subjects without cirrhosis who are TN will be treated for 8 weeks. 
!Arm B:  HCV GT1, 2, 4 – 6 subjects with cirrhosis who are TN or TE and HCV GT 3 subjects with cirrhosis who are TN will be treated for 12 weeks.  
!Arm C:  All HCV GT3 subjects who are TE will be treated for 16 weeks.
Note:  Subjects with mixed HCV genotype infection should receive whichever duration is longer based on their genotypes, cirrhosis status and treatment experience.  For subjects with an indeterminate genotype, treatment duration will default to the respective GT3 duration based upon treatment-experience and cirrhosis status.
The study will consist of a Screening Period, Treatment period and Post Treatment period:Treatment Period:
Enrolled subjects will receive GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg once daily (QD) for 8 weeks (Arm A), 12 weeks 
(Arm B), or 16 weeks (Arm C).  Scheduled visits in the Treatment Period consist of Day 1 and Weeks 4 and 8 for all subjects, an additional Week 12 visit for subjects in Arms B and C, and an additional Week 16 visit for subjects in Arm C.  Study procedures, including assessment of adverse events, vital 
signs, adherence, concomitant medications, HCV RNA, HCV resistance, glecaprevir and pibrentasvir pharmacokinetic assays, and clinical laboratory tests, will be conducted at each visit.
Post-Treatment Period:
Subjects who complete or prematurely discontinue the Treatment Period will be followed for 24 weeks 
in the Post-Treatment Period.
During the Post-Treatment Period, all subjects will have visits at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 following 
completion or premature discontinuation of the Treatment Period.  Study procedures to monitor safety, clinical laboratory tests, HCV RNA, and to evaluate the efficacy and the emergence and persistence of resistant virus will be conducted during these visits.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs):
The Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36™) will be used to assess the impact of kidney disease 
on a patient's quality of life.
Resistance:
The following information will be tabulated and summarized:  1) for all subjects with available samples, 
baseline polymorphisms at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence; and 2) for subjects who do not achieve SVR
12, post-baseline 
substitutions relative to baseline.
Pharmacokinetic:
Individual plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, and their possible metabolites will be 
tabulated and summarized.  
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug) based on overall population (i.e., across treatment 
durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status).  The primary endpoint will be analyzed based on intention-to-treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized 
with a two-sided 95% confidence interval based on the normal approximation of the binomial 
distribution unless the number of SVR 12non-responders is less than 5, where the Wilson's score method 
will be used to calculate the confidence interval.  No hypothesis will be tested.
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure across treatment arms
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse across treatment arms
For on-treatment virologic failure and post-treatment relapse, the number and percentage of subjects will 
be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method.  Analyses 
of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy subgroup analyses will be performed.
PROs:
Change from baseline to each applicable visit in the patient reported outcome summary measures will be 
summarized.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs and with available samples, baseline polymorphisms at signature 
resistance-associated amino acid positions identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and 
comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drugs who do not 
achieve SVR 12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA M 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
substitutions in available post-baseline samples identified by NGS and comparison to the baseline sequence, 2) the amino acid substitutions in available post-baseline samples at signature resistance-associated positions identified by NGS and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral substitutions by NGS.
Pharmacokinetic:
Individual plasma concentrations of glecaprevir, pibrentasvir, and their possible metabolites will be 
tabulated and summarized. 
Safety:
Safety summaries will be provided by the treatment duration and cirrhosis status and overall.  All 
subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug through 30 days post study drug dosing) will be tabulated by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term.  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be provided by grade and relationship to study drug.  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and vital sign values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by treatment duration and cirrhosis status across genotypes and overall.  Changes from baseline to post-baseline in the CTCAE grading of laboratory values will 
also be summarized.

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 
170 million individu als infected worldwide.1  There are 7 identified HCV genotypes, with 
genotype 1 (GT1) being the most prevalent worldwide.2  HCV genotypes 2 (GT2) and 3 
(GT3) infections are more common in Latin America (5% to 30%), Europe (20% to 40%) and Asia (30% to 45%).
3-5  HCV GT4 is commonly found in parts of Africa and the 
Middle East, particularly in Egypt, GT5 is primarily found in South Africa, and GT6 is 
primarily found in south-east Asia, and GT7 has recently been described in Central Africa.
6
Depending on various risk factors, between 10% and 40% of patients with chronic HCV infection will develop cirrhosis.
7  Death related to the complications of cirrhosis may 
occur at an incidence of approximately 4% per year; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in this population at an estimated incidence of 1% to 5% per year.
7  Patients 
diagnosed with HCC have a 33% probability of death during the first year.7  Successful 
treatment of HCV has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality as well as the development of HCC.
8,9
Infection with HCV is common among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) 
undergoing dialysis in the US, EU and Japan with a prevalence of 3% to 23%, depending on the country.
10  Among patients with ESRD, the presence of HCV correlates with 
higher rates of mortality than in the HCV-negative population.11  Therefore, patients with 
renal disease are an important special population for study when evaluating new HCV treatments.
While a significant proportion of the HCV-infected population has renal impairment, 
safety and efficacy data of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in patients with severe renal impairment (i.e., creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) is limited.  Currently approved regimens to treat patients with severe renal impairment include ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir with or without ribavirin (RBV) for HCV GT1 infection, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with RBV for HCV GT4 infection, and 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
18
elbasvir/grazoprevir with or without RBV to treat HCV GT1 and GT4 infection.12-14  The 
development of a safe and effective, RBV-free, pangenotypic regimen to treat HCV 
infected patients with severe chronic ki dney disease remains an important unmet medical 
need.
AbbVie is currently developing two "next generation" DAAs, glecaprevir (GLE, formerly 
known as ABT-493), an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir (PIB, formerly known as ABT-530), an NS5A inhibitor, for use in combination for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.  GLE and PIB each have potent in vitro antiviral activity against genotypes 1 through 6
15and a high genetic barrier to resistance, with no or little loss of 
potency against common resistant-associated substitutions.  Additive or synergistic in vitro anti-HCV activity has been demonstrated with the combination of GLE and PIB.  GLE 100 mg and PIB 40 mg are co-formulated into a fixed-dose combination tablet (hereafter referred to as GLE/PIB), which provides patients with a convenient once-daily (QD), fixed-dose combination treatment regimen of three tablets QD to maximize treatment compliance.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharmacol ogy and toxicology, in vitro virology 
and metabolism, and clinical data can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB)
Overview of GLE/PIB Registrational Program and Supportive Studies
The GLE/PIB registrational program included a broad subject population including 
subjects with compensated liver disease and subjects with severe renal insufficiency   across all genotypes using a single GLE/PIB dose of 300 mg/120 mg QD.  Supportive Phase 2 studies used the Phase 2 formulation of separate GLE and PIB tablets, with each tablet containing 100 mg and 40 mg, respectively.  Treatment arms from these supportive Phase 2 studies using the regimen selected for registrational studies (GLE 300 mg plus PIB 120 mg) were pooled with arms from the registrational studies for analyses of efficacy and safety.  Treatment-naïve (TN) and TE subjects to any combination of pegylated IFN (pegIFN), RBV, sofosbuvir (SOF), NS5A inhibitors, or PIs were allowed

in the program.  In addition, the program included subjects with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection (Study M13-590), subjects with chronic kidney disease [CKD] Stages 4 – 5, including those on hemodialysis (Study M15-462), subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Studies M14-172, M15-462, and M14-868 Part 3), and subjects with or without cirrhosis who failed a previous regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor and/or an NS3/4A PI (Study M15-410).
A total of 2,376 subjects were randomized or enrolled in the registrational studies or 
supportive Phase 2 studies to receive GLE 300 mg QD and PIB 120 mg QD.  Of these, 2,369 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug ( Table 1 ).

Impact of Baseline Polymorphisms on Treatment Outcome
The association between baseline polymorphisms and treatment outcome in subjects who 
received GLE 300 mg QD with PIB 120 mg QD in the registrational or supportive Phase 2 studies was evaluated by conducting an integrated analysis of baseline sequence 
data.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted on all baseline samples at 15% 
detection threshold at key amino acid positions 155, 156, and 168 in NS3, and 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, and 93 in NS5A. 
In subjects who were TN or TE-PRS, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 were detected in 
1.1% (9/845), 0.8% (3/398), 1.6% (10/613), 1.2% (2/164), 41.9% (13/31), and 2.9% (1/34) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 infection, respectively.  Baseline polymorphisms in NS5A were detected in 26.8% (225/841), 79.8% (331/415), 22.1% (136/615), 49.7% (80/161), 12.9% (4/31), and 54.1% (20/37) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, respectively.
The presence of baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A did not have an impact on 
SVR
12rates for GT1-, 2-, 4-, 5-, or 6-infected subjects.
Within GT3-infected subjects, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and the NS5A 
polymorphisms at positions 24, 28, 31, 58, 92, or 93 did not have an impact on treatment outcome. 
Amino Acid Substitutions in Subjects Experiencing Virologic Failure
Among TN and TE-PRS subjects with or without cirrhosis treated for 8, 12, or 16 weeks, 
23 subjects experienced virologic failure (2 with GT1, 2 with GT2, and 19 with GT3).  One GT3-infected subject experiencing virologic failure was determined to have been reinfected with GT3a virus distinct from the one present at baseline.  Therefore, baseline polymorphisms and treatment-emergent substitutions were analyzed for 22 subjects experiencing virologic failure. 
Among the 2 GT1-infected subjects, 1 had treatment-emergent substitutions A156V in 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
24
NS3 and Q30R/L31M/H58D in NS5A, and 1 had treatment-emergent Q30R/H58D (while 
Y93N was present at baseline and post-treatment) in NS5A.
Among the 2 GT2-infected subjects, no treatment-emergent substitutions were observed 
in NS3 or NS5A; the prevalent M31 polymorphism in NS5A was present at baseline and post-treatment in both subjects.
Among the 18 GT3-infected subjects, the majority of subjects had treatment-emergent 
variants at the time of failure in NS3 (61.1%, 11/18) and NS5A (88.9%, 16/18).  Treatment-emergent NS3 substitutions Y56H/N, Q80K/R, A156G, and Q168L/R were observed in 11 subjects, and A166S or Q168R was present at both baseline and post-treatment in 5 subjects.  Treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28G, A30G/K, L31F, P58T, or Y93H were observed in 16 subjects, and 13 subjects had A30K (n = 9) or Y93H (n = 5) at both baseline and post-treatment.
Integrated Safety Results
A summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) from pooled analyses of the 
registrational studies and supportive Phase 2 studies are presented in Table 3 .  The 
severity of the underlying renal disease and its associated comorbidities in patients with 
CKD Stages 4 and 5, the frequency and severity of the AEs in subjects enrolled Study M15-462 were expected to be higher than in subjects enrolled in the other registrational studies.  Therefore, the summary of adverse events reported in Table 3 does 
not include the results of Study M15-462 which is listed separately.
As shown in Table 3 , the AEs occurring with a frequency M 5% are headache, fatigue, 
nausea and diarrhea.  The majority of subje cts experienced an AE, which were mostly 
considered to be mild in severity by the investigator (Grade 1).  Rates of AEs that were 
serious, led to premature study drug discontinuation or had a severity Grade M 3 were low.  
Including data from Study M15-462, there were 7 deaths, none of which were related to study drug, and the majority occurred several months after the last dose of study drug.

Cross reference:  Summary of Clinical Safety R&D/16/0147:  Table 2.2__2.2, Table 2.2__3.2
Adverse events in subjects without cirrhosis (n = 1,977) were similar in type, frequency, 
and severity compared with subjects with cirrhosis (n = 288).  The safety profile in subjects with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection (n = 33) was similar to that in HCV monoinfected subjects.  Overall, the safety profile of GLE/PIB in the elderly population ( M 65 years old, 
n = 328) was comparable to the safety profile in the non-elderly population (n = 2,041).
In Study M15-462, GLE/PIB was generally well-tolerated in subjects with CKD Stage 4 
and 5 as evidenced by a treatment discontinuation rate of 1.9% (2/104) due to AEs that were considered DAA-related.  No subject experienced a serious AE that was assessed as DAA-related.  The safety profile in subjects in Study M15-462 was consistent with

underlying ESRD and its associated comorbidities.  Pruritus was the most common AE 
among subjects (20.2%) in this study followed by fatigue (14.4%) and nausea (11.5%).  Pruritus was not an unexpected finding, as it is commonly observed in patients with severe renal impairment.  Laboratory abnormalities were infrequent with no subject experiencing a Grade 3 or higher elevation in ALT or AST and 1 subject experiencing a Grade 3 elevation in total bilirubin.  
The frequency and severity of hepatic-related AEs as well as liver chemistry 
abnormalities evaluating potential hepatotoxicity were low across the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Liver-related safety results indicated that:
DFour subjects had post-nadir Grade 3 ALT abnormalities or Grade 2 ALT with 
total bilirubin M 2 × ULN.  None of these subjects prematurely discontinued 
study drug due to an ALT or bilirubin increase.
oALT abnormalities in 3 of these 4 subjects were not clinically significant 
oOne subject experienced concurrent ALT > 3 × ULN (increased from nadir 
grade) and total bilirubin M 2 × ULN in the context of multiple gallstones 
and was not consistent to have drug-induced liver injury
DBased on exposure-response analyses, no exposure-dependent ALT increases 
were observed in subjects with ALT abnormalities 
DGrade 3 increases in bilirubin were infrequent (0.4%) and without bilirubin-
related AEs; none were associated with liver disease progression
DNo subjects experienced drug-related he patic decompensation.  One subject 
with cirrhosis (Study M14-172) who had known esophageal varices 
experienced an episode of esophageal varices hemorrhage that was considered not related to study drug.  Treatment was continued without clinical or 
laboratory signs of liver disease progression.  
A total of 6 (0.3%) subjects experienced a de novo event of HCC.  In all 
6 subjects, the events were considered related to subject's medical history of underlying liver disease and not to GLE/PIB.

In summary, GLE/PIB demonstrated a favorable safety profile similar across durations of 
8, 12, and 16 weeks.  The regimen was well tolerated across a broad and diverse population of subjects, including subjects with cirrhosis, HIV coinfection, and CKD Stage 4 or 5.   
Common study drug-related AEs occurring in M 5% of subjects were headache, fatigue, 
nausea and were mostly Grade 1 (mild) in severity.  Serious AEs and AEs leading to 
premature study drug discontinuation were rare.  There were no hematological or blood 
chemistry findings of concern or considered likely related to treatment.  Unlike other 
protease inhibitors, no liver-related toxicities and no cases consistent with drug-induced liver injury were identified.
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB in CKD 
Stage 3b, 4 and 5 subjects with HCV GT1 – 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis.
3.1 Differences Statement
The Phase 3 registration Study M15-462 evaluated GLE/PIB for a duration of 12 weeks, 
regardless of cirrhosis status or prior treatment experience, in HCV GT1 – 6-infected subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m
2) or ESRD (estimated GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or requiring 
dialysis).  The patient population in Study M16-127 will be expanded compared to 
Study M15-462 to include subjects with less severe chronic renal disease by including up to 40 subjects with CKD Stage 3b (eGFR 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m
2) and will also 
include HCV GT3-infected subjects with prior treatment experience.  Compared to Study M15-462 which evaluated a single treatment duration of 12 weeks, the present study will evaluate treatment durations 8, 12 and 16 weeks based on HCV genotype, cirrhosis status and prior treatment experience.

3.2 Benefits and Risks
This Phase 3b study is a three arm study in which eligible HCV GT1 – 6 infected subjects 
will receive GLE/PIB for 8, 12 or 16 weeks based on their genotype, cirrhosis status and prior treatment experience.  The combination of GLE/PIB has been evaluated in six Phase 3 registration studies and three Phase 2b supportive studies.  The results of these studies suggest that the likelihood of successfully demonstrating a high SVR
12rate in 
HCV GT1 – 6 subjects with renal impairment is high.
The Phase 3 Study M15-462 evaluated a 12 week duration of GLE/PIB in 104 CKD 
Stage 4 and 5 subjects, including 85 subjects on hemodialysis, with HCV GT1 –6 infection with and without cirrhosis.  The SVR
12rate of 98% (102/104) was observed 
based on the ITT population; no subject experienced virologic failure.  In addition, the 
regimen was generally well-tolerated in subjects with renal impairment as evidenced by a low treatment-discontinuation rate due to AEs, no drug-related serious AEs, AEs that were mostly mild to moderate in severity and infrequent laboratory abnormalities.  These 
results support the recommendation that adults with chronic HCV infection and severe renal impairment and ESRD follow the duration recommendations for subjects with normal renal function.  
At present, no DAA regimen is approved for use in patients with HCV GT 2, 3, 5 and 
6 infection with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).  In addition, approved DAA regimens for use in patients with HCV GT1 and 4 often include the use of RBV which is associated with toxicity in this patient population.  There fore, identification of a 
safe, efficacious, RBV-sparing regimen is a benefit for the CKD Stage 4 and 5 population.  
Moreover, an 8 week treatment duration in HCV GT1 – 6 treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis is a benefit compared to currently available regimens which are typically 12 weeks or more in duration.  Other potenti al benefits of treatment with GLE/PIB 
include a higher genetic barrier to development of drug resistance compared to 
first generation protease and NS5A inhibitors and the development of resistance was infrequently observed as high rates of SVR
12were demonstrated across the Phase 2 and 
3 studies.

In the Phase 2 and 3 studies, no significant toxicity or trends in liver chemistry 
abnormalities were observed and rates of study drug-related-SAEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were low.  Case s of potentially clinically significant ALT and 
total bilirubin elevations were rare in the Phase 2 and 3 analysis set with ALT elevations 
> 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) occurring in < 0.1% (2/2,265) subjects and total bilirubin elevations > 3 × ULN occurring in 0.4% (8/2,265) subjects; no cases consistent with drug induced liver injury (DILI) were reported.  No subject discontinued study drug due to ALT or bilirubin elevations.
Additional risks associated with GLE/PIB include the development of 
resistance-associated substitutions.  In subjects treated with a DAA, amino acid substitution(s) in the targeted protein conferring resistance to the DAA can be selected.  It is expected that PIB, an NS5A inhibitor, will be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing resistance-associated substitutions in NS3 that confer resistance to GLE, because there should not be any cross-resistance in substitutions resistant to DAAs targeting different proteins.  The converse is expected to be true as well – GLE should be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to PIB.  In addition, in vitro resistant colony selection studies in HCV replicon cells containing GT1 – 6 NS5A demonstrated that PIB had a high genetic barrier to resistance – very few colonies were selected, and most of those that were selected contained NS5A substitutions that conferred only modest levels of resistance to PIB.  Based on accumulated clinical and in vitro data to date, the risk of development of resistance-associated substitutions during GLE and PIB combination trials is reduced when compared to treatment with first generation protease and NS5A inhibitors.  The combination of PIB and GLE achieved high SVR rates with few virologic failures in the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  These results support the prediction that the risk of development of resistance-associated substitutions with GLE and PIB combination treatment is low.
Risks associated with GLE/PIB, including the risks of AEs, hepatic laboratory
abnormalities, virologic failure and develop ment of resistance-associated substitutions, 
appear limited and manageable based on the results from the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Given

the potential for achieving high rates of cure  in renally-impaired HCV GT1 – 6 subjects, 
the risk-benefit balance is favorable.
4.0 Study Objective
4.1 Primary Objective
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy (by evaluating the 
percentage of subjects achieving SVR 12) and safety of GLE/PIB in adults with chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 – 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis and with chronic renal impairment in both HCV treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects.  The efficacy of GLE/PIB will be assessed based on the overall population (i.e., across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status) and the safety of GLE/PIB will be assessed by treatment duration and cirrhosis status across genotypes.
4.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives are to assess efficacy of GLE/PIB based on overall population 
(i.e., across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status) by evaluating the following:
DThe percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure;
DThe percentage of subjects with HCV virologic relapse.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in HCV GT1 – 6-infected subjects with chronic renal impairment, with or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve or prior treatment-experienced with interferon [IFN] or pegylated IFN [pegIFN] with or without RBV, or sofosbuvir [SOF] plus RBV with or without pegIFN.

This study will consist of a Screening Period, a Treatment Period and a Post-Treatment 
Period.
Screening Period:  Subjects have up to 42 days following the Screening Visit to confirm 
eligibility and enroll into the study.Treatment Period:  Eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg 
QD for 8 weeks (Arm A), 12 weeks (Arm B), or 16 weeks (Arm C). Post-Treatment Period:  Subjects who complete or prematurely discontinue the Treatment 
Period will be followed for 24 weeks after their last dose of study drug to evaluate 
efficacy and to monitor HCV RNA, and the emergence and persistence of viral substitutions.
A study schematic is shown below in Figure 1 .

The study enrollment will be monitored to meet the following non-mutually exclusive 
enrollment criteria:  (1) up to approximately 40 subjects with Stage 3b CKD, (2) up to approximately 75 HCV GT1-infected subjects, (3) up to approximately 30 subjects with compensated cirrhosis. 
The study population will include subjects w ith HCV GT1 – 6; subjects with mixed HCV 
genotype infection should receive whichever duration is longer based on their genotypes, 
cirrhosis status and treatment experience.  For subjects with an indeterminate genotype, treatment duration will default to the respective GT3 duration based upon treatment-experience and cirrhosis status.
Subjects with renal impairment will be categorized during screening as having CKD 
Stage 3b, Stage 4 or Stage 5; CKD categorization for each subject at screening will be used throughout the study.  These categories are defined according to eGFR in Table 4
below:
Table 4. Definition of Chronic Kidney Disease Stages
CKD Stage eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)*
3b 30 to < 45
4 15 to < 30
5 < 15 or requiring dialysis
* eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × (Serum Creatinine)–1 154× Age–0 203× (0.742 if female) × (1.21 if black).
The study was designed to enroll approximately 120 eligible subjects to meet scientific 
and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if th e target number of subjects has been enrolled, 
there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
5.1.1 Screening Period
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study-specific procedures will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system.  The investigator w ill evalu ate whether 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
34
the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2
during the period from the Screening Visit through Study Day 1 prior to dosing, and will 
record the results of this assessment and the details of the informed consent process in the subject's medical records.  Eligible subjects have up to 42 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into the study.
5.1.1.1 Rescreening
Subjects who at Screening have any of the following are not eligible to rescreen or retest:
DA positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); or
DHBV DNA > LLOQ in subjects with isolated positive anti-HBc (i.e., negative 
HBsAg and Anti-HBs); or
DA confirmed positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test; or
DA confirmed positive pregnancy test (if female).
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria with the exception of laboratory parameters may 
retest once within the 42-day screening period without prior AbbVie approval.
Subjects who have exclusionary laboratory parameter(s) are allowed to retest on the 
related panel(s) (e.g., exclusionary albumin requires a repeat chemistry panel) within the 
same screening period and must meet all eligibility laboratory criteria on any panel that is repeated.  If any of the retest result(s) are exclu sionary, the subject may not be rescreened.
Subjects who fail to enroll within 42 days of Screening, regardless of the reason for falling outside of the 42-day screening window, may be allowed to rescreen only once without approval of the AbbVie Scientific Dire ctor.  These subjects must be rescreened 
for all laboratory and eligibility criteria, not just those that were exclusionary.
For subjects who rescreen or subjects that do not meet the study eligibility criteria 
including upon retest/rescreen, the site personnel must contact the IRT and identify the subject as a screen failure.

M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
35
Subjects who rescreen and meet all eligibility criteria to enroll to the study will retain the 
same subject number, assigned at the Screening Visit, throughout the study.
5.1.2 Treatment Period (TP)
After meeting the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled via IRT system.  Subjects 
will be administered study drug at the site on Study Day 1, with dosing instructions.
Study visits and procedures during the Treatment Period are detailed in Appendix C .  
Safety and tolerability will be assesse d throughout the study.  Laboratory testing will 
include chemistry and hematology as specified in Table 6 .  Plasma samples for 
pharmacokinetic analysis and HCV RNA analysis will be collected as detailed in 
Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.1.1 .  Blood samples for optional pharmacogenetic analysis 
will be collected as detailed in Appendix C .
All subjects will continue to return to the site on an outpatient basis as outlined in 
Appendix C .  Sites should ensure that subjects adhere to all study visits.  Subjects who 
cannot complete their study visit per the visit schedule should ensure they do not run out 
of study drug prior to their next study visit.  Compliance is critical to ensure adequate 
drug exposure.
HCV virologic failure criterion will be evaluated and applied by the investigator as 
detailed in Section 5.4.1.1 .
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period should return for a Treatment Discontinuation Visit and undergo the study procedures as outlined in Appendix C and as described in Section 5.4.1 .
5.1.3 Post-Treatment (PT) Period
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and either complete treatment or 
prematurely discontinue study drug will be monitored in the Post-Treatment Period for safety, clinical laboratory tests, HCV RNA, and the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions for an additional 24 weeks following the last dose of study drug. 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60

5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving from the time of signing the consent through the Treatment Period and 30 days after study drugs are stopped, must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) along with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage information including dose, route and frequency.  The investigator should review all concomitant medications for any potential interactions.
During the Post-Treatment Period, all medications taken will be recorded until 30 days 
following the last dose of study drugs.  After 30 days post-treatment, during the Post-Treatment Period, only antiviral therapies related to the treatment of HCV and medications prescribed in association with a serious adverse event (SAE) will be recorded in EDC.
The AbbVie Scientific Director should be contacted if there are any questions regarding 
concomitant or prior therapies.
5.2.3.1 Prior HCV Therapy
Subject must be HCV treatment-naïve (i.e., patient has not received a single dose of any 
approved or investigational anti-HCV regimen) or treatment-experienced (i.e., has failed prior IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy).  Previous HCV treatment must have been completed M 2 months prior to 
screening.  
Subjects will be categorized as:
DHCV treatment-naïve:  subject has never received any treatment for HCV 
infection.
DSubjects with an allowed prior treatment will be categorized as:

of a prior treatment course but HCV RNA was detectable (or quantifiable) following cessation of therapy.
^Other:   subject received a prior treatment course and reason for not 
achieving SVR is other than above.
^Unknown:   subject received a prior treatment course and reason for not 
achieving SVR is unknown.
For subjects who had multiple HCV treatment courses, the categorization of previous 
response category will be based on the last prior treatment.
5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
The investigator should confirm that a conc omitant medication/supplemen t can be safely 
administered with study drugs.  Some medications may require dose adjustments due to 
the potential for drug-drug interactions.  The investigator should refer to product labeling as needed to determine if, due to renal impairment, some medications may be contraindicated or require dose adjustment.

Management of hematopoietic growth factor therapy, if initiated by the investigator 
during the study, is the responsibility of the investigator; growth factors will not be provided by AbbVie, and AbbVie will not reimburse for the expense of growth factors or 
their use.  Investigators should refer to the current package inserts of the growth factors 
for additional information regarding their use.
During the Post-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess concomitant 
medications/supplements, and subjects may resume previously prohibited medications/supplements or revert to pre-study doses 14 days following discontinuation of study drugs as applicable.
5.2.3.3 Prohibited Therapy
Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications or supplements 
listed in Table 5 at least 14 days or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the

5.3 Efficacy Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacogenetic and Safety 
Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C and Appendix D .
5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
Informed Consent 
Signed study-specific informed consent will be obtained from the subject before any study 
procedures are performed.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Medical History
A complete medical history, including history of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, will be taken at Screening.  The subject's medical history will be updated at the Study Day 1 Visit.  This updated medical history will  serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at visits specified in Appendix C or 
upon subject discontinuation.  A symptom-directed physical examination may be performed at any other visit, when necessary.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
45
The physical examination performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the baseline physical 
examination for clinical assessment.  Any significant physical examination findings after the first dose will be recorded as adverse events.
Height will be measured only at Screening.  
Vital Signs and Weight
Body temperature, blood pressure, pulse and body weight will be measured at each study 
visit as specified in Appendix C and Appendix D or upon subject discontinuation.  Blood 
pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes.  The subject should wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing.  The vital signs performed on Day 1 of the Treatment Period will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12-lead resting ECG will be obtained at the Screening visit as indicated in Appendix C .  
The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection.
The ECG will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site ("local 
reader").  The local reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the 
following categories:
DNormal ECG
DAbnormal ECG – not clinically significant
DAbnormal ECG – clinically significant
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source.  The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine-generated measurements and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
46
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained at a minimum for the clinical laboratory tests outlined in Table 6
at the visits indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D .
Blood samples for serum chemistry tests should be collected following a minimum 8-hour 
fast prior to drug intake (with the exception of the Screening Visit, which may be 
non-fasting).  Subjects whose visits occur prior to the morning dose of study drug should 
be instructed to fast after midnight until the blood sample is collected in the morning and thereafter take their study medications with food.  Subjects whose visits occur following the morning dose of study drug should be instructed  to fast after breakfast until the study 
visit occurs.  At the Study Day 1 visit, a fasting blood sample should be collected prior to 
the first dose of study drug, which should be taken with food.  Blood samples should st ill 
be drawn if the subject did not fast for at least 8 hours.  Fasting or non-fasting status will be recorded in the source documents and on the laboratory requisition.

Liver Diagnostic Testing
Subjects will be considered to be non-ci rrhotic or cirrhotic based on the definitions below:
Non-Cirrhotic
DA liver biopsy within 24 months prior to or during Screening demonstrating 
the absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, 
Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of ] 3, Ishak fibrosis score of ]  4; or
DA FibroScan®score of < 12.5 kPa within ] 6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period; or
DA Screening FibroTest score of ] 0.48 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to 
Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) < 1.
Cirrhotic
DPrevious histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on liver biopsy, e.g., METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of > 3, Ishak 
score of > 4 or on a liver biopsy conducted during Screening; or
DA FibroScan
®score of M 12.5 kPa at any time prior to screening or during 
Screening period; or
DA Screening FibroTest result that is M 0.75 and an APRI > 2.
In the absence of a qualifying liver biopsy, subjects with an indeterminate FibroTest result 
(0.48 < result < 0.75), or conflicting FibroTest and APRI results (e.g., FibroTest ] 0.48, 
but APRI M 1) should be evaluated based on the investigator's clinical judgment to 
determine the presence or absence of cirrhosis. 
If more than one method is used to determine the presence or absence of cirrhosis, the 
results of a liver biopsy will take precedence over FibroScan and FibroTest/APRI and the results of FibroScan will take precedence over FibroTest/APRI.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening 
HCC screening will be required as a protocol-specified study procedure only at the 
Screening Study Visit and at the last Post-treatment Study Visit, as indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D , for subjects with compensated cirrhosis only.  Between 
those visits, HCC screening should be performed according to standard of care.
At the Screening Study Visit and at the last  Post-treatment Study Visit, subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis will be required to have a liver ultrasound performed on them to 
screen for HCC, unless the subject has a historical liver ultrasound, CT or MRI performed for HCC screening within 3 months prior to thos e visits, in which case the result of the 
historical US, CT or MRI will be used as the result for the Study Visit assessment.  A positive ultrasound result suspicious of HCC will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI.  Alternate methods of screening for HCC (i.e., MRI or CT) at a study visit should be discussed with the study designated physician.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Instruments (Questionnaires)
Subjects will complete the self-administered PRO instruments (where allowed per local 
regulatory guidelines) on the study days specified in Appendix C and Appendix D .  
Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  
Subjects who are functionally unable to read the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaires to them.  Site personnel should encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits and should ensure that a response is entered for all items. 
PRO instruments should be completed prior to drug administration on Day 1 and on 
subsequent visits, the PRO instrument should be administered prior to any discussion of adverse events or any review of laboratory findings, including HCV RNA levels.

and may be performed by a non-GLP laboratory.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.
If, during the course of study drug administration, the subject prematurely discontinues, 
the procedures outlined for the applicable Premature D/C Visit should be completed as defined in Appendix C and Appendix D .  Ideally this should occur on the day of study 
drug discontinuation, but no later than 2 days after their final dose of study drug and prior 
to the initiation of any other anti-HCV therapy.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment.  The last dose of any study drug and reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the EDC (electronic data capture) system.  The subject should then begin the Post-Treatment Period where the subject will be monitored for 24 weeks for HCV RNA, the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions.
If a subject is discontinued from study drug or the Post-Treatment Period with an ongoing 
adverse event or an unresolved laboratory result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved.
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject 
reports becoming pregnant during the Treatment Period, the administration of DAAs may be continued at the Principal Investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
61
the benefit of continuing DAAs is felt to outweigh the potential risk.  Specific instructions 
regarding subject pregnancy can be found in Section 6.1.6.  Subjects will be monitored for 
SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3 .  
5.4.1.1 HCV Virologic Failure Criteria
The following criteria will be considered evidence of HCV virologic failure for the 
purposes of subject management:
DConfirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV 
RNA measurements of > 1 log 10IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during 
treatment; or
DConfirmed HCV RNA M 100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements M 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during treatment.
When confirmatory testing is required, it shoul d be completed as soon as possible and the 
subject should remain on study treatment until the virologic failure criteria has been 
confirmed.  Subjects meeting virologic failure criteria will be discontinued from study 
drug and will continue to be followed in the Post-Treatment Period for the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions until 24 weeks post-treatment.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safety 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination.

5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open-label study.5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
At the start of the study, each subject should receive counseling regarding the importance 
of dosing adherence with the treatment regimen with regard to virologic response and potential development of resistance.
At each study visit during the Treatment Period denoted in Appendix C , subjects will be 
instructed to bring all bottles of study drug (full, partial or empty) for assessment of 
treatment compliance.  At post-baselin e dispensing visits denoted in Appendix C , study 
site personnel will assess subject compliance by inspecting the contents of the bottles and 
record the status of each one, as well as the exact number of remaining tablets of GLE/PIB in the source and IRT.  Treatment compliance will be based on the number of tablets dispensed, as recorded in IRT, and the number of remaining tablets.  If poor compliance is noted, the subject should be counseled and this should be documented in the subject's source.

5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The investigator or his/her representative will verify that study drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by signing and dating the 
Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar document and via recording in the IRT system.  A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be kept by the investigator and will include lot number, kit number, number of tablets dispensed, subject number, initials of person who dispensed study drug, and date dispensed for each subject.  An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by the AbbVie monitor throughout the Treatment Period.  The monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.  Final accountability will be verified by the monitor at the end of study drug treatment at the site.
During the study, should an enrolled subject misplace or damage a study drug bottle of 
GLE/PIB the IRT system must be contacted and informed of the misplaced or damaged study drug.  If the bottle is damaged, the sub ject will be requested to return the remaining 
study drug to the site.  Replacement study drug ma y only be dispensed to the subject by 
contacting the IRT system.  Study drug repl acement(s) and an explanation of the reason 
for the misplaced or damaged study drug(s) will be documented within the IRT system.  
The study drug start date and the last dose of the regimen will be documented in the subject's source documents and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  The status of each bottle, number of tablets remaining in each one returned, and the date of reconciliation will be documented in the IRT system.  The monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.
Upon completion of or discontinuation from the Treatment Period, all original study drug 
bottles (containing unused study drug) will be returned to AbbVie (or designee) or destroyed on site.  All destruction procedure s will be according to instructions from the 
Sponsor and according to local regulations following completion of drug accountability procedures.  The number of tablets of each type of study drug returned in each bottle will be noted in the IRT system or on a drug accountability log (if appropriate).  Labels must remain attached to the containers.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLE/PIB administered 
for 8, 12 or 16 weeks in renally impaired subjects (CKD Stages 3b to 5) with HCV GT1 –
6, with or without compensated cirrhosis.  The combination regimen of GLE/PIB was 
evaluated in non-renally impaired HCV GT1 – 6 infected subjects with and without 
compensated cirrhosis in the registrational studies and in CKD Stage 4 and 5 subjects with and without cirrhosis in the EXPEDITION-4 study (discussed in detail in Section 3.0).  
Based upon the results of these studies, AbbVie plans to evaluate the same combination regimen of GLE/PIB used in the registrational studies in an expanded population of renally-impaired subjects for durations consistent with the proposed label-recommendation.  The selection of a three arm study design is appropriate in order to ensure that subjects receive the appropriate treatment duration based on their genotype, cirrhosis status and prior treatment experience.  
In view of the expected high SVR rate in this study and the established safety profile of 
GLE/PIB in patients with renal impairment, a control arm would be of limited value for efficacy comparison.  In this context, an open-label, three-arm study is appropriate to adequately describe the efficacy and safety of this regimen when administered for the proposed label recommended durations.  
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard pharmacokinetic, statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized 
in this study.  HCV RNA assays are standard and validated.  Clonal and population sequencing methods are experimental.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
This study is planned to enroll treatment-naïve or previous treatment-experienced (IFN or 
pegIFN with or without RBV, pegIFN/RBV plus SOF, or SOF plus RBV) chronic HCV GT1 – 6-infected subjects, with or without compensated cirrhosis, with CKD Stages 3b to 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
67
5.  With the exception of CKD Stage 3b subjects and the more inclusive eligibility criteria 
implemented in this study (e.g., GT3 treatment-experienced subjects, removal of specific laboratory, BMI and medical history exclusion criteria), the population enrolled in this 
study will be comparable to the population enrolled in the EXPEDITION-4 study.  In 
addition, with the exception of renal impairment, the study population is comparable to that enrolled in the broader registrational Phase 2 and 3 studies in non-CKD subjects.  
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
5.6.4.1 Rationale for Dose Selections
The dose of GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg to be used in this study is the proposed label-
recommended dose.  These doses have been administered to over 2,300 subjects in the registrational program, and have shown high SVR
12rates with a favorable safety profile.
5.6.4.2 GLE and PIB Dose and Treatment Duration
The Phase 3 study EXPEDITION-4 evaluated a 12 week duration of GLE/PIB in 
104 CKD Stage 4 and 5 subjects, including 85 subjects on hemodialysis, with HCV GT1 – 6 infection with and without cirrhosis.  The SVR
12rate of 98% (102/104) and no 
virologic failure was observed in this study support the use of GLE/PIB in renally-impaired subjects.  In the registrional program, the efficacy in CKD patients was comparable to that observed for non-CKD subjects, suggesting that treatment recommendations for CKD patients should fo llow those for patients without renal 
impairment.  Therefore, the current study will evaluate the proposed GLE/PIB label recommended treatment durations.  
As described in Section 3.0, the high SVR
12rates observed in non-CKD patients with and 
without cirrhosis support the proposed recommended treatment durations of 8, 12, and 
16 weeks based on genotype, cirrhosis status and prior treatment experience.

6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the physical characteristics, iden tity, quality, purity, potency, durability, 
reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.
Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ).  For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.1
through 6.1.5 .  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
69
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are usually not considered to be AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs).  However, laboratory abnormalities or changes in vital signs that result in study drug discontinuation or interruption, necessitate 
therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7
regarding toxicity management) and/or are deemed clinically significant by the 
investigator, should be recorded as AEs or SAEs as defined in Section 6.1.1.1 and 
Section 6.1.1.2 .
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occ ur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
70
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, bl ood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4).
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
71
The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI CTCAE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific grading details for that AE entity.
Grading system for Adverse Events (a semi-colon indicates 'or' within the description of 
the grade).
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL*
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
Assessment of relatedness will be made with respect to the DAAs (GLE/PIB).  The 
investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study drug:
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
72
Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the 
event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and 
potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the 
event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and 
potential alternative causes, there is insufficient
evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related nonserious adverse events 
(e.g., infection at liver biopsy site) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug administration until 30 days following di scontinuation of study treatment has 
elapsed, all adverse events and serious adverse events will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  After 30 days following completion of study treatment and throughout the Post-Treatment Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious AEs will not be collected).
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by entering the serious adverse event data into the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.

6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Administration of study drug may be continued at the investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if the benefit of continuing therapy is felt to outweigh the risk (Section 5.4.1 ).  If a subject is discontinued, the subject 
will be monitored for SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3 .
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected for pregnancies occurring up to 30 days after the end of treatment.  
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  The medical outcome for 
either mother or infant, meeting any serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.7 Toxicity Management
For the purpose of medical management, all adverse events and laboratory abnormalities 
that occur during the study must be evaluated by the investigator.  All adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be managed  and followed to a satisfactory clinical 
resolution.  A toxicity is deemed "clinically significant" based on the medical judgment of 
the investigator.  The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is to be used in the grading of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities , which is available on the Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf.
Specific toxicity management guidelines apply to the instances of: increases in ALT 
(Section 6.1.7.1 ).

76
6.1.7.1 Management of Transaminase Elevation
If a subject experiences a post-baseline increase in ALT to > 5 × ULN and also > 2 × the 
baseline value, the subject should have a confirmatory ALT measurement performed.  If the ALT is confirmed to be > 5 × ULN and also > 2 × the baseline value, the recommendations below should be followed:
DComplete hepatic questionnaire.
DEvaluate for an alternate etiology for ALT elevation; document in the source, 
update the medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable), and obtain HBsAg, Anti-HBc IgM, Anti-HBc Total, Anti-HBs, HBV DNA, 
Anti-HAV IgM, Anti-HAV IgG, Anti-HEV IGM, Anti-HEV IgG, and HEV 
RNA and other additional tests, as appropriate.
DManage the subject as medically appropriate.
DRepeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and INR within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
DDiscontinue study drugs if any of the following is observed at any time:
^ALT level is M 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
^Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of other symptoms/signs of liver 
failure.
^At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of ALT increases requires approval of the AbbVie TA MD.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition

78
Primary Contact: Alternate Contact:
Such contact must be made as soon as possible to permit a review by AbbVie to 
determine the impact of the deviation on the subject and/or the study and whether any instances of protocol non-compliance should be reported to regulatory authorities as a serious breach of GCP and the protocol.
8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The primary analysis will occur after all subjects have completed the PT Week 12 Visit or prematurely discontinued study.  The data for the primary analysis will be locked after data cleaning.  Data after PT Week 12 will be added to a new version of the database which will be cleaned and locked at the end of the study.
SAS
®(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) for the UNIX operating system will be used for all 
analyses.  All confidence intervals will be  two-sided with an alpha level of 0.05.
Descriptive statistics will be provided, such as the number of observations (N), mean, and 
standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and counts and percentages for discrete variables.
Safety and demographic analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least 
one dose of study drug.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
79
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population defined as 
all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug, unless otherwise 
specified.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, when applicable, will be performed 
on the intention-to-treat population modified to exclude subjects who did not achieve SVR
12for reasons other than virologic failure (mITT-VF).
No data will be imputed for any efficacy or safety analysis except for analyses of SVR 
endpoints (HCV RNA data).  HCV RNA values will be selected for the analyses of all SVR endpoints (e.g., SVR
4, SVR 12, and SVR 24) based on defined visit windows.  A 
backward imputation method will be used to impute missing responses for SVR analyses.
8.1.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects in the ITT 
population by arm (A, B and C) and overall.  Demographics include age, weight, height, BMI, gender, race, and ethnicity.  Baseline characteristics will be summarized as continuous variables (where appropriate) and as categorical variables, including all subgroup variables defined in Section 8.1.2.4 , and including HCV genotype and subtype,  
prior HCV treatment history, baseline HCV RNA level, fibrosis stage (F0 – F1, F2, F3, or F4), dialysis (yes or no), CKD stage (Stage 3b, Stage 4, Stage 5), cirrhosis (yes/no), tobacco (user, ex-user, or non-user) and alcohol use (drinker, ex-drinker, or non-drinker) status, former injection drug user (yes, within last 12 months; yes, more than 12 months ago; or no), use of stable opiate substitution, history of diabetes, history of depression or bipolar disorder, and geographic region.
All the demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized as continuous or 
categorical variables where appropriate.  Summary statistics (N, mean, median, SD, and range) will be generated for continuous variables (e.g., age and BMI), and the number and percentage of subjects will be presented for categorical variables (e.g., sex and race).
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60

Treatment compliance to study drug will be calculated based on the percentage of tablets 
taken relative to the total tablets expected to be taken.  A subject is considered to be compliant if the percentage is between 80% and 120%.  Compliance will be calculated for each subject and summarized with the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The percentage of compliant subjects will be summarized.
8.1.2 Efficacy
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population, unless otherwise specified.  
The efficacy analyses will be performed based on overall population, i.e., across treatment
durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status. 
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by the central 
laboratory using the Roche COBAS
®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan®HCV Quantitative 
Test, v2.0.  The notation "HCV RNA < LLOQ" is used to represent all HCV RNA values < 15 IU/mL that are HCV RNA detected or HCV RNA not detected.  HCV RNA M LLOQ 
are all quantifiable values.
8.1.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR
12(HCV 
RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug) based on overall 
population across treatment durations, genotypes, and cirrhosis status.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval using the normal approx imation to the binomial distribution, unless 
the number of SVR 12non-responders is less than 5, where the Wilson's score method will 
be used to calculate the confidence interval instead.
A summary of reason for SVR 12non-response (e.g., on-treatment virologic failure, 
relapse, other) will be provided.

8.1.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
DThe percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure (defined 
as confirmed increase of > 1 log 10IU/mL above nadir during treatment, 
confirmed HCV RNA M 100 IU/mL after HCV RNA < LLOQ during 
treatment, or HCV RNA M LLOQ at the end of treatment with at least 6 weeks 
of treatment), and 
DThe percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse (defined 
as confirmed HCV RNA M LLOQ between end of treatment and 12 weeks 
after the last dose of study drug among subjects who completed treatment as 
planned with HCV RNA < LLOQ at the end of treatment; excluding subjects who have been shown to be reinfected)
For the analysis of post-treatment HCV virologic relapse, completion of treatment is 
defined as any subject with study drug duration of 52 days, 77 days, and 103 days or greater for subjects allocated to treatment durations of 8 weeks, 12, and 16 weeks, respectively.
For on-treatment virologic failure and post-treatment relapse, the number and percentage 
of subjects will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% CI using Wilson's score method.
8.1.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis
As sensitivity analyses, the number and percentage of subjects in the mITT-VF population 
achieving SVR
12, as applicable, will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval using the normal approximation and a two-sided 95% CI using the Wilson's score method.
The two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method will also be 
calculated as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint of SVR
12based on ITT 
population.

DThe percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 4(SVR 4 weeks after the last 
actual dose of study drug);
DThe percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 24(SVR 24 weeks after the last 
actual dose of study drug);
DThe percentage of subjects who relapse after achieving SVR 12.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each additional efficacy endpoint w ill be 
summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson's score 
interval.
8.1.3 Patient Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete the self-administered PRO instrument (where allowed per local 
regulatory guidelines) on the study days specified in Appendix C and Appendix D . 
Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other th an encouragement to complete the tasks.  
Subjects who are functionally unable to read the instrument may have site personnel read the questionnaire to them.  Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all sp ecified visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
The mean change from baseline to each applicable post-baseline timepoint in KDQOL-36
(SF-12, burden of kidney disease, symptoms and problems and effects of kidney disease on daily life) will be summarized descriptively at each visit and for change from baseline to each post baseline visit.
Additional analyses of PROs will be performed as useful and appropriate.The PRO instrument should be completed prior any study procedures at each visit and 
prior to any discussion of adverse events or any review of laboratory findings, including HCV RNA levels.

8.1.4 Resistance Analyses
For all subjects, full length NS3/4A and NS5A from baseline samples will be sequenced 
by NGS.  For subjects who do not achieve SVR 12, full length NS3/4A and NS5A from the 
first sample after failure/discontinuation with HCV RNA M 1000 IU/mL will be 
sequenced by NGS.  An appropriate subtype specific prototypic reference sequence will 
be used for comparison with sequences fro m samples.  Subjects treated with study drug 
who do not achieve SVR 12due to reasons other than virologic failure but have a time 
point with HCV RNA M 1000 IU/mL after treatment discont inuation, will have the sample 
at that time point sequenced.
Only samples with an HCV RNA level of M 1000 IU/mL will undergo sequence analysis 
in order to allow accurate assessment of products of amplification.  Therefore, if the HCV 
RNA level at the time of HCV virologic failure or treatment discontinuation is < 1000 IU/mL, the sample closest in time after HCV virologic failure/treatment discontinuation with an HCV RNA level M 1000 IU/mL will be used.  Included time 
points for analyses on samples from subjects who do not achieve SVR
12are 1) the sample 
closest in time after failure/discontinuation with an HCV RNA level of M 1000 IU/mL,
and 2) 24 weeks post-DAA treatment, provided that resistance-associated substitutions were detected by NGS at the time of HCV virologic failure/treatment discontinuation.
For each DAA target, signature amino acid positions and a key subset of amino acid 
positions are listed in Table 9 .  Appropriate subtype specific prototypic reference 
sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.

The following definitions will be used in the HCV resistance analyses:
DBaseline polymorphism:  a polymorphism by NGS in a baseline sample ( M 2% 
or M 15% prevalence within a subject's viral population depending on 
polymorphism frequency threshold utilized) that was not present in the 
appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA target 
(NS3/4A or NS5A).
DPolymorphism/substitution at a signature amino acid position:  polymorphism 
(relative to reference) present in a baseline sample or substitution (relative to baseline) present in post-baseline sample at a signature amino acid position.
DPost-baseline substitution:  an amino acid substitution in a post-baseline time 
point sample that was not detected at baseline (< 2%) in the subject and is 
detectable in M 2% of the sequences from the post-baseline sample.
DEnriched polymorphism:  polymorphism present in both the baseline and a post-baseline sample whose prevalence in the post-baseline sample is at least 20 percentage points greater than the prevalence in the baseline sample 
[(post-baseline % – baseline %) M 20]
DTreatment-emergent substitution:  A post-baseline substitution or an enriched 
polymorphism.
Analysis 1:   The following analyses will be provided for all subjects, separated by HCV 
subtype:

amino acid positions for each DAA target (NS3/4A and NS5A).
DA listing of all baseline polymorphisms (15% detection threshold) at non-
signature amino acid positions for each DAA target (NS3/4A and NS5A) for 
subjects who experience virologic failure.
DA by subject listing of baseline polymorphisms (15% detection threshold) at signature amino acid positions in subjects with polymorphisms across both 
NS3 and NS5A, or those with multiple baseline polymorphisms within any 
one target (NS3/4A or NS5A).

subset of amino acid positions in NS3 only,  in NS5A only, any in NS3, any in 
NS5A, any in NS3 or NS5A, any in NS3 + NS5A, by subtype, and total  
(include all subtypes).
Analysis 2:   The impact of baseline polymorphisms on treatment outcome will be 
assessed as follows:  for each polymorphism, the SVR
12rate will be calculated for 
subjects with and without the polymorphism and the 2 rates will be compared.  Analysis 
will be grouped by HCV subtype and DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A). 
The following will be included in the analyses of impact of baseline polymorphisms on 
treatment outcome:
DFor each signature amino acid position, presence of any polymorphism at that 
position (vs no polymorphism at that position), using detection thresholds of 
both 2% and 15%.
DEach individual polymorphism at each signature amino acid position (vs not 
that polymorphism) using detection thresholds of 2% and 15%.
DPolymorphisms at each non-signature amino acid position at a detection 
threshold of 15%.

amino acid position relative to the baseline amino acid sequence will be 
provided for each DAA target (NS3/4A and NS5A).
The persistence of post-baseline substitutions at signature amino acid positions for each 
target will be assessed by NGS at Post-Treatment Week 24.  A listing by subject and time point of all post-baseline substitutions relative to the baseline amino acid sequence will be provided for each DAA target.
If resistance-associated substitutions are not detected in a given target for a subject at the 
time of failure/discontinuation, then that target may not be sequenced in subsequent samples from that subject.
HCV Genotype/Subtype
Phylogenetic analysis will be conducted on HCV NS3/4A and/or NS5A sequence from 
baseline samples from all subjects in order to accurately determine genotype/subtype.  If 
the phylogenetic analysis is not available, then the result from Sanger sequencing of a 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
88
region of NS5B by AbbVie or by the Central laboratory will be used to determine the 
subject's HCV genotype/subtype, if available.  Finally, if neither the phylogenetic analysis result nor the Sanger sequencing assay results is available, then the Inno-LiPA assay results from the Central laboratory will be used to categorize the subject.  This information will be presented in summaries of efficacy subgroup analyses.
8.1.5 Safety
Safety summaries will be provided by treatment duration and cirrhosis status across 
genotypes and overall.  All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  
8.1.5.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsen s in severity after initiation of study drug 
through 30 days post-study drug dosing) will be tabulated by primary MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events by severity grade and relationship to study drug (DAAs) also will be provided.  Subjects reporting more than one adverse event for a given MedDRA preferred term will be counted only once for that term using the most severe grade for the severity grade table and the most related for the relationship to study drug tables.  Subjects reporting more than one type of event within a SOC will be counted only once for that SOC.
Additional analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.
8.1.5.2 Clinical Laboratory Data
Clinical laboratory tests will be summarized at each visit.  The baseline value will be the 
last non-missing available measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.  Mean changes from baseline to each post-baseline visit, including Final Treatment Visit, will be 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
89
summarized descriptively.  Changes from baseline to post-baseline in the CTCAE grading 
of laboratory values will also be summarized.
8.1.5.3 Vital Signs Data
Mean changes in temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and weight 
from baseline to each post-baseline visit, including Final Treatment Visit, will be summarized descriptively.  The number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-defined criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) vital signs values will be summarized.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses
Plasma concentrations of GLE, PIB, and their possible metabolites will be tabulated for 
each subject and group.  Summary statistics will be computed for each time and visit.  
Plasma concentration data from this study may be combined with data from other studies 
and analyzed using the following general methodology:
Population pharmacokinetic analyses may be performed using the actual sampling time 
relative to dosing.  Population pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect modeling approach (NONMEM) with the NONMEM software (Version VI, or higher version).  The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of data from previous studies.  Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of the PK analytes will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.  Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional estimation technique using NONMEM.

Relationship between exposure (noncompartmental or population pharmacokinetic model 
based values of concentrations over time, AUC, C trough or some other appropriate measure 
of exposure) and clinical observations (antiviral activity or virologic end points, such as SVR
12response) will be explored, if appropriate.  Exposure-response relationships for 
primary and secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.  Exposure response relationships will be explored using a logistic regression analysis and/or a semi-mechanistic viral dynamic model.  Additionally, relationship between exposure and safety endpoints of interest may also be explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is anticipated that approximately 120 HCV GT1 – 6 infected subjects with chronic renal 
impairment, with or without compensated cirrh osis, who are either HCV TN or TE with 
IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN will be enrolled in the study.  No formal hypothesis is being tested.  If the observed SVR
12rate in 
this study is 97% among 120 HCV GT1 – 6 renally  impaired subjects, then the half-width 
of 2-sided 95% normal approximation interval is 0.031.
8.3 Randomization Methods
This study is not randomized.  Eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study.
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., adve rtisements used to recruit subjects) and 
any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the 
ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
91
advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a 
study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval and approval by 
Regulatory Authority (ies), if required by local regulations, prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to ICH GCP and all other applicable regulatory requirements.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local 
regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A .
9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
92
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related 
procedures and that the subjec t received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Pharmacogenetic analysis will only be performed if the subject has voluntarily signed and 
dated a pharmacogenetic informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The pharmacogenetic informed consent must be signed before the pharmacogenetic testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the pharmacogenetic testing, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional pharmacogenetic 
exploratory research samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once AbbVie is informed, the optional samples will be dest royed.  However, if the subject withdraws 
his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data.
10.0 Source Documents and Case Report Form 
Completion
10.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records.  This may include 
hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x-rays.  Data collected during this study must be recorded to the appropriate source document.  The Investigator Awareness Date (SAE CRF) may serve as the source 
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
93
for this data point.  This adverse event data point required for eCRF completion can be 
entered directly in the eCRF.
The investigator(s)/institution(s) will perm it study-related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this 
study.  These forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to AbbVie and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called Rave
®provided by the 
technology vendor Medidata Solutions Incorporated, NY, USA.  The EDC system and the 
study-specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The documentation related to the validation of the EDC system is available through the vendor, Medidata, while the validation of the study-specific eCRFs will be conducted by AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will 
be recorded by investigative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation.
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person 
performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  For any correction, a reason for th e alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will 
be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by AbbVie personnel (or their representatives).  AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries.  The principal investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide his or her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.
Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir
M16-127 Protocol Amendment 3EudraCT 2016-004182-60
94
Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a 
password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
11.0 Data Quality Assurance
To ensure data integrity and subject safety, a study monitor will continuously, throughout the study, verify that all subjects sign the informed consent prior to any study specific procedures being conducted, that the protocol procedures are being followed appropriately, and that the information provided in the eCRF is complete, accurate, and supported by information in source documents.
Computer logic and manual checks will be created  to identify items such as inconsistent 
study dates.  Any necessary corrections will be made to the eCRF.
12.0 Use of Information
Any research that may be done using optional pharmacogenetic exploratory research 
samples from this study will be experimental in nature and the results will not be suitable for clinical decision making or patient management.  Hence, the subject will not be informed of individual results, should analyses be performed, nor will anyone not directly involved in this research.  Correspondingly, researchers will have no access to subject identifiers.  Individual results will not be reported to anyone not directly involved in this research other than for regulatory purposes.  Aggregate data from optional exploratory pharmacogenetic research may be provided to investigators and used in scientific publications or prese nted at medical c onventions.  Optional exploratory research 
information will be published or presented only in a way that does not identify any individual subject.

Section 1.2  Synopsis
Subsection Statistical Methods:
Heading "Pharmacokinetic:"Delete:  last paragraph
Pharmacokinetic data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for 
the population pharmacokinetic analyses.  Actual sampling times relative to dosing will be used for the analyses.  Pharmacokinetic models  will be built using a non-linear mixed-
effect modeling approach with the NONMEM software.  The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of data from previous studies in HCV-infected subjects and healthy subjects.  Apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of glecaprevir, pibrentasvir, and their possible metabolites will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses.  Relationship between exposure and clinical observations (antiviral activity) will be explored.

 1. OBJECTIVES  
We hypothesize that a behavioral dietary intervention designed to modestly increase cruciferous 
vegetable intake in patients with Non -Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) will significantly 
reduce recurrence and progression. Findings from our in vitro , in vivo , and epidemiologic studies1-
10 have shown that dietary isothiocyanates (ITCs) exert potent anti -cancer activities against bladder 
cancer. ITCs are a group of phytochemicals primarily derived from cruciferous vegetables and oral 
consumption of dietary ITCs can be rapidly metabolized, de livered to the bladder, and 
concentrated in the urine —rendering the abnormal bladder epithelium the best target. In our 
retrospective study1, higher consumption of raw cruciferous vegetables was associated with 
reduced bladder cancer -specific and overall mortality.  
We will use the ORBIT  Model11 to translate our strong preclinical findings into a novel, dietary 
behavioral intervention to reduce bladder cancer recurrence and progression in diverse patients 
with NMIBC. We will partner with the New York State Cancer Registry (NYSCR) to recruit and 
enroll eligible patients and their clinical care providers in our catchment area, which is 
characterized by a disproportionally high risk of and mortality rate for bladder cancer. The dietary 
intervention will be based on Social Cognitive Theory12 and developed in collaboration with our 
Community Advisory Board consisting of bladder cancer care providers and patients to ensure 
optimal uptake by survivors. To facilitate the rapid translation of research into evidence -based 
practice, implementation s upport strategies will be identified at the clinic level as an incremental 
step towards integrating the dietary behavioral intervention into current healthcare systems serving 
patients with bladder cancer. The study’s specific aims are:  
Specific Aim 1:   Develop an evidence -based behavioral intervention to increase cruciferous 
vegetable intake, with the goal of attaining desirable urinary ITC levels effective for anti -cancer 
activities. We will work with our Community Advisory Board to adapt materials an d methods 
from current evidence -based fruit and vegetable interventions and leverage our findings on ITC 
yield from cruciferous vegetables to develop our dietary intervention, using a systematic process 
consisting of information gathering, d iscussion groups, and mock intervention delivery.  
Specific Aim 2: Conduct a feasibility pilot of our dietary behavioral intervention through a hybrid 
I implementation randomized controlled design in 80 NMIBC survivors, where the treatment 
group (n=40) will receive an evidence -based telephone intervention to increase cruc iferous 
vegetable intake and the control group (n=40) will receive a general fruit and vegetable intake 
intervention based on NCI guidelines. The primary outcomes will be cruciferous vegetable intake 
and urinary ITC levels, and the secondar y outcome will be gene expression changes in urinary 
exfoliated epithelial cells as a surrogate for intermediate efficacy.  
Exploratory Aim:  Engage the clinical care providers of patients enrolled in our intervention to 
ascertain the barriers and facilitators of intervention implementation within clinical practice 
through conducting 20 semi -structured interviews. The goal is to gain feedback a nd refine the 
intervention for “real -world’ implementation.  
Primary Objective(s)  
•  Develop an evidence -based behavioral intervention to increase cruciferous vegetable 
intake, with the goal of attaining desirable urinary ITC levels effective for anti -cancer 
activities. We will work with our Community Advisory Board to adapt materials and  
methods from current evidence -based fruit and vegetable interventions and leverage

 our findings on ITC yield from cruciferous vegetables to develop our dietary 
intervention, using a systematic process consisting of information gathering, discussion 
groups, and mock intervention delivery.  
• Conduct a feasibility pilot of our dietary behavioral intervention through a hybrid I 
implementation randomized controlled design in 80 NMIBC survivors, where the 
treatment group (n=40) will receive an evidence -based telephone intervention to

general fruit and vegetable intake intervention based on NCI guidelines. The primary 
outcomes will be cruciferous vegetable intake and urinary ITC levels.  
Secondary Objective(s)  
• The secondary outcome will be to ascertain the level of gene expression changes in 
urinary exfoliated epithelial cells (due to the intervention) as a surrogate for 
intermediate efficacy.  
Exploratory Objective(s)  
• Engage the clinical care providers of patients enrolled in our intervention to ascertain 
the barriers and facilitators of intervention implementation within clinical practice 
through conducting 20 semi -structured interviews. The goal is to gain feedback an d 
refine the intervention for “real -world’ implementation.  
2. BACKGROUND  
The problem of bladder cancer.    Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the US, 
contributing to over 80,000 new cases and 17,000 deaths annually2. The majority of bladder cancer 
(70-80%) is diagnosed at an early stage with cancer confined to the epithelial and lamina propria 
layer of the bladder —also known as non -muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)4. The standard 
treatment for NMIBC is transurethral resection of bladder tumor, which is a routine clinic 
procedure without hospitalization. Howeve r, NMIBC typically recurs (50 -80%) with some 
patients experiencing multiple recurrences at similar stages and others (20 -30%) progressing to 
muscle -invasive disease, which is associated with cystectomy and poor survival3-5. Depending on 
pathological characteristics, approximately 15% of tumors are defined as high -risk and receive one 
or more doses of intravesical therapeutic agents6, of which Bacillus Calmette –Guerin (BCG) has 
been the gold standard for four decades7. Yet approximately 30% of these patients  will be non -
responders to BCG, and high incidence of local side effects are concerns7. For the majority of 
NMIBC patients, no other treatment is available, although they are still at risk of recurrence and 
progression. Current clinical management requires life -long surveillance by cystoscopy for 
NMIBC patients, amounting to bladder cancer being the most expensive cancer to treat per 
patient8-10. An estimated 696,440 people are living with bladder cancer in the US23, the majority 
of which are off treatment and under surveillance. Novel, non -invasive, cost -effective strategies to 
control NMIBC recurrence and progression are urgently needed.  
Dietary isothiocyanates (ITCs) in bladder cancer chemoprevention.   Dietary ITCs are a group 
of phytochemicals primarily derived from cruciferous vegetables (cruciferae) with multi -faceted 
anti-cancer mechanisms. Our group has published 10 peer -reviewed papers11-20 involving in vitro , 
in vivo , and epidemiologic studies demonstrating the important role of dietary ITCs and ITC -rich 
cruciferae in preventing bladder cancer recurrence and progression. The four most common dietary 
ITCs and their primary urinary me tabolites potently inhibited the growth of a panel of human 
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 5 of 175 
 bladder cancer cells including NMIBC cells with IC 50 values around 10µM averagely15, 17,  which 
is realistically achievable in the urine with a single oral dose of ITC at 10 µmol/kg weight in rats24. 
ITC at 10 µmol/kg (approximately 1 mg/kg) is also readily achievable in humans, with some 
cruciferae yielding as much as 3.4 mg ITC per gram25. Daily oral administration of ITC at the same 
dose level for three weeks significantly inhibits orthotopic bladder cancer growth20. Importantly, 
we demonstrated that die tary ITCs not only inhibit bladder cancer development, but also prevent 
tumor progression into muscle -invasive disease18, 20.  Our group also discovered that orally 
ingested ITCs are rapidly and almost exclusively delivered to the bladder and concentrated in 
urine, showing 2 -3 orders of magnitude higher concentration of ITCs and metabolites in the urine 
than in the plasma withi n 3 hours of dosing18, 20. Storage of the urine in the bladder further enhances 
exposure of malignant cells to ITCs.  Therefore, thi s unique metabolism and disposition pathway 
makes the bladder the best target for ITCs or ITC -rich cruciferae. In our retrospective study of 239 
bladder cancer patients11, 12, raw cruciferae  intake was inversely associated with bladder cancer 
risk, and importantly, associated with a significantly improved disease -specific survival (hazard 
ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval = 0.25 -0.74).  
Low cruciferae intake in bladder cancer survivors (BCS).   Although the potential beneficial 
effect of dietary ITCs in bladder cancer is compelling, the consumption of the primary dietary 
resource of ITCs —cruciferae —is generally low among BCS. An average of 0.45 serving per day 
was observed in our retrospective study12, similar to the report of the daily consumption of 0.44 
servings in a pilot study of 48 BCS26. Preliminary analysis of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) 
data from over 1,400 newly diagnosed N MIBC patients from our Be -Well study (R01CA172855)27 
reported that daily intake of cruciferae was about 52.7 gram, or approximately 0.7 servings; while 
urinary ITC level was around 4.4 µM, which is below the averagely 10 µM of ITCs observed to 
stop or kill at least 50% of bladder cancer cells in in vitro  models15, 17. Based on our recent findings 
on the diverse range of ITC yield from cruciferae and the various impact of cooking methods on 
the ITC yield28, 29, we believe that at least one serving (~1 cup ra w or ½ cup cooked) of cruciferae 
per day , with guidance on the choice of vegetables and cooking conditions, will increase urinary 
ITC levels to the desirable doses needed to exert anti -cancer activities in the bladder.  
Lack of interventions to increase cruciferae intake.   Systematic reviews30-34 and meta -
analyses35 have documented the effectiveness of behavioral dietary interventions to increase 
vegetable intake in adults, including older and male participants, who comprise the majority of 
BCS4. Only one study tested an intervention designed to increase vegetable intake in BCS26. 
Compared to control participants, intervention participants significantly increased their daily 
vegetable intake (2.4 to 3.9 servings) from base line to 6 -months, but not cruciferae intake. The 
intervention also failed to deliver the corresponding increase in urinary ITC concentrations, 
showing comparable ITC levels between intervention and control groups at 6 -month follow -up. 
We will use our prior work  to maximize ITC exposure in the following ways: 1) ITC yield varies 
as much as 300 -fold from raw cruciferae28, thus we will recommend proper vegetables (e.g. 
arugula, cabbage) in our intervention; 2) heavily cooking largely reduces ITC yield, while l ightly 
cooking substantially increases ITC yield from cruciferae28. Thus, we will recommend proper 
cooking conditions (e.g. stir -frying, microwaving) in our intervention; 3) peak urinary 
concentration is achieved within 3 hours of dosing and more than 50% of the dose is excreted and 
accumulated in urine within 8 hours of  dosing20, 36. Thus, we will recommend consumption at 
dinner time to avoid ITCs being quickly excreted out of body from frequent urination during the 
day.

 Scientific  premise.   Bladder cancer will recur in the majority (50 -80%) of NMIBC  patients, yet 
current management is close monitoring with additions of intravesical therapies for a small portion 
of patients (15%) only4, 6. Effective interventions are needed to prevent disease recurrence and 
progression and improve cancer -specific survival for NMIBC survivors with minimum side 
effects, participant/provider burden, and cost. Robust preclinical and epidemiological data 
document the promising anti -cancer effect s of cruciferae as a source of ITCs against bladder 
cancer. N umerous dietary interventions have effectively increased vegetable intake in diverse 
adults.  Yet an effective intervention designed to improve bladder cancer prognosis through 
increasing cruciferae intake has not been developed. We propose to translate our basic science 
research findings in dietary ITCs and bladder cancer into an evidence -based behavioral 
intervention for NMIBC patients with potential for population -level impact.  The proposed research 
will accelerate what we currently know into an intervention that could meaningfully impact cancer 
survivorship in  a population at high risk of recurrence and progression that are currently under 
surveillance.  
Preliminary Studies.  Dr. Tang’s work has documented the anti -cancer potential of dietary ITCs 
and ITC -rich cruciferae against bladder cancer11-20. Her recent findings on ITC composition data 
in food commonly consumed in the Western diet and the effects of cooking methods on ITC yield 
from cruciferae28 informed the proposed intervention. Dr. Tang co -led the Be-Well study  
(R01CA172855), a prospective cohort of NMIBC survivors27, which provided data to support the 
need of a behavioral dietary intervention to increase cruciferae intake to boost urinary ITC levels. 
Dr. Yeary led The WORD study  (2P20MD002329 -06), a behavioral weight loss trial of 426 adults 
that included a dietary component to meet intake goals of at least 5 -9 servings of fruits and 
vegetables a day38. The intervention significantly increased vegetable intake by 3.44 (1.51, 5.36) 
servings from baseline to 6 months. Components of this intervention will be used in our cruciferae 
intervention for BCS.

in the Western New York area. Recruitment for both patients and physicians will take place over 
the span of two years (study duration).  
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 8 of 175 
 5. LOCAL AND STUDY -WIDE RECRUITMENT METHODS  
Patient Recruitment. Using ICD -O-3 codes provided, Dr. Kuliszewski of the NYSCR will lead 
her staff to identify qualifying patients from their database based on the study’s eligibility 
requirements. The NYSCR has identified 199 cases that meet the study’s eligibility criteria in 2018 
and anticipate at least 400 eligible cases in  total in 2018 and 2019. A total of 250 eligible patients 
will be contacted to enable researchers to recruit from a pool of at least 100 patients. In prior 
studies, 52.4% to 62.5% of  patients contacted by the NYSCR agreed to be contacted by researchers 
for study consent. The NYSCR will send a letter to the physician of record for selected cases 
notifying that the patient was identified for the study, requesting that the NYSCR be notif ied if the 
patient is unable or ineligible to participate in the study, and requesting information about the 
case’s primary care physician if different from the contacted physician.  If no contraindication has 
been received from the physician or if the phys ician has not responded within 3 weeks, the NYSCR 
will send an informational packet to the patient. The packet will contain: 1) a letter with study 
information; 2) a participant information sheet; and 3) a release of information consent form. After 
two wee ks without response, a reminder packet will be sent and followed with up to five phone 
calls. If the NYSCR can’t reach the patient, the patient will be considered a refusal. The NYSCR’s 
materials and procedures will be reviewed by the New York State Depart ment of Health IRB.  For 
patients who agree to be contacted about the study, the NYSCR will securely share the patient’s 
name, contact information, and information about their diagnosis with the Roswell study team 
through a secure file transfer. We estimate that from the pool of at least 100 patients who consent 
to be contacted, we will be able to obtain informed consent from at least 80 patients (80%). 
Research staff will contact patients who have agreed to be contacted by phone, whereby they will 
provide a  general study overview and conduct a screening interview to confirm eligibility. Staff 
will obtain informed consent to participate in the study by phone; the consent form along with a 
Participant Welcome Letter ( Appendix O) will be mailed to participants for record. To assist with 
study retention, we will ask participants for contact information to be used in follow -up. 
Participants will also be given incentives for completing study assessments. The Roswell  study  
team  will share  information  with the NYSCR  team  on the patients  who agree  to participate  in the 
study,  as well as any information  obtained  from  study  participants  that does not match  the 
information  provided  from  the NYSCR  database  (e.g.,  race,  ethnicity).  
Roswell  Park  Cancer  Registry.  Due to low enrollment  from  the NYS  Cancer  Registry,  we will 
also recruit participants from the Roswell Park Cancer Registry that meet the study’s eligibility 
criteria. To avoid overlap with NYS Cancer Registry patients, we will identify potential 
participants by focusing on patients diagnosed within last fi ve years and exclude patients 
diagnosed within 2018 -2019 (original parameters for the NYS Cancer Registry recruitment list). 
Study staff will consult with Roswell Park urolog ist to determine if the patient is unable or 
ineligible to participate in the study. The patients accessioned from the Roswell Park Cancer 
Registry will be contacted by letter (See Appendix T) asking them to participate in the study. Study 
staff will follow -up with potential participants to determine whether they received the letter and if 
they are interested in participating.  
Physician Recruitment. We will ask intervention participants to nominate physicians to 
participate in a short 15 -minute semi -structured interview. Research staff will mail an invitation 
letter to nominated physicians that will include an information sheet ( Appendix J), opt -in/opt -card 
card, and stamped reply envelope. Within 2 -weeks, physicians who do not respond will be 
contacted by phone, fax, or email with no more than 5 attempts. Participating physicians will

10/31/2022   Page 9 of 175 
 receive $100. Physicians who verbally consent to participate will be asked to refer other physicians 
to the study. Community Advisory Board (CAB) members will also utilize their networks to 
nominate physicians for staff to contact. We will recruit up to 20  physicians to ensure data 
saturation61. Among clinicians involved in cancer treatment, enrollment rates between 46.3% -92% 
have been reported60, 62, 63, with one study reporting an enrollment rate of 48% among clinicians 
involved in bladder cancer treatmen t62. Out of the 80 participants enrolled in our intervention, we 
anticipate 40 to nominate their physicians and we expect to receive referrals for 5 additional 
physicians from enrolled physicians and 5 physicians nominated by our CAB. Given an anticipated 
enrollment rate of 48%, we anticipate recruitment of 20 physicians.  
6. MULTI -SITE RESEARCH  
Since this is NIH funded study, Single IRB will be pursued for the NYS DOH (NYS CR) and 
Roswell Park will be serving as the IRB of Record.

 8. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
Primary Endpoint(s)  
• Urinary ITC levels  will be measured using HPLC -based cyclocondensation assay14, 51, 
which measures ITCs and metabolites as low as a few picomoles and has been routinely 
performed in Dr. Tang’s laboratory. The results will be adjusted by urinary creatinine 
level using creatinine assay kits (Caymen, Ann Arbor, MI). Cruciferae intake  will be 
assessed using a questionnaire adapted from Thomson et al.52 to capture both intake 
and cooking styles.   
Secondary Endpoint(s)  
• Gene expression  will be evaluated via RNA -seq as a surrogate for intermediate 
efficacy, conducted at Roswell Park’s Genomics Shared Resource using NextSeq500 
platform (Illumina Inc.). We have worked with the Genomics core to optimize the 
extraction of RNA samples from ur ine. With the addition of TRIzol ™ right before the 
storage of the cell pellet samples, we were able to extract sufficient amounts of RNA 
and generate high quality RNA -seq data. Dietary intake  will be evaluated by three non -
consecutive 24 -hour dietary recal ls (two weekdays, one weekday) conducted by trained 
staff using the interview -administered Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR)53. 
• Additional urinary metabolites and potential biomarkers will be explored using 
proteomic and/or metabolomic approaches.  
Exploratory Endpoint(s)  
• Our exploratory endpoint will be identification of barriers, facilitators, and other 
process -related measures relevant to informing the implementation of an evidence -
based cruciferae intervention within clinical practice.  
9. DESIGN  
We will use a Hybrid I implementation randomized -controlled design to simultaneously gather 
outcomes regarding the intervention’s feasibility and process data to facilitate wide -spread 
implementation and dissemination of the intervention into clinical prac tice if the intervention is 
effective. A total of 80 patients will be recruited on a rolling basis. Forty will be randomized to 
intervention and 40 to control.

 10. TREATMENT  
The planned evidence -based behavioral intervention using techniques associated with effective 
dietary change in older adults (Table 1): problem solving, plan social support, goal setting, follow -
up prompts, and provide feedback. The 6 -month intervention wi ll likely consist of the following, 
although aspects of the intervention may change based on data from the adaptation process: 1) 
Mailed educational materials about the importance of consuming cruciferae, how to maximize 
urinary ITC levels, serving size 
goals, the importance of self -
monitoring, and strategies to 
increase intake, along with 
booklets to record daily 
cruciferae intake; 2) One live 
phone call (~45 -60 minutes) 
delivered two weeks after mailing 
materials to verify understanding 
of the educationa l information 
and help participants complete a 
personalized action plan where 
participants will identify barriers 
and facilitators (e.g. social 
support) to meet identified goals 
(problem solving); 3) 11 
Interactive Voice Response 
(IVR) phone messages that will 
begin by asking participants to 
input the servings of cruciferae 
consumed the previous week 
(follow -up prompt). Depending 
on number of servings participants input, they will be routed to one of three paths: a) meeting 
goals, b) not meeting goals but has some progress, c) no progress. Participants on each path will 
receive a tailored phone message (provision of feedback) selec ted from a library of messages to 
enable participants to meet or maintain their cruciferae goal. A total of 11 IVR calls will be 
delivered weekly for the first three weeks and then bi -weekly for the remainder of the 6 -month 
intervention.  
11. PROCEDURES INVOLVED  
Aim 1: Develop an evidence -based behavioral intervention to increase cruciferous vegetable 
intake  
Adaptation.  Working with our Community Advisor Board (CAB) consisting of a urologist, clinic 
staff, and BCS, we will refine current evidence -based vegetable interventions to develop a novel 
dietary intervention for BCS. We will use a systematic process consisting of information gathering, 
discussion groups, and mock intervention delivery. Dr. Yeary, who has extensive experience 
adapting evidence -based behavioral interventions for diverse groups, will lead the team through a 
four-stage adaptation process based on the Barrera and Castro framework42 and PEN -3 model for 
cultural adaptation43. We will: 1) identify relevant factors to increase cruciferae intake in BCS; 2)

 use the PEN -3 model to review each of the intervention’s components (e.g. graphics, terminology, 
saliency of behavioral messages); 3) administer the revised intervention to the CAB for their 
feedback; and 4) refine the intervention based on Step 3. We will  also present the program to the 
BCS group meeting at Roswell Park to ensure the intervention is salient to our target population 
by demographic characteristics. The final product will be a 6 -month cruciferae intervention for 
BCS grounded in Social Cogniti ve Theory (SCT).  CAB members will each be compensated $100 
per meeting (up to three meetings), each meeting lasting about 1.5 hours and will be conducted via 
phone or computer. CAB members (bladder cancer survivors) may be asked to complete a 
structured i nterview over the phone and complete some demographic questions about themselves.  
Structured interviews will last approximately 60 minutes and CAB members will be paid $50 for 
completion of the structured interview. See Appendix K for Study Information Sheet for CAB 
members and Appendix L for CAB Interview Guide)  
Intervention Design.  Drawing from the large body of literature on evidence -based behavioral fruit 
and vegetable interventions, the intervention will likely include components used by Wolf et al.44 
and Djuric et al.45 (i.e. educational materials, phone calls, written plans, self -monitoring), who 
significantly increased vegetable intake among participants whose demographic characteristics 
mirror the majority of our target population (i.e. age 65 and older, diverse, male ). The following 
evidence -based behavior al techniques associated with effective dietary change in older adults46 
will also be incorporated (Table 1): problem solving, plan social support, goal setting, follow -up 
prompts, and provide feedback.  The 6 -month intervention will likely consist of the following, 
although aspects of the intervention may change based on data from the adaptation process: 1) 
Mailed educational materials about the importance of consuming cruciferae, how to maximize 
urinary  ITC levels, serving size goals, the importance of sel f-monitoring, and strategies to increase 
intake, along with booklets to record daily cruciferae intake (See Appendix P); 2) One live phone 
call (~45 -60 minutes) delivered two weeks after mailing materials to verify understanding of the 
educational information and help participants complete a personalized action plan where 
participants will identify barriers and facilitato rs (e.g. social support ) to meet identified goals 
(problem solving ) (See Appendix Q); 3) 11 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone messages 
that will begin by asking participants to input the servings of cruciferae consumed the previous 
week ( follow -up prompt ). Depending on number of servings participants input, they will be routed 
to one of three paths: a) meeting goals, b) not meeting goals but has some progress, c) no progress. 
Participants on each path will receive a tailored phone message ( provision of feedback ) selected 
from a library of messages to enable participants to meet or maintain their cruciferae goal. A total 
of 11 IVR calls will be delivered weekly for the first three weeks and then bi -weekly for the 
remainder of the 6 -month int ervention. The CAB will give specific feedback about visual material 
that would be the most appealing to BCS, specific barriers survivors may have to meet study goals, 
examples from survivors’ day -to-day lives to incorporate in the materials, specific phra ses and 
language to clearly convey the content, strategies to consume cruciferae with minimum effort, and 
tailored wording or terms that would optimize the participants’ response to IVR feedback. We 
selected phone and mail modalities of intervention delive ry because: 1) Phone -based dietary 
interventions are effective35; 2) phone -based interventions are more feasible to implement on a 
wide -scale compared to face -to-face interventions, which take more resources47; 3) IVR would be 
more cost -effective for a clinic to incorporate within its system vs. dedicating staff to provide 
frequent calls. Further, IVR is more feasible and accessible to the target population because BCS 
are typically older (average age at diagnosis is 73 years old); use of text messaging is lower among 
older groups, with less than half reporting email or text messaging for communication48.   
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 14 of 175 
 Control intervention.  Participants in the control arm will receive mailed materials about general 
fruit and vegetable intake intervention based on published NCI guidelines. 
(https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs/ ). The control intervention will utilize the same delivery 
method (i.e. mailed educational materials, live phone call, IVR calls) and follow the same contact 
schedule as the treatment schedule (See Appendix P and Appendix Q).  We intend to compare our 
tailored cruciferae program with general program on increase of fruit and vegetable intake. We 
anticipate minimal contamination between intervention and control because BCS will be recruited 
throughout our catchment area and ou r intervention will be delivered individually with each BCS.  
Personnel Training.  Dr. Yeary will utilize her extensive experience in training others in the 
delivery of behavioral interventions to train project staff to implement the intervention. A training -
of-trainers model that incorporates didactic education, trainee practice, and w ritten and verbal 
feedback will be used. Training will build knowledge about behavior change promotion, with a 
specific emphasis on delivering the live phone call with fidelity, utilizing participant booklets to 
program the IVR messages,  and communicating effectively with participants about health. The 
training will conclude with project staff demonstrating mastery of concepts through mock phone 
sessions and live phone calls, and accurate programming based on booklet data received. Projec t 
staff will be asked to complete a checklist of topics to monitor intervention fidelity.  
Aim 2: Conduct  a feasibility  pilot of our evidence -based  dietary  behavioral  intervention   
Study  Design.  We will use a Hybrid  I implementation  randomized -controlled  design  to 
simultaneously  gather  outcomes  regarding  the intervention’s  feasibility  and process  data to 
facilitate  wide -spread  implementation  and dissemination  of the intervention  into clinical  practice  
if the intervention  is effective.  A total of 80 patients  will be recruited  on a rolling  basis.  Forty  will 
be randomized  to intervention  and 40 to control.   
Participant  Recruitment.  Eligibility  criteria  include:  1) English  speaking;  2) diagnosed  with 
stage  Tis, Ta, or T1 bladder  cancer;  3) resides  in the Western  New  York  (WNY)  catchment  area 
(Niagara, Orleans, Genesee, Erie, Wyoming, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, and Allegany counties) ; 4) 
did not receive a partial or radical cystectomy; 5) does not have a prior cancer diagnosis within 12 
months of their bladder cancer diagnosis  6) does not have a subsequent more advanced bladder 
cancer diagnosis; and 7) (for Roswell Park Cancer Registry o nly) diagnosed 2016 -2018, 2019 -
current.  We chose not to include current cruciferae intake as an eligible criterion because prior 
studies have reported that BCS consumed an average of 0.44 -0.45 servings per day12, 26, less than 
half our recommended amount. Using ICD -O-3 codes provided, Dr. Kuliszewski of the NYSCR 
will lead her staff to identify qualifying patients from their database based on the study’s eligibility 
requirements. The NYSCR has identified 199 cases that meet the study’s eligibility criteria  in 2018 
and anticipate at least 400 eligible cases in total in 2018 and 2019. A total of 250 eligible patients 
will be contacted to enable researchers to recruit from a pool of at least 100 patients. In prior 
studies, 52.4% to 62.5% of patients contacted by the NYSCR agreed to be contacted by researchers 
for study consent. The NYSCR will send a letter to the physician of record for selected cases 
notifying that the patient was identified for the study, requesting that the NYSCR be notified if the 
patient i s unable or ineligible to participate in the study, and requesting information about the 
case’s primary care physician if different from the contacted physician. If no contraindication has 
been received from the physician or if the physician has not respon ded within 3 weeks, the NYSCR 
will send an informational packet to the patient. The packet will contain: 1) a letter with study 
information; 2) a participant information sheet; and 3) a release of information consent form. After 
two weeks without response,  a reminder packet will be sent and followed with up to five phone 
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 15 of 175 
 calls. If the NYSCR can’t reach the patient, the patient will be considered a refusal.  The NYSCR’s 
materials and procedures will be reviewed by the New York State Department of Health IRB.  For 
patients who agree to be contacted about the study, the NYSCR will securely share the patient’s 
name, contact information, and information about their diagnosis with the Roswell study team.  For 
the Roswell Park Cancer Registry, study staff will consult with Roswell Park urologist to 
determine if the patient is unable  or ineligible to participate in the study. The patients accessioned 
from the Roswell Park Cancer Registry will be contacted by letter (See Appendix T) asking them 
to participate in the study. Study staff will follow -up with potential participants to determine 
whether they received the letter and if they are interested in participating. We estimate that from 
the pool of at least 100 patients who consent to be contacted, we will be able to obtain informed 
consent from at least 80 patients (80%). The Roswell study team will share information with the 
NYSCR team on the patients who agree to participate in the study, as well as any information 
obtained from study participants that does not match the information provided from the NYSCR 
database (e.g., race, ethnicity).  
Participant Data and Sample Collection Procedures .  Research staff will contact patients who 
have agreed to be contacted by phone, whereby they will provide a general study overview and 
conduct a screening interview to confirm eligibility. The consent form will be mailed out to 
patients prior to the conse nting discussion. We will ask the patient to mail back the consent form 
with the appropriate signatures. We will also provide an additional copy of the consent form for 
their records. We will include a paid  postage pre -addressed envelope for the patient to mail back 
the signed consent form to study staff. Baseline Data Collection will be conducted within four 
weeks prior to intervention start. The Data Collector, masked to treatment assignment, will conduct 
telephone surveys with participants and directly enter participants’ responses into pre -programmed 
data collection forms in REDCap49, 50. Surveys will cover sociodemographic variables,  faith and 
spirituality beliefs, dietary, and cruciferae intake ( Appendix F). Additionally, 24 -hour dietary 
recalls will be conducted and instructions ( Appendix M) and a reference guide ( Appendix N) will 
be mailed out to participants prior to their scheduled recall interview.   Participants will also be 
mailed out track books to help keep track of their fruit and/or vegetable intake during the 
intervention ( Appendix R).  Follow -up Assessment  (Appendix G1) will be conducted at 6 months 
following the same protocol as the baseline assessment ( Appendix F). Participants will receive 
$100 for completing the baseline and 6 -month follow -up assessment s. In addition, we will ask 
participants’ feedback on the intervention  (Appendix G2) as part of  the Follow -Up Assessment 
(Appendix G1). The feedback questions (Appendix G2) will be given to those in the cruciferous 
arm only.  For cruciferous arm study participants that have completed the 6 -month follow -up 
assessment as of the March 21, 2022 Protocol revision, the study participants will be called back 
to complete the feedback questions (Appendix G2).  These study participants will first be sent an 
information sheet ( Appendix W) regarding the additional feedback questions before being called. 
When they are called regarding the study feedback questions, they will provide verbal consent 
before proceeding with answering the feedback questions.  
Urine Sample Collection will be conducted at baseline and 6 -months. Participants will be 
instructed to collect first -void urine continuously for three days, which will provide a more reliable 
measurement than one -spot urine samples. A specially designed ur ine collection device consisting 
of a 10 -mL container and sponge with a plastic holder will be used,  which does not impact urinary 
ITC measurement and has been used in the Be -Well study with documented ease of collection and 
minimal shipment burden. Staff will mail urine collection kits and instructions ( Appendix C) to 
participants. Given that recent behaviors may have a large impact on urinary ITC levels, 
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 16 of 175 
 participants will be asked to complete a brief 2 -page specimen collection survey ( Appendix D) on 
medical and lifestyle status in the past two days. They will then return the survey and urine samples 
to Roswell Park in the provided shipping box with biohazard labels and ice packs via pre -paid 
overnight shipping service. Once received, the urine wi ll be spun down from the sponge, aliquoted, 
and stored at -80⁰C at Dr. Li Tang’s lab (x8247) at Roswell Park. The urine aliquots will be assayed 
at Dr. Tang’s Lab for ITC analysis using HPLC -based cyclocondensation assay.64 This method is 
able to accurately measure as low as a few picomoles of ITCs and their metabolites. Dr. Tang’s 
lab has experience and expertise in running this assay 65 and will process the urine samples and 
perform the measurements. The results will be adjusted by urinary creatinine leve l, which will also 
be performed in the laboratory, using a commercially available creatinine assay kit (Caymen, Ann 
Arbor, MI). The cell pellets from three urine samples per participant will be combined and 
delivered to Genomics Shared Resources at Roswell Park for RNA -seq analysis in a batch. 
Additional urinary metabolites and potential biomarkers will be explored using proteomic and/or 
metabolomic approaches. All assays will be conducted on the stored urine samples. Neither new 
urine sample collection nor  patient contact will occur.  
Exploratory  Aim:  Engage  providers  to ascertain  specific  clinic -level  implementation  factors  
We will ask intervention  participants  to nominate  physicians  to participate  in a short  15-minute  
semi -structured  interview.  Research  staff will mail an invitation  letter  to nominated  physicians  that 
will include  an information  sheet  (Appendix J), opt-in/opt -card card,  and stamped  reply  envelope.  
Within  2-weeks,  physicians  who do not respond  will be contacted  by phone,  fax, or email  with no 
more  than 5 attempts.  Participating  physicians  will receive  $100.  Physicians  who verbally  consent  
to participate  will be asked  to refer  other  physicians  to the study.  CAB  members  will also utilize  
their networks  to nominate  physicians  for staff to contact.  
We will conduct  brief  15-minute  semi -structured  interviews  using  an interview  guide.  The guide  
will give physicians  a brief overview  of our cruciferae  intervention.  Research  staff will then ask 
questions  regarding  facilitators  and barriers  of intervention  adoption  within  clinical  practice37. 
Staff  will ask physicians  the needed  implementation  strategies  to sustain  the intervention  post 
research  funding,  in addition  to intervention  modifications  to maximize  sustained  clinic  adoption37. 
12. WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
Participants can stop their participation at any time.  Participants may refuse to answer any question 
and they may leave the study at any time.  
13. RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
For the survey portion of the study, involvement in this study does not involve any physical risk. 
The possible risks might be feeling uncomfortable answering questions.  
There are no known risks associated with providing a urine sample other than a potential loss of 
confidentiality.  
14. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS  
Participants in the intervention and feasibility scale -up pilot may benefit from study participation 
by improving dietary habits and/or reducing bladder cancer recurrence. The information gained 
may also help other bladder cancer patients in the future. Participants will receive $100 for 
completing each assessment —the study will ask participants to complete baseline (see Appendix 
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 17 of 175 
 F) and 6 -month follow -up assessments (See Appendix G1). Thus, participants will be able to 
receive up to  $200  total in assessments.  Participating  physicians  will receive  $100  for the 
interview.  
15. DATA AND SPECIMEN BANKING  
All questionnaire data will be stored in REDCap or in a locked file cabinet. REDCap is a secure 
application supported by Partners Research Computing, Enterprise Research Infrastructure & 
Services (ERIS). ERIS has all the necessary physical and operational securities in place to meet or 
exceed Federal and State security and privacy regulations for data transmission and storage using 
REDCap. Data will only be removed when coded, entered, or audited. The urine samples will be 
processed and stored at Dr. Tang’s  laboratory and a dataset will be created to track and record the 
results obtained from laboratory assays on urine samples. The dataset will only contain study IDs 
without any personal identifiable information. The file that contains the link between study  ID and 
subject identifiable information will be maintained separately and can only be accessed by Drs. 
Yeary and Tang and will never be released to any laboratory staff.  
16. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
Solid Tumors  
N/A 
Hematologic Tumors  
N/A 
Other Response Parameters  
We will assess the treatment intervention’s effect on the consumption of cruciferae  vegetables and 
ITC yield, as specified under the heading, “STUDY ENDPOINTS ”. We will also assess changes 
in gene expression via RNA -Seq, so as to identify a panel of genes that respond specifically to 
consumption of cruciferae vegetables as specified in the section of STUDY ENDPOINTS. It is 
well known that isothiocyanates in cruciferae vegetables alter multiple signaling pathways. 
Therefore, the identified panel of genes can be used as biological biomarkers to understand how 
individuals re spond to the cons umption of cruciferae vegetables, and more importantly, be used as 
biomarkers to monitor the effect of cruciferae vegetables.    
17. SAFETY EVALUATION  
Reporting Unanticipated Problems.  
Unanticipated problem reporting will begin at the time of participant consent. The Reportable New 
Information (RNI) Form will be submitted to the Roswell Park Clinical Research Service (CRS) 
Quality Assurance (QA) Office within 1 business day of becoming a ware of the Unanticipated 
Problem. After review, CRS QA Office will submit the RNI to the IRB.  
When becoming aware of new information about an Unanticipated Problem, the updated 
information will be submitted to the CRS QA Office with an updated RNI Form. The site 
Investigator or designated research personnel will report all unanticipated problems to  the IRB in 
accordance with their local institutional guidelines.  
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 18 of 175 
 18. DATA MANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
Individual confidentiality concerning study data and measurements will be ensured through the 
following ways: Participant data will not be identified by name (using only an identification 
number for identification), all data and records in locked storage a reas accessible only to project 
staff, and password protected computer data files. Participants will not be personally identified in 
any scientific reports generated by the study. All results will be presented in aggregate form. All 
project staff will unde rgo training and ongoing continuing education about methods to protect 
confidentiality. All project staff will complete Human Subject Training Requirements.  
We have contracted with an outside company Above Ground Development (AGD) to conduct the 
11 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone messages that participants receive as part of the 
intervention.  The study staff will share the following information with AG D that includes 
participant’s name, date of birth and contact phone number. This PHI information will be entered 
into the secure web portal (user interface) and ALL data will be stored with AGD on a secure 
HIPAA Compliant server.  
Safety of subjects.  Data safety and monitoring will be overseen by Drs. Yeary and Tang. The 
proposed study is considered extremely low risk. Adverse events will be monitored routinely 
during questionnaire and data collection and participants will be instructed to contact stu dy 
personnel for any issues. Monthly meetings with Dr. Yeary, Dr. Tang, and the Project Coordinator 
(Ms. Harfouche) will also be held to evaluate the status of study subjects. Dr. Qiang Li, a Board 
Certified Bladder Cancer Surgeon, will provide guidance and supervision regarding all the 
reported side effects or potential symptoms possibly related to study participation. Adverse events 
will be labeled as to whether attributed to behavior intervention or not, classified as mild, moderate, 
severe, life threatening, or causing death, and reported to Roswell Park IRB and NIH under 
Institute guidelines. We will track reporting of adverse events in the REDCap study database. All 
clinical trials at Roswell undergo yearly review by an independent D ata Safety Monitoring Board.  
Collection of Data and Biospecimens.  Project staff will collect questionnaire data from research 
subjects by telephone interview, as dictated by study protocol. Questionnaire data will be directly 
entered into REDCap, a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and 
databases. Only study identification number (Study ID) will be entered when the data are collected. 
All data collected by research assistants are considered part of the subject’s confidential record. 
REDCap is a secure appli cation supported by Partners Research Computing, Enterprise Research 
Infrastructure & Services (ERIS). ERIS has all the necessary physical and operational securities 
in place to meet or exceed Federal and State security and privacy regulations for data tra nsmission 
and storage using REDCap. All data will remain confidential. A file will be separately maintained 
that associates the subject name with that subject’s study ID. This file will remain in a locked file 
cabinet and will not be stored with the actual  study data. The urine samples will be collected by 
the participants at home and directly shipped to Roswell Park using prepaid and addressed shipping 
labels. All urine samples will be labeled with assigned study IDs only and no personal information 
will b e provided.  
Storage of Collected Data and Biospecimens.  
N/A 
Data Entry Requirement.  All data will be coded prior to entry. Any ambiguity in the response to 
a question will be brought to the attention of Ms. Harfouche for clarification. If Ms. Harfouche is 
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 19 of 175 
 unsure how to code the response, the matter will be brought to the attention of Drs. Yeary, Tang, 
and consulted with the statistician (Dr. Yu). Ms. Harfouche will maintain a log, so that future 
occurrences of problems will be handled in the same manner.  
The data entry system will require a login identification and password in order to gain access to 
the data. Where appropriate, validation and range rules will be applied to the actual entry fields. 
Only Dr. Yeary, Dr. Tang, Dr. Yu, and data entry personnel  will be able to view the data in its raw 
state. All other authorized personnel will view data via forms and reports in aggregate form created 
by Dr. Yeary, Dr. Tang, and Dr. Yu.  
Access to Cleaned Computer Data.  Only Drs. Yeary, Tang, and Yu can give permission for the 
release of aggregated study data. No confidential information will be released without permission.  
19. STATISTICAL PLAN  
Patient.  We will use SAS for data analysis and R for RNA -seq data. We will generate descriptive 
statistics and assess group differences at baseline and examine treatment drop -out and missing data 
patterns’ impact on treatment effects. We will calculate summary sta tistics and compare study 
endpoints and patient baseline characteristics by treatment group using independent sample t-tests 
and Fisher’s exact tests. We will summarize changes between pre - and post -intervention for both 
arms and calculate point estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We will 
analyze between -group differences in the change of outcome variables between baseline and post -
intervention using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The intervention group will be used as 
factors and the baseline variables used as covariates. Within -group difference between two time -
points will be compared by paired sample t-tests, while between -group differences at each time -
point will be compared by independent sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tes ts. RNA -seq data 
will be processed and quality -checked by the Bioinformatics Shared Resource at Roswell Park; 
sample relationships will be explored using sample clustering and principle component analysis. 
We will use DESeq258 to identify significantly dif ferentially expressed (SDE) genes and conduct 
pathway analysis with GSEA59 using rank -based gene list from SDE analysis. All tests will be 
two-sided at the significance level of 0.05. We will use the Benjamini -Hochberg’s method to 
calculate the false disco very rate for gene expression.  
Physician. Interviews  will be audio -recorded,  transcribed  verbatim,  checked  for accuracy  and 
entered  into a software  program  for the management  of text data (e.g. NVivo  12). We will code  
transcripts  using  content  analysis.  Coding  decisions  and emergent  findings  will be discussed  until 
an agreement  is reached57. 
Sample Size Determination  
Patient : With n=40 for each group, the ANCOVA can achieve 80% power to detect a difference 
of 0.57 within -group standard deviations (SDs) between groups assuming the correlation of post -
intervention and baseline outcome is R2=0.2. Data from the Be -Well study repo rts a within -group 
SD of 8.9 μM for urinary ITCs and 62 g/day for cruciferae intake; thus, we can detect a difference 
equivalent to 5.1 μM in urinary ITC and 35.3 g/day of cruciferae intake between groups. The 
intervention’s goal is to increase urin ary ITC levels from the baseline of 4.4 μM to the desirable 
biological dose of 10 μM and cruciferae intake from the baseline of 52.7 gram (0.7 serving) to at 
least 75 gram (a typical serving size) at 6 -month follow up. Given the generally lower cruciferae 
intake observed in other BCS studies (around 0.44 -0.45 serving, equivalent to 33 -34 gram per 
day)11, 26, the proposed study will have sufficient power to detect our projected differences.

 Physician : We will recruit up to 20 physicians to ensure data saturation61. Among clinicians 
involved in cancer treatment, enrollment rates between 46.3% -92% have been reported60, 62, 63, 
with one study reporting an enrollment rate of 48% among clinicians involved in bladder cancer 
treatment62. Out of the 80 participants enrolled in our intervention, we anticipate 40 to nominate 
their physicians and expect to receive referrals for 5 additional physicians from enrolled physicians 
and 5 physicians nominated by our CAB. Given an anticipated enroll ment rate of 48%, we 
anticipate recruitment of 20 physicians.  
Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the control arm and interventional arm using 
permutated block randomization. We will employ random block sizes of 4 and 2. Randomization 
will be carried out by the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformati cs. 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics.  
 Descriptive statistics (as appropriate: n, percent, mean, median, min and max) will be used to 
summarize demographic and baseline characteristics. The patient characteristics will also be 
summarized by treatment group. The baseline characteristics between  groups will be compared by 
independent sample t -tests and Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate.  
Primary Analysis.  
For primary analysis, the aim is to investigate the between -group differences in the change of 
urinary ITC levels and cruciferae intake between baseline and post -intervention. The comparison 
of change from baseline will be made utilizing analysis of covari ance (ANCOVA) and F -tests 
(α=0.05). The intervention group will be used as factors and the baseline variables used as 
covariates. A coefficient for interventional group that is significantly greater than 0 will indicate 
that the intervention increases the ITC levels or cruciferae intake. Within -group difference between 
two time -points will be compared by two -sided paired sample t -tests, while between -group 
difference at each time -point will be compared by two -sided independent sample t -tests (α=0.05). 
Since  this is a pilot feasibility study, no adjustment for multiple comparisons will be planned.   
Secondary Analys es.  
The aim of secondary analysis is to investigate the difference in gene expression patterns between 
two groups. Three urine samples per participant will be collected at baseline and month 6, and the 
cell pellets from three urine samples per participants wil l be combined and subject to RNA -seq. 
RNA -seq data will be processed and quality -checked by Bioinformatics Shared Resource at 
Roswell Park; sample relationships will be explored using sample clustering and principle 
component analysis. We will use DESeq to  identify significantly differentially expressed (SDE) 
genes and conduct pathway analysis with GSEA using rank -based gene list from SDE analysis. 
All tests will be two -sided at significance level of 0.05. We will use the Benjamini -Hochberg’s 
method to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) for gene expression.  
The additional metabolites and biomarkers will be analyzed using the same approach  as in primary 
analysis . The univariate distributions of these variables will be examined, and appropriate 
transformations may be applied before analysis.  Benjamini -Hochberg’s method to control the 
FDR.

22. COMMUNITY -BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH  
The study does not use a “pure” community -based participatory research approach but does 
include community engagement, which will include engagement of a Community Advisory Board 
to develop the cruciferae intervention.  
23. SHARING OF RESULTS WITH SUBJECTS  
Aggregate study results will be disseminated to the project’s Community Advisory Board, the 
Bladder Cancer Survivorship Group at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, the New York 
State Department of Health Cancer Registry, and to participating patients and health care providers 
who consented to be part of the research, written informed consent for particip ating patients and 
verbal consent for participating health care providers. Study participants will be mailed aggregate 
study results with no personal identifiers. Study results will also be disseminated to academic and 
practice audiences through scientific  papers and conferences.  
24. SETTING  
Participant Recruitment.  NYSCR will send a letter to the physician of record for selected cases 
notifying him/her that the patient was identified for the study, requesting that NYSCR be notified 
if the patient is unable or ineligible to participate in the study, and requesting in formation about 
the case’s primary care physician if different from the contacted physician. If no contraindication 
has been received from the physician or if the physician has not responded within 3 weeks, the 
NYSCR will send an in formational packet to the patient. The packet will contain: 1) a letter with 
study information; 2) a participant information sheet; and 3) a release of information consent form. 
After two weeks without response, a reminder packet will be sent and followed with up to five 
phone calls. If NYSCR can’t reach the patient, the patient will be considered a refusal. The 
NYSCR’s materials and procedures will be reviewed by the New York State Department of Health 
IRB.  For patients who agree to be contacted about the study, the NYSCR will securely share the 
patient’s name, contact information, and information about their diagnosis with the Roswell study 
team.  For the Roswell Park Cancer Registry: study staff will consult with Roswell Park urologist 
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 22 of 175 
 to determine if the patient is unable or ineligible to participate in the study. The patients 
accessioned from the Roswell Park Cancer Registry will be contacted by letter (See Appendix T) 
asking them to participate in the study. Study staff will follow -up with potential participants to 
determine whether they received the letter and if they are interested in participating. We estimate 
that from the pool of at least 100 patients who consent to be contacted, we will be able to obtain 
informed consent from at least 80 patients (80%). Research staff will contact patients who have 
agreed to be contacted by phone, whereby they wil l provide a general study overview and conduct 
a screening interview to confirm eligibility. The consent form will be mailed out to patients prior 
to the consenting discussion. We will ask the patient to mail back the consent form with the 
appropriate sign atures. We will also provide an additional copy of the consent form for their 
records. We will include a paid postage pre -addressed envelope for the patient to mail back the 
signed consent form to study staff. To assist with study retention, we will ask pa rticipants for 
contact information to be used in follow -up. The Roswell study team will share information with 
the NYSCR team on the patients who agree to participate in the study, as well as any information 
obtained from study participants that does not  match the information  provided  from  the NYSCR  
database  (e.g.,  race,  ethnicity).  
The process for contacting the patient, including the number of contact attempts, the letter text 
and/or phone script, the consent form, the data to be collected, and information on any incentives 
for participation will be reviewed by the NYSCR, New York S tate Department of Health 
(NYSDOH), and the NYSDOH IRB prior to the initiation of any patient/proxy contact. In addition, 
the research team will follow all NYSDOH procedures in conducting their study, including the 
following procedures:  
1. All written materials must include contact information for people who can answer 
questions about the research and participant rights.  
2. Patient consent to participate must be obtained.  
3. If a patient asks to be removed from current or future research studies, this information 
must be sent within two weeks to the NYSCR, so that the patient’s record can be flagged and 
the patient added to a “Do Not Contact” list.  
4. Researchers must immediately report any complaints about the study or the release of 
patient information to the Director of the NYSCR and to the Administrator of the NYSDOH 
IRB.  
If changes are made to any recruitment materials or processes after NYSDOH departmental and 
IRB approval, an IRB amendment must be submitted and approved before the changed materials 
may be used.  
Before receiving case -level Registry data, the Principal Investigator for a research study will be 
required to read and sign a Research Data Use Agreement. This contract describes limitations on 
the use of the data, as well as restrictions on the dissemina tion of findings, use of personal 
identifiers, and contact with patients identified through data provided by the NYSCR. All staff 
working with confidential data, or with possible access to confidential information from the data, 
are required to have curren t IRB training certification and to sign a Confidentiality Pledge. The 
Research Data Use Agreement and Confidentiality Pledge documents can be obtaining by emailing 
the NYSCR at nyscr@health.ny.gov.  
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 23 of 175 
 Researchers must agree to maintain the confidentiality of identifiable data received from the 
NYSCR. Identifiable data include any information that would permit, directly or indirectly, the 
identification of any individual. When applying to use the data, r esearchers should indicate how 
the data will be stored as well as how and when they will dispose of the data after the study is 
completed. In addition, researchers must attest that: 1) no data will be published or released in any 
form where a particular in dividual or establishment is directly or indirectly identifiable; 2) 
identifiable data obtained from the NYSCR will be used only for the proposed study; 3) identifiable 
information obtained from the NYSCR will not be released to anyone or any institution w ithout 
prior written approval by the NYSDOH; and 4) any publication or report produced using the data 
will acknowledge the source of the data. In the event of a breach of confidentiality, researchers 
must notify the Director of the NYSCR as soon as possibl e but no later than two business days 
after learning of the breach.  
Physician Recruitment.  Research staff will mail an invitation letter to nominated physicians that 
will include an information sheet ( Appendix J), opt -in/opt -card card, and stamped reply envelope. 
Within 2 -weeks, physicians who do not respond will be contacted by phone, fax, or email with no 
more than 5 attempts. Participating physicians will receive $100. Physicians who verbally consent 
to partic ipate will be asked to refer other physicians to the study. CAB members will also utilize 
their networks to nominate physicians for staff to contact.  
25. PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF SUBJECTS  
Only de -identified data will be accessed and recorded.  Data files will be coded numerically and 
assigned to each participant.  Information gathered from participants will remain anonymous and 
will be referred to only by general category.  There will be no  reference by name to any participant 
in any qualitative or quantitative data capture.  No patient identity will be disclosed in the event of 
publication or sharing of data.    
For physicians, the study will not collect any identifiers from the physician. The data collected 
from physician participation would be qualitative only.  Therefore, for the physicians only, we are 
requesting a waiver of HIPPA Authorization.  
The data collected from this study will be organized by a unique identification number assigned to 
the participant so that their identity will be available only to project staff and will remain 
completely confidential. The data manager, study staff, Co -Is and PI of the study will have access 
to the data records.   
All study records will be kept electronically in Roswell Park maintained and secured equipment.  
The electronic data records will be saved and secured on the Roswell Park shared server. Survey 
data will be filed in a locked cabinet located in 311 Carlton H ouse and will not be taken off Roswell 
Park premises. The data will be kept in a locked room where it will remain for approximately five 
years following the completion of the project.  
26. RESOURCES AVAILABLE  
The project will be co -led by Drs. Yeary and Tang, who will serve as multiple PIs on the project. 
Drs. Yeary and Tang will make joint decisions regarding the project. They will collaborate with 
the New York State Department of Health Cancer Registry and th e Community Advisory Board 
in making collaborative decisions regarding the project. Communication between the PIs will be 
done in person, through video conferencing (e.g. Zoom, Webex), phone, and email.  
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 24 of 175 
 The project will be coordinated by the Ms. Harfouche (Roswell Park) and all project data will be 
collected by the data collector (Ms. Dauphin). All data will be entered and managed by the database 
manager (Ms. Harfouche). All quantitative data analyses wil l be done by Dr. Yu.  
Drs. Yeary and Tang will lead the completion of the study’s aims, with Dr. Yeary focused on the 
intervention aspects of the study, and Dr. Tang focused on the biological aspects of the study. Dr. 
Yeary and Dr. Tang will oversee collaboration with the Commu nity Advisory Board (including 
Dr. Qiang Li) in developing the intervention. Dr. Yeary will oversee the intervention’s 
implementation and evaluation. Dr. Yeary will oversee Ms. Harfouche, who will oversee the 
recruiter (Ms. Dauphin), data collector (Ms. Da uphin), and interventionist (Ms. Clark). Dr. Yeary 
will train the interventionist to deliver the intervention. Both Drs. Yeary and Tang will work 
closely with the New York State Department of Health Cancer Registry during the initial stage of 
recruitment. Dr. Tang will oversee the laboratory work and ensure that the biological specimens 
are adequately collected, processed, and analyzed. Non -dietary data analysis will be led by Dr. 
Yeary and Tang, in close collaboration with Dr. Yu. Dietary data analysis wil l be led by Dr. 
McCann. Specific Aim 3 will be led by Drs. Yeary and Tang, who will oversee staff to recruit 
providers and complete provider telephone interviews.  
The NYSCR employs a staff of over 50 to collect, process, and analyze reports on about 110,000 
diagnosed cases of cancer among New Yorkers each year. The staff includes a 10 -member research 
unit, five of whom hold a doctoral degree. Areas of expertise with in this unit include cancer 
epidemiology, biostatistics, geographic analysis, and information science. The NYSCR has a 
strong national reputation and provides data to many national and international cancer studies.  
The PIs will work with the New York State Department of Health Cancer Registry and the 
Community Advisory Board to disseminate project results and decide next steps.  
27. PRIOR APPROVALS  
The NYSCR study team will obtain approval of study materials by the NYSDOH Bureau, 
Division, Center, and the NYSDOH IRB.  
28. COMPENSATION FOR RESEARCH -RELATED INJURY  
If the subject believes they have been injured as a direct result of their participation in this research 
study, they will be advised to notify the Roswell Park Patient Advocate at (716) 845 -1365 or the 
Dr. Karen Yeary at (716) 845 -6231 or Dr. Li Tang at ( 716) 845 -8247.  
Medical diagnosis and treatment for the injury will be offered, and a determination will be made 
regarding appropriate billing for the diagnosis and treatment of the injury. A financial counselor 
(716-845-3161) will be able to provide an explanation of coverage and to answer questions the 
subject may have regarding study related billing.  
The subject is not prevented from seeking to collect compensation for injury related to malpractice, 
fault, or blame on the part of those involved in the research.  
29. ECONOMIC BURDEN TO SUBJECTS  
There are no costs associated with participation in the surveys and/or urine collection.  
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 25 of 175 
 30. CONSENT PROCESS  
Prior to administration of any assessment, participants are informed of the purpose of the study 
and told that their participation is voluntary. Participants are also informed that their responses to 
questions will be kept confidential. If the patient cons ents verbally, NYSCR or Roswell Park 
Cancer Registry staff will fill out the consent to be contacted form and document that consent to 
be contacted was obtained via phone ( Appendix H). If the Registry is unable to contact the patient 
via telephone, and no written response has been received, no other contact will be attempted, and 
the patient will be considered a refusal. At the end of the two registries work, we estimate that 
there wi ll be a pool of at least 100 patients that have consented to be contacted by research staff 
based on response rates from previous studies participated in by the NYSCR. Research staff will 
then contact patients who have agreed to be contacted by phone, wher eby they will provide a 
general study overview and conduct a screening interview to confirm eligibility.  
We are requesting a waiver of written consent documentation at the time of initial call, and prior 
to receipt of the signed written consent, for purposes of starting the baseline survey ( Appendix F). 
The consent script will be a review of the consent document that is being obtained. The consent 
form will then be mailed out to patients. We will ask the patient to mail back the consent form 
with the appropriate signatures. We will also provide an addi tional copy of the consent form for 
their records. We will include a paid postage pre -addressed envelope for the patient to mail back 
the signed consent form to study staff.  The consent form will indicate that a participant retains the 
right to withdraw a t any time and that their health care will not be affected by their decision to 
participate or refuse to participate in the study. All investigators and project staff will satisfy the 
required IRB training and certification requirements. The IRB training w ill be completed during 
the early months of the project. For recruitment of health care providers, we will ask intervention 
participants to nominate physicians to participate in short 15 -minute semi -structured interviews. 
Intervention participants will pro vide informed consent before providing their health care 
providers’ contact information.  
For cruciferous arm study participants that have completed the 6 -month follow -up assessment as 
of the March 21, 2022 Protocol revision, the study participants will be called back to complete the 
feedback questions (Appendix G2).  Therefore, these study par ticipants will first be sent an 
information sheet ( Appendix W) regarding the additional feedback questions before being called. 
When they are called regarding the study feedback questions, they will provide verbal consent 
before proceeding with answering the feedback questions.  
Our Community Advisory Board members will also utilize their networks to nominate physicians 
for the research team to contact. Research staff will mail an invitation letter to nominated 
physicians that will include an information sheet ( Appendix K), opt -in/opt -out card ( Appendix 
U), and stamped reply envelop. Within 2 -weeks, physicians who do not respond will be contacted 
by phone, fax, or email with at most five attempts. Follow -up contact will use the same invitation 
letter originally sent out or a phone script mirroring the info rmation sheet ( Appendix J). Physicians 
who decide to participate in the study will provide verbal consent. Physicians who verbally consent 
to participate will also be asked to refer other physicians to the study. We will recruit up to 20 
physicians to ensure data saturation.  
The key elements of the informed consent procedure which will be explained to the participants 
are: 1) the research status of the study - particularly the assessment; 2) the prospect of psychological 
risk and the provisions for it; 3) the lack of guarantee of benefit from participation in the 
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 26 of 175 
 assessment, 4) the confidentiality of subjects responses to all study measures; 5) the voluntary 
nature of the study; 6) the receipt of the money for participating in the assessment, and 7) the 
freedom to withdraw from the study or to refuse to answer spec ific questions at any time.  
Before the survey is conducted, research study staff members will explain: 1) the nature and 
purpose of the research endeavor, 2) that participation in the research component is completely 
voluntary, and 3) that data collected from participants will be con fidential and assessed, evaluated 
and reported as aggregate data, as well as precautions taken in the storage of the data.  
The Roswell Park Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Informed Consent Process for Research 
(HRP -090) will be followed.  
31. PROCESS TO DOCUMENT CONSENT IN WRITING  
The Roswell Park “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091)” will be followed:  
The Investigator (or IRB specified designee) is responsible for obtaining written consent from each 
patient participant in accordance with GCP guidelines using the approved informed consent form, 
before any study specific procedures (including screening pr ocedures) are performed. The 
informed consent form acknowledges all information that must be given to the participant 
according to applicable GCP guidelines, including the purpose and nature of the study, the 
expected efficacy and possible side effects of the treatment(s), and specifying that refusal to 
participate will not influence further options for therapy. Any additional information that is 
applicable to the study must also be included. Additional national or institutionally mandated 
requirements for informed consent must also be adhered to. The participant should also be made 
aware that by signing the consent form, processing of sensitive clinical trial data and transfer to 
other countries for further processing is allowed. For physician participants,  we are requesting a 
waiver of written consent.  We would not collect any identifiers from the physician. The data from 
physicians would be qualitative only.  Physicians will provide verbal consent.  
The Investigator or designee shall provide a copy of the signed consent form to the participant and 
the signed original shall be maintained in the Investigator File. A copy of the signed consent form 
must be filed in the participant file. At any stage, the  participant may withdraw from the study and 
such a decision will not affect any further treatment options.

 back into the container. Throw away the urine collection hat into a trash 
receptacle; do not ship the urine collection hat.  
     
3. Write the date and time of the collection using a pen directly onto the label on the 
urine collection device.  
 
4. Store the urine sample in its collection device, including both the sponge and 
container, in your refrigerator. The urine is absorbed into the sponge so it should 
not leak from the device.  
 
5. Repeat the first morning urine collection for two more days in a row (Steps 1 -4), 
storing the samples in the refrigerator until ready for shipment.  
 
SCHEDULING A FEDEX PICKUP

box to Roswell Park Cancer Institute.  Do not take the package to a FedEx retail 
store for shipment or drop in a FedEx drop box.  
a.) Once you have placed the call to FedEx, say “Schedule a Pickup”  
b.) After the automated system has registered your request, dial 0, 
followed by the # sign to be directly transferred to a FedEx representative  
c.) Let the representative know your samples will be delivered via FedEx 
Express service  (priority overnight shipping)

 Appendix H New York State Cancer Registry Contact Materials and Procedures  
 
POW -R Health: Power to Redefine your Health Program  
NYS Cancer Registry Patient Contact and Data Handling Procedures  
 
The procedures described in this document are standard procedures the New York State Cancer 
Registry (NYSCR) follows for patient contact studies.  
 
I.  Approval Process  
 
1. Roswell Park Cancer Institute IRB approval  
2. NY State Health Department Administrative approval  
 
II. NYSCR Patient Consenting Process (i.e., physician notification and patient consent to 
release name, contact information, and diagnostic information to Roswell Park Cancer 
Institute)  
 
Using ICD -O-3 codes provided in the study protocol, the NYSCR will conduct a search of its 
database to identify eligible patients who were diagnosed with stage Tis, Ta, or T1 bladder 
cancer in 2018 or later, who resided in one of eight counties of interest  at diagnosis (Niagara, 
Orleans, Genesee, Erie, Wyoming, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, and Allegany), who are 18 years of 
age or older, who did not receive a cystectomy, who did not have a prior cancer diagnosis within 
12 months of their bladder cancer diagnosi s, who did not have a subsequent more advanced 
bladder cancer diagnosis, and who have not died or opted out of research studies. This search 
will be repeated if needed until the recruitment goal is reached. The NYSCR will contact 
reporting facilities to ob tain the patients’ physician information, if missing in the database.  
 
The NYSCR will send a letter to the physician of record for selected cases notifying him/her that 
the patient was identified for the study, requesting that the NYSCR be notified if the patient is 
deceased, too ill or otherwise unable or ineligible to participate in the study, and requesting 
information about the case’s primary care physician if different from the contacted physician. 
The physician will have three weeks to respond.  
 
If no contraindication is received from the physician or if the physician has not responded within 
three weeks, the NYSCR will send an informational packet to the patient. The packet will 
contain: 1) a letter explaining the study and requesting permission to release their name, contact 
information, and diagnostic information to the study’s principal investigator at Roswell Park 
Cancer Institute; 2) a participant information sheet; and 3) a release of information consent form. 
If the NYSCR has not received a ny response after two weeks a reminder packet of information 
will be sent. Again, if no response is forthcoming after two more weeks, five telephone calls will 
be attempted by the NYSCR (three during regular business hours, and two during non -business 
hours) to describe the study and receive a response (either consent or refusal). If the patient 
consents verbally, NYSCR staff will fill out the consent form and document that the consent was 
obtained via phone. If the Registry is unable to contact the patient  via telephone, and no written 
response has been received, no other contact will be attempted, and the patient will be considered 
a refusal.  
 
Roswell Park Protocol No.: I 661820  
10/31/2022   Page 82 of 175 
 Upon receipt of the consent form, the patient’s name, contact information, and diagnostic 
information will be provided by the NYSCR to the study’s principal investigator at Roswell Park 
Cancer Institute via Roswell’s secure File Transfer Solution (sFTP). T he NYSCR will receive a 
unique user name and password in separate emails to transfer the data via sFTP.  
 
 
III. Roswell Park Patient Contact Procedures  
 
Upon receipt of the patient information from the NYSCR, the Roswell Park research team will 
contact the patient by telephone. All members of the Roswell Park research team will have 
completed Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI training).  If the patient is not 
reached during the first attempt, the research team will make additional attempts using the 
following algorithm: five additional attempts at varying dates and times, for a total of six 
attempts over three weeks. Each attempt will be documented in the call manager portion of the 
Electronic Data Capture system. After all phone attempts are exhausted, a traceable Hard to 
Reach Letter will be mailed to the patient’s address listed in the patient profile. The patient will 
be asked to conta ct the Roswell Park research team if they are interested in learning more about 
the study.   
 
Upon contact with the patient, the Roswell Park research team member will again explain the 
study, administer the screening interview, and obtain consent for the patient’s participation.  The 
Roswell Park research team will record the patient’s real time r esponses in the corresponding 
Patient Phone Screening Interview Form in the Electronic Data Capture system. The patient will 
be mailed a consent form for them to keep. For respondents who do not wish to participate, the 
telephone contact will be terminated , and they will be ineligible for the study. Information on 
non-participants will be provided to the NYSCR, as well as any information for any individuals 
who indicate that they do not want to be contacted about any future research studies.  
 
 
IV. Data Handling, Dissemination and Storage Procedures  
 
After receipt of the patient information from the NYSCR, the data will be entered and stored in 
REDCap. REDCap is a secure application supported by Partners Research Computing, 
Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS). ERIS has all the necessar y physical and 
operational securities in place to meet or exceed Federal and State security and privacy 
regulations for data transmission and storage using REDCap. The dataset containing patient 
contact information will be separated from the research datas et including survey data and urine 
sample tracking data. The data will only be accessed by key members of the Roswell Park 
research team who are in charging of contacting patients. All the data communications between 
NYSCR and Roswell Park will be transfer red via Roswell’s secure File Transfer Solution 
(sFTP). A unique username and password will be used for each data transfer and sent in separate 
emails.

Dear Dr. “M.D._LAST NAME”:  
 
We are writing to inform you that the New York State Department of Health’s Cancer 
Registry is collaborating with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center on a pilot 
study of a dietary intervention with a goal to reduce the risk of recurrence in 
individual s diagnosed with non -muscle invasive bladder cancer. Patients diagnosed 
with non -muscle invasive bladder cancer (including Tis, Ta, and T1 disease) who did 
not receive cystectomy and who live in the counties of Niagara, Orleans, Genesee, 
Erie, Wyoming, Cha utauqua, Cattaraugus, and Allegany may be eligible for the study.  
 
Our records show that one of your patients was recently diagnosed with bladder 
cancer and meets the study criteria. The patient’s name and other identifying 
information reported to the Cancer Registry are on the enclosed form. We would like 
to contact your  patient to assess their interest in participating in the study.   
 
Patients will be sent an introductory letter describing the study and requesting their 
consent for their name, contact information, and some information about their 
diagnosis to be shared with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Patients 
who consent will be contacted by phone regarding participation in the study. Patient 
participation in the study includes participation in a 6 -month phone -based dietary 
intervention that will consist of educational materials mailed to the patient’s home, 
one 20 -minute phone call with Roswell Park staff to go over the educational 
materials, and 11 automated telephone calls asking participants to report the number 
of vegetable servings they have consumed in the prior week, followed by tailored 
feedback based on the servin gs reported. Patients will also be asked to complete two 
assessments, one at the beginning of the study, and one at the end. These 
assessments will include a 45 -60-minute phone survey, self -collection of a urine 
sample, and three 24 -hour dietary recalls. A ll information that could identify the 
patient will be kept confidential. Names and other identifying information will not be 
used in any publication about the study.

Please keep a copy of this form for your reference.  
 
I am (fill in name/role), with the Division of Prevention & Population Sciences at Roswell Park 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. I am working with a team at Roswell Park to learn about the 
barriers and facilitators of intervention implementation within clinical practice. The goal is to 
gain feedback and develop the intervention f or “real -world’ implementation.  
 
To accomplish this, we would like to conduct a semi -structured interview with a total of 20 
physicians or health care providers within the area in Western New York. This study is funded 
by the National Cancer Institute.  
 
I would like to tell you more about it before you decide whether or not to participate in this one -
time interview study. Please stop me at any time if you have any questions. Your participation is 
completely voluntary; you do not have to participate.  
 
During the interview, I will provide you with a brief overview of our dietary intervention for 
bladder cancer patients. I will then ask questions regarding facilitators and barriers of 
intervention adoption within clinical practice. I will ask your opinion  on the needed 
implementation strategies to sustain the intervention, in addition to intervention modifications to 
maximize sustained clinic adoption. The interview should last approximately 15 minutes. I may 
ask your permission to electronically record th e discussion so we can capture information 
accurately. If you object to electronically recording the conversation, please let me know now.  
 
This information will be collected anonymously (without linking it to your name or identity, or 
identifying any patients; all data will be aggregated). We will not be using your name on any of 
the forms or any information that is gathered.  
 
Your involvement in this study does not involve any physical risk to you. The possible risks 
include feeling uncomfortable answering questions, embarrassment, or someone identifying you 
as a participant in the project, although this would be rare. You will  not receive any direct health 
benefit from participating in this study.  
 
Participants that complete the interview will receive a $100 gift card to a local retail store.  
 
You do not have to take part in this one -time contact research study. If you decide to participate, 
you can stop your participation at any time. You may refuse to answer any questions and you 
may leave at any time.   
 
Results of this study will yield important information on the feasibility of a dietary behavioral 
intervention to improve bladder cancer outcomes among bladder cancer patients. These results 
have the potential to improve the survivorship outcomes of a grou p at elevated risk of cancer 
recurrence, as well as for teaching, for research, for scientific publications and/or for 
presentations at scientific meetings. You will not be identified in any way. Your participation is 
completely anonymous because I am not collecting your name (or taking photographs of you).

 Appendix L Bladder Community Advisory Board (CAB) Interview Guide  
Thank you for being willing to be a part of helping us make a healthy eating program for bladder 
cancer survivors to improve their health. We’re going to start by asking some questions about 
you.  
1. (Administer demographic survey, page 2)  
 
2. When were you first diagnosed with bladder cancer?  
o What type of treatment did you receive after your bladder cancer diagnosis?  
o How long did the treatment last?  
3. Have you had any recurrence since your initial bladder cancer diagnosis?  
o If yes, when did it happen and what treatment did you receive?

7. Recent research has shown that eating more cruciferous vegetables can reduce the 
chances of bladder cancer coming back in bladder cancer survivors. Cruciferous 
vegetables include broccoli, arugula, brussels sprouts, green or white cabbage, and 
turnips.   
o What do you think about this information? Is this helpful? Have you heard this 
before?  
8. In your day -to-day life, what might make it easier for you to eat more cruciferous 
vegetables?  
o Probes: Help from your family, help from the healthcare system, help from 
friends, any particular information  
9. Who does most of the shopping for food in your family?  
o If self: What affects the kinds or amount of vegetables you buy?  
o If not self: What role do you play in what they shop for?  
10. Who does most of the planning or preparing of meals in your family?  
o If not self: What role do you play in how meals are planned or prepared?  
11. How do other people in your life impact the kinds and amounts of vegetables you eat?

 Appendix M Participant 24 -hour Dietary Recall Instructions  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What’s a 24 -Hour Recall?  
 Scheduling the Calls   
Measuring Tips  24-Hour Recal ls 
 
 
 
24-hour recalls are 
a way of figuring out  
what you usually 
eat and drink .  We 
will get this 
information  through  talking to you on the  
telephone , where we will  ask you to 
remember  what you ate and drank during 
the previous day.   
 
The telephone  recalls  will occur on 3 
separate days at the start of the study, 
and 3 separate days at the end of the 
study. The days will be selected at 
random  so that weekdays (Monday 
through Thursday) and one weekend day 
(Friday through Sunday)  is included . This 
will help us figure ou t your average  diet.  
 
 
 
A person from Rosw ell Park Cancer 
Institute, Buffalo, NY  will be calling you  to 
do the recalls.  They  will call you during 
the times you said would work best with 
your schedule  when you signed up to be 
a part of the study. At this time, the y will 
call and  ask you for details of everything  
-- all foods and liquids (including water) -
- that you ate or d rank during the past 24 
hours from midnight to midnight of the 
previous day .  
 
The person will ask you the amount you 
actually ate or d rank, not how much was 
put into the dish, cup, or bowl. Please use 
the “Food Amounts B ookle t” that we 
sent you with this  sheet.  The following 
tips will also help you estimate how much 
you eat  and drink . 
 
 
 
 
    
 
Use measuring  cups 
and spoons  to help yo u 
tell the Roswell person  
the exact amount you ate 
or drank . 
 
Instead of telling the 
Roswell person  you had breakfast cereal, 
give more details like: 1 cup of wheat 
flakes with 1/2 cup of lowfat  milk, and 1/2 
of a large (8 -inch)  banana.  
 
▪ Measur e the volume of  dishes, bowls, 
cups, and glasses that you use a lot. 
This will help you to figure out and 
report the correct volume of 
food/drink  each time you use that 
container.  
 
▪ For pieces of food that do not fit into a  
cup or spoon, des cribe the size using 
the " Food Amounts B ookle t". 
 
For example, 1 corn tortilla (6 inches 
across), and 1 cube of cheese (2" long x 
1" wide x 1/2" high). You can use weight 
or dimensions for reporting meat, fish, 
poult ry, cheese, pizza, and baked goods.  
Include thickness, length, and width of 
food using a ruler. Indicate if the weight 
was obtained before or after cooking.  
 
Be Specific.  When naming the food or 
drink  that you ate /drank , give the Roswell 
person detail s. For example, if you ate 
meat, details su ch as the part eaten are 
important . If you ate chicken, tell the 
person  whether it was from the thigh or 
breast, or if it was white or dark meat.  
 
Brand Names & Labels.  Brand names 
of prepared foods are very useful for the 
Roswell person , as are  labels fro m the 
prepared foods you have eaten.

Magazine. Please have your PO W-R Magazine next to you so you can follow along what I’m going to review.  
 
 PART C: MAGAZINE CONTENT  
 Welcome to the POW -R Health Program (page 2)  
• Among bladder cancer survivors like you, there is still a 50% -80% chance that the bladder 
cancer could come back within 5 years  
• Compared to all types of cancers, bladder cancer has the highest chance of coming back  
• If the cancer comes back and is not caught at early stages, there is a risk of losing the 
bladder  
• Going to your routine check -ups with doctors is good to catch bladder cancer coming back 
at early stages. But they are not enough.  
• Doctors made the POW -R Health Program  to make sure you live the longest, healthiest 
life possible  
• Certain vegetables that can help stop bladder cancer from coming back. These vegetables 
are called power vegetables  i Interesting convo points  ntr 
• Power vegetables help reduce death from bladder cancer by 57%              
     Confirm Intervention Packet Receipt

    What are Power Vegetables? (page 4)  
• Power vegetables are cruciferous vegetables  
• Examples of power vegetables are Broccoli, Turnip, Cabbage, and Arugula  
• When power vegetables are eaten, they break down into active things. One of these active 
things is isothiocyanates (eye -so-thye-oh-sigh-nates) or ITCs.  
• ITCs have strong anti -cancer actions against many types of cancer, including bladder cancer.  
• Do you have any questions about what I’ve covered so far?       Interesting convo points  
 
  How are Power Vegetables Good at Fighting Bladder Cancer? (pages 4 and 5)  
• (Refer participant to picture in magazine on page 5)  
• (Go through Steps 1 -4 of the picture)  
• There is proof that eating power vegetables can help stop bladder cancer from coming back  
 
  How Can You Get the Most Anti -Cancer Power From Power Vegetables  
 
• The key to getting the most anti -cancer power from power vegetables is to have enough 
ITCs in the urine and to have the bladder inner surface fully soaked in the isothiocyanates as 
long as it can.  
• Choose power vegetables that are high or medium in ITCs (look at page 7 in magazine for 
medium and high ITC power vegetables)  
• Eat at least one serving of power vegetables per day. One serving size is 1 cup of power 
vegetables at the time you eat it. So if you eat one cup of arugula raw, that would be 1 cup 
raw. If you eat arugula cooked, that would be 1 cup of cooked arugula. One  cup is about the 
size of your fist.  
• It is best to eat power vegetables fresh, or raw. They can be lightly cooked too, for no more 
than 10 minutes. If you cook power vegetables too much it will reduce their anti -cancer 
power. Don’t use canned power vegetables.  
• Eat power vegetables at dinner time or as a late -night snack before bed. When you eat power 
vegetables, the ITCs from the power vegetables can get in the urine within 1 hour and 
slowly build up in the urine over 8 hours. If you eat power vegetables during the day, you 
could lose a lot of ITCs in your urine from going to the bathroom throughout the day. If you 
eat power vegetables at dinner time or as a late -night snack, your body will be able to build 
up the ITCs in your bladder. Although you may go to the bathroom a few times before you 
go to the bed, a fair amount of the ITCs can still build up in the urine and increase the time 
the bladder is soaked in ITCs.  
 Tips to Eat More Power Vegetables (page 10)  
 
• Look at pages 10 and 11 in your magazine for tips on how to eat more power vegetables

sure that the magazine communicated the information to you clearly. Are you ready? Let’s go!  
 
Note: For a question to be answered correctly, all parts of the question must be answered correctly.  
 
 
 
 TB1 What is a power vegetable?  
      Correct: A cruciferous vegetable  
 
CORRECT : Yes, that’s right! A power vegetable is a certain type of vegetable called cruciferous vegetables.  
INCORRECT: Power vegetables are cruciferous vegetables.  
 
 
CORRECT: Yes, that’s right - good job! There are  a lot of vegetables that are considered cruciferous vegetables. More 
cruciferous vegetables are listed in your POW -R Health Magazine.  
INCORRECT : Ok, no problem, you missed [state answers that are incorrect and correct].  Your POW -R Health 
Magazine lists some power vegetables on page 7.  
 
 
TB3 How many power vegetable servings do you need to eat 
each day.  
Correct Answer : 1 serving/day   
 
  
 
No Correct  
Yes 
 
CORRECT : Excellent, you’re right. You only need to eat one power vegetable serving a day to help stop bladder 
cancer from coming back.  
INCORRECT : Okay, no problem, the correct answer is 1 serving or cup a day. You only need to eat one power 
vegetable serving a day to help stop bladder cancer from coming back.  
 TB2 Please give me three examples of power vegetables.

 CORRECT : Excellent, you’re right. 1 serving of a power vegetable is 1 cup at the time you eat it. 1 cup is about the 
size of your fist.  
INCORRECT : Okay, no problem, the correct answer is 1 serving of a power vegetable is 1 cup at the time you eat 
it. 1 cup is about the size of your fist.  
 
TB5 QUESTION: What is an isothiocyanate or ITC?   
 
                                                                             Correct  
No     Yes  
 Correct Answer : An active compound in power vegetables that has 
strong anti-cancer properties     
CORRECT : Ok great, you really seem to understand what an isothiocyanate/ITC is.  
INCORRECT : Isothiocyanates/ITCs are an active compound in power vegetables that has strong anti -cancer properties.  
 
CORRECT: Yes, that’s right - good job!  
INCORRECT : It’s best to eat power vegetables fresh or raw. If you want to cook them, it’s best to eat them lightly 
cooked, where you cook them for less than 10 minutes.  
 
 
 
 
TB7 Why is it important to eat power vegetables at dinner or 
as a late -night snack before bedtime?  
 
Correct Answer : Isothiocyanates  from power vegetables go to the urine. 
The isothiocyanates  in the urine soak the inside of the bladder; the 
longer the isothiocyanates  in the urine are in the bladder, the longer the 
bladder will be exposed to the anti -cancer activities. Many people urinate 
several times throughout the day, and less often at night. If you eat 
power vegetables later at night, there is a greater chance tha t the 
isothiocyanates  from the power vegetables will stay in your bladder 
longer.   
                                                                                  Correct  
 
                                                                           No       Yes  
 
 
 
CORRECT: Yes, that’s right - good job!  
INCORRECT : Isothiocyanates/ITCs from power vegetables goes to your urine. The urine then goes to your bladder. 
The isothiocyanates in your urine will work to kill any cancer cells in your bladder. The longer the bladder is exposed to 
the isothiocyanates in your urine , the longer it will be exposed to anti -cancer activities. Many people urinate several 
times a day a less often at night. So, there is a greater chance that the isothiocyanates from the power vegetables will say 
in your bladder longer if you eat power vege tables at night.    
   TB4 What is the amount of 1 serving of a power vegetable?  
Correct Answer : 1 cup at time of eating/consumption   
 
  
 
No Correct  
Yes 
TB6 What is the best way to prepare power vegetables so they 
give you most isothiocyanates/ITCs?  
Correct Answer : It is best to eat power vegetables fresh or raw. 
You can also lightly cook them too (cook for less than 10 minutes).  
                                                                                Correct

One of the things you received in the packet we mailed to you is a POW -R Book. Please have your POW -R Book ready 
to review. In this book, I am asking that you keep track of how many power vegetables you eat every day, and each 
week. Science shows that keeping track of what you eat is a powerful way to change your habits. Keeping track of how 
many power vegetables you eat will help you eat more power vegetables.  Let’s go over all  of the parts of the POW -R 
Book.  
Check box when section is covered  
1. 1 POW -R book for each 
week; 24 sent to you —1 is for 
practice to use now. We are 
asking you to keep track of how 
many power vegetables you eat 
every week for the entire 
program.  3. 7 days in one POW -R book  5. Each day you say whether 
you ate at least 1 power 
vegetable cup where you 
prepared it in a POW -R Health 
Preferred way (explain what 
this is)  7. On the back is 
the phone number 
of the person from 
our team that you 
can call if you 
have any 
questions.  
2. Cover page —write down 
dates of the week you are 
keeping track  
 4. Each day you write down 
how many cups of power 
vegetables you had at dinner 
or after dinner. Only write 
down those power vegetables 
you ate at dinner or after 
dinner (have them open book)  6. On the first page, is where 
you will write down the total 
number of power vegetables 
you at dinner or after dinner 
for that week. After our phone 
call, you will receive 
automated messages and will 
be asked to enter the number 
of cups of power vegetables  
you ate for the week.  8. Any questions?  
Let’s practice using the POW -R Track Book.  
 CORRECT : Yes, that’s right - good job!  
INCORRECT : Ok, so the correct total is X. Let’s try that again to make sure you can use the POW -R Book correctly.   
Feel free to use a calculator if that would make things easier.   My plan this week to eat more power vegetables  
Now let’s make a plan to eat more power vegetables 
this week. The next time you or someone else goes 
to the grocery store, which power vegetables will 
you buy with medium to high isothiocyanates (page 
7)? Power vegetables to buy  
The next time you eat power vegetables, how will 
you make them? Remember that when you cook the 
power vegetable, to cook it for less than 10 minutes.  Raw, microwave, sauté/stir -fry, steam  
 Practice using POW -R Track Book  
Take a POW -R Track Book. Can you think back 
this past week of any power vegetables you ate at 
dinner or after dinner? If you did not eat any power 
vegetables, how about any type of vegetable? Let’s 
go through each day.  Monday                        Tuesday                             Wed

                                                                 No  Correct  
  Yes 
 Correct Answer : An active compound in power vegetables that has 
strong anti -cancer properties     
CORRECT : Ok great, you really seem to understand what an isothiocyanate is.  
INCORRECT : Isothiocyanates are an active compound in power vegetables that has strong anti -cancer properties.  
TB6.3  What is the best way to prepare power vegetables so they 
give you most isothiocyanates?  
Correct Answer : It is best to eat power vegetables fresh or raw. 
You can also lightly cook them too (cook for less than 10 minutes).  
                                                                        Correct  
 
                                                                    No     Yes  
 
 
 
CORRECT: Yes, that’s right - good job!  
INCORRECT : It’s best to eat power vegetables fresh or raw. If you want to cook them, it’s best to eat them lightly 
cooked, where you cook them for less than 10 minutes.  
 
TB7.2  Why is it important to eat power vegetables at dinner or 
as a late night snack before bedtime?  
 
Correct Answer : Isothiocyanates  from power vegetables go to the 
urine. The isothiocyanates  in the urine soak the inside of the bladder; 
the longer the isothiocyanates  in the urine are in the bladder, the 
longer the bladder will be exposed to the anti -cancer activities. Many 
people urinate several times throughout the day, and less often at 
night. If you eat power vegetables later at night, there is a greater 
chance tha t the isothiocyanates  from the power vegetables will stay in 
your bladder longer.   
                                                        Correct  
 
                                                   No     Yes  
 
 
CORRECT: Yes, that’s right - good job!  
INCORRECT : Isothiocyanates from power vegetables goes to your urine. The urine then goes to your bladder. The 
isothiocyanates in your urine will work to kill any cancer cells in your bladder. The longer the bladder is exposed to the 
isothiocyanates in your urine, the  longer it will be exposed to anti -cancer activities. Many people urinate several times a 
day a less often at night. So, there is a greater chance that the isothiocyanates from the power vegetables will say in your 
bladder longer if you eat power vegetable s at night.

tailored personally to  you. Each call will ask you how many cups of power vegetables you ate for the week, figure out 
whether you are meeting your action plan goals, and then give you tailored support based on the obstacles and strategies 
you wrote down in your action plan. So,  it will really be important for you to complete your POW -R Book every day, 
calculate your total power vegetables eaten at dinner or after dinner at the end of every week, and have that available 
when you receive the phone call.

call this number too to complete your automated phone call. There will be 11 automated phone call and we ask you to 
complete all 11 calls.  
Each call will start by asking you what your date of birth is, so the system will know it is you.  For example, if you 
were born January 3, 1953, you would enter 01 -03-1953. The system will call you from this number: 716 -333-POWR. 
You can also call this nu mber if you miss the call.  
Can you tell me how you will enter your date of birth? [Confirm that the participant

 How can you get the best health benefits from fruits and vegetables?  
• Vegetables: Fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables can all be a part of healthy eating.  
o Fresh vegetables are best  
o Canned vegetables can be high in salt, so if you buy canned vegetables make sure 
you look for the ‘no salt’ ones.  
• Fruit: Fresh, frozen, and canned fruit can all be a part of healthy eating  
o Fresh fruit is best  
o Canned fruit can be high in sugar and calories, so buy canned fruit in 100% fruit 
juice with no sugar added.  
o Be careful of fruit juices! They’re high in sugar and calories, and you can miss out 
on a lot of other vitamins and minerals that eating fruits will give you.  
• Eat 2½ to 3 cups of vegetables and 1½ to 2 cups of fruit each day; or a total of 4 -5 cups of 
both fruits and vegetables a day. 1/2 cup is about the size of the front  of a closed fist. 1 cup 
is about the size of your entire fist or a baseball.

and vegetables reduces the risk of getting some cancers, high blood pressure (hypertension), 
heart disease, and diabetes.  
• Fruits and vegetables have all of these great health benefits because they have a lot of

 PART I: Closing    
Thanks for taking the time to complete this call. Next week you will start receiving automated phone calls from 
our POW -R Health Program. The purpose of the calls will be to support you to eat more fruit and vegetables. 
The calls will be tailored personall y to you. Each call will ask you how many fruit and vegetables you ate for 
the week, figure out whether you are meeting your action plan goals, and then give you tailored support based 
on the obstacles and strategies you wrote down in your action plan. So,  it will really be important for you to 
complete your POW -R Book every day, calculate your total cups of fruit and vegetables eaten at the end of 
every week, and have that available when you receive the phone call.  
The system will call you from this number: 716 -333-POWR (7697). You can also call this number if you miss 
the call. This number is on the magnet we mailed to you to remind you that this is not a spam number. Can you 
please get the magnet we sent you out? P lease place this magnet in a place that you’ll be able to see it. If you 
miss a call, you can also call this number too to complete your automated phone call. There will be 11 automated 
phone call and we ask you to complete all 11 calls.  
Each call will start by asking you what your date of birth is, so the system will know it is you. For example, if 
you were born January 3, 1953, you would enter 01 -03-1953. The system will call you from this number: 716 -
333-POWR. You can also call this num ber if you miss the call.  
Can you tell me how you will enter your date of birth? [Confirm that the 
participant can provide their DOB correctly]  DOB  Correctly read

Date  
 
Dear Participant,  
 
We recently received funding from the National Institutes of Health to learn more about how diet 
may reduce the risk of recurrence in individuals with early -stage bladder cancer. Men and 
women who were recently diagnosed with early -stage bladder cancer and  who live in the 
counties of Niagara, Orleans, Genesee, Erie, Wyoming, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, and Allegany 
may be eligible for the study.  
 
We are asking you to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed and treated for 
bladder cancer. The goal of this study is to make a healthy eating program to improve cancer 
outcomes. The purpose of this study is to compare two types of healthy  eating programs. This 
study will allow the researchers to know whether different types of healthy eating programs can 
improve the bladder cancer outcomes of the patients. The intervention that you will receive as 
part of this study will be given to you at  no cost.  
 
If you agree to take part in this research study, you will receive a $100 gift card for completion 
of the baseline surveys and you will receive another $100 gift card for completion of the 6 -month 
survey.   
 
This study has been reviewed and approved by the Roswell Park Institutional Review Board to 
assure that the study plans will not put any participants at risk. Your involvement in this study 
does not involve any physical risk to you. The possible risks might be feeling uncomfortable 
answering questions, embarrassment, or someone identifying you as a participa nt in the group, 
although this would be rare. You will not receive any direct health benefit from participating in 
this study.  
 
Someone from our office will call you to make sure you received this letter and to discuss the 
study with you.  If you have any questions, please call us at 716 -845-XXXX. We hope that you 
will be able to help us by completing the survey.  
 
We hope to hear from you soon!

Date  
 
Dear Dr. X,  
 
Your patient or colleague recently participated in the POW -R Health research study, a National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) -funded study that is testing different dietary strategies to lower the risk of 
bladder cancer recurrence. We are excited about this study because it may produce a dietary 
intervention that helps reduce the risk of bladder cancer recurrence and improve bladder cancer 
survivorship.  To be noted, the funded study is a behavior intervention program that has no 
relevance to clinical treatment reg ardless of whether clinical care is provided.  
 
We are contacting you because either your patient or colleague nominated you to be a part of this 
study. To be part of the study, all we need is to conduct a 15 -minute phone interview with you to 
gain a physician’s insight on how our dietary intervention —if proven to be successful —could be 
incorporated into routine care. Physicians who participate will receive a $100 gift card from a 
local store as a small token of our appreciation.   
 
If you can participate in a 15 -minute phone interview, please let us know by filling out the card 
included in this mailing. If you do not want to participate, please let us know on the card so we 
do not contact you in the future.  
 
For more detailed information about the study, please review the included information sheet.  
 
Thanks so much for our consideration. We hope to hear from you soon.

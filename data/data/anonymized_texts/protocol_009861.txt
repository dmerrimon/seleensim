Study Title:  Evaluation of the Performance of Trima Accel® Version 7.0 Software Enhancements 
for the Collection of Platelets Stored in Platelet Additive Solution  
Study Number:  CTS-5059  
Target Population:  Healthy Adults  
Device Description:  The Trima Accel system  is an automated blood component collection system that uses 
centrifugal force to separate donor blood into platelet, plasma, and red blood cell 
(RBC) components and uses Anticoagulant  Citrate Dextrose, Solution  A (ACD -A) as 
the anticoagulant. The device is comprised of three major sub -systems, 1) the Trima 
machine itself, 2) sterile, single -use disposable blood tubing sets  and, 3) embedded 
software. There are additional optional accessories such as plasma bags , platelet bag s, 
a seal safe system, and barcode scanner kit.  
The Trima Accel system  received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
510(k) clearance for hyperconcentrated platelet collections stored in platelet additive solution (PAS) on 17 December  2012 (BK120049).  
Intended Use:  The Trima Accel system is an automated blood cell separator intended for use in 
collecting blood components for later transfusion into patients . 
Study Centers Planned:  At least 2 and up to 8 Blood Centers  in the United States  
Objective:  To verify that platelets collected on the Trima Accel system  with Version 7.0 software 
enhancements and  stored in PAS meet the FDA requirements for leukoreduction 
(< 5.0 × 106 residual white blood cells [WBC] per transfu sable unit).  
Rationale:  The study is designed  to evaluate changes to the Trima Accel software to ensure the 
modified software  meet s the FDA acceptance criteria for leukoreduction  and platelet 
yield . The operating range for the system flow rates, anticoagulant ratios, storage 
conditions, and centrifugal forces are the same as the currently cleared Trima Accel 
system. There are no changes to the environment or storage conditions for platelets ; 
therefore, no in vitro or in vivo platelet quality data will be collected . 
Outcome Measures:  Primary Endpoint:  
The proportion of platelet units with an acceptable residual WBC level. Acceptable residual WBC counts are: singles = residual WBC level < 5.0 × 10
6; doubles  = residual 
WBC level < 8.0 × 106 or < 5.0 × 106 for each transfusable unit; and triples = residual 
WBC level < 12.0 × 106 or < 5.0 × 106 for each transfusable unit.  
Secondary Endpoint:  
The proportion of platelet units with an acceptable platelet yield . Acceptable platelet 
yield for single, double and triple platelet products are: platelet yield ≥ 3.0 × 1011 for 
singles, platelet yield ≥ 6.2 × 1011 for double s, and platelet yield ≥ 9.3 × 1011 for triples.  
Safety Measures:  Safety will be monitored through collection of adverse event s (AEs) , serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ), and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs). 
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Age 18 years or older . 
2. Meets the inclusion criteria defined by the Blood Center for an apheresis platelet 
with PAS  collection on the Trima Accel system . These criteria are based on FDA  
guidance  and American Association of Blood  Banks (AABB) standards. Note: 
subjects who are deferred from volunteer community donations because of travel 
restrictions, piercings , or tattoos may participate in the study, as products are not 
transfused . 
3. Has given writt en informed consent .

Confidential  Page 5 of 38 Exclusion Criteria:  1. Has previously donated a n evaluable platelet  product in this study (CTS -5059).  
Number of Subjects  
Planned:  Up to 450 healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in this study to complete 93 single, 
93 double and 93 triple  collections . 
Study Design:  This is a prospective, open -label, multi -center controlled study to evaluate the 
leukoreduction of platelets stored in PAS  collected on the Trima Accel system  
Version  7.0 software enhancement . Up to 450 healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in 
this study to ensure 93 single, 93 double and 93 triple platelet product evaluable data 
points. Evaluable is defined as a completed platelet product that does not meet any of the protocol analysis exclusion criteria.  
Plateletpheresis will be per site standard practice and per applicable FDA guidelines such as the FDA Collection of Platelets by Automated Methods, December 2007 
Guidance for Industry  and Pre -storage Leukocyte Reduction of Whole Blood and 
Blood Components Intended for Transfusion, September 2012.  
Study Duration:  Study participation will be up to 30 days and will consist of 1 to 2 visits. Screening may be done within 30 days of the apheresis procedure or combined as a single visit, which includes screening and the apheresis procedure all in 1 day.  
The entire study should be completed in approximately 16 months.  
Statistical Methodology:  Counts and percentages of success rates and the lower one- sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence intervals will be calculated separately for success rates of single, double, and triple platelet products . If 0 or 1 failure is observed, then the confidence interval 
will suggest that the true success rate is at least 95% with 95% confidence for the given platelet product. This approach will be applied independently to single, double, and 
triple platelet products.  
Also applied independently to single, double, and triple platelet products, the lower one-sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals will be calculated for the 
proportion  of platelet units with an acceptable platelet yield . If 16 or fewer  failures are 
observed, then the confidence interval will suggest that the true success rate is at least 75% with 95% confidence for the given platelet product.

1.1 Background  
Platelet transfusions are used extensively for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
associated with major trauma, surgery , or chemotherapy, and in individuals that are 
thrombocytopenic (have low platelet count) or have other platelet dysfunctions.  
Currently, the majority of platelets transfused in the United States are collected by apheresis.1 
Platelets collected by apheresis are separated from donor blood using advanced techniques and 
the remaining blood components (red blood cells [RBC], white blood cells [WBC] and/or 
plasma) can be cycled back to the donor. The use of platelet concentrates obtained from single 
donors by automated apheresis has grown steadily as the collection instruments have improved 
to enable collection of double or even triple doses of platelets (hyperconcentrated) in a single apheresis collection. This practice maximizes the amount of platelets collected from each donor in a manner that  is time and cost efficient, and it has the benefit of exposing the recipient to as 
few individual donors as possible, thereby potentially minimizing the risk of transfusion related adverse events (AEs) such as pathogen transmission and immune reactions.
2  
The risks posed by WBCs in transfused blood components are recognized as an additional and substantial problem in transfusion medicine. Residual WBCs in blood components have been 
implicated in transfusion complications, including transfusion- associated graft -versus-host 
disease (TA -GvHD ), alloimmunization, febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, transmission 
of intracellular viruses (eg , cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and 
transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM). To reduce the risk of WBC induced transfusion 
complications, leukoreduction is employed and removes the majority of WBCs from blood 
component products.
3,4 
In addition to leukoreduction in platelet products, platelets can be stored in platelet additive 
solution (PAS). In Europe it is common practice t o replace part of the plasma with  PAS. The 
rationale behind this practice is that diluting the plasma may reduce the risk of deleterious 
reactions such as allergic reactions and immune reactions triggered by cellular mediators present 
in the plasma.5 Subst ituting PAS for plasma  may have other advantages as well. It has a more 
consistent composition than plasma from different donors, it can be optimized for longer storage, and it allows for a more frugal use of blood components since more plasma can then be used for 
other applications instead of platelet storage.
6,7 
Platelet additive solution  has been used for over 20 years in Europe. In the United States , the first 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the use of PAS was in 2009. This first 
approval was for the use of the PAS InterSolTM (Fenwal™, a Fresenius Kabi company) as a 
replacement of 65% plasma in platelet components. Subsequently, approval was received in 2012

2 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
Terumo BCT, Inc. (Terumo BCT) is a corporation that develops and markets the Trima Accel 
system , an apheresis medical device for the collection of blood products, including platelets. The 
Trima Accel  syste m is an automated blood component collection system that uses centrifugal 
force to separate donor blood into platelet, plasma, and RBC  components using Anticoagulant 
Citrate Dextrose, Solution  A (ACD -A) as the anticoagulant . The device is comprised of 3 ma jor 
sub-systems: 1) the Trima machine itself; 2) sterile, single -use disposable blood tubing sets; and 
3) embedded software. There are additional optional accessories, such as plasma bag, platelet 
bag, seal safe system, and barcode scanner kit .  
The Trima Accel system consists of a functionally closed disposable set (sterile, nonpyrogenic) 
used in conjunction with equipment and software to collect combinations of blood products. 
Collections for this study will be performed per the Version 6.0 Trima Accel Op erators Manual  
and the Version 7.0 user change summary  which is provided to the study site by the Sponsor. 
The Trima system  4.0 was initially cleared  for the collection of platelets by the FDA on 13 
October 1998 (BK970023). The Trima Accel system was clear ed under BK010046 and 
BK010050 and additional Trima Accel embedded software modification s have been submitted 
and cleared  by the FDA  with the most recent approval on 29 August 2014 (BK140158) for 
Version 6.4 software. 
Terumo BCT has developed new Trima Acc el embedded software (ie, Version 7.0) to enhance 
the collection of platelets stored in PAS.  
2.1 Version 7.0 Software  
The Trima Accel system Version 7.0 software is intended to consolidate multiple enhanced 
software versions with the additional value of creating improvements relevant globally. These 
improvements include enhancing the leukoreduction, reducing the procedure time, and 
improving the overall experience for the operator and donor.  
The configuration of the device (software update to Version 7.0) will be provided to the 
Investigator by Terumo BCT. These configurations will be within the normal operating r ange of 
the Trima Accel system V ersion 6.4, as clear ed by the FDA. The operating range for the system 
flow rates, anticoagulant ratios, storage conditions, and centrifugal forces are the same as the currently cleared Trima Accel system  software . 
The following modifications have been made in Version 7.0 software to be used with the Trima Accel system :

Confidential  Page 13 of 38 1. The blood prime procedure has been modified to increase the inlet pump speed during 
specific portions of prime, allowing the system to reduce the time of the blood prime procedure by improving the blood flow rates through the channel during the priming process.  
2. Modifications to the leukoreduction system (LRS) chamber clearing procedure to clear 
excess WBC content from the LRS chamber in a more efficient manner.  
3. Changes to the platelet inventory recovery (PIR) phase to reduce the platelet inventory in the separation channel and LRS chamber at the end of the procedure when sufficient 
platelets remain.  
4. The platelet collection algorithm has been modified to improve the control of the 
concentration of platelets deliver ed to the LRS separation chamber, thereby improving 
the leukoreduction potential of the LRS chamber. 
5. The platelet collection algorithm for hyperconcentrated platelets has been modified to 
improve the control of the concentration of platelets within the LRS separation chamber, also improving the leukoreduction potential of the LRS chamber. 
6. Improvements to the venous access pressure monitoring algorithms have been made that adjusts the draw flow rate in response to a venous access alarm  (autoflow) . Specifical ly, 
this algorithm allows for longer pump pauses in response to a venous access alarm by automatically lowering the flow rate  and will automatically increas e the flow rate when  
no venous access  alarms occur . 
7. Maintenance modifications to the software to upg rade the operating system from 
VxWorks 5.5 to VxWorks 6.9. 
2.2 Arm  Cuff  
It is standard practice during phlebotomy to use a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff approximately 2 inches above the antecubital area for venipuncture.
8 The American Association 
of Blood Bank s (AABB) recommends applying 60 mmHg of pressure either via a tourniquet or 
blood pressure cuff and have the donor squeeze a hand-gripper several times and hold during the process of obtaining venipuncture.
8 After venipuncture, it is recommended to have the donor 
relax their hand and give the gripper a slow, firm squeeze every 5-10 seconds and loosen the tourniquet or blood pressure cuff to 40 mmHg.
8 In regards to the apheresis procedure, the AABB 
recommends sites follow their standard operating procedures (SOPs), which generally state to 
maintain appropriate pressure (20 to 40 mmHg) and blood flow (ie, squeeze a hand -gripper) 
during the apheresis procedure.

Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS- 5059  Version 4.0: 22 NOV 2016   
 
Confidential  Page 14 of 38 Terumo BCT has developed an arm cuff which can be used as an alternative to maintain pressure 
on the arm and blood flow during apheresis procedures. Specifically , this arm cuff has a pressure 
control valve which allows the cuff to be fully inflated for use in obtaining venipuncture, an inline relief valve which allows the cuff to maintain the desired donation pressure (20 to 
40 mmHg) , and an inflation bulb which the donor may squeeze to maintain the donation 
pressure.  
The arm  cuff is not connected or linked to the Trima Accel system  and will be submitted f or FDA 
clearance as a standalone  device as  an alternative method to the standard methods of maintaining 
arm pressure and blood flow for apheresis procedures. In the current study, half the study sites will receive the arm  cuff and the remaining will utilize their standard method of maintaining 
donation pressure as indicated by the S ite SOP. The use of the arm cuff is not expected to impact 
the leukoreduction, volume, or yield of single, double or triple platelet products.  
2.3 Platelet Additive Solution  
InterSol solution was FDA approved for the storage of hyperconcentrated platelets (BN080041) on 07 December 2009  for use with  the 
AmicusTM Separator system  (BK090065) . InterSol PAS  is 
an isotonic solution designed to replace a proportion (65%) of the plasma used in the storage of 
leukoreduced apheresis platelets under standard blood banking conditions.  
The solution contains constituents that are naturally occurring components present in many cellular systems: sodium acetate as a n utrient, sodium citrate to prevent platelet clumping and 
activation, sodium phosphate for buffering, and sodium chloride for osmolarity. InterSol solution does not have a pharmacological effect in vivo, but rather acts to provide the appropriate 
environment for platelet storage in lieu of a portion of the plasma. 
InterSol solution is provided as a 500 mL sterile and non-pyrogenic solution in a non-polyvinyl 
chloride plastic container with a sterile and non-pyrogenic fluid path. Each 100 mL of InterSol contains 305 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, anhydrous, United States 
Pharmacopeia ( USP); 93 mg monobasic sodium phosphate, monohydrate, USP; 318 mg sodium 
citrate, d ihydrate, USP; 442 mg sodium acetate, trihydrate, USP; 452 mg sodium chloride, USP; 
Water for Inject ion, USP quantity sufficient. 
Currently , the use of InterSol  solution for storage of platelets  with the Trima Accel system  has 
not been cleared by the FDA . The FDA has recently approved a prospective in vitro study of 
platelets collected on the Trima Accel system  and stored in InterSol solution (IDE 16145).

The collection of single, double, and triple platelets stored in PAS will be done with the Trima 
Accel Platelet + Sampler + AutoPAS, MultiPlasma, RBC disposable set (catalog number 80370). 
This disposable set was cleared by the FDA (BK120049) on 17 December 2012. 
3 INTENDED USE STATEME NT 
The Trima Accel system is an automated blood cell separator intended for use in collecting blood components for later transfusion into patients. Depending on the tubing set used, the Trima Accel system may collect multiple blood components, alone or in combination. For the purposes of this study the following products will be collected under this protocol: 
• Platelets Pheresis, Leukocyte Reduced in 65% InterSol PAS (single, double, and triple units) 
with or without concurrent plasma. 
4 NONCLINICAL STUDIES  
Laboratory assessments using human and bovine whole blood pools to test software changes 
related to procedure time and platelet leukoreduction have been conducted at Terumo BCT. 
Specifically, modifications to previously released versions of Trima Accel software regarding the 
blood prime and the PIR algorithm have been tested to confirm the software changes in Version  7.0 maintain  product volume accuracy  and reduce the overall time of the apheresis 
procedure. These software modifications tested in whole blood pools resulted in a product 
volume accuracy ± 6%  indicating the system was properly primed for the collection procedure 
and decreased the overall procedure time.   
Additionally, the in vitro quality of double hyperconcentrated platelets collected from a single 
donor on the Trima Accel system , split and then stored in plasma via gravity drain and InterSol 
solution via auto PAS- metering  was tested . The acceptance criteria
9 of pH (22°C) > 6.2 was met for 
all units in this study through 7 days of storage. In vitro cell quality of platelets stored in InterSol 
solution (determined by extent of shape change [ESC], hypotonic shock response [HSR], 
membrane-bound P-selectin expression [CD62P], and morphology scoring) was robust in 
InterSol solution stored platelets and was comparable to control platelets stored in plasma.  
5 CLINICAL TRIAL EXPERIENCE  
The software modifications  being proposed in Trima Accel V ersion 7.0 software have been  
studied alone and in combination from  clinical donations from healthy donors. Software changes  
made to  previously released software versions were tested to determine if the additional 
Version  7.0 software modifications resulted in improved leukoreduction, maintained platelet 
yield, and decreased procedure time.

Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS- 5059  Version 4.0: 22 NOV 2016   
 
Confidential  Page 16 of 38 5.1 Hyperconcentrated Platelet Leukoreduction Improvements  
Changes to the platelet collection algorithm were tested in blood donations from healthy 
volunteers to determine if software modifications resulted in  improvements to the platelet 
leukoreduction in hyperconcentrated platelet products. In hyperconcentrated platelet products, 
the modified platelet collection algorithm alone showed an overall system performan ce of 100% 
of products containing < 5.0 × 106 WBCs per transfusable dose and 99.9% of hype rconcentrated 
products contain < 1.1 × 106 WBCs per transfusable dose per log normal regression analysis. 
When this modification was assessed with  additional Version 7.0 enhancements (n = 24), all  of 
the hyperconcentrated products contained < 5.0 × 106 WBCs per transfusable dose.  
5.2 Platelet Yield and Procedure Time Improvements 
The Trima Version 7.0 software has been modified to improve the overall platelet collection 
procedure time by modifications  to the disposable set priming procedure and  the LRS chamber 
purge process . Changes to the prime procedure alone (n  = 52), resulted in a product volume 
accuracy ± 6% and when tested with other Version 7.0 enhancements (n = 40) platelet 
concentrations in the plasma product averaged 5 × 103 cells/uL.  
The venous access monitor has been modified to adjust the draw flow rate in response to venous access alerts (autoflow). A clinical assessment of the autoflow algorithm paired with the arm cuff 
(n = 30) resulted in the average operator intervention per procedure being 0.433 ± 0.935. An 
additional study was conducted with the autoflow paired with the Version 7.0 software modifications and showed an average operator intervention rate of 0.50 ± 0.88 per procedure. 
These modifications are a significant improvement over the United States average of access 
related events (approximately  5 per procedure as determined by Terumo BCT historical data) . 
The LRS chamber purge modifications resulted in 3-5 minutes of time advantage over the 
current Trima Accel collection for each algorithm respectively. There is an  even greater time 
savings advantage for runs wher e 1 or more purges are saved due to LRS chamber purge 
changes. T he time savings due to PIR software modific ations are dependent on the donor size 
and precount on the day of donation and therefore may differ per donation. 
6 RATIONALE FOR THE CU RRENT STUDY  
The study is designed to evaluate changes to the Trima Accel software (Version 7.0) to ensure they meet the FDA acceptance criteria for leukoreduction
9,10 (< 5.0 × 106 WBC per transfusable 
unit) and results in platelet yield s ≥ 3.0 × 1011 for singles, ≥ 6.2 × 1011 for doubles and 
≥ 9.3 × 1011 for triples.  
The operating range for the system flow rates, anti -coagulant ratios, storage conditions, and 
centrifugal forces are the same as the currently FDA cleared Trima Accel system. There are no

will be evaluated . Additionally, no products will be transfused from this study. 
The Trima Accel system Version 7.0 software is intended to consolidate multiple enhanced 
software versions with the additional value of creating improvements relevant globally. This 
effort will yield a software release with several new enhancements targeted at improving 
productivity, leukoreduction and WBC flagging, reducing procedure time, reducing venous access alarms , and improving the user and donor experience.

8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
8.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective, open- label, multi-center controlled study to evaluate the leukoreduction of 
platelets stored in PAS collected on the Trima Accel system  with Version 7.0 software 
enhancement s. Up to 450 healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in this study to ensure 93 single, 
93 double, and 93 triple platelet product evaluable data points. Evaluable is defined as a 
completed platelet product that does not meet any of the protocol analysis exclusion criteria 
(Section 15.4).   
The additional subject s account for screen failures, incomplete procedures, and protocol analysis 
exclusions. 
Concurrent plasma will be collected from qualifying subjects  to exercise the platelet/plasma 
product combination. Of the 93 evaluable procedures required for each type (singles, doubles, 
and triples) at least 25% of collections will include concurrent plasma collection.  The Trima 
Accel system  calculates subject  eligibility for blood product combinations based on platelet 
count, hemoglobin or hematocrit, and total blood volume (TBV) of the subject .  
Red blood cells will not be collected in this study ; platelets will be collected in 65% InterSol 
PAS and 35% plasma.  The Trima Accel system  collects RBCs after platelets and plasma, 
therefore there is no effect of RBC collections on the platelet collections due to platelet collection software modifications. Similarly, there is no effect of the platelet collections on 
subsequent RBC collections.  
8.2 Study Duration  
Study participation will be up to 3 0 days and will consist of 1 or 2 visits. Screening may be done 
within 30 days of the apheresis procedure or combined as 1 visit, which includes screening and the apheresis proced ure all in 1 day. The apheresis procedure can last from 25 to 150 minutes, 
dependent upon the product to be collected, machine configuration, subject parameters, the 
quality of the vascular access, and the tolerance of the subject to the ACD-A anticoagulan t.  
The entire study should be completed in approximately 16 months.

 A donor is considered to be an enrolled subject following inform ed consent. It is expected that  
due to the screening and eligibility requirements, some fraction of subjects will not qualify for a 
platelet/plasma donation after consent and some who are enrolled may not complete their anticipated procedures. Subjects will be considered screen failures if they fail to mee t any of the 
eligibility  criteria , and subjects who do not complete their anticipated procedure (after 
venipuncture) will be considered as a study procedure discontinuation/t ermination . 
After informed consent has been obtained, s ubjects  will receive a unique study identification 
(USID)  number . The USID  number will use the following convention: 59XX- YYY , where XX is 
the pre-assigned site number and -YYY will be a sequential number starting with 001. The USID  
number will be  recorded  on the electronic Case Report Form (e CRF) .   
Subjects that fail screening criteria on information or laboratory values that are anticipated to change, may be rescreened. Subjects that have incomplete procedures or donated a product that 
meets any of the p rotocol analysis exclusions (Section 15.4) may rescreen if they meet all

13 ADVERSE EVENTS/EFFECTS 
13.1 Anticipated Risks 
13.1.1 Potential Apheresis Related  Risks  
Donor reactions are mostly transient self-limited events, and in very rare exceptions a donor may experience long -term morbidity or sustain permanent impairment.
11,12 Small hematomas, 
presyncopal episodes , and citrate reactions account for the majority of complications in 
automated collection procedures, and younger or first-time donors are more likely to experience complications .
12-14 Although rare (< 5 out of 10,000 apheresis donations), almost 40% of 
reactions requiring medical care outside the donation premises are venipuncture related, including large hematoma, and possible nerve irritation.
14 
13.1.2 Veni puncture Related  
The risks associated with venipuncture for blood sampling or intravenous ( IV) access include 
apprehension, pain, discomfort, venospasm, fainting, bruising, infiltration at the venipuncture site, clotting in the IV tubing, and/or administra tive errors. Occurrence rates of venipuncture AEs 
are summarized in Table 13-1.

b Faint defined as a brief loss of consciousness, usually less than 30 seconds.  
13.1.3 Apheresis Complications in Healthy Donors  
Apheresis donation is reasonably safe and the majority of complications are mild in nature. 
While definitions on severity differ in the literature, commonly used parameters to assess severity are the necessity for outside medical care, recovery time, and p otential life -threatening 
consequences. Mild reactions consist of signs and symptoms with a normal recovery time (within 15 min). Moderate reactions usually require medical care and/or have a prolonged recovery time (within 30 min), and severe reactions comprise life -threatening risks and/or recovery time goes 
beyond 30 min.
17-19 Mild citrate reactions are very common with apheresis procedures, while 
vasovagal reactions are substantially lower compared to whole blood donation.14,17 Some donor 
reactions that  have been previous ly reported for automated collection procedures are anxiety, 
chills, digit and/or facial paresthesia, fever, headache, hematoma, hyperventilation, hypotension, light-headedness, nausea and vomiting, fainting, unpleasant taste sensations, urtica ria, and 
allergic reactions. Adve rse reactions listed in Table 13-2 are general apheresis risks and are not 
specific to the Trima Accel system .

13.1.4 Apheresis Risks with the Trima Accel System  
Trima Accel disposable tubing sets are sterilized with ethylene oxide which may cause 
anaphylactic reactions. Though cases of allergic reactions to ethylene oxide are reported in 
literature, Terumo BCT has no knowledge that any such event has occurred with the Trima A ccel 
system  to date. 
13.2 Risk Mitigation  
To minimize risks of subject injury, the following general procedures are to be followed: 
1. Ensuring that all Investigators are properly qualified and meet pre- specified criteria for 
Investigator selection and that they and their study teams successfully complete the 
following training: Site specific training, Human Subject Protection, and  Clinical 
Investigation P lan (CIP) training to include device and procedure training.  
2. Ensuring that subjects who are enrolled meet all eligibility criteria, including minimum hemoglobin or hematocrit and platelet limits for donation. The apheresis devices are

Confidential  Page 25 of 38 programmed to allow collection of products only from subjects who will meet projected 
hematocrit and platelet standards at the com pletion of the collection. These limitations are 
for the safety of subjects and apply to this protocol. 
3. Stopping the procedure if moderate or severe AEs occur. The subject can also request that 
the procedure be stopped at any time.  
4. With the collection of p rotected health information (PHI) associated with this research 
study, there is a small risk of violation of privacy and loss of confidentiality. The apheresis collections will be documented on the Study Site’s SD . Electronic CRFs will be 
uploaded to the e lectronic data capture ( EDC ) with only subject and product number as 
subject identifiers, to ensure confidentiality.  
5. Subjects will be questioned concerning adverse experiences throughout the procedure. Subjects will also be visually monitored for signs of distress during blood donation. 
Suspected adverse reactions will be treated according to study sites’ SOPs and 
documented on the SD and e CRFs.  
13.3 Adverse Event Definitions 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medical device, whether or not considered related to the 
medical device and/or procedure. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the medical device and/or procedure. 
13.4 Adverse Event Recording  
Adverse events that occur after signing  the informed consent form (ICF) will be recorded on the 
AE eCRF.  
13.5 Adverse Event Reporting  
13.5.1 Severity  
This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Scale, Version 4.03 for AE grading.
22 The CTCAE includes a grading (severity) scale for each AE term. 
Grades were developed using the following guidelines: 
Grade 0  – No AE or within normal limits.  
Grade 1  – Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  – Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated.

Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS- 5059  Version 4.0: 22 NOV 2016   
 
Confidential  Page 26 of 38 Grade 3  – Severe; medically sig nificant but not immediately life threatening . 
Grade 4  – Life threatening.  
Grade 5  – Fatal.  
13.5.2 Relationship  
The Principal Investigator (PI) at each site will be asked to document his/her opinion of the 
relationship of the event to the device and/or procedure( s) as follows:  
Not Related:  
The event is clearly related to factors other than the study device and/or procedure(s), such as the subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study treatment 
administration/ procedure, and/or follows a known response pattern to study device/procedure(s) 
but could have been produced by other factors, such as the subject’s clinical state or other 
therapeutic interventions. 
Probably Related: 
The event follows a re asonable temporal sequence from the time of study device /procedure(s) 
and cannot be reasonable explained by other factors, such as the subject’s clinical state or 
therapeutic interventions. 
Definitely Related:  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study device /procedure(s), 
and follows a known response pattern, and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors. In 
addition, the event occurs immediately following study procedure(s), and/or improves on 
stopping the study procedure, and/or reappears on resumption of study procedure(s).  
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for determining the causal assessment . 
13.6 Adverse Event Follow -up 
All treatment-related AEs must be followed in accordance with the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and other applicable regulatory 
requirements (e.g., US Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 812). The expected AE of mild 
hematoma (bruise) and/or mild infiltr ation are not followed to resolution.

Confidential  Page 30 of 38 15.1 Sample Size  
As specified in the FDA guidance, for up to 1 allowed failure, 93 platelet products are required to 
show that the proportion of platelet units with an acceptable residual WBC level is at least 95% with 95% confidence.
 9 With 93 platelet products being collected, 16 failures or fewer  is required 
to show that the proportion of platelet units with an acceptable platelet yield is at least 75% with 95% confidence. 
15.2 Outcome Measures  
15.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is the proportion of platelet units with an acceptable residual WBC level. Counts and percentages of success rates and the lower one- sided 95% exact 
binomial confidence intervals will be calculated separately for success rates of single, double, and triple platelet products . If 0 or 1 failure is observed, then the confidence interval will suggest 
that the true success rate is at least 95% with 95% confidence for the given platelet product. This 
approach will be applied independently to single, double, and triple platelet products. 
15.2.2 Secondary Endpoint 
The s econdary endpoint of platelet yield will be summarized for single, double, and triple 
platelet products. Separately for single, double, and triple platelet products, the lower one-sided 
95% exact binomial confidence intervals will be calculated for the proportion of platelet units with an acceptable platelet yield . If 16 or fewer failures are observed, then the confidence 
interval will suggest that the true success rate is at least 75% with 95% c onfidence for the given 
platelet product. 
15.2.3  Safety Measures  
Adverse event s will be summarized by the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA  
Version 18.1 or later). Tables will describe the frequency and percentage of all AEs, SAEs, and 
UADEs r eported by subjects in the safety population. Presentations will summarize AEs by 
maximum reported severity and relationship to device and procedure. AEs leading to study or procedure discontinuation will also be tabulated.  
15.3 Analysis Populations  
The safety  population will include of all subjects enrolled in this trial for whom at least 1 
apheresis procedure is initiated.  The Full Analysis Set ( FAS) will be defined separately for 
single, double, and triple platelet products. The FAS for a given platelet prod uct will consist of 
the first 93 collections that do not meet any of the protocol exclusion criteria described in Section  15.4. The FAS will be used to examine the primary and secondary endpoints.

Confidential  Page 31 of 38 15.4 Protocol Analysis Exclusions 
Data points will be excluded from analysis in the following situations: 
1. Inability to collect a complete unit due to: 
a. Subject  issues (inadequate access, reaction, needle abort, procedure 
disqualification upon Trima Accel device update of subject platelet count and 
hemoglobin or hematocrit ). 
b. Decision to stop procedure by subject , Investigator, nursing staff or operator. 
c. Equipment failure or malfunction (unrecoverable system failure; plugged or 
malfunctioning filter[s]).  
d. Protocol deviation. 
2. Decision to stop the procedure due to a change in the subject  platelet count (ie subject  
qualifies for double, however day- of platelet count is  for a single platelet product and 93 
single platelet products have already been collected). 
3. Failure or inability to update the Trima Accel system with the actual platelet count (platelet count performed on sample taken from Trima Disposable sample pouch) AND the actual platelet count differs from the entered platelet count by more than 10%. Updating the Trima Accel system with actual platelet count from the sample pouch is 
standard procedure for the Trima Accel system.  
4. Incomplete or incorrect collection procedure or post- collection processing that affects the 
primary or secondary endpoint due to: 
a. Equipment failure or malfunction. 
b. Subject  issues (inadequate access, reaction, needle abort). 
c. Unanticipated centrifuge stop during collection procedure. 
d. Failure to follow collection or post-collection handling procedure outlined in the 
Trima Operator’s Manual , and supplement(s). 
e. Subject and procedure samples are not taken as specified in protocol. 
f. Solution other than InterSol added to platelets prior to storage. 
g. Results o f endpoint assays are not available.

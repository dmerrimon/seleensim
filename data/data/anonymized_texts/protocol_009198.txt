Study Title:  A Phase 2, Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -blind , Placebo -controlled  
Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Saroglitazar  Magnesium  in Patients with 
Primary Biliary Cholangitis  
Background:  
Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC; previously referred to as “Primary Biliary Cirrhosis”) is a 
chronic progressive , autoimmune cholestatic disease that mainly affects middle -aged women . It is 
characterized by progressive inflammatory destruction of the intrahepatic small and medium -size 
bile ducts and resulting in bile duct destruction, ductopenia and portal fibrosis that progresses 
slowly to biliary  cirrhosis and subsequent  liver failure. Fatigue  (65% to 85%  of patients ) and 
pruritus  (25 – 70% of patients)  are the two common symptoms and have a major impact on quality 
of life  (QoL)  in patients with PBC . Additionally hyperlipidemia occurs in up to 85% of patients, and 
could even be the initi al serum abnormality in PBC.  
 
The etiology and exact pathogenesis of PBC are still not clear, and proposed to be related to a 
combination of genetic factors, viral and bacterial infections, autoantibodies to mitochondrial 
antigens , and / or environmental factors. At present u rsodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)  is the first line 
therapeautic agent and  obeticholic acid (OCA ) is the second line agent for UDCA intolerant or 
unresponsive . However, OCA is associa ted with dose -related worsening  in pruritus.  In the POISE 
trial, pruritus occurred more frequently in the OCA -treated groups relative to placebo, with 38%, 
56%, and 68% of patients experiencing prurit us in the placebo, 5 -10 mg, and 10 mg groups, 
respectively. Adverse changes in lipid levels, mostly due to reductions in high -density lipoprotein 
(HDL), were also common in all  OCA -treated patients.  
 
It has been reported that patients treated with UDCA monotherapy also have a suboptimal response 
in endpoints (alkaline phosphatase [ALP], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], or immunoglobulin

 [Ig]M), and some of patients will subsequently die or require liver t ransplantation, thus indicating a 
clear need for additional therapies.  
 
Ligand -activated peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor alpha (PPARα) contributes to a range of 
actions including cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. PPARα primarily downregulates BA 
synthesis through inhibition of the BA -synthesizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 cholesterol 7A1 -
hydroxylase (CYP7A1) . PPARα is the molecular target of fibrates and improvements in liver 
enzymes and lipid profiles have been reported with their  use. Fenofibrate has been evaluated for 
cholestatic liver diseases. A recent study reported significantly higher decompensation -free and 
transplant -free survival in patients treated with fenofibrate and UDCA when compared to UDCA 
alone.  
Saroglitazar,    
 
 it is a potent and predominant PPARα agonist with moderate PPARγ agon istic 
activity.  Saroglitazar  magnesium  is the first glitazar granted marketing authorization in India and is 
indicated for treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia  and hypertriglyceridemia with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus  not controlled by statin therapy . The drug was developed with an expectation to achieve 
optimum antidyslipidemic and antihyperglycemic effects, while avoiding adverse events (AEs) such 
as peripheral edema, weight gain, cardiovascular events, renal and/or liver toxicity, etc., which are 
commonly see n with other dual PPAR or PPARα agonists.  
There is strong mechanistic rationale for studying Saroglitazar  magnesium  in PBC due to its α/γ 
agonist activity. Moreover, Saroglitazar  magnesium  also improved liver function biomarkers, i.e., 
alanine aminotransfe rase ( ALT ), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ), alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) and 
gamma -glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  
Therefore , this study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of Saroglitazar  
magnesium  2 mg and 4 mg  in patients with PBC.  
Objectives - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety , tolerability, and efficacy of 
Saroglitazar  magnesium  in patients with PBC . 
Primary Objective : 
1. To investigate the effect of a 16-week treatment regimen of Saroglitazar magnesium  2 mg 
and 4 mg on AL P levels in patients with PBC . 
Secondary Objectives : 
1. To compare the effect of Saroglitazar magnesium  (2 mg and 4 mg)  and placebo on below 
mentioned  parameters following a 16 -week treatment:  
i. Alkaline Phosphatase  
ii. Lipids  profile : TG, TC, HDL, LDL, and VLDL

Methodology : 
This is a Phase 2 p rospective, multicenter, randomized, double -blind , place bo-controlled  study 
planned to enroll a total of  36 patients from  ~10-12 sites with a diagnosis of PBC who meet the 
study ’s inclusion/exlcusion criteria . The study will be conducted over a period of up to 26 weeks 
and will include a 6-week Screening Phase , a 16-week double -blind  Treatment Phase  and a safety 
follow -up visit after 4 weeks . Six patients in each group are planned for pharmacokinetic 
assessment therefore a total of 18 patients will be included. Additional patients may be enrolled 
into the study to ensure the pharmacokinetic assessment is performed on at least 6 completed 
patients in each treatment arm.  
 
Screening Phase  
 Visit 1 (Day -42): Patient eligibility for participation in the study will be assessed. Medical 
history will be obtained and physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory 
evaluations (including serology, [anti-nuclear antibody , smooth muscle antibody  and serum 
immunoglobulin level G ], clinical chemistry, hematology, liver biochemistries , and urinalysis) 
will be performed. In patients with ANA or SMA antibody positive titers, a liver biopsy must 
have been performed to rule out autoimmune hepatitis or overlap syndrome.  Female patients 
will undergo a pregnancy test. Serum ALP must be ≥1.67 upper limit of normal (ULN) to

 proceed further in the study.  
 Visit 2 (Day -14 to -7): Liver biochemistries  (ALT, ALP, total bilirubin (TB) and INR will be 
re-measured approximately 4 weeks from Day -42 to  determine eligibility.  
Elevated ALP must be ≥1.67 ULN on 2 occasions in the Screening Phase  and is necessary for 
study entry. If there is an increase of more than 30% in the levels of ALT, t otal bilirubin or 
INR at Day  (-14) to Day  (-7) [Visit 2] as compared to the values on Day  (-42) [Visit 1], then 
such patients will not be eligible for study entry.  
The average of two assessments (Visit 1 and Visit 2) of liver biochemistries and INR will be 
considered as baseline  values for these parameters . 
Randomization & Treatment Phase  
 Visit 3: The Randomization & Treatment Phase will include 6 outpatient visits over a period 
of 16 weeks, including the randomization visit. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive 
either Saroglitazar magnesium  ( 2 mg or 4 mg) or placebo  orally once daily  in addition to their 
ongoing  treatment  with UDCA  (Patients unable to tolerate UDCA will receive only the 
investigational medicinal products) , starting on Day 1 and contuining for 16 weeks. Efficacy 
and safety parameters will be assessed during each study visit as per the S chedule Visit Table.  
 Visit 3. 1: Patient will visit study site at 2 week s after randomization visit for LFT s. The LFTs 
will be performed at local laboratory.  
 Visits 4 , 5 and 6: Patients will visit the study site at Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5) and 
Week 12 (Visit 6) for clinical assessment, dispensation and reconciliation of study drug, and 
measurements of efficacy endpoints.  
 End-of-treatment Visit (Visit 7): An End -of-double -blind  treatment will occur at Week 16 
and considered as End of Treatment visit.  The clinical assessment, reconciliation of study 
drug, and measurements of efficacy and safety endpoints  will be performed as per the study 
schedule.  
 Safety Follow -up Visit (Visit 8) : A final post -treatment visit  will occur 4 weeks  (±3 days) 
after the End -of-treatment Visit for safety monitoring.  A clinical examination and safety lab 
assessment will be performed during this visit.  
Patient withdrawal  
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study prematurely for any reason, the End of 
Treatment Visit procedures should be followed.   
The Investigator may withdraw a subject from the study for any of the following  reasons : 
1. Subject who reports AE and i f considered in Investigator’s/Medical Expert’s opinion

 that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  
2. Any subject found to have entered the study in violation of this protocol.  
3. Subject’s lack of compliance to the study protocol.  
4. Any subject who wishes to withdraw his / her consent for participation in the study.  
5. In case a subject becomes pregnant, then she will be withdrawn from the trial.  
6. Any subject who requires the use of unacceptable concomitant medications as 
mentioned in ex clusion criteria and restrictions.  
7. Termination of study by sponsor, IRB/IEC, or the regulatory authority.  
Discontinuation of Subject Investigational Product (IP)  
Patients with worsening liver function will not be enrolled in the study. Evidence of worsening liver 
function will be assessed based on the 2 initial laboratory values used to establish the baseline.  
Elevation s in ALT and/or AST , occurring after the init iation of study drug , that meet the definition 
of a potential Case of Drug -Induced Liver Injury per below;  
1. If patients with abnormal baseline liver indices develop elevations of AST or ALT 
greater than 2x baseline or total bilirubin greater than 1.5x basel ine values while on 
study, testing shall be repeated within 48 -72 hours.  
2. If there are persistent elevations in ALT or AST greater than 2x baseline or TBL greater 
than 1.5x baseline values, then close observation (testing and physical examination 2 -3 
times per week) shall be initiated or study drug will be discontinued  
 A decision to discontinue or temporarily interrupt the study drug will be 
considered based on factors that include how much higher baseline ALT and AST 
were relative to the upper limit of no rmal (ULN) and how much the on study ALT 
and AST levels have increased relative to baseline, in addition to whether there is 
concomitant elevation of bilirubin or INR. Study drug will be discontinue d or 
temporarily interrupt ed:  
a. When the baseline values were < 2x ULN, discontinue if ALT or AST 
increases to > 5x baseline , 
b. When the baseline values were ≥ 2x ULN but < 5x ULN, discontinue if ALT 
or AST increases to >3x baseline , 
c. When the baseline values were ≥ 5x ULN, discontinue if ALT or AST 
increases to > 2x baseline , 
d. Discontinue if ALT or AST increase > 2x baseline AND the increase is

Criteria for Safety  
 Frequency and severity of adverse events  
 Clinical laboratory testing (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis)  
 Twelve -lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  
 Vital signs  
 Body weight  and height (at screening)  
 Physical examination  
Statistical Methods:  
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to database lock. The SAP will 
include detailed statistical aspects of the efficacy and safety analysis. Statistical analysis will be 
performed using SAS® software (version 9.4 or higher) (SAS Institute Inc., USA).  
Demographic characteristics and Baseline Characteristics will be summarized by treatment, subject 
disposition, reasons for withdrawal or by any other variables as appropriate. Unless o therwise 
stated, all the continuous variables will be represented by n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median and maximum. All the categorical variables will be presented as counts and percentages.  
Efficacy Analysis:  
Modified intent -to-treat (MITT) an d Per Protocol (PP) analysis will be carried out for the study trial.  
All efficacy analyses will be based primarily on the MITT, and analyses based on the Per Protocol 
(PP) analysis will be secondary to this.  
The MITT population will consist of all patients who have been randomized, taken at least 1 dose of 
the study treatment and have provided efficacy data for at least 1 post baseline evaluation . Missing 
values will be imputed by carrying forward the last observation value after  baseline.  
The PP analysis population will consist of all patients who have completed the treatment phase and 
have not deviated from or violated the protocol in such a way that could affect efficacy outcome.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
 
The primary analysi s for the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on the MITT. The primary 
efficacy endpoint in this study is improvement in ALP  levels after 16 weeks of Saroglitazar  
magnesium  treatment .  
The primary endpoint will be summarized and improvement from baseli ne to week 16 will be

 evaluated using Paired t -Test. Statistical significance will be defined as a p -value <0.05.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis:  
Each secondary efficacy endpoint will be summarized by treatment group at each visit, as 
appropriate.  
Endpoints such as change from baseline in ALP at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16 in 
Saroglitazar magnesium  groups as compared to placebo ; change from baseline in lipid profile (TG, 
TC, HDL, LDL, and VLDL) at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16 in Saroglitazar magnesium  
as compared to placebo ; change from baseline in liver biochemistries  (GGT, ALT, AST, Bilirubin 
and albumin) at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12  and Week 16 change from baseline in serum total bile 
acids at Week 4, Wee k 8, Week 12 and Week 16  in Saroglitazar  magnesium  as compared to 
placebo ; change from baseline in C4 and FGF 19 at week 16; and change in QoL (PBC40) at Week 
16 will be analyzed using ANCOVA model. Treatment effects will be estimated using the least -
square mean, standard error and 95% confidence intervals from ANCOVA model with baseline 
value as covariate. Comparison will be performed for Saroglitazar magnesium  groups  (i.e., 2 mg 
and 4 mg ) and placebo  using the difference in least -square means from the ANCOVA model. 
Proportion  of patients with ALP improvement , i.e. 15%, 20%, 30% , 40% and normalization  at 
Week 8 and Week 16  will be presented as counts and percentages.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for each pharmacokinetic parameter . 
These analyses will also be supported by simple summaries (n, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum) at each visit.  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety analyses wi ll be based on the Safety population which will consist of all patients who are 
known to have received at least 1 dose of study treatment, with patients grouped according to the 
actual treatment received.  
All safety endpo ints (AEs, clinical laboratory testing, ECG, body weight, physical examination and 
vital signs) will be summarized by treatment group using the following descriptive statistics: N, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and patient 
counts and percentages for categorical variables.

 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND  
Primary biliary Cholangitis (PBC) previously referred as “Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)” 
is a chronic progressive inflammatory autoimmune mediated cholestatic disease that mainly 
affect s middle age women and is characteriz ed by progressive inflammatory destruction of 
the interlobular bile duct, and the subsequent development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, 
eventually leading to liver failure  (Ulrich et al., 2015; Keith et al., 2009; EASL 2009 ). 
Fatigue (65% to 85% of patie nts) and pruritus (25 – 70% of patients) are the most prevalent 
symptoms and have a major impact on quality of life  (QoL) . Additionally Hyperlipidaemia 
arises in up to 85% of patients, and could be the initial serum abnormality in PBC  (Jayant 
and Keith, 20 03). 
The etiology and exact pathogenesis of PBC are still not clear, and proposed to be related 
with genetic factors, viral and bacterial infections, autoimmune status, and environmental 
factors . At present  ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA ) are approved 
therapeutic option s for the treatment of PBC . But, up to 40% of UDCA -treated patients have 
an inadequate biochemical response, depending on the criteria used, and such patients have 
significantly  worse transplant -free survival rates than  UDCA -responsive patients ( Gideon et 
al., 2015 ). Recently, OCA has been approved for use in PBC patients who are UDCA 
unresponsive or intolerant. However, OCA is associated with an increase in pruritus  and its 
tolerability may be sub -optimal in the real wo rld. In the POISE trial, pruritus occurred more 
frequently in the OCA -treated groups relative to placebo, with 38%, 56%, and 68% of 
patients experiencing pruritu s in the placebo, 5 -10 mg, and 10 mg groups, respectively. 
Adverse changes in lipid levels, mos tly due to reductions in high -density lipoprotein (HDL), 
were also common in all OCA -treated patients. Although, it is unclear if these changes by 
themselves are of any clinical significance ( Nevens etal., 2014 ), the presence of additional 
risk factors suc h as smoking and family history of cardiovascular disease is of concern . 
2.2 RATIONALE FOR CONDUC TING THE TRIAL  
A growing body of literature supports the notion that nuclear receptors are critically involved 
in the regulation of hepatic bile salt secretion and bile formation. In particular, PPARα which

 is highly expressed in liver, muscle, kidney and heart regulates  the transcripti on of several 
genes involved in lipid metabolism, cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis through inhibition 
of cytochrome P450 cholesterol 7A1 -hydroxylase (CYP7A1) , the rate limiting step in bile 
acid synthesis.  
PPARα is the molecular target for the fibrate hypolipidemic agents, including fenofibrate, 
gemfibrozil and clofibrate, which are FDA -approved for the treatment of dylipidemia, 
though each fibrate differs in its specificity for the different PPAR subtypes, α, β/δand γ. 
Fibrates were first noted to reduce hepatic alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoenzyme levels 
during their development as cholesterol -lowering agents in the 1970s ( Zumoff 1977) . Since 
then, case reports and pilot studies demonstrated the efficacy of  bezafibrate and fenofibrate 
in reducing the biomarkers of cholestatis and liver test abnormalities  (Ghonem et al., 2015) . 
A recent study reported significantly higher decompensation -free and transplant -free 
survival in patients treated with fenofibrate an d UDCA when compared to UDCA alone  
(Cheung et al., 2016) . 
Saroglitazar magnesium ), a dual PPAR agonist with predominantly PPARα and a 
moderate PPARγ agonist, is approved in India at the doses of 2 mg and 4 mg QD for the 
treatment of “diabetic dyslipi demia” and “hypertriglyceridemia with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) not controlled by statin therapy”. Saroglitazar magnesium Phase 2 and 3 studies in 
patients with dyslipidemia with and without diabetes, and in patients with NASH 
demonstrated potential of favorably modulating the predicting markers of PBC (alkaline 
phosphate and Gamma -glutamyl transferase) in addition to its anti -hypertriglyceridemia 
activity.  
There is a strong mechanistic rationale for studying PPAR α/γ agonist in PBC, therefore , this 
proof of concept placebo -controlled Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability and Efficacy of Saroglitazar  magnesium  (2 mg and 4 mg)  in Patients with PBC .

Clinical Experience  
Maximum Tolerated Dose in Phase 1 was 16 mg/day for 10 days was found to be well 
tolerated. In Phase I trials in healthy human volunteers, Saroglitazar  magnesium was found 
to be well tolerated in single[Jani et al., 2013] and multiple dose studies without any safety 
concern. Several Phase 2 study were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
Saroglitazar  magnesium in dyslipidemic subjects without  diabetes, diabetes and subjects 
with impaired glucose tolerance test.

 In dyslipidemic subjects with and without diabetes mellitus, Saroglitazar  magnesium showed 
favorable results in all the expected endpoints (fasting plasma glucose: (FPG) and lipid 
profile). Saroglitazar magnesium, especially 2  mg Saroglitazar  magnesium and 4  mg 
Saroglitazar  magnesium seemed to be comparable to pioglitazone and rosiglitazone and 
showed clinically relevant reduction in the TG -C, total cholesterol and FPG levels. 
Saroglita zar magnesium  has been tested in Phase 2 for NASH at 4 mg dosage form and 
demonstrated statistically significant reduction of ALT levels compared to placebo which 
was measured as the primary endpoint.

 2.4 RISK AND BENEFIT  
The safety and tolerability of Saroglitazar  magnesium is well -established  on the basis of 
pre-clinical and clinical studies (Phase 1 to Phase 3).This study will evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of Saroglitazar  magnesium in Primary Biliary Cholangitis  patient s. The commonly 
reported adverse events (AEs) during clinical studies were gastritis, asthenia and pyrexia.  
Saroglitazar magnesium is approved in India at doses of 2 mg and 4 mg QD for the treatment 
of “diabetic dyslipidemia” and “hypertriglyceridemia with  T2DM not controlled by statin 
therapy”.

definition of a potential Case of Drug -Induced Liver Injury per below;  
1. If patients with abnormal baseline liver indices develop elevations of AST or 
ALT greater than 2x baseline or total bilirubin greater than 1.5x baseline values 
while on study, testing shall be repeated within 48  -72 hours.  
2. If there are persistent elevations in ALT or AST greater than 2x baseline or TBL 
greater than 1.5x baseline values, then close observation (testing and physical 
examination 2 -3 times per week) shall be initiated or study drug will be 
discontin ued 
 A decision to discontinue or temporarily interrupt the study drug will be 
considered based on factors that include how much higher baseline ALT and 
AST were relative to the upper limit of normal (ULN) and how much the on 
study ALT and AST levels have i ncreased relative to baseline, in addition to

 schedule d visits patients will have the IP administered on site after the blood sample 
collection.  
5.3 PACKAGING, LABELLING  AND RE -SUPPLY  
Tablets of S aroglitazar magnesium (2 mg and 4 mg ) and placebo will be packe d, labeled  and 
supplied by the Sponsor according to all local legal requirements.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All drug supplies must be stored in a temperature -controlled enviro nment for ambient 
temperature 20 -250C.   
All Investigators will be provided with a sufficient number of units of the IP for the conduct 
of the study. Investigational product would then be dispensed to each subject in such a way 
that the subject can take the doses in accordance with the p rotocol. A drug accountability log 
for recording the receipt, storage, dispensing and return of the IP will be maintained by the 
Investigator or any designated personnel.   
Site will contact the sponsor/designee for re -supply of the Investigational product.   
After the study has been completed, the PI must account for all study drug used, unused and 
partially used. All study drugs  will be destroyed at the site (per site’s SOPs) or returned to 
the Sponsor (or designee). Unused drug supplies will be destroyed at the site after approval

 for the same by the Sponsor.  No study drug will be destroyed or returned until drug 
accountability has been performed by the study monitor . 
5.4 STORAGE CONDITIONS  
Investigational product will be stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) and in dry place , 
protect ed from light. If the IP temperature extends outside the 20 -25°C range, a temperature 
excursion must be documented in the study -specific temperature log, and sent to the 
Sponsor. If  the excursion is within 15 -30°C, quarantine is not required, and the IP is 
acceptable for use. If the excursion is outside of the 15 -30°C range, the IP must be 
quarantined until a decision on the stability of the IP is made by the Sponsor. If the 
excursio n goes beyond the range of 15 -300 C it will be considered as a protocol deviation.  
All IP supplies in the study will be stored in a secure place with access limited to the Site 
Pharmacist or the Investigator designated site staff.  
5.5 BLINDING / UNBLINDIN G 
The study is a  double blind  study, hence study participants and investigator will not be made 
aware which preparation ( Saroglitazar  magnesium 2 mg or Saroglitazar magnesium  4 mg or 
placebo ), is to be administered. The randmization  code will be available to the Investigator, 
for emergency purposes only . The randomization code will be ava ilable on each kit which is 
concealed in the form of scratchcard. In an emergency, when knowledge of the patient’s 
treatment assignment is essential for t he clinical management or welfare of the patient, the 
investigator should make every effort to first contact the Sponsor/ designee.  
The formulation of Saroglitazar magnesium (2 mg and 4 mg ) and placebo IPs will be similar 
in appearance to make any difference in treatment unobvious to the patients and to maintain 
adequate blinding of evaluators. Neither the Investigator nor the patient should be able to 
identify the received treatment.  
In an  emergency, when knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment is essential for the 
clinical management or welfare of the patient, the investigator should make every effort to 
first contact the Sponsor/ designee .  
Prior to unblinding the patient’s treatm ent assignment, the investigator should assess the 
relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug (Yes or No). If the

 blind is broken for any reason, the investigator must record the date and reason for breaking 
the blind on the a ppropriate electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and source documents.  
5.6 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENT TO TREATMENT  GROUP  
Patient s will be randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to Saroglitazar  magnesium  2 mg , 
Saroglitazar magnesium  4 mg and placebo . The  block  randomization schedule will be 
generated using SAS® software (Version: 9. 4 or higher; SAS Institute Inc., USA).  Each 
block will contain investigational medicinal products; Saroglitazar magnesium  2 mg, 
Saroglitazar magnesium  4 mg and placebo. Each block wi ll contain at least 3 kits of IMP for 
3 patients i.e. , 1 kit of Saroglitazar magnesium 2 mg, 1 kit of Saroglitazar magnesium 4 mg 
and 1 kits of placebo.  
The subject identification number will be established at the site  based on the r andomization 
number/kit  number/ patient number  and will be used to identify the subject throughout the 
study and will be entered on all documentation. The same subject number will not be 
assigned to more than 1 subject. If a subject is not eligible to receive treatment, or if a 
subject discontinues from the study, the same subject number cannot be assigned to another 
subject.  
The subjects will first be screened into the study. Once patients are determined to be  eligible, 
they will be randomize d. The subject will also be assigned a  study drug in accordance to 
their assigned treatment group upon completion of the randomization.  
Patients will be considered randomized as soon as the first allocation of treatment number is 
assigned. The first study drug intake should take place as soon as possible after 
randomization (on the same day), under medical supervision.  
5.7 SELECTION OF DOSES  
Saroglitazar magnesium 2 mg and 4 mg have favorably modified the lipid profile in the 
dyslipidemic patients during its development in Phase 2 and 3 studies. Based on the efficacy, 
safety and tolerability results of Saroglitazar  magnesium, it is approved in India at the doses 
of 2  mg and 4 mg QD for the treatment of “Diabetic Dyslipidemia” and 
“Hypertriglyceridemia with T2DM not controlled by statin t herapy”.  Saroglitazar

Saroglitazar  magnesium 2 mg and 4 mg doses have been selected for this study.  
5.8 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
All medications received by the subject at any tim e prior to the Screening Visit and taken 
within 3 months before the Screening Visit, during the interval between the Screening Period 
and Randomization and those taken throughout the trial will be recorded on the appropriate 
electronic case report form (eC RF). The site may rely on subjec t report for this information. 
All subjects must be questioned about concomitant medication at each visit. All concomitant 
medication, both prescribed and over -the-counter, must be recorded in the eCRF. This 
includes drugs u sed on a chronic and as needed basis.  
Medications that are indicated as prohibited in the Exclusion Criteria must not be used after 
the screening visit during the interval between the screening period and randomization or 
during the trial.  
The following tr eatment/drugs will be allowed during the study.  
i. Statins are permitted as concomitant medications; however, patients will be 
monitored for statin related toxicity when it is co -admin istered.  
ii. Glycemic control medications will be permitted as concomitant medications, 
including antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl 
peptidase 4 (DPP -4) inhibitors and insulin.  
iii. Treatment for common illness during the s tudy may be allowed.  
iv. For any required concomitant medication, the patient must be on a stable dose 
for 3 months at study entry and patients must continue with their current  drug 
regimen without any change  in dosage . 
5.9 RESCUE MEDICATION AN D ADDITIONAL TREATME NT(S)  
The Investigato r at his/her discretion will be allowed to offer a rescue medication for 
clinically significant conditions correlated with the laboratory findings, if required, however, 
such interventions shall be recorded in the eCRF with description of type of intervent ion,

  Twelve -lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  
 Vital signs  
 Body weight and height (at screening)  
 The physical examination will consist of an evaluation of the head, neck, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, chest, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, extremities, and the neurological 
and musculoskeletal systems . 
All AEs will be captured and notification sent to the Sponsor. All AEs will be captured in 
eCRF. At a minimum, SAEs will be reported in the CRFs as per the timelines defined in the 
Protocol in adverse event section. However, each research institution’s IRB/IEC reporting 
requirements may contain shorter timelines.  
Serious adverse events reporting must comply with the United State of Food and Drug 
Administration ( USFDA ) reporting requirements and IRB/IEC reporting requirements.  
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that f rom time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the Investigator that may make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases, the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safety and well -being of the subject. When  a protocol required test cannot be performed the 
Investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions 
which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are a dhered to as soon as possible. 
The trial team will be inf ormed of these incidents in a timely fashion.  
All biological samples will be assayed by a Sponsor -identified CAP and/or CLIA -certified 
laboratory, using analytical methods in compliance with standard and validated 
methodologies, with adherence to written s tandard operating procedures (SOPs).  
Details regarding the sample processing, handling, storage, and shipment will be offered 
separately in the study -specific central laboratory manual prior to the initiation of the trial.  
6.2.1 Appropriateness of Measurement  
The endpoints chosen for the given study [safety and efficacy] are appropriate for the 
assessment of outcome of the study.

 6.2.2  Abnormal Laboratory Findings  
In addition, a clinically significant value outside the normal or reference range in a routine 
safety a ssessment, such as clinical laboratory, vital signs or ECG, may signify an adverse 
finding. Additional examinations or repetition of test will be performed as medically 
indicated.  
If the Investigator considers the abnormality as of major relevance, he/she should also record 
this as an AE. If the findings contribute to a clinical diagnosis (e.g. hepatitis in case of 
increased liver enzymes), then this diagnosis should be recorded as AE.  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows:  
1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
3. Test result leads to change in study dosing or discontinuat ion from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or  
4. Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of SAE , and/or  
5. Test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator.  
For any abnormal te st result that meets one of the above conditions except for the last 
condition, the Investigator will provide a justification for not reporting the abnormal test 
finding as an AE.  
Each AE shall be evaluated for the severity, duration, resolution, action ta ken and its 
association with the study treatment. The study participant may be withdrawn or terminated 
from the study depending on the seriousness of the adverse effects.

will be conducted over a period of up to 26 weeks and will include a 6-week Screening 
Phase , a 16-week Treatment Phase  and a safety follow -up visit after 4 weeks . 
Screening Phase : 
 Visit 1 (Day -42): Patient eligibility for participation in the study will be assessed. 
Medical history will be obtained and physical examination, electrocardiogram (EC G) 
and laboratory evaluations (including serology, [anti-nuclear antibody, smooth muscle 
antibody  and serum i mmunoglobulin level G ], clinical chemistry, hematology, liver 
biochemistries , and urinalysis) will be performed. In patients with ANA or SMA 
antibo dy positive titers, a liver biopsy must have been performed to rule out 
autoimmune hepatitis or overlap syndrome . Female patients will undergo a pregnancy 
test. Serum ALP must be ≥1.67 upper limit of normal (ULN) to proceed further in the 
study.  
 Visit 2 (Day -14 to -7): Liver biochemistries  (ALT, ALP, total bilirubin (TB) and INR 
will be re -measured approximately 4 weeks from Day -42 to determine eligibility.  
Elevated ALP must be ≥1.67 ULN on 2 occasions in the Screening Phase  and is 
necessary fo r study entry. If there is an increase of more than 30% in the levels of ALT, 
total bilirubin or INR at Day  (-14) to Day  (-7) [Visit 2] as compared to the values on 
Day (-42) [Visit 1], then such patients will not be eligible for study entry.  
The average o f two assessments (Visit 1 and Visit 2) of liver biochemistries  and INR  
will be considered as baseline values for these parameters.  
Randomization & Treatment Phase:  
 Visit 3: The Randomization & Treatment Phase will include 6 outpatient visits over a 
period of 16 weeks, including the randomization visit. Patients will be randomly 
assigned to receive either Saroglitazar magnesium  (2 mg or 4 mg) or placebo  orally

 the results/outcome of primary endpoints or subject safety. Minor  protocol deviations do not  
require immediate notification to the IEC/IRB unless otherwise specified by IEC/IRB 
requirements. All minor  protocol deviations will be noted in monitoring reports and provided 
to the investigator.   
Major  protocol deviation includes any violation which may influence the results/outcome of 
primary endpoints or subject safety. Major  protocol deviations must be reported immediately 
to the IRB/IEC as specified by the IRB/IEC requirements. All Major  protocol de viations will 
be reported to the Sponsor immediately.  
Note: persistent non -compliance of minor  protocol deviations may rise to the level of major  
protocol deviations.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at a given center in the event of 
monitoring and/or auditing findings of serious or persistent n on-compliance with the 
protocol, SOPs, GCP, and/or applicable regulatory requirement(s) by an 
investigator/institution.  In all case of site closure due to protocol deviations, the IEC/IRB 
and reg ulatory authority will be informed.  
The clinical study report will provide the list of protocol deviation/violation on separate 
section. The result will be analysed for all participants with major  protocol deviations.  
Protocol deviation/violation will inc lude but are not limited to the following;  
o Subjects that did not meet entry criteria  
o Subjects that developed withdrawal criteria but were not withdrawn  
o Subjects that received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose  
o Subjects that received an excluded medication  
7.6 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
Safety data including adverse events and liver -related events (i.e., clinically meaningful 
elevations in liver biochemistries  ALT, AST, and bilirubin) will be reviewed regularly by a 
Data Monitoring Committee. The Data Monitoring Committee will have a formal structure 
and will operate according to a previously agreed upon remit.

 8 BIOSTATISTICS  
8.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN  
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to database lock. The 
SAP will include d etailed statistical aspects of the safety and efficacy analysis. Statistical 
analysis will be performed using SAS® (version 9. 4 or higher) software (SAS Institute Inc., 
USA).  
8.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE  HYPOTHESIS  
Below is the hypothesis of primary efficacy endpo int:  
Null hypothesis: H 0: μs = 0 
Alternative hypothesis H 1: -μs > 0 
Where: μ s = change from baseline in ALP levels of the Saroglitazar magnesium  (2 
mg and  4 mg).  
Rejection of the null hypothesis will lead to conclude that the change from baseline in 
Saroglitazar magnesium 2 mg and 4 mg is statistically significant and hence the test drug is 
effective.  
8.3 STUDY POPULATION AND  PLANNED ANALYSIS  
8.3.1 Populations  
8.3.1.1  Safety population  
The safety population includes the subjects who satisfy all inclusion/exclusion criteria, are 
randomized and received at least single dose of study medication.  
8.3.1.2  Modified intent -to-treat population  
The modified intent -to-treat (MITT) population includes: all randomized subjects who 
received any study drug and have at  least one post -randomized  efficacy measurement.  
All primary and secondary objectives will be analysed using MITT population with LOCF 
method. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will be used as an imputation 
method for the efficacy variables fo r MITT analysis.

 8.3.1.3  Per-protocol population (PP)  
The per -protocol population (PP) includes all randomized patients who meet all the 
inclusions/exclusion criteria, completed the  treatment phase and have not deviated from or 
violated the protocol in such a way  that could affect efficacy outcome.  
8.3.2 Planned Analy sis 
Modified intent -to-treat (MITT) and Per Protocol (PP) analysis will be carried out for the 
efficacy analysis.  
All efficacy analyses will be based primarily on the MITT, and analyses based on the Per 
Protocol (PP) analysis set will be secondary to this.  
The MITT will consist of all patients who have been randomized, taken at least 1 dose of the 
study treatment and  have provided at least a post -randomized efficacy data.  Missing values 
will be imputed by carrying forward the last observation value after baseline . 
8.3.2.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on the MIT T. The 
primary efficacy endpoint in this study is improvement in ALP levels after 16 weeks in 
Saroglitazar  magnesium  treatment .  
The primary endpoint will be summarized and improvement from baseline to week 16 will 
be evaluated using Paired t -Test. Statistical significance will be defined as a p -value <0.05.  
8.3.2.2  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Each secondary efficacy endpoint will be summarized by treatment group at each time point, 
as appropriate.  
Following secondary endpoints will be analyzed:  
 Change from baseline in ALP at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16 in 
Saroglitazar magnesium  as compared to placebo.

 8.3.4 Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics and Baseline Characteristics will be summarized by treatment, 
subject disposition , reasons for withdrawal or by any other variables as appropriate. Unless 
otherwise stated, all the continuous variables will be represented by n, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, median and maximum. All the categorical variables will be presented 
as cou nts and percentages . 
8.3.5 Interim Analysis  
8.3.6 An interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 24th active 
randomized subject completes the study, that is Week 20  visit assessment.  The 
purpose of this interim analysis is to assess the effect of Saroglitazar Magnesium 
in PBC patients and to choose the optimal dose for  planning the phase III study. 
The interim ana lysis will be performed with unmasking of specified i ndividuals 
from the Sponsor who are not involved in the direct conduct of the trial. The 
study will continue until all planned s ubjects complete the study. Treatment 
masking of individual subjects will remain intact for all subjects, Investigators, 
and sta ff from the Sponsor who have contact with subjects or Investigators or 
those who are involved in the direct conduct of the study until al l planned 
randomized subjects complete the study and the f inal database lock has 
occurred. Handling of Missing Data  
Clarifications, wherever possible, will be obtained from the respective Investigator for any 
missing data or for any illegible entry, unused or unauthenticated data and this will be 
recorded in the data handling report before the final database lock.  
Subjects  who are discontinued from the study should be excluded from PP analysis set. Any 
randomized subjects who are discontinued from the study for any reason and have at least a 
post-baseline efficacy data should be included in the MITT analysis set using Last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) method. LOCF method will be used as an imputation 
method for the efficacy variables for MITT analysis.  
8.4 RANDOMIZATION  
Subject s will be randomly assigned in 1:1:1 treatment allocation ratio to Saroglitazar 
magnesium  2 mg,  Saroglitazar  magnesium 4 mg and placebo , respectively. The 
randomization schedule will be generated to ensure the treatment balance by using SAS® 
software (Version: 9. 4 or higher; SAS Institute Inc., USA).

 9 ADMINISTRATIVE MATTE RS 
The trial will be carried out in compliance with the protocol, in accordance with the ICH 
Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for GCP and in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
9.1 ETHICS  
9.1.1 Institutional Committee Review and Communications  
The trial will not be initiated before the protocol and informed consent and subject 
information form have been reviewed and have received approval / favorable opinion from 
the USFDA -registered IEC/IRB. Should a protocol amendment be written that requires 
IEC/IRB approval, the changes in the protocol will not be instituted until the amendment and 
revised informed consent (if appropriate) has been reviewed and received approval  / 
favorable opinion from the IEC/IRB. A protocol amendment intended to eliminate an 
apparent immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately providing that the 
appropriate regulatory authorities and IEC/IRB are notified as soon as possible and  an 
approval is requested. Protocol amendments only for logistical or administrative changes 
may be implemented immediately; however, both the IRB/IEC and the Regulatory Authority 
will be notified as soon as possible.  
The constitution of the IEC/IRB must c omply with the requirements of the US Code of 
Federal Regulations. A list of the IEC/IRB members, with names and qualifications, will be 
requested. If such a list is unavailable, the Investigator must provide the name and address of 
the central IEC/IRB alo ng with a statement from the IEC/IRB that it is organised according 
to GCP and the applicable laws and regulations. The IEC/IRB must also perform all duties 
outlined by the requirements of the regulatory agencies.   
9.1.2 Informed Consent and Subject Information  
Prior to subject participation in the trial, written informed consent will be obtained from each 
subject (or the subject’s legally accepted representative) according to the regulatory and 
legal requirements of the participating country. Each signature mus t be dated by each 
signatory and the informed consent and any additional subject information form retained by

 the Investigator as part of the study records. A signed copy of the IEC/IRB approved 
informed consent and any additional subject information must be given to each subject or the 
subject’s legally authorised representative.  
The subject must be informed that his / her medical records may be examined by authorised 
monitors or Clinical Quality Assurance auditors appointed by the Sponsor, by appropriate 
IEC / IRB members and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.   
Should a protocol amendment be made, the subject consent form and subject information 
form may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the protocol. It is the responsibility of 
the Inv estigator to ensure that an amended consent form is reviewed and received approval  
from the IEC/ IRB, and to further ensure that it is signed by all subjects subsequently entered 
in the trial and those currently in the trial, if affected by the amendment.  
9.2  DATA MANAGEMENT AND RECORDKEEPING  
9.2.1 Drug Accountability  
Drug supplies, which will be provided by the Sponsor, must be kept in a secure, limited 
access storage area under the storage conditions defined by the Sponsor. A temperature log 
must be maintained to m ake certain that the drug supplies are stored at the correct 
temperature.  
The Investigator and/or pharmacist must maintain records of the product’s delivery to the 
trial site, the inventory at the site, the use by each subject, and the return to the Sponso r or 
alternative disposition of unused product(s). These records will include dates, quantities, 
batch/serial numbers, expiration dates (if applicable), and the unique code numbers assigned 
to the IP(s) and trial subjects. Investigators will maintain recor ds that document adequately 
that the subjects were provided the doses specified by the protocol and reconcile all IP(s) 
received from the Sponsor.  
After the study has been completed, the PI must account for all study drug used, unused and 
partially used. All study drugs  will be adequately destroyed at the site (per site’s SOPs) or 
returned to the Sponsor (or designee). Unused drug supplies will be destroyed at the site

 after approval for the same by the Sponsor.  No study drug will be destroyed or returned until 
drug accountability has been performed by the study monitor.  
9.2.2 Patient Card  
Upon enrolment  in the study, patients will receive a patient card to be carried at all times. 
The patient card will state that the patient is participating in a clinical research study, type of 
treatment, number of treatment packs received, and contact details in case o f an SAE.  
9.2.3 Data Management  
9.2.3.1  Data Handling  
Data will be recorded at the site on eCRFs and reviewed by the clinical research associate 
(CRA) during monitoring visits. The CRAs will verify data recorded in the electronic data 
capture ( EDC ) system with source documents. All corrections or changes made to any study 
data must be appropriately tracked in an audit trail in the EDC system. An eCRF will be 
considered complete when all missing, incorrect, and/or inconsistent data has been 
accounted  for. 
9.2.3.2  Computer Systems  
Data will be processed using a validated computer system conforming to regulatory 
requirements.  
9.2.3.3  Data Entry  
Data must be recorded using the EDC system as the study is in progress. All site personnel 
must log into the system using thei r secure user name and password in order to enter, review, 
or correct study data. These procedures must comply with Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (21 CFR Part 11) and other appropriate international regulations. All passwords 
will be strictly  confidential.  
9.2.3.4  Medical Information Coding  
For medical information, the following thesauri will be used:  
o Latest version of MedDRA for adverse events and medical history, and

9.2.3.5  Data Validation  
Validati on checks programmed within the EDC system, as well as supplemental validation 
performed via review of the downloaded data, will be applied to the data in order to ensure 
accurate, consistent, and reliable data. Data identified as erroneous, or data that a re missing, 
will be referred to the investigative site for resolution through data queries.  
The eCRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed by the Investigator.  
9.2.4 Source documents  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and su bstantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the Investigator’s site. Data 
reported on the eCRFs that are derived from source documents ( SDs) must be consistent 
with the SDs or the discrepancies must be explained.  
The Inves tigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, 
depending on the trial; also current medical records – not just shadow charts – must be 
available.  
The following data to be reported on the eCRF should be included and derived from the 
source documents:  
 Subject identification (subject number, gender, date of birth/age)  
 Subject participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date 
informed consent given)  
 Dates of subject’s visits  
 Medical history  
 Medication history  
 AEs (onset and end)  
 SAEs (onset and end)  
 Originals or copies of laboratory results: All laboratory reports must be 
reviewed by the Investigator and/or his/her designee; any abnormal findings 
should be addressed.

9.2.5 Direct access to source data / documents  
The Investigator/ institution will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review 
and regulatory inspection, providing direct access to all r elated source data / documents.  
Case report forms and a ll SDs, including progress notes and copies of laboratory and 
medical test results must be available at all times for review by the Sponsor’s clinical trial 
monitor and inspection by health authorities (e.g., FDA, or other applicable regulatory 
authorities ). The on -site monitor will review all eCRFs, and written informed consents. The 
accuracy of the data will be verified by reviewing the documents described in Section 9.2. 4. 
9.2.6 Trial Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the s tudy is conducted in accordance 
with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements, and that valid data are 
entered into the eCRFs.  
To achieve this objective, the study monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the 
same time, the  Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized and easily 
retrievable data. Before the enrolment  of any patient in this study, the Sponsor or their 
designee will review with the Investigator and site personnel the following documents: 
protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed 
consent process, and the procedure for reporting SAEs.  
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor or their designee to monitor the study as frequently 
as deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are 
satisfactory. During the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be 
verified against source documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. 
After the eCRF data i s entered by the site, the CRA will review the data for safety 
information, completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. Computer programs that 
identify data inconsistencies may be used to help monitor the clinical study. If necessary, 
requests for cla rification or correction will be sent to Investigators. The Investigator and 
his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and provide any missing 
information, whenever possible.

9.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE AU DIT 
A quality assurance audit of this tri al may be conducted by the Sponsor or Sponsor’s 
designees. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the 
Investigator’s trial related files and correspondence, and the informed consent 
documentation that is relevant to this cli nical trial.  
9.4 PROCEDURES  
9.4.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the course of the clinical trial (i.e., from signing the informed 
consent onwards) will be collected, documented and reported to the Sponsor by the 
Investigator according to the specific defin itions and instructions detailed in this section.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this trea tment.  
Any medical condition already present at screening should not be reported as an adverse 
event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in 
severity or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it sho uld be reported as an 
adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g. electrocardiogram) 
findings that are detected during the study or are present at screening and significantly 
worsen during the study should be report ed as AEs. The investigator will exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
values occurring duri ng the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, 
stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.

 9.4.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse  event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of 
Sponsor's product that:  
 Results in death;  
 Is life threatening;  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongs an existing inpatient 
hospitalization;  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Is another important medical event  that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above . 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting -Procedures for Investigators:  
Initial Reports:  
Any serious adverse event, or follow -up to a serious adverse event, including death due to 
any cause that occurs to any subject from the time the consent is signed through 7 days 
following cessation of treatment, whether or not related to the Sponsor's product, must be 
reported to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence to 
investigational site.  
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an Investigator who is a qualified 
physician to be related to the Sponsor’s product that is brought to the attention of the 
Investigator at any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also 
must be reported immediately to the Sponsor.   
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system for the study. W hen the form is completed, CRO /Sponsor  Safety personnel

Follow -Up Reports  
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome. Within 24 hours 
of receipt of follow -up information, the investigator must update the SA E form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation 
(e.g., subject discharge summary or autopsy reports) to CRO /Sponsor  Clinical Safety via fax 
or e-mail. If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to th e procedures outlined 
above for initial reporting of SAEs.  
9.4.3 Evaluating Adverse Events  
An Investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events with respect to 
the elements outlined in  Table 4 . The Investigator’s assessment of causality is required for 
each adverse event. Refer to Table 4 for instructions in evaluating adverse events.

Maximum  Mild  awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Intensity  Moderate  discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity (for pediatric trials, definitely 
acting like something is wrong)  
 Severe  incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity (for pediatric trials, extremely 
distressed or unable to do usual activities)  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event (AE) is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Sponsor's 
product that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or places the subject, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred [Note: This does not include  an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.]; or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or pro longs an existing inpatient hospitalization  (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient 
admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued 
observation. (Note: Hospitalization [including hospitaliza tion for an elective procedure] for a pre -existing 
condition which has not worsened does not constitute a serious adverse event.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ( in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to 
diagnosis); or  
 Is a cancer; or  
 Is associated with an overdose (whether accidental or intentional). Any adverse event associated with an 
overdose is considered a serious adverse event. An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is 
considered a non -serious  event of clinical interest and must be reported within 24 hours.  
 Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than  1 day, indicate the appropriate length of 
time and units  
Action 
taken  Did the adverse event cause the Sponsor's product to be discontinued?  
Relationship 
to Sponsor's 
Product  Did the Sponsor's product cause the adverse event? The determination of the li kelihood that the Sponsor's 
product caused the adverse event will be provided by an Investigator who is a qualified physician. The 
Investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted 
on the AE form, en sures that a medically qualified assessment of causality  was done. This initialled 
document must be retained for the r equired regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as 
reference guidelines to assist the Investigator in assessing the likelih ood of a relationship between the test 
drug and the adverse event based upon the available information.   
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Sponsor's product 
and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the comp onents and their respective elements (in number 
and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor's product caused the adverse event:  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the Sponsor's product such as:  
reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, diary, etc.), expected 
pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time 
Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the Sponsor's 
product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with 
investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely 
Cause  Is the AE not  reasonably explained by another aetiology such as underlying disease, other 
drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors  
Relationship  
to Sponsor's 
Product  
(continued)  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Sponsor’s product 
and the AE: (continued)  
Dechallenge  Was the Sponsor's product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
      If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
           If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.

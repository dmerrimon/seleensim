 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   5 PRÉCIS Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults.1 The need for effective treatments has become imperative, as 36 million people worldwide are affected.2,3 The results from several large trials have been sobering with a lack of significant clinical outcomes, prompting a paradigm shift to initiate treatment earlier in the disease process and explore lifestyle interventions.4-7 Exercise has emerged as an exciting, non-pharmacological approach to help remediate cognitive loss or delay onset of dementia.8-13 However, to fully capitalize on the investments in exercise and to discover the full treatment potential of exercise, the brain mechanisms supporting exercise for older adults with MCI must be understood.   Using an aerobic walking intervention program, we will conduct an investigation of brain mechanisms supporting exercise, from localized function and structure of the hippocampus, to lower-level growth factors. This project will recruit 60 sedentary older adults between 55-80 years of age with early MCI. Based on the Surgeon General’s recommendation for moderate-intensity aerobic in older adults,14-15 participants will be randomly assigned to: aerobic walking for 30 mins, 5 days/week for 6 months OR health education non-active control for 6 months, with 30 participants in each arm. Primary outcome measurements include regional brain activity in the hippocampus and behavioral performance on the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST).16-17 Additionally, we will examine secondary outcomes of physical function, aerobic fitness, amyloid burden, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) associated with exercise.18-21 For exploratory purposes, all participants will be scanned with amyloid and tau PET tracers at baseline and follow-up to examine the contribution of amyloid and tau aggregation on brain function and to serve as an AD risk biomarker.    Study Title  Lifestyle Enriching Activities for Research in Neuroscience intervention trial (LEARNit)  Objectives  The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of modifiable lifestyle factors including exercise and healthy living education on brain health. The investigators will compare 2 types of interventions, moderate aerobic walking vs. healthy living education reading, over 6 months to evaluate changes in brain function, cognition, and physical function in older adults with cognitive concerns.        Our primary outcomes are neuroimaging measures of brain function after a 6--month exercise intervention, including regional BOLD activity and performance on a memory task, with secondary outcomes of brain derived neurotrophic factor, amyloid PET, physical function and aerobic fitness. We will link biological changes to meaningful clinical outcomes by examining 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   6 the relationship between enhanced brain function, improved memory performance and physical function after the intervention.    Primary outcomes. Based on the goals and innovation of this proposal, our primary outcomes are neuroimaging measure of brain function: fMRI BOLD signal in the hippocampus. Functional MRI has proven to be an effective non-invasive, in-vivo tool for measuring brain function. 22-24 Growing evidence supports that fMRI BOLD can detect neuronal changes that occur very early in the disease process. The hippocampus has been shown to be a selectively vulnerable region in AD, and several studies, including our own, identified a dysfunctional brain signal in the hippocampus in MCI patients.25-27   Secondary outcomes. The secondary outcomes consist of additional biological and clinical measures. The clinical outcomes were selected based on previous literature examining the effects of exercise and for enabling comparisons to the large ADCS exercise trial. The cognitive and functional outcome measures will be measured pre- and post-intervention (at baseline and 6 month follow-up).   Design and Outcomes    This trial is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of aerobic exercise on brain signal and memory function in individuals 55-80 years of age.  Interventions and Duration  There will be two arms:   Moderate aerobic walking OR Health education reading  Participants will engage in the arm specific intervention activities for the duration of the 6-month intervention. There will be two study visits, one at baseline and one at the end of the 6-month intervention.  Sample Size and Population  LEARNit will recruit 60 sedentary older adults ages 55-80 displaying early signs of cognitive impairment, as identified by the cognitive assessments administered at the screening visit via 1 SD or lower on one cognitive test from a neuropsychological battery. Subjects will be otherwise healthy older adults with no history of neurological disease or disorder who meet criteria to participate in the intervention and do not have any contraindications for MRI. Subjects will be randomized to one of the two arms, stratified by APOE4 status.

 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   9 1 STUDY OBJECTIVES 1.1 Primary Objective The primary objective is to evaluate change in the outcomes of fMRI brain signal and behavioral performance during a mnemonic similarity memory task after a 6-month exercise intervention. We hypothesize that the exercise arm will have differences in hippocampal brain signal and performance relative to the health education control arm.  1.2 Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives will examine change in outcomes of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), amyloid PET, physical function and aerobic fitness after a 6-month exercise intervention. We hypothesize that the exercise arm will have differences in amyloid PET accumulation, higher BDNF levels and improved aerobic fitness relative to the health education control arm.  2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects 36 million people worldwide.1 Results from several large pharmacological trials prompted a paradigm shift to initiate treatment earlier in AD. 2-3 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a preclinical stage of AD, may be an optimal period for initiating treatment. Exercise has emerged as an exciting, lifestyle intervention to help remediate cognitive loss or delay onset of dementia.8-10 However, to fully capitalize on the investments in exercise and to discover the maximum treatment potential of exercise, the brain mechanisms supporting exercise for older adults with MCI must be understood.28-30 While a large body of literature has found that exercise enhances cognition, very few intervention studies have investigated the brain mechanisms responsible for these benefits.31-36  The positive effects of exercise on cognitive function in healthy older adults were first shown over a decade ago when aerobic walking improved executive function after 6 months, relative to stretching.30 Increases in gray and white matter brain volume after a 6-month aerobic exercise intervention were later reported, and this finding was corroborated by a recent 12-month aerobic exercise study that showed increased hippocampal volume, improved memory function, and increased BDNF in healthy older adults.28,37 Overall, the majority of studies on exercise that examined brain volume and cognition were in healthy older adults, leaving exercise effects on brain mechanisms in at-risk populations, such as MCI, largely unexplored. In a home-based exercise intervention, MCI patients were randomized to an exercise of choice, usually walking, or to a usual care control arm. The walking arm improved on the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- cognitive subscale) by 0.26 points while the usual care arm actually 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   10 declined by 1.04 points.9-10 Two studies to date, have examined the effects of exercise on brain function using fMRI in an intervention study.37 These studies provided a glimpse into brain changes in MCI patients after exercise, but there is a need for a comprehensive study to understand how impaired brain mechanisms can be remediated with aerobic and strengthening exercise to support the cognitive benefits of exercise.  Using advanced brain imaging and key growth factor measures, the proposed study will take a cross-disciplinary approach to investigate the effects of exercise on brain mechanisms in individuals with MCI. Results from this study will provide critical insight into the brain mechanisms that drive the benefits of exercise on cognitive outcomes, will supply evidence of the intervention target and engagement, and will give neuroscientific support for public health interventions to increase exercise in older adults at risk for AD. 2.2 Study Rationale Using an aerobic walking intervention program, we will conduct an unprecedented investigation of brain mechanisms supporting exercise, from large-scale connectivity, and localized function and structure of the hippocampus, to lower-level growth factors. This project will recruit 60 sedentary older adults between 55-80 years of age with early MCI. Based on the Surgeon General’s recommendation for moderate-intensity aerobic in older adults, participants will be randomly assigned to: aerobic walking for 30 mins, 5 days/week for 6 months OR health education non-active control for 6 months, with 30 participants in each arm.14-15 Primary outcome measurements include regional brain activity in the hippocampus and behavioral performance on the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). Additionally, we will examine secondary outcomes of brain volume, amyloid burden, cognition and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) associated with exercise. Importantly, all participants will be scanned with amyloid and tau PET tracers at baseline and follow-up to examine the contribution of amyloid and tau aggregation on brain function and to serve as an AD risk biomarker.  3 STUDY DESIGN LEARNit is a single-site, single-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of moderate aerobic walking (55-80% target HR) versus healthy living education reading in older adults who perform at least 1 standard deviation below normative values for their age (N=60). Intervention is performed at home or in the participant’s local community (e.g., home or neighborhood). Intervention duration is 6 months. Randomization for this single-blind study was achieved using a permuted block schema with block sizes of 2 and 4. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either aerobic walking or healthy living education arms and stratified by APOE4 carrier status (yes/no) based on saliva APOE phenotyping.

Contraindications to MRI scan (e.g., pacemaker). 4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from the community using local media outlets, like the newspaper, radio, flyers and local community groups, including senior centers, retirement communities and churches. The projected enrollment is 25 participants per year. Screening and Eligibility Criteria: All study candidates will first be telephone-screened for information on demographics, exercise level, medications, and MRI contraindications. If eligible after the telephone screening, participants will receive an in-person evaluation including a detailed history, neuropsychological screening battery assessing memory and executive function. Screening for depression will be done using the self-report 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Participants will be deemed eligible, meeting criteria for a diagnosis of cognitive decline, when performance on at least one measure of the neuropsychological battery is one standard deviation below age, education and gender matched norms.  Screening Records: Detailed documentation for all subjects who are screened will be kept in the REDCap database including ineligibility documentation.  Eligibility Criteria: A summary of each participant’s in-person screening and eligibility data is included in the REDCap database in the Screening Key form. Consenting: Consent will be obtained from participants at the beginning of the Screening Visit prior to any testing. The Project Manager, Coordinator or PI will review the consent form (IFC) with participants. One of the collaborating MDs (e.g., Dr. Peter Conti) will be available to answer questions (by phone as necessary) and will sign the consent form.  A copy of the signed consent form will be offered to all participants for their records. The original signed consent form will be stored in a locked cabinet in the PI’s office. Randomization: Randomization for this single-blind study was achieved using a permuted block schema with block sizes of 2 and 4. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either aerobic walking or healthy living education arms and stratified by APOE4 carrier status (yes/no) based on saliva APOE phenotyping.  
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   13 5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  At-home Walking Program: Participants enrolled in the at-home walking program will have a program tailored to them. A trained exercise therapist will assist them in designing this program to carry out for a period of 6 months. Over the first 6 weeks subjects will engage in walking exercises that gradually increase in duration up to 150 minutes/week. The interventionist will work closely with the subject during this period to ensure proper safety, positioning, and intensity. From week 6 and on, participants will continue walking at 150 minutes/week. At the end of the study, subjects will receive a packet of reading materials for the at-home health education program to independently engage in the other intervention program, if they wish. At-home Health Education Program: Participants will be asked to participate in an at -home health education program for a period of 6 months that consists of a behavioral intervention packet of reading materials. Participants will be asked to read about two topics per month from the packet. The interventionist will work closely with them during the first 6 weeks to ensure understanding of the program and continue to visit them to ensure compliance through the duration of the intervention. Following the program, they will be offered the opportunity to attend an educational session on exercise with the interventionist and will receive materials on engaging in an at home walking program. All participants will be asked to wear a physical activity-monitoring device for the intervention period of 6 months. Participants will be asked to complete surveys, questionnaires, and keep an activity diary to be mailed in, collected by the interventionist, completed online or by phone.  5.2 Handling of Study Interventions   Aerobic Walking Arm:  The aerobic group will participate in aerobic walking for a total of 3-5 days/week for 6 months. There is a misconception of what constitutes beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of aerobics. It is exercise intensity level that determines heart rate.  The target heart rate range for participants in the aerobic training group is 60 to 75% of their maximum heart rate. Since all participants are 55 years or older, simple walking activities will be all that is required to achieve this target heart rate range. All the participants in this study are inactive and may not have much, if any, prior aerobic experience. The aerobic walking program is detailed below. Each session will include warm-up, aerobic, and cool-down periods.   Components of Aerobic Training Exercise:  
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   14 Warm-up (5 minutes) – Each exercise session will begin with an easy warm-up. Instruct the participant to use a heart rate zone of less than 50% of Max Heart Rate to guide your warm-up.  As a general guideline, a warm-up can be something as simple as walking for 5 minutes at a slower pace.    Aerobic Segment (30 minutes) – The objective is to increase subjects’ heart rates to 60% to 75% of their maximum. Subjects will measure their heart rate at 15 minutes into the walking period and at the end of walking.  At the end of the aerobic training session, have subjects record their heart rates and perceived exertion in their Exercise Diaries.   Cool-down (5 min) – Aerobic activity should always be followed by a cool-down period. The participant will slow down walking speed in the last 5 minutes of the walking session. Instruct the participant to “slow down your movement and try to get your heart rate back down to less than 50% of Max Heart Rate. “ Perceived exertion should be checked again to be sure everybody is recovering adequately  Progression of Aerobic Exercise:  Ideally participants will progress the walking program over the first 4 weeks with the following schedule: weeks 1-2 will consist of 40 minutes for 2 days/week (including 5 minutes warm-up, cool-down and 30 minutes of continuous walking). By weeks 3-4 subjects will have added the 3rd walking day at 40 minutes. Thus, by week 5 up to 6 months, subjects are participating fully in the aerobic component of the program (40 minutes total including 5 minutes warm-up, 30 minutes continuous aerobic walking and 5 minute cool-down for at least 3 days/week). However, it is likely that not all subjects in the aerobic group can progress at this rate. In these cases, the interventionist will tailor a program of increasing duration per session and increasing frequency per week to eventually achieve the complete walking program of 40 minutes.   Structure of aerobic exercise: minimum of 3 days per week (45 minutes each) walking, up to 5 days per week (30 minutes each).   If a subject has limited endurance and can only manage 10 minutes of continuous aerobic exercise during the first session before complaining of fatigue or RPE of ‘very hard exertion,’ the following adapted schedule may be used such that the subject is participating fully by Week 6.  Health Education Arm:  Interventionists will have equivalent contact with participants from the health education to that of the aerobic walking group. They will visit weekly for the first four weeks, biweekly at weeks 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   15 6 and 8, with a monthly visit thereafter.  Additional bi-weekly phone calls will be made in between the monthly visits. The health education protocol will consist of a home-based behavioral intervention packet of reading materials and videos for lifestyle practices including nutrition, stress management and risk factors for negative health outcomes (e.g., smoking, etc).   At the Orientation Visit (Week 0), subjects will complete the Health Education Contract with the interventionist and select their preferred topic order. Participants will be given a binder for the reading materials. There will be approximately two topics per month to read and participants will answer 4-5 reflection questions per week via electronic journal or on paper, to measure adherence. Because providing ‘choices’ to the subjects has been shown to greatly impact adherence, the subjects will be given the choice to complete 13 out of 15 of the topics listed above. They may order the topics however they wish and select the educational topic they want to study for every two week period. Participants should be given the new topics at each home visit.   The topic choices for each participant will be recorded in REDCap using the Health Education Topic Order instrument. This form must be completed within a week of the Orientation Visit as it links the appropriate reflection questions to the reading journals.

Other studies involving research intervention are not allowed.  5.3.2 Required Interventions  None 5.3.3  Prohibited Interventions Other studies involving research intervention are not allowed.  5.4 Adherence Assessment       Adherence will be assessed using several strategies, including Exercise Journal entries, and adherence outcomes obtained during the interventionist visits that include completed days of activity, exercise duration, time in target HR zone, subjective ratings of perceived effort, and achieved HR.      The study team and interventionists will implement behavioral management strategies to support a positive exercise environment. The goal in LEARNit will be for participants to complete at least 80% of the prescribed exercise sessions. Participants who miss one or more exercise sessions each week will be contacted by their interventionist or a study team member to provide encouragement and help generate a plan to help the participant complete the training sessions the following week. In cases where adherence is an ongoing problem, the study team may meet with the interventionist to discuss strategies to increase adherence (e.g., goal setting, reinforcers identified and scheduled, etc.). Theory and evidence-based approach to increase adherence. A challenge of employing a behavioral intervention is achieving program adherence and completion, particularly in 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   17 individuals with MCI. To increase the likelihood of meeting these goals, the interventionist will draw upon principles of social-cognitive and health belief models for personal and environmental factors and perceived barriers and benefits.38-40 The interventionist will begin by establishing rapport and trust with the participant by gaining an understanding of the participant’s perspective on the intervention and any perceived barriers to increasing self-efficacy.41-43 This will be followed by an introduction and rationale for the intervention, education on the benefits of exercise, and addressing home-life challenges. The program steps of each intervention will be detailed in a manual for the interventionist to be performed by the interventionist with the participant during two 1-hour sessions during the first 2 weeks.  To encourage adherence and accountability, these steps will be followed: 1) The interventionist will develop a contract with the participant and identify motivating factors for compliance and increasing positive health outcomes during the first 2 home visits, and a contract copy will be kept in the behavioral modification packet for the participant. 2) The participant will complete an exercise journal of activity completion (start/stop time), heart rate during activity, and any adverse events. It has been highly successful for collecting confidential information for our current projects and will be used for the participants’ journal. 3) The interventionist will conduct weekly phone calls for the first 6 weeks and bi-weekly calls thereafter to answer questions, reinforce safe practices, and probe any adverse events. Research staff will monitor journals for compliance and address any identified concerns. The interventionist will complete monthly home visits to provide encouragement and retrieve pedometer data as well as the exercise journal. 4) The study coordinator will mail monthly newsletters to the participants on the health benefits of exercise (or healthy lifestyles for the control arm). 5) The interventionist will perform a fidelity check during 2 of the home visits. Specifically, the interventionist will perform the program with the participant (walking, strengthening activities) to observe the participant’s completion and use motivational techniques to provide feedback and additional instruction if needed. If the participant must travel away from the home during the intervention period of 12 months, the interventionist will work with the participant to establish a plan for maintaining activity during travel time. 6) To mitigate possible reduced motivation over time, we will conduct 2 “refresher course” at the midway point of the intervention. The steps of using a contract and journal to increase adherence in MCI have been used by Drs. Winstein and Fisher, Co-Investigators and are detailed in the Manual of Procedures (MOP).

The study investigators will answer any questions participants may have about the study. • Evaluation: Subjects will receive an in--person evaluation including a review of medical history, physical screen and a comprehensive neuropsychological screening battery assessing memory and attention. Subjects will be asked to provide a saliva sample. 30-Day Compliance Test • Physical Activity Monitoring: Subjects will be given an accelerometer and asked to wear the device at home for a period of 30 days. 6.1.1 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization Baseline Assessments (2-day Visit): The following procedures will take place over 2 days at the baseline visit. Total participation during the 2--day period is not anticipated to exceed 10 hours. (For example, baseline participation may be 6 hours on day one and 4 hours on day two). ● Cognitive Tasks: Subjects will be asked to perform one or more memory or attention task(s). They may be presented with images, videos, words, numbers, or sounds. The cognitive testing session should last no more than two hours. ● Questionnaires: Subjects will be asked to complete one or more surveys or questionnaires on paper or in electronic format. Completing these documents should take no more than 30 minutes. ● fMRI Scan: Subjects will be asked to perform cognitive tasks while we use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure changes in activity in the brain. Estimated time in the MRI machine will be about 60 to 90 minutes. The entire session should last no more than 3.5 hours including said cognitive tasks. ● PET/CT Scan: Subjects may be asked to participate in 2 positron emission tomography (PET/CT) scans per visit (2 at Baseline and 2 at 6-month visit). After a delay of about 75 minutes to allow the tracers to be absorbed, you will be moved into the PET/CT scanner for about 30 minutes. ● Blood Draw: Subjects will be asked to have a blood draw. This will be a fasting blood draw. We will collect about 50 mL of blood. ● Physical Assessment: Subjects will be asked to complete a physical function test. Subjects will be asked to perform a number of everyday activities. The second assessment is a treadmill walking test performed at the clinical exercise research center 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   20 (CERC) while we monitor heart rate. Subjects will be monitored by trained study staff. Finally, body composition and body weight will be measured at the same time on the Biospace InBody 520 device. Subjects will stand on the scale-like device while grasping two handles, one in each hand. The device works by sending a very low- voltage electrical signal through the body to determine water content and body fat percentage. The voltage is so low that subjects cannot feel it. The testing will take about 45 minutes. ● Randomization: Subjects will be assigned randomly, much like tossing a coin, to a study group. They will be randomized into one of two health programs, and will have a 50% chance of being placed in either group. One group will participate in an at-home walking program and the other an at-home health education program.  6.1.2 Follow-up Visits / Completion/Final Evaluation Follow-up 6-month Visit (2-day Visit): The following procedures will take place over 2 days at the follow-up visit. Total participation during the 2-day period is not anticipated to exceed 10 hours. (For example, participation may be 6 hours on day one and 4 hours on day two). ● Cognitive Tasks: Subjects will be asked to perform one or more memory or attention task(s). They may be presented with images, videos, words, numbers, or sounds. The cognitive testing session should last no more than two hours. ● Questionnaires: Subjects will be asked to complete one or more surveys or questionnaires on paper or in electronic format.

 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   21 two handles, one in each hand. The device works by sending a very low- voltage electrical signal through the body to determine water content and body fat percentage. The voltage is so low that subjects cannot feel it. The testing will take about 45 minutes. 7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  Adverse events are recorded via electronic recording directly into REDCap by the participant in the form of “Have there been any changes in your health status?” Any reporting of an AE triggers an alert to the study team in the REDCap system. 7.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events   An adverse event (AE) is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Adverse events are to be recording regardless of their relationship to the study intervention.  A serious adverse event (SAE) is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly.  7.1.1  Evaluation of Safety Measures  Event and participant count of the following will be summarized overall and by treatment group for the entire cohort:  • AE: Overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class • AE: MedDRA Preferred Term • SAE: Overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class • SAE: MedDRA Preferred Term • SAE Definitely Related to Intervention: Overall and by System Organ Class • Hospitalization • Deaths  Comparisons of the number of participants with at least one AE, SAE, SAE definitely related to Intervention and Death will be examined between Intervention groups using the Fisher's Exact test. 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   22 7.2 Reporting Procedures AEs will be reported to the IRB according to the timing specifications laid out by the governing body. SAEs will be reported within 24 hrs of reporting to the Safety Monitor and the IRB. 7.3 Follow-up for Adverse Events The follow-up of adverse events occurs while the participant is actively engaged in the study through electronic inquiry. 7.4 Safety Monitoring This trial was monitored by an NIH-approved Data and Safety Monitoring Officer, Dr. Sharon Sha, MD, Chief of Memory Disorders Division at Stanford University.   Sharon J. Sha, MD, MS Clinical Professor Chief, Memory Disorders Division Associate Vice Chair, Clinical Research Neurology and Neurological Sciences Stanford Center for Memory Disorders Director, Huntington’s Disease Center of Excellence and Ataxia Clinic Co-Director, Lewy Body Dementia Research Center of Excellence   Stanford Neuroscience Health Center 453 Quarry Road, MC 5979 Palo Alto, CA 94304 ssha1@stanford.edu memoryresearch@stanford.edu http://med.stanford.edu/neurology.html  8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION    Investigators will make every effort to maximize participant retention. If a participant expresses a desire to stop the intervention, the study team will meet to discuss the participant’s existing challenges and possible approaches to reduce burden to encourage continued participation if at all possible (e.g., adapt exercise routine to reduce pain or increase interest, problem-solve regarding adherence issues, etc.). If a participant continues to decline further participation, or if an investigator discontinues the intervention, an exit interview should be completed as soon as possible immediately following intervention discontinuation.  
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   23  All early intervention discontinuation participants will be strongly encouraged to complete the month 6 assessment visit.           Reasons for Early Discontinuation       Participants are allowed to voluntarily discontinue participation in this trial at any time. Due to the low safety risk of this intervention, we do not anticipate early discontinuation due to safety concerns.  9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  9.1 General Design Issues  Hypotheses regarding the primary cognitive outcome, and secondary and exploratory outcomes will be tested using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) including indicator variables for time, intervention, time-by-intervention interaction term, and additional covariates meeting confounding criteria below. A participant-level random intercept will be specified; significance of random slopes will be tested and included in the model if significant. Age and sex/gender will be treated as potential confounders. Potential confounders will be identified from randomization imbalance and based on their effect on the magnitude of treatment. A variable will be treated as confounder if adding it to the model changes the value of treatment estimate by more than 15%. APOE4 will be included in all models because it was a randomization stratification factor. For fMRI hippocampal BOLD analysis, within subject changes in activity will be calculated for each individual subject in those with both baseline and follow-up fMRI data. Subject data will be normalized to group template space which is comprised of timepoint 1 and 2 to reduce measurement error or individual subject bias. Analyses will be performed by staff blinded to the treatment group. 9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  Given the planned sample size of 30 participants per group, the magnitude of effect observable for this analysis are described below:  This study was powered based on the fMRI primary outcome. Group sample sizes of 30 achieve 80% power for each test to detect an effect size of at least 0.736 and a type I error of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample equal-variance t-test. There are 2 primary outcomes (cognition, imaging), but because they are very different measures, the alpha level will remain at 0.05 for each primary outcome test. There will be no alpha-level correction for secondary or exploratory outcomes. Preliminary data provide an estimated standard deviation of 0.25 z-score units for fMRI network 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   24 function, indicating that we will be able to detect differences of 0.184 z-score units in brain function between groups. The effect sizes for fMRI BOLD activity and network function reported in previous physical activity intervention studies in older adults ranged from 1.17-1.24, thus we have high power to detect significant differences in brain function.  9.2.1 Treatment Assignment Procedures    We used a randomized, single-blind study design where randomization was achieved using a permuted block schema with block sizes of 2 and 4. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either aerobic walking or healthy living education arms and stratified by APOE4 carrier status (yes/no) based on saliva APOE phenotyping. Research suggests that APOE4 status may affect response to exercise, thus carriers were balanced across groups.     9.3 Interim analyses and Stopping Rules No interim analyses or stopping rules were applied for this clinical trial. 9.4 Outcomes  Hypotheses regarding the primary cognitive outcome, and secondary and exploratory outcomes will be tested using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) including indicator variables for time, intervention, time-by-intervention interaction term, and additional covariates meeting confounding criteria below. A participant-level random intercept will be specified; significance of random slopes will be tested and included in the model if significant. Age and sex/gender will be treated as potential confounders. Potential confounders will be identified from randomization imbalance and based on their effect on the magnitude of treatment. A variable will be treated as confounder if adding it to the model changes the value of treatment estimate by more than 15%. APOE4 will be included in all models because it was a randomization stratification factor.  For fMRI hippocampal BOLD analysis, within subject changes in activity will be calculated for each individual subject in those with both baseline and follow-up fMRI data. Subject data will be normalized to group template space which is comprised of timepoint 1 and 2 to reduce measurement error or individual subject bias. Analyses will be performed by staff blinded to the treatment group. 9.4.1 Primary outcome   The primary outcome measures will be collected during fMRI acquisition at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Participants will complete the mnemonic similarity test (MST) during the fMRI scan to provide both primary outcome measures of hippocampal BOLD signal and MST performance, which is assessed using the Lure Discrimination Index.   
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   25 ● Hippocampal BOLD signal: change in hippocampal BOLD signal during the MST task defined as differences in activity between baseline and 6-month as the outcome measure. Change can be in either direction.  ● Lure Discrimination Index (LDI): change in the LDI score, defined as 6-month – baseline, as the outcome measure will be analyzed using the MMRM approach. Higher change scores indicate improvement in LDI performance.  9.4.2 Secondary outcomes   Secondary analyses will be conducted using the same MMRM statistical approach described above for the analysis of all secondary outcomes.  • Single-stage treadmill test: change in the VO2 max score from the single-stage treadmill test defined as 6-month – baseline as the outcome measure. Higher change scores indicate improvement. • Physical function test score: change in the Physical Function test score defined as 6- month – baseline as the outcome measure. Higher change scores indicate improvement. • Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level: change in total plasma BDNF defined as 6-month – baseline level as the outcome measure. Higher change scores are better. • Amyloid PET SUVR: change in global amyloid composite score including the mean of frontal, temporal, parietal cortex SUVRs defined as 6-months – baseline will be the outcome measure. Lower change scores are better. 9.5 Data Analyses Hypotheses regarding the primary cognitive outcome, and secondary and exploratory outcomes will be tested using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) including indicator variables for time, intervention, time-by-intervention interaction term, and additional covariates meeting confounding criteria below. A participant-level random intercept will be specified; significance of random slopes will be tested and included in the model if significant. Age and sex/gender will be treated as potential confounders. Potential confounders will be identified from randomization imbalance and based on their effect on the magnitude of treatment. A variable will be treated as confounder if adding it to the model changes the value of treatment estimate by more than 15%. APOE4 will be included in all models because it was a randomization stratification factor.  For fMRI hippocampal BOLD analysis, within subject changes in activity will be calculated for each individual subject in those with both baseline and follow-up fMRI data. Subject data will be normalized to group template space which is comprised of timepoint 1 and 2 to reduce measurement error or individual subject bias. 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   26  10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 10.1 Data Collection Forms Data is collected using REDCap forms. Outcome assessments are collected by blinded assessors from study staff, the USC Memory and Aging Center, the Clinical Exercise Research Center and the USC PET Imaging Center. Subject data is collected using only their study ID, for which the key is kept separate and inaccessible by the blinded assessors. Physical copies of the IFC will be kept separately from all other study forms in a locked file cabinet, within in a secure office.   Data acquired during the intervention period for completion of intervention tasks was entered remotely via REDCap with assistance from the interventionists, as the intervention was home-based.  10.2 Data Management  This was a single site randomized clinical trial. Screening, Baseline and Follow-up visit data was collected on site at USC, by the study team, the USC Memory and Aging Center, as well as the Clinical Exercise Research Center and the USC PET imaging center. Data was scored when needed by the assessor collecting the outcome measures. Imaging data was acquired and transferred to the USC NIIN Computer cluster. Clinical report forms were used on paper or electronic entry. All paper data were entered into the online digital database, REDCap. REDCap data forms were created with built-in value controls and double entry from independent data managers was used to ensure accuracy.  10.3 Quality Assurance  10.3.1 Training Data entry staff were trained on all REDCap forms and cognitive tests as needed. Accuracy of data entry was ensured via double entry from 2 independent data managers familiar with the forms. Double data entry was used for all paper to electronic transfer scoring. Any discrepancies were discussed by the quality control group described below.  10.3.2 Quality Control Committee  A committee of study staff was formed to review the cognitive testing and physical function tests for consistency and accuracy of scoring. The group met at three separate time frames to review data together. Any discrepancies were reviewed and adjudicated by the group for consensus on accuracy and scoring values.  
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   27 10.3.3 Metrics REDCap data forms were created with built-in value controls and double entry from independent data managers was used to ensure accuracy.  10.3.4 Protocol Deviations Protocol deviations will be captured in REDCap using a protocol deviation form to record details and timeline of the deviations. Deviations will be reviewed in real time by the study team to determine appropriate action.  10.3.5 Monitoring Consent forms were collected during the initial screening visit, signed by the PI and uploaded to the clinical trials portal within 2-4 weeks, before the baseline assessment visit. Outside review was conducted by the University to ensure completion at the baseline visit. Participants submitted weekly activity reports to the study team using REDCap. Reports were monitored weekly and contact was made by the study team or interventionist to ensure completion and accuracy.   11 PARTICIPANT RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  This protocol and the informed consent document (Appendix I) and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by the IRB.  11.2 Informed Consent Forms A signed consent form will be obtained from each participant.

 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   45 Appendix II – COVID-19 Required Safety Protocols   Research staff (Interventionist) practices in the field   o Prior to engaging in research activities in any community/field settings, research staff must be tested and confirmed negative for COVID-19 in accordance with local testing guidelines / requirements.  o Research staff must provide attestation in their USC istar account that they have reviewed and understand the plan for completing a daily log of contacts with whom they have had direct in-person interaction, including research participants and staff.  o Before traveling to community/field research site(s) each day, all research staff must complete the Trojan Check university health screening protocol that is required of persons when requesting access to USC campuses and buildings.  o https://trojancheck.usc.edu/login  o In traveling to/from local community/field research sites, researchers must wear face coverings, ensure no more than two people occupancy per vehicle, and/or that local public health guidelines are followed when mass transit (bus/metro) is used. Researchers must wash hands (or use hand sanitizers) immediately upon departing the vehicle.  High touch areas (e.g., keys, door handles, steering wheels, seat belt buckle) must be disinfected before and after the field day.  o Research staff must enter the community/field setting each day prepared with a sufficient number of face coverings and hand sanitizer for all research participants.  o Researchers at each off-campus study setting must complete a daily log of contacts with whom they have had direct in-person interaction, including research participants and staff, for purposes of participant notification.  Contact information must be collected for the purpose of participant notification in all of the following cases:   1) any interactions occurring at fewer than 6 feet of distance and for more than a period of briefly passing by someone, whether indoors or outdoors; and 2) interactions occurring indoors for more than a period of 10 minutes.  These rules apply regardless of whether PPE / facial coverings are worn during the interaction.  o Hand washing is required of research staff every 30 minutes and at the beginning and end of each visit to a community or field site.  When hand-washing is not possible, hand sanitizer may be used.  o If a research staff member feels ill at any point while in the community/field setting, he/she/they must discontinue data collection and other research activities immediately, 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   46 report illness to the field supervisor and the USC health office, and self-quarantine.  o If a research staff member is diagnosed with COVID-19, they must contact USC Student Health to discuss and be prepared to share participant notification data with Student Health.  o Community/field research activities including data collection should be conducted in sparsely populated, low-density spaces and settings – preferably outdoors if at all possible.  o Research staff must ensure that research participants and prospective participants in field and community settings are assembled and/or seated in a manner that adheres to COVID-19 safety and risk mitigation standards, including a minimum of 6 feet of physical distancing.  o Research staff must provide to each participant an information sheet that explains the collection of data for the purpose of participant notification in the case of infection.  o Disinfectant wipes must be used in community/field settings to clean pens, clipboards, tablets, laptops, and any other equipment or devices immediately before and after sharing among research staff or between participants, or every 30 minutes, whichever is more frequent.  Hand washing or sanitizing must also be done at these times.  o Disinfectant wipes must be used to clean cases, bags, or other containers immediately before they are provided to the participant and after they are returned, or every 30 minutes, whichever is more frequent.  Hand washing or hand sanitizing must also be done at these times.   o Physical incentive items (e.g., gift cards) must first be cleaned using disinfectant wipes.  o Research participants who do not have a facial covering should be provided with masks (paper or cloth as directed by current public health guidelines) and hand sanitizer by the research staff  prior to engaging in any research activity including study screening.  o Research participants who refuse to wear facial coverings or practice risk mitigation steps necessary to protect themselves and others will not be allowed to participate in USC research.  (Exceptions for wearing masks shall be granted for children under two years of age and persons with disabilities, as recommended by current public health guidelines.)  o Research participants must be provided with information about COVID-19 risk mitigation and safety practices (i.e., information sheet available through OPRS).  o Research participants should be provided information on when and how to access health 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   47 care services (http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/FAQ.pdf), and a list of available social services and resources such as food and domestic violence assistance (e.g.,  https://www.211la.org/   and   https://www.1degree.org/).  o As with all aspects of community/field research, research participants’ culture, language, and health literacy should be considered when communicating COVID-19 safety and risk mitigation information and practices.

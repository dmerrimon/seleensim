The original protocol along with Amendment 1 and Amendment 2 were designed to test 2 
weight -based dosing regimens. The low dose (  subcutaneously [SC] once a week [QW] for  
patients  and  SC QW for patients ) was designed to achieve REGN4461 
trough concentrations of  , whereas the higher dose (  SC QW for patients  
and  SC QW for patients ) was designed to achieve REGN4461 trough 
concentrations of . Pre -specified interim analysis, conducted after the last patients 
reached the 8 -week primary endpoint,

 Simulations, updated using the 
higher clearance rates observed in this population, indicate that  SC QW for both weight 
tiers are more likely to  achieve the targe t REGN4461 trough concentration of  and 
optimal pharmacodynamic effects.  A 12 -month treatment extension is being implemented to 
evaluate safety, pharmacodynamic effects and exposure for this higher dose.

Data  
Amendment 2  
The main purpose of this amendment is to modify the inclusion criteria for study eligibility to 
select a patient population that is most likely to have generalized lipodystrophy and therefore 
would be most likely to respond to REGN4461 treatment.  
Language  was also added to remind investigators to discontinue REGN4461 treatment starting at 
week 52 in patients who, in their opinion, do not demonstrate clinical benefit to REGN4461, and 
to continue REGN4461 treatment at and beyond week 52 (until a common treat ment end date) 
only in patients who demonstrate a clinical benefit in response to REGN4461.  
Adjustments to study assessments were made to improve the timing and quality of the data 
obtained and to decrease patient burden. Other more minor changes were mad e to align with the 
sponsor’s latest protocol template, to acknowledge impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the 
study, and to increase clarity. The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and 
the rationale.

 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study of REGN4461, 
a Leptin Receptor Agonist Antibody, in Patients with Generalized 
Lipodystrophy  
Site Location(s)  
 Principal Investigator  The study will be conducted globally at approximately 10 sites.  
Rebecca Brown, MD; National Institutes of Health, United States  
Objectives  The primary objectives of the study are to:  
• Estimate the effects of REGN4461 on glycemic parameters in the 
subset of patients with elevated baseline hemoglobin A1c levels 
(HbA1c ≥7%) 
• Estimate the effects of REGN4461 on fasting triglyceride levels 
in the subset of patients with elevated baseline fast ing 
triglycerides (TG  ≥250 mg/dL)  
The secondary objectives of the study are to:  
• Estimate the effects of REGN4461 on a composite endpoint of 
changes in either HbA1c or fasting TG for all patients  
• Estimate the effects of 3 dose levels of REGN4461 on glycemic  
parameters and fasting TG  
• Estimate the effects of REGN4461 on insulin sensitivity  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN4461  
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of 
REGN4461  
Study Design  This is a phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 
the efficacy and safety of REGN4461 in patients with generalized 
lipodystrophy (GLD) who are not receiving recombinant methionyl human 
leptin (rhLeptin, metreleptin) therapy.

Note: Patients who complete the end of treatment ( EOT ) visit for 
Open Label Treatment Period 5 (OLTP  5) and have secured 
access to continued REGN4461 treatment through other means, 
(eg, another Regeneron -sponsored clinical trial, compassionate 
use, or an expanded access program), may forgo any or all of 
visits 119 -121 and proceed to end of study ( EOS ) visit. These 
patients will be considered study completers.  
•  
After the  single -blind placebo run -in period where baseline testing 
will be performed, patients will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2  
double -blind treatment arms, stratified based on screening HbA1c 
(HbA1c ≤8% or HbA1c >8%). The study design involves an intra -patient 
dose esc alation to maximize information from each patient enrolled and to 
allow for intra -patient comparisons between dose levels. The 2 dose levels 
were selected to maximize the likelihood to observe efficacy and obtain 
exposure -response information to guide futu re clinical development.  
Treatment Arm A:  This arm consists of 3 sequential 8 -week periods in 
which patients receive the following treatments:  
• Placebo  
• Low-dose REGN4461  
• High -dose REGN4461  
Treatment Arm B:  This arm consists of 3 sequential 8 -week periods in 
which patients receive the following treatments:  
• Low-dose REGN4461  
• High -dose REGN4461  
• High -dose REGN4461  
For DBTP 1 -3 and OLTP 4, two dose levels (“high dose” and “low dose”) 
of REGN4461 will be tested , and each dose level will be tiered  
.  
Tier 1:  patients   
• Low-dose REGN4461 :  intravenous (IV) load  
 subcutaneous (SC)  QW 
• High -dose REGN4461 :  SC QW

experience excessive weight loss and/or clinically significant (in the 
opinion of the investigator) spontaneous hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), 
defined as hypoglycemia that occurs i n the absence of exogenous insulin 
or insulin secretagogues, prior to OLTP 5 will be ineligible for the dose 
increase and will remain on their OLTP 4 dose. In addition, patients 
receiving  SC QW that experience excessive weight loss and or 
significan t spontaneous hypoglycemia during OLTP 5 will decrease their 
weekly SC dose from  QW.  
Study Duration  The study duration is expected to be at least 128 weeks, based on 
enrollment rate estimates.

 CONFIDENTIAL  End of Study Definition  The end of study is defined as the date that the last patient completes the 
last study visit, withdraws from the study, or is lost to fol low-up (ie, the 
patient can no longer be contacted by the investigator).  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Up to 26 patients will be enrolled  
 Target Population:  The target population is patients with a clinical diagnosis of GLD 
12 years of age (or lower limit of age approved by Health Authority,

 Dose/Route/Schedule:  In the initial 4 -week single -blind run -in period, patients will receive IV 
placebo infusion, followed by placebo SC injections administered 
subsequently on a weekly basis for .  The dosing regimens of 
REGN4461 in the double -blind period will be tiered according to baseline 
body weight (Tier 1: , Tier 2: ), and are as follows:  
Tier 1:  patients with bas eline body weight :  
• Low-dose REGN4461 :  IV load

• High -dose REGN4461 :  SC QW  
In OLTP 4, all patients will receive high -dose REGN4461 (  
SC QW in Tier 1 or  SC QW in Tier 2). After week 52, the 
REGN4461 dose may be adjusted downward based upon the safety, 
tolerability, PK, or PD data ob tained during the study. During OLTP 5, all 
eligible patients will receive  IV loading dose, followed

Procedures and Assessments  The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of 
determining study eligibility or characterizing the baseline characteristics 
of the study population: medical history, demographics, HIV serology, and 
hepatitis testing (HBsAg, HCV), menstrual history, and pregnancy status.  
Safety procedures include: vital signs, physical examination, body weight, 
height, Tanner sta ging, Menstrual history/pregnancy status reporting/ 
confirmation of contraception and hypoglycemia monitoring and 
electrocardiogram.  
Laboratory procedures include: hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, 
pregnancy testing, lipid panel, endocrine hormones  and other laboratory 
testing.  
Efficacy procedures include: fasting glucose assessment, fasting TG 
assessment, hemoglobin A1C, fructosamine, insulin/C -peptide, lipid 
panel, lipoprotein analysis by NMR, urine protein/urine creatinine, WMG, 
MMTT, liver volum e and fat content by MRI and MRI -Proton Density Fat 
Fraction (MRI -PDFF), respectively, whole body composition by DXA, 
vibration -controlled transient elastography (VCTE), and patient -reported 
outcomes.  
Statistical Plan  No formal statistical hypothesis testing will be conducted. The size of the 
study is determined by study feasibility constraints due to the limited 
number of GLD patients in the world not being treated with metreleptin. It 
is determined that up to 26 patients will be enrolled f or the study with 
approximately a 20%  dropout rate. The primary objective is to estimate the 
treatment effect of REGN4461 on glycemic and lipid parameters. With 20 
patients (10  patients per study arm) completing the study, the study has a 
minimal detectabl e change (MDC) of 1% absolute value reduction in 
HbA1c (standard deviation [SD]=1.5%, within -group comparison) and a 
28% reduction in fasting TG (SD=40%, within -group comparison). For 
within -group comparison, the study would have 80% power to detect a 
1.5%  reduction in HbA1c absolute value from baseline to week 8 for a 
2-sided alpha of 0.05 test (standard deviation =1.5%).  
For most primary continuous endpoints, the study assesses the treatment 
effect of REGN4461 from baseline to the end of the double -blind  period 1

 CONFIDENTIAL  (week 8) (within -group and between -group comparison). Summary 
statistics, including mean change from baseline, standard error (SE), 
corresponding 95% confidence interval, and nominal p -value will be 
provided for within - and between -group comparis on, using a mixed effect 
model repeated measurement model (MMRM). Mean changes (+/ - SE) 
will be plotted over time by treatment arm.  
For secondary endpoints, summary statistics, including mean change from 
baseline, SE, 95% confidence interval, and nominal p-value will be 
provided using a similar MMRM. The treatment effect of REGN4461 
changes from baseline over time will be provided based on each scheduled 
assessment time point.  
Summary statistics will be provided comparing the effects of REGN4461 
low-dose and high -dose regimens on HbA1c, fasting glucose, WMG, 
fasting TG, and MMTT.  
As a secondary objective, the REGN4461 treatment effect will be 
evaluated using a composite “Z score” of HbA1c and TG. MMRM will be 
used to evaluate the effects of REGN4461 on bo th between -group and 
within -group comparisons. Mean, SE, and 95% confidence interval will be 
provided.  
Change from baseline to week 8 for patients in Treatment Arm A will be 
provided. If there is no significant change in HbA1c or TG, defined as 
change in HbA1c (absolute value change) 0.4% or TG  change (percent 
change) 20%, then those patients’ changes from week 8 to week 16 will 
be pooled together with patients’ changes in Treatment Arm B from 
baseline to week 8, to evaluate the treatment effect of the l ow-dose 
regimen. Similarly, if there is no significant change from baseline to week 
8 for patients in Treatment Arm A, data from patients in Treatment Arm A 
(change from week 16 to week 24) will be pooled together with data from 
patients in Treatment Arm B  (change from week  8 to week 16), to estimate 
the treatment effect of increasing the dose from low -dose regimen to high -
dose regimen.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
REGN4461, a leptin receptor (LEPR) agonist, is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
is being investigated for the treatment of conditions associated with leptin deficiency, including 
lipodystrophy. Generalized lipodystrophy (GLD) is an ultra -rare condition characterized by 
near-complete loss of adipose tissue (lipoatrophy). There are an estimated 300 to 400 patients with 
GLD identified worldwide and an estimated p revalence of approximately 0.23 to 0.96 cases per 
million (Chiquette, 2017 ). Adipose tissue functions to store energy and signal the status of ene rgy 
stores by secreting hormones (adipokines) such as leptin, which regulates energy intake, energy 
expenditure, and reproductive function. Severe lipoatrophy and leptin deficiency in GLD manifest 
as hyperphagia, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertriglyce ridemia, pancreatitis, infertility, and 
hepatic steatosis (progressing to non -alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH] and advanced liver 
disease).  
Recombinant methionyl human leptin (rhLeptin) (metreleptin, Myalept®) is the only approved 
treatment option to trea t the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with GLD. Currently, 
rhLeptin is approved in the United States (US) for GLD, and in Japan and Europe for lipodystrophy 
(both general and partial). However, immunogenicity (>80% of patients develop anti -drug 
antibodies and ~6% develop neutralizing antibodies) (Myalept, 2015 ) and the requirement for once 
daily injections can limit the effectiveness of metreleptin in some patients. In the US, me treleptin 
carries a black box warning noting that anti -metreleptin antibodies might cross react to endogenous 
leptin. In the US, metreleptin is only available through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy 
(REMS) program in order to restrict prescribing  to only trained, certified physicians, to reserve 
access for eligible patients, and to ensure that the benefits of the therapy outweigh risks. There is 
thus an unmet need in GLD for effective therapies that are safer, administered less frequently, and 
can treat patients with neutralizing antibodies to the only approved therapy, metreleptin.  
REGN4461 binds and activates leptin receptors (LEPR) signaling. REGN4461 is not related to 
endogenous leptin, and therefore should not have elevated risks of anti -drug antibodies 
cross -reacting with endogenous leptin. Once -weekly administration of REGN4461 improved 
glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, hypertriglyceridemia, food intake, body weight, hepatic mass, 
and steatosis in lipodystrophic humanized LEPR mice. In toxicology studies (a non -GLP single - 
and repeated -dose pilot study and a GLP 13 -week toxicology study in monkeys), REGN4461 
administration resulted in either reduction in body weight gain or body weight loss. These effects 
are consistent with a role of le ptin in regulation of body weight. No adverse reactions of treatment 
have been identified to date. A first -in-human (FIH), double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 
REGN4461 in healthy volunteers (R4461 -HV-1794) is completed. In the initial (Part A) 
single -ascending dose portion of the study, participants were randomized 3:1 to REGN4461 vs. 
placebo in 1 of 7 cohorts to receive doses  intravenously (IV) up to  IV, 
and  subcutaneously (SC) and  SC. In Part B of the study, par ticipants were 
randomized to 4 distinct cohorts defined by sex, baseline leptin levels and BMI to receive  
 
. Results of the R4461 -HV-1794 study indicate that REGN4461 was well 
tolerated by healthy volunteers when administered via IV and SC routes at the doses tested. There 
were no safety signals identified from the TEAEs observed in the REGN4461 -treated groups 
compared to placebo group in either part of the study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  2. STUDY OBJECTIVES   
2.1. Primary Objectives  
The primary objectives of the study are to:  
• Estimate the effects of REGN4461 on glycemic parameters in the subset of patients 
with elevated baseline hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1c ≥7%) 
• Estimate the effects of REGN4461 on fasting triglyceride levels in the subset of patients 
with elevated baseline fasting triglycerides (TG  ≥250 mg/dL)  
2.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives are to:  
• Estimate the effects of REGN4461 on a composite endpoint of changes in either HbA1c 
or fasting TG for all patients  
• Estimate the effects of 3 dose levels of REGN4461 on glycemic parameters and fasting 
TG  
• Estimate the effects of REGN4461 on insulin sensitivity  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN4461  
• Evaluat e the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of REGN4461  
2.3. Exploratory Objectives

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIONALE   
3.1. Rationale  
3.1.1.  Rationale for Study Population  
The patient population for this study is patients with a clinical diagnosis of congenital or acquired 
GLD who are not currently treated with metreleptin. The majority of patients with GLD have 
marked improvements i n metabolic parameters with leptin replacement. These results closely 
mirror preclinical data with REGN4461 and recombinant leptin in a murine model of 
lipodystrophy. Some GLD patients are untreated with metreleptin because metreleptin is not 
approved in t heir country, because they are unwilling or unable to perform daily SC administration 
of metreleptin, or because they have experienced an adverse effect from metreleptin or developed 
neutralizing antibodies to metreleptin. The treatment effect of metrelept in was greater and more 
directionally consistent in patients with GLD and baseline levels of HbA1c ≥7% or 
TG ≥250 mg/dL (FDA, 2013 ). Therefore, the patient population in this study is limited to patients 
with GLD with baseline HbA1c ≥7 % or TG ≥250 mg/dL, in order to reduce variability and more 
clearly evaluate the effects of REGN4461 in the small subset of patients available that are not 
being treated with metreleptin. Acquired and congenital forms of GLD are included, as both groups 
of patients experience clinical benefit from metreleptin ( Myalept, 2015 ). 
Data from the REGN4461 first -in-human study (R4461 -HV-1794) demonstrate that REGN4461 
is pharmacologically active only in low -leptin individuals (≤8.0 ng/ml), con sistent with LEPR 
being saturated in individuals with higher leptin levels. All reported patients with congenital GLD 
have very low leptin levels and are anticipated to respond to REGN4461. However, rare patients 
with acquired GLD have higher leptin levels  as a result of preserved visceral adiposity, despite 
generalized subcutaneous lipoatrophy. Therefore, for patients with acquired GLD additional 
inclusion criteria have been incorporated into this study in order to select patients with a greater 
likelihood  of response to a LEPR agonist antibody.  The inclusion criterion for low leptin levels 
(≤8.0 ng/ml) is based on the responder analyses from study R4461 -HV-1794. Alternatively, low 
body adipose mass (<20% for females, <14% for males, based on the first perc entile from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cohort III data) independent of leptin 
concentrations is also acceptable, as leptin levels are proportionate to body fat mass (Meral, 2018 ) 
(Diker -Cohen, 2015 ).  
The metabolic complications of GLD manifest early in life, leading to signifi cant morbidity and 
mortality among pediatric patients (Lima, 2017 ). The mean age of death in a large 
rhLeptin -untreated cohort was 27 years old, with patients dying as young as age 11 from diabetic 
complications (Lima, 2017 ). Patients with GLD therefore begin metreleptin early in life, and 
metreleptin has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in pe diatric patients (Brown, 2017 ). 
The study includes adolescents (ages 12 to 17 years), as these patients have a high, unmet medical 
need and the preclinical toxicology studies support inclusion of these patients. In healthy, 
adolescent monkeys of comparable developmental stage to the proposed patient population (peri -
pubescent), no adverse effects of continuous exposure (weekly dosing up to  via IV 
infusion) were identified (R4461 -TX-17003; 13 -week GLP toxicology study) . The primary effect 
REGN4461 exhibited in adolescent monkeys was decreased body weight gain or body weight loss, 
consistent with the expected pharmacology of a LEPR agonist. Upon cessation of exposure during

3.1.2.  Rationale for Study Design  
 
 
 
 
The purpose of the single -blind placebo run -in period is to stabilize diet and metabolic parameters. 
Because the primary mechanism by w hich LEPR agonism improves metabolic parameters is 
through improvement of hyperphagia and reductions in caloric intake, changes in diet and 
medications that can occur upon enrollment in a clinical study might have a considerable impact 
on study endpoints. For instance, in the initial study of metreleptin, the effect of study enrollment 
on improvement of TG was nearly as large as the effect of 1 month of metreleptin therapy 
(Oral,  2002 ). In the current study, the randomized, placebo -control led study period (  
) will evaluate the effects of REGN4461 and assess study effects in patients randomized 
to placebo. The length of the DBTP 1 (8 weeks) was chosen to provide enough time for metabolic 
parameters to improve, but also to minimize the length of time some patients are treated with 
placebo. In GLD patients, initiation of metreleptin can improve, and in some patients even 
normalize, fasting glucose and fasting TG within days to 1 month (Brown, 2018 ) (Ebihara, 2007 ) 
(Vatier, 2016 ). Reductions in HbA1c upon metreleptin initiation have been demonstrated within 2 
weeks (Brown, 2018 ). After 4 months of treatment with metreleptin, patients  with GLD 
experienced a mean reduction in HbA1c of ~1.5% from a baseline of 9.2%, and a reduction in 
median TG of 50% from a median baseline of 580 mg/dL. After 6 months, metreleptin was 
reported to lower HbA1c by 2.7% in the subgroup of patients with base line HbA1c >8% (mean 
baseline of 9.8%), and lower mean fasting TG by 72% in the subgroup of patients with a baseline 
fasting TG >300  mg/dL (mean baseline of 914 mg/dL (Diker -Cohen,  2015 ). A  treatment 
period is also long enough to see improvements in hepatic steatosis, which has been reported to 
improve within 2 weeks of initiation (Brown, 2018 ) (Javor, 2005 ) (Oral, 2002 ) (Petersen, 2002 ).  
Two dose levels have been selected for the double -blind portion of this study (DBTP 1 -3, 
Section  3.1.3 ). There is uncertainty regarding the optimal dose of REGN4461 in GLD because: 
(1) PK in healthy volunteers might differ from PK in GLD patients due to potentially different 
levels of the target receptor (LEPR); (2) very high doses of REGN4461 were associated with 
diminished efficacy in cellular reporter assays of LEPR activity, in a LEPR humanized mouse 
model of lipodystrophy, and in healthy cynomolgus monkeys (ie, an inverse U -shaped 
dose-response or ‘hook effect’ was observed); and (3) REGN4461 is an agonist antibody and 
therefore might not need to saturate the target receptor for maximal efficacy. Therefore, the study 
design involves an intra -patient dose escalation in DBTP  2 and DBTP 3 to maximize information 
from each patient enrolled, and to allow for intra -patient comparisons between the 2 dose levels. 
Exploration of 2  dose levels in the DBTPs will help to minimize bias and leverage objective 
measures. The low -dose and high -dose treat ment regimens will be defined by body weight tiers, 
as described in Section  3.1.3 , in order to ensure equivalent exposure in all patients.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The Open -Label Treatment Period (OLTP) 4 (from week 24 through at least week 52) will explore 
the durability of treatment effects of the  doses. Long -term effects of 
REGN4461 on HbA1c, TG, insulin sensitivity, liver disease, and body composition will be 
assessed at week 52 by serum studies, insulin sensitivity assessment (clamp or insulin -tolerance 
test [ITT]), liver vo lume and fat content (by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and MRI -Proton 
Density Fat Fraction [PDFF], respectively), whole body composition (by Dual -energy X -ray 
absorptiometry [DXA]), vibration -controlled transient elastography (VCTE), and  
.  
A pre -specified interim analysis (IA) was performed when the last enrolled patient reached the 
week 8 primary endpoint. The IA revealed that GLD patients had lower than predicted REGN4461 
concentrations and no significant treatment effects on gl ycemic and lipid parameters at week 8. A 
population PK analysis was performed and indicated faster clearance of REGN4461 in this GLD 
population. As the study progressed to week 36, clinically meaningful treatment effects were 
observed for HbA1c and triglyc erides in these patients. Therefore, a higher dose (ie,  SC 
QW) is predicted to achieve the target trough concentrations in GLD patients and to increase the 
likelihood of rapidly achieving optimal treatment effects. REGN4461 appears to be generally w ell 
tolerated for the doses observed, with no safety concerns identified with regards to TEAEs, AESIs, 
and laboratory parameters. As such, an additional treatment period at a dose of  SC QW 
(OLTP 5) has been added in order to assess the safety  that is proposed to be 
used in future studies of REGN4461 in the GLD population. To rapidly achieve desired 
concentrations quickly,  IV is required at the start of this higher -dose 
treatment period (OLTP 5).

REGN4461 on HbA1c, TG, liver disease, and body composition will be assessed at week 52 by

X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]), vibration -controlled transient elastography (VCTE), and  
 
Conditions that will mark the end of OLTP 4 and the beginning of OLTP 5 are detailed in 
Section  6.1.  
After the last dose of study drug, patients enter a 16 -week follow -up period to assess the efficacy, 
safety, and PK after discontinuation of REGN4 461. The duration of off -drug follow -up (16 -weeks) 
is sufficient to allow concentrations to fall below the limit of quantitation. Patients who complete 
the EOT visit associated with OLTP  5 and secure access to REGN4461 treatment outside of the 
study are no t required to complete follow -up period visits, and may instead complete the EOS visit 
and complete the study. This design element was instituted  to allow  patients experiencing 
improvements in metabolic parameters to seek continued treatment with REGN4461,  should they 
choose to do so.   
3.1.3.  Rationale for Dose Selection

 CONFIDENTIAL  analyses  of glucose control and body weight effects in a mouse model of lipodystrophy, and 
body -weight effect data in healthy cynomolgus monkeys. A 2 -tiered dosing paradigm for fixed SC 
dose considers the wide range of body weights for adult and adolescent patient s planned for the 
current study.  
In preclinical species, PD effects were associated with a wide range of exposures to REGN4461, 
while the sustainability of the effects was observed under dosing conditions where target -mediated 
clearance (TMC) of REGN4461 was saturated. Transgenic mice expressing nuclear sterol 
regulatory element -binding protein 1c (nSrebp1c) in adipose tissue through the aP2 promoter 
(aP2-nSrebp1cTg/+) are reported to develop a syndrome with characteristic features of GLD 
(Shimomura, 1999 ). aP2 -nSrebp1cTg mice have a near -absence of white adipose tissue and are 
severely insulin -resistant, hyperglycemic, and dyslipidemic. aP2 -nSrebp1cTg/+ mice also develop 
an enlarged fatty liver. This mouse model provided the first evidence that leptin  resolves the 
metabolic complications of GLD (Shimomura, 1999 ). Since aP2 -nSrebp1cTg/+ mice recapitulate 
the clinical manifestations of GLD, they rep resent a useful model for pharmacological testing of 
REGN4461. Considering REGN4461 does not bind mouse LEPR (REGN4461 -PH-17036), aP2 -
nSrebp1cTg/+ mice were crossed with mice expressing a humanized ectodomain of LEPR 
(Leprhu/hu) as described in REGN4461 -PH-17041, to generate an aP2 -nSrebp1cTg/+Leprhu/hu line. 
In this mouse model of lipodystrophy, single doses of REGN4461 resulted in normalization of 
glucose concentrations and loss of body weight. These effects were evident at concentrations of 
REGN4461  but were notably more sustained at concentrations that 
saturated the TMC pathway. In monkey studies, sustained body -weight effects (either body weight 
loss or reduced body weight gain compared to control animals) were observed at steady -state 
concentrations . However, greater overall effects  
. Given 
that leptin -binding receptors are widely expressed, but that targe t (signaling) receptors are limited 
to the central nervous system, it is presumed that the preclinical PK/PD data reflect the need to 
saturate TMC associated with binding to peripheral LEPR to achieve adequate exposures in the 
brain. In addition, the inter species differences in concentration required to saturate TMC and 
deliver sustained PD effects may be a consequence of differences in peripheral target burden.  
 
 
 
 
Because patients with GLD lack adipose tissue and may therefore have a lower peripheral target 
burden and altered PK profiles compared to healthy volunteers, it is important to explore a lower 
dose level in this study. The low dose level,  SC,   
 
, thereby maximizing the opportunity to observe intra -patient comparisons 
between low - and high -dose levels.

period for each tier is expected to be at least 10 -fold lower than the AUC cumulative  (at the no observed 
adverse effect level [NOAEL]) estimated from a PK model derived from 3  preclinical toxicology 
studies in c ynomolgus monkeys. Therefore, considering both maximal concentration and total 
exposure following repeated dosing, the proposed high dose is expected to be well tolerated.  
The current study includes both adult and adolescent patients with body weight potentially much 
lower than a typical adult of 70 kg. The effect of weight on the PK of REGN4461 was examined 
based  
 
 respectively. Though this magnitude of  between -patient variability is typical  and 
reflects  inter-individual differences not only in body weight/volume of distribution but also  in 
absorption and  elimination , the impact of body weight  over the larger range of patient weights 
expected in this study could necessitate dose adjustment.  
 
 
 
 
 As discussed above, these exposure levels are believed to 
be efficacious and we ll-tolerated and to adequately differentiate between the low and high doses. 
Therefore, the selected doses for patients with weights of less than 50 kg are considered

 CONFIDENTIAL  3.1.4.  Rationale for Endpoints  
Clinical studies of metreleptin in lipodystrophy patients demonstrated improv ement in HbA1c, 
fasting TG, and fasting glucose (FDA, 2013 ). Regulators globally have approved metreleptin based 
on changes seen in these parameters, and therefore these endpoints have been chosen for this study. 
Due to the variability  of TG and HbA1c endpoints, several design elements have been utilized to 
reduce variability and enhance the ability to observe a treatment effect in this small study of 
metreleptin -untreated patients. The averaging of multiple, fasting TG observations wil l improve 
the accuracy of the fasting TG estimate in the baseline and treatment periods, compared to only 
single values. Since fasting and blood draws can be burdensome on patients with lipodystrophy, 
particularly in metreleptin -untreated patients with hyp erphagia, measurements of fasting TG will 
be limited to the end of the study periods. Since effects on HbA1c are delayed and quite variable, 
mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), weighted mean glucose (WMG), and fasting blood glucose 
will also be assessed as a  short -term measure of glycemic control.  
A secondary composite endpoint comprising change in HbA1c or change in TG will be calculated 
to assess the overall effects of REGN4461 on metabolic parameters in the enrolled population. 
There is significant heterog eneity in baseline metabolic abnormalities among patients with GLD, 
and the treatment effect on a given endpoint (eg, HbA1c, TG) is expected to vary according to the 
baseline abnormality. For example, estimates suggest that only ~one -third of patients have  
abnormalities in both HbA1c and fasting TG. This observation is consistent with prior studies in 
GLD patients (FDA, 2013 ). Most patients identified have elevated TG, while a smaller fraction of 
patients have uncontrolled HbA1c (<40%).  Significant inter -patient differences in diet, medication 
adherence, and underlying disease pathology are possible contributors to this heterogeneity in 
metabolic manifestations of lipodystrophy. The composite endpoint will assess the overall impact 
of RE GN4461 in this heterogeneous population, by assessing the effects on glycemic parameters 
among patients with abnormal baseline glycemic control and effects on fasting TG among patients 
with elevated baseline fasting TG, in a single composite endpoint.  
REGN 4461 improved insulin sensitivity in a mouse model of lipodystrophy and is expected to 
improve insulin sensitivity in patients with GLD. The gold -standard assessment of insulin 
sensitivity is the hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamp study (clamp study). Patie nts with 
metreleptin -untreated GLD are insulin -resistant and require high insulin infusion rates 
(120 mU/m2·min) to suppress endogenous glucose production and stimulate glucose uptake. In a 
recent study of 14 lipodystrophy patients, a statistically signifi cant 30% increase in insulin 
sensitivity, as measured by glucose infusion rate to maintain euglycemia, was observed within 
2 weeks of metreleptin administration to previously untreated patients (Brown, 2018 ). Inclusion 
of a clamp study at baseline, week 8, and week 52 will provide a sensitive assessment of metabolic 
effects of REGN4461. At clinical sites that do not have the capability to  perform a clamp study, 
an ITT will be used instead.  
REGN4461 is expected to reduce hepatic steatosis, similar to what has been observed with 
metreleptin therapy (Brown, 2018 ) (Javor, 2005 ) (Oral, 2002 ) (Petersen, 2002 ). REGN4461 
reduced hepatic fat in a mouse model of lipodystrophy. Patients will undergo baseline and 
on-treatment MRI (weeks 8, 24, and 52 for all patients, and at the start and at the end of OLTP 5 
for all eligible patients) to evaluate the effects of REGN4461 on hepatic volume and fat content. 
Liver fat content and liver volume assessment by MRI -PDFF and MRI, respectively, will be 
performed only at sites with the requisite technical capability. Baseline, week 52, and at the start

 CONFIDENTIAL  and at the end of OLTP 5 VCTE evaluation will assess long -term impact of REGN4461 on liver 
fibrosis. Liver fibrosis assessment will be performed only at sites with VCTE capability. Since 
hepatic steatosis can progress to NASH, cirrhosis, and liver failure in patients  with lipodystrophy, 
an  may be performed (in adult patients who have consented to participate in 
this sub -study) at baseline and after treatment to evaluate the effects on the non -alcoholic fatty 
liver disease activity score (NAS) and  fibrosis.  
It is expected that REGN4461 will decrease appetite, a therapeutic effect in GLD patients with 
hyperphagia. In order to quantify these effects, hunger and eating behaviors will be assessed during 
the study by a daily de novo lipodystrophy -speci fic PRO measure. To ensure the measure is fit for 
purpose under the context of use, we will also conduct exit interviews between weeks 6 and 8 (or 
at the early termination visit before week 8, if applicable). The qualitative data from the exit 
interviews w ill also be used to interpret trial results and to further understand whether the observed 
changes were meaningful from the perspective of the patient.  
Excessive appetite suppression could have an impact on muscle mass. Therefore, body weight will 
be monit ored throughout the study. In addition, whole body DXA imaging will be performed at 
baseline and during the treatment period to quantify the short - and long -term effects of REGN4461 
on fat and lean tissue mass. Whole body DXA will be performed only at site s with these 
capabilities.  
3.2. Hypothesis  
REGN4461 will improve the metabolic complications of leptin deficiency in patients with GLD 
who are untreated with metreleptin.  
3.3. Benefit -Risk  
Recognizing that the “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on 
the conduct of clinical trials, the Sponsor does not intend to screen any patients in this study until 
the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic is deemed manageable and no longer interfering with the 
conduct of trials at individual sites, and patients can safely participate in this study. Until then, the 
Sponsor plans to obtain approvals from Health Authorities/Ethics Committees to enable initiation 
of study sites for this study, as allowed by local laws and regulations.  
3.3.1.  Risk -Benefit for REGN44 61 
For patients with generalized lipodystrophy, REGN4461 has the potential to be a better alternative 
than metreleptin to reduce metabolic complications of lipodystrophy (as discussed in the most 
current version of the Investigators’ Brochure). In addition , because the structure of REGN4461, 
a monoclonal antibody, is distinct from leptin, there is no expected risk of REGN4461 -treated 
patients developing neutralizing antibodies that cross -react to endogenous leptin. To date, no 
important identified risks hav e been established with REGN4461. Important potential risks have 
been established based on observations from nonclinical studies, the mechanism of action of 
REGN4461 (including class effects), and risks associated with mAbs in general. These potential 
risks include:

  Patients who complete the EOT visit associated with 
OLTP  5 and have secured access to continued REGN4461 treatment through other means, (eg, 
another Regeneron -sponsored clinical trial, compassionate use, or an expanded access program), 
may forgo any or all of the off -drug follow -up visits 119 -121 and proceed to the EOS visit. These 
patients will be considered study completers.  
Patients who are ≥12 year s of age, (or lower limit of age approved by Health Authority, EC, and

range laboratory value) that resulted in initial screen failure should be repeated.  
4-Week Single -Blind Placebo Run -in Period (Week -4 to Day 1)  
At the beginning of the placebo run -in period, patients will receive an IV placebo infusion, 
followed 1 week later by SC injections of placebo, administered once weekly for 3 weeks. After 
the first administration of placebo at the study site, subsequent administr ation may either be 
continued at the clinical site, or by the site personnel or another healthcare professional at a remote 
location (eg, the patient’s home, school, or place of work).  
Blood samples will be collected to measure fasting lipid and glucose le vels during the run -in 
period. These blood samples may be collected at a clinical unit, at home by a visiting nurse, or at 
an outpatient clinic visit. Patients will also receive training on a clinical outcome assessment 
(COA), if available, which they will  use to record patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures.  
At the end of the placebo run -in period, patients will undergo MMTT assessment, WMG 
assessment, insulin -sensitivity assessment, and VCTE assessment. The insulin -sensitivity 
assessment will be a clamp study for patients who visit qualified sites where a qualified clamp 
research unit and experienced investigator are available. Patients presenting to sites without a 
qualified clamp research unit will undergo an ITT in lieu of a clamp study. The patients w ho 
present to sites that are not qualified and experienced to perform clamp (and additionally are not 
qualified and experienced to perform ITT testing) will not undergo insulin -sensitivity assessment. 
Additionally, patients will undergo baseline liver volu me and fat content by MRI, and whole -body 
composition by DXA imaging (at sites with the requisite capability). Adult patients will have the 
 during the placebo run -in period. Baseline efficacy labs 
(eg, HbA1c, fasti ng glucose, and fasting TG) will be collected on study day 1 prior to study drug 
administration.  
 
After baseline testing, patients will be randomized 1:1 to placebo (Treatment Arm A), or 
REGN4461 (low -dose r egimen) (Treatment Arm B), stratified based on screening HbA1c 
(HbA1c ≤8% or HbA1c >8%) to ensure equal representation of patients with very elevated HbA1c 
in each study arm. On study day 1, patients in Treatment Arm A will receive an IV  infusion of 
placeb o and patients in Treatment Arm B will receive an IV  REGN4461. 
Starting on day  and continuing weekly through days  patients will receive 
weekly SC injections of either placebo or  
, administered by either a trained visiting nurse at a remote location or by trained study staff 
at a study site (see Table  2 for details of dosing schedule). At the end of DBTP 1, patients will 
undergo in -clinic assessments including laboratory assessments for PD, MMTT, WMG, and 
insulin sensitivity (clamp or ITT), liver volume and fat content by MRI, and whole body 
composition by DXA imaging (at sites with the requisite capability) (see  Table  4 for details). The 
primary endpoints are assessed at the end of DBTP 1 (week 8).  
Double -Blind Treatment Periods 2 and 3 (Weeks 8 to 16 and 16 to 24)

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.2. Run-in Treatment(s)  
There will be a 4 -week single -blind placebo run -in period (w eek -4 through day 1). At the 
beginning of the placebo run -in period, patients will receive an IV placebo infusion, followed 
1 week later by SC injections of placebo, administered once weekly for  
8.3. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuati on Rules  
8.3.1.  Dose Modification  
At the beginning of OLTP 5 (at least week 52) patients in both treatment arms will receive a 
 IV followed a week later by weekly injections of  SC QW for  
. Exceptions to this include patients  who have lost >10% weight loss since baseline and in 
the opinion of the investigator, in consultation with the study's medical monitor, are considered to 
be experiencing excessive weight loss. In addition, any patients that experiences significant 
spontan eous hypoglycemia that is considered adverse by the investigator will not undergo the dose 
increase. Spontaneous hypoglycemia  (<70 mg/dL) is defined as hypoglycemia that occurs in the 
absence of exogenous insulin or insulin secretagogues. Patients that do  not undergo the dose 
increases will not undergo any loading dose at the beginning of OLTP 5 and will continue the dose 
they were receiving in OLTP 4 during OLTP 5. Those patients that begin  
 
 SC QW.  
8.3.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study 
will be asked to return to the clinic for an ear ly termination visit which consists of assessments 
performed at the EOT visit and remaining study visits starting with the off -drug follow -up period 
(Table  6).  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  9.1.6 .  
8.3.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Serious or severe allergic reactions considered related to study drug  
• Severe liver injury or dysfunction  for which no other reason can be found to explain, 
such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug 
capable of causing the observed injury . Liver injury is defined as follows:  
 
For individuals with normal  baseline transaminase and liver enzyme levels:  
− Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >8 x upper 
limit of normal (ULN) or  
                                        VV-RIM-00328257-1.0 Approved - 08 Dec 2023 GMT-5:00

− ALT or AST >3 x ULN and total bilirubin >2 x ULN (or interna tional normalized 
ratio (INR) >1.5)  
• For individuals with abnormal  baseline transaminase and liver enzyme levels:  
− ALT or AST >3 x over baseline and total bilirubin >2 x over baseline (or 
international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5)  
• Patient withdraws consen t 
• Investigator’s clinical judgment that it is in the best interest of the patient  
8.3.2.2.  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The investigator may temporarily discontinue study drug dosing at any time, even without 
consultation with the medical mon itor, if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action 
and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest. However, the Regeneron medical 
monitor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of temporary or permanent study drug 
discontinuation. If a patient requires a prohibited medication at any time during the study, the 
principal investigator should contact the Regeneron medical monitor. Based on the discussions, 
study drug may be continued or temporarily or permanently discon tinued.  
8.4. Management of Acute Reactions  
8.4.1.  Acute Intravenous Infusion Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infusion reactions must be available in 
the treatment unit for immediate use. All infusion reactions must be reported as adv erse events 
(AEs) (as defined in Section  10.4.1 ) and graded using the grading scales as instructed in 
Section  10.5.1 . 
8.4.1.1.  Interruption of the Intravenous Infusion  
The infusion should be interrupted if any of the following AEs are observed during the infusion:  
• Severe cough  
• Rigors/chills  
• Rash, pruritus (itching)  
• Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
• Diaphoresis (sweating)  
• Hypotension  
• Dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
• Vomiting  
• Flushing  
The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically, and the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the 
original rate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  If investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment or discontinuation of the infusion other 
than described above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the appropriate response 
according to typical clinical practice.  
8.4.1.2.  Termination of the Intrave nous Infusion  
The infusion should be terminated and NOT restarted if any of the following AEs occur:  
• Anaphylaxis*  
• Laryngeal/pharyngeal edema  
• Severe bronchospasm  
• Chest pain  
• Seizure  
• Severe hypotension  
• Other neurological symptoms (confusion, loss of consciou sness, paresthesia, 
paralysis, etc.)  
• Any other symptom or sign that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants 
termination of the IV infusion  
* Consider anaphylaxis if the following is observed (Sampson, 2006 ): acute onset of an illness 
(minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized 
hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE 
FOLLOWING:  
• Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wh eeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow, hypoxemia)  
• Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
 If anaphylaxis is suspected, all efforts should be made to colle ct additional blood samples within 
30 minutes of the onset of symptoms for measurement of serum tryptase. In case of suspected 
systemic hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis additional blood samples may also be collected for the 
assessment of REGN4461 drug conce ntration and immunogenicity.  
8.4.2.  Acute Injection Reactions  
8.4.2.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Patients should be observed for 30 minutes after the first SC injection in clinic.  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be avail able 
for immediate use. All injection reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section  10.4.1 ) 
and graded using the grading scales as instruc ted in Section  10.5.1 . 
Acute systemic reactions following  the SC injection of study drug should be treated using clinical 
judgment to determine the a ppropriate response according to typical clinical practice.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.4.2.2.  Local Injection Site Reactions  
Local injection site reactions must be reported as AEs and graded according to Section  10.5.1 .  
8.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
All eligible patients will begin the single -blind placebo run -in period within 4 weeks of screening. 
Upon completion of a 4 -week run -in period, up to 26 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in 
Treatment Arm A or Treatment Arm B. Central randomization scheme will be provided by an 
interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) to the 
designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee). Randomization  will be stratified according to 
HbA1c (HbA1c ≤8% vs HbA1c >8%) at the screening visit.  
8.5.1.  Blinding  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study. The Regeneron medical/study director, study 
monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research organization  (CRO) personnel who are in 
regular contact with the study site will remain blinded to all patient randomization assignments.  
An unblinded pharmacist or qualified, unblinded designee will reconstitute study drug (for IV and 
SC injections) and prepare the IV infusion bags. Further details are provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual or Nursing Manual.  
Investigators will be blinded to specific endpoints, including but not limited to HbA1c, TG, and 
other lipids, for the entire length of the double -blind treatment per iod (up to week 24). However, 
there may be extenuating circumstances (eg, interruptions of biospecimen shipments to the central 
laboratory due to COVID -19 restrictions, expedited laboratory results needed to assess potential 
safety finding, etc.) in which laboratory assessments may be performed at a local laboratory. Based 
on the protocol schedule of events, these assessments are not expected to be unblinding, and this 
contingency mitigates risk of losing critical study data.  
Select individuals not involve d in the conduct of the study may have access to unblinded data as 
needed for safety review or other data review.  
Any unblinded analyses used for dose adequacy decisions will be executed with controlled 
dissemination to ensure the integrity of ongoing data  collection. No study personnel involved in 
the day -to-day conduct of the study will have access to any patient randomization assignments 
before the database is locked for this study.  
8.5.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient m ay be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy).  
• If unblinding is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  
− Only the affected patients will be unblinded.

 CONFIDENTIAL  − The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator. If there is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site will unblind the patient.  
− The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or de signee as soon as possible after 
unblinding the patient.  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true em ergency. In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling 
that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
8.6. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
8.6.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
A medication numberin g system will be used to label blinded and open -label investigational study 
drug. Lists linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups 
(or companies) responsible for study drug packaging. In order to maintain the blind  (when 
applicable), these lists will not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct. Study drug 
will be stored at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC; storage instructions will be provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual, Nursing Manual, and Instructions for Us e document.  
8.6.2.  Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or designee at regular 
intervals or as needed during the study. At specified time points during the study (eg,  interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by the site monitor, all opened and unopened study drug will be destroyed  / returned to the sponsor 
or designee.  
Patients may be allowed to receive study dru g from the investigator at regular interval when 
attending visits at the clinical site for administration by a nurse, caregiver, and/or self -use. Patients 
will be provided with an appropriate transport container and instructions for use. Study drug, 
opened  and unopened, must be returned to the site for appropriate reconciliation and destruction 
by the sponsor or designee.  
8.6.3.  Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept current.  
The investigator must be able to account for all opened a nd unopened study drug. These records 
should contain the dates, quantity, and study medication  
• Dispensed to each patient,  
• Returned from each patient (if applicable), and  
• Disposed of at the site or returned to the sponsor or designee  
All accountability reco rds must be made available for inspection by the sponsor and regulatory 
agency inspectors; photocopies must be provided to the sponsor at the conclusion of the study.

8.7. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Any treatment administered or procedure performed (eg, vaccination) from the time of informed 
consent to final study visit will be considered concomitant medication or procedure. This includes 
medications that were started before the study and are ongoing during the study.  
8.7.1.  Prohibited Medications  
Prohibited medications are:  
• Recombinant human leptin (metreleptin, Myalept), starting 1 month prior to study 
start and throughout the duration of the study  
• All over -the-counter and prescription weight loss medications eg orlistat (Xenical, 
Alli), lorcaserin (Belviq), phentermine -topiramate (Qsymia), naltrexone -bupropion 
(Contrave) starting 1 m onth before the study start and throughout the duration of the 
study  
8.7.2.  Permitted Medications  
All medications except those listed in Section  8.7.1 , are permitted.  
Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant medications, permitted over -the-counter 
medications, and dietary supplements stable throughout the entire duration of the study, unless in 
the judgement of the treating physician a safety conce rn warrants medication addition, 
discontinuation or a dose modification.  
Documentation of concomitant medications : Documentation of  concomitant medications, doses of 
medications, and other medical treatments (eg, apheresis) will occur according to the sche dule of 
assessments in Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7. All concomitant medication 
changes that occur during the course of the study must be recorded.  
Diabetes medications : If a patient is taking diabetes medications at th e beginning of the study, 
REGN4461 will be added to existing therapy. Insulin and insulin secretagogues (eg,  sulfonylureas) 
may be decreased in dose or discontinued in response to low blood glucose levels (glucose <100 
mg/dL), a large and clinically -signif icant decrease in fasting blood sugar (eg,  50% decrease in 
fasting glucose from prior values) signs/symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, or if a safety 
concern arises. Otherwise, all attempts should be made to continue the patient’s current diabetes 
medi cation regimen.  
New hyperglycemia requiring medical treatment (rescue therapy) should be managed with insulin 
and reported as an AESI according to Section  10.3.3 . New hyperglycemia requiring treatment is  
defined as follows : Fasting glucose ≥250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) on 2 occasions including 
symptoms consistent with hyperglycemia AND increase in fasting glucose >50  mg/dL above 
baseline.

healthcare professional at a remote location (eg, the patient’s home, school, or place of 
work), or self -administered/administered by a designated person.  
a. If medication is administered by site personnel or another healthcare professional , 
study personnel will monitor AEs, concomitant medications, menstrual 
history/pregnancy status rep orting/confirmation of contraception weekly . Diabetes and 
lipid medication adjustments must occur at least once monthly (see footnote  5). 
b. If patients are self -administering study drug or the study drug is being administered by 
a designated person , site per sonnel must assess the patient for AEs, concomitant 
medications, menstrual history/pregnancy status reporting/confirmation of 
contraception, and diabetes and lipid medications adjustments must occur at least once 
monthly . These assessments may occur via te lephone contact or in -site assessments, 
at the discretion of the investigator.  
2. In-clinic stay can begin within a ±2 -day window. Patients will have the option to leave on 
the same day of study drug administration after being observed for at least 4 hours, 
provided no other procedures are required on that day.  
3. Training for study drug administration must be performed and documented for all patients 
who choose to self -administer REGN4461 during OLTP 4. Training is not required for 
patients who choose to  not self -administer study drug. Training may occur at any time 
during OLTP 4 prior to first self -administration. If an appropriate designee (eg,  parent or 
caregiver) will administer study drug to the patient during OLTP 4, this individual will 
undergo tra ining as above.   
4. A medication administration diary will be provided to the patient/designee prior to 
initiation of self -administration or administration by a designated person such as a parent 
or caregiver. The diary must be completed upon each study drug administration. Training 
on the diary will be provided only to patients which will self -administer REGN4461.

visit. A urine pregnancy test will be performed l ocally (eg, point -of-care). A positive urine 
pregnancy test should be confirmed with a serum test.  
9. Study assessments should be performed, and blood samples are to be collected before study 
drug administration, unless otherwise indicated. For patients under going apheresis, study 
assessments are to be performed and blood samples are to be collected immediately before 
the lipid -apheresis procedure. Study drug will be administered after the apheresis 
procedure. At all visits, PK, ADA, and ANGPTL3/PCSK9/sLEPR sa mples should be 
collected prior to the administration of drug.  
10. Patients must be in a fasted state (after at least approximately a 12 -hour fast). The duration 
of fasting may be shortened for patients with a documented clinical contraindication to 
fasting.  
11. Patients must be in a fasted state (after at least approximately a 12 -hour fast) for insulin 
sensitivity assessments.  The duration of fasting may be shortened for patients with a 
documented clinical contraindication to fasting.  
Insulin sensitivity will be measured by clamp at sites where a qualified and experienced 
facility and staff are available. Blood samples for the clamp will be collected for the 
analysis of glucose, insulin, C -peptide at following times: 2 baseline samples within 
30 minutes before sta rting insulin infusion and up to 4 samples during the 30  minutes long 
steady state. Additional samples will be analyzed for point of care glucose measures during 
insulin infusion, as outlined in the study manual.  
 
  
Patients will undergo an ITT at sites where a qualified and experienced ITT facility and 
staff are availabl e. Patients with a history of seizure disorder should not undergo ITT.  
Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of glucose, insulin and C -peptide timed as 
follows: two baseline samples before starting insulin administration and at 5, 10, 15, 20 
and 30 minutes after starting the insulin administration.  
 
 
12. Patient s presenting to sites without qualified and experienced facility and staff to perform 
a clamp or ITT will not undergo clamp or ITT evaluation . This procedure can be done 
within .

 CONFIDENTIAL  In individuals under 18 years of age, standing height should be  recorded at least every 3 months 
using a stadiometer at time points according to Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7. 
Patients should be instructed to remove footwear and stand upright with their heels together.  
Tanner staging for pubertal development should be performed at least every 3 months at time 
points according to Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7. If the patient reaches Tanner stage 5, 
this assessment will be no longer performed. Whenever possible, the same trained health care 
professional will conduct the Tanner staging at each assessment.  
9.2.2.3.  Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed at time points according to Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, 
and Table  6. 
Twelve -lead ECGs will be collected after the patient has been in the supine position for at least 10 
minutes. The electrodes should be positioned in the same location, as much as possible, for each 
ECG recording.  
The ECG will be interpreted locally by the investigator. If new and/or clinically significant changes 
in ECG parameters are observed, a repeat ECG should be immediately performed for confirmation 
before making any decision for the concerned patient. Any clini cally significant abnormality 
should be documented as an AE/SAE, as applicable.  
Heart rate will be calculated from the ventricular rate (or RR interval) and recorded. The PR or 
PQ, QRS, and QT (QTcF) intervals will be recorded. The ECG recordings and repor ts will be 
retained with the source.  
9.2.2.4.  Menstrual History, Pregnancy Status Reporting, and Confirmation of 
Contraception  
Assessment of menstrual cycle history for WOCBP will be conducted at baseline and at the visits 
specified in Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7 to identify any changes in occurrence, 
frequency, or duration following study drug treatment.  
9.2.2.5.  Hypoglycemia Monitoring  
It is recommended that all diabetic patients prescribed insulin or insulin secretagogues 
(eg, sulfonylureas or glinides) should be instructed to routinely monitor finger stick blood glucose 
using a glucometer. Patients who have been instructed by their treating physicians to routinely 
self-monitor glucose using a glucometer will be asked to enter glucose values into an electronic 
patient diary. The purpose of the electronic patient diary is to facilitate prompt interaction with 
their study site if low blood glucose values are recorded. Low blood glucose values will trigger an 
alert for the patient to call the site and the site will be automatically notified to call the patient. 
This monitoring is not intended to replace protocol adverse events of special interest and other 
safety reporting procedures.  
9.2.3.  Laboratory Testing

9.2.4.13.  Assessment of Liver Stiffness by Vibration -Controlled Transient Elastography 
(VCTE ) 
Vibration -controlled transient elastography (eg, FibroScan®) uses transient elastography to 
measure the stiffness of the liver. Some GLD patients with NASH may have increased liver 
stiffness, reflective of an accumulation of fibrotic scar tissue. VCTE is u sed for assessing liver 
cirrhosis and/or advanced -stage liver fibrosis. Liver stiffness will only be assessed at sites with 
VCTE capability ( Table  3, Table  6, and Table  7). 
9.2.5.  Patient -Reported Outcome Measures  
9.2.5.1.  Daily Appetite and Eating Behavior PRO  
This PRO measure instrument is being developed specifically for this trial in order to assess 
hunger, cravings, eating behaviors, and emotional aspect of eating among patients with 
lipodystrophy. The  development of the diary is in accordance with the Food and Drug 
Administration’s (FDA’s) guidance on PRO development.  
Patients will complete the PRO assessments daily, unless otherwise noted in Table  3, Table  4, 
Table  5, and Table  6. Patients who are enrolled prior to approval and availability of the PRO 
instrument will complete the daily PRO asses sment once it becomes available. Patients who are 
incapable of completing the PRO (eg, illiteracy) are still eligible to participate in the study but will 
not complete PRO assessments.  
9.2.5.2.  Questions Assessing Sensation of Body Temperature  
Self-administered que stions developed specifically for this trial will assess the patient’s sensation 
of body temperature. Patients will be asked to rate how often they felt uncomfortably cold in the 
past 24 hours and how often they felt uncomfortably hot in the past 24 hours.  Patients will complete 
this PRO assessments as noted in Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, and Table  6.  
9.2.5.3.  Short Form – 36 Survey  
The Short Form – 36 Survey (SF -36) is a 36 -item self-administered PRO measure assessing health -
related quality of life (HRQoL) concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment group. The 
SF-36 will be completed by patients ages 18 years of age and older. The SF -36 assesses physical 
functioning, role -physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role -emotional, 
and mental health. Patients answer questions assessing these concepts over the previous week 
using 3 -, 5-, or 6 -point Likert scales; scores range from 0 to 100, with high er scores indicating 
better health. The past -week recall has been compared to the 4 -week recall and is shown to have 
comparable properties (Keller, 1997 ). The SF -36 is one of the most widely used and studied PRO 
measures, with good psychometric properties documented across different populations ( Table  3, 
Table  4, Table  5, and Table  6).

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.5.4.  Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scales  
The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) 4.0 Generic Core Scales is a measure 
assessing HRQoL in children and adolescents. The PedsQL™ will be used to measure HRQoL in 
patients ages 12 to 17. The PedsQL™ is a 23 -item measure that assesses physical functioning, 
emotional functioning, social functioning, and school/work/studies functioning. The instructions 
for PedsQL™ ask how much of a problem each ite m has been over the past 7 days on a 5 -point 
response scale, ranging from never a problem (0) to almost always a problem (4). The measure 
will be a self -administered PRO for patients ages 13 to 17 years (teen report) and for patients 
12 years of age (child  form). The items for each of the teen and child forms for patients are 
essentially identical, differing primarily in the use of developmentally appropriate language. Items 
are reverse -scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale so that higher scor es indicate better 
HRQoL. The total scale score is computed as the sum of all the items over the number of items 
answered on individual scales ( Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, and Table  6). The PedsQL™ was 
developed using focus groups, cognitive interviews, pre -testing, and field testing measurement 
development protocols (Varni, 1999 ) and has demonstrated validity, reliability, ability to detect 
change, and responsiveness (Varni, 2001 ) (Varni, 2002 ) (Varni, 2003 ) (Desai,  2014 ). 
9.2.5.5.  Patient Global Impression of Severity  
Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) items are self -administered PRO questions assessing 
the patient’s perception of the o verall severity of the symptoms of their disease and/or of a specific 
symptom of their disease. At study visits (see Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, and Table  6), patients will 
be asked to rate the severity of specific symptoms of lipodystrophy (ie  hunger, cravings, eating 
behaviors) on a Likert scale ranging from “not at all” to “very much.”  
9.2.5.6.  Patient Global Impression of Change  
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) items are self -administered PRO questions assessing 
the patient’s perception of the change in overall severity of the symptoms of their disease and/or 
of a specific symptom of t heir disease, compared to the start of the study ( Table  6). At weeks 8, 
16 and 24 patients will be asked to rate the severity of specific symptoms of l ipodystrophy 
compared to before the start of the study on a 7 -point Likert scale ranging from “much better” to 
“no change” to “much worse.”  
9.2.5.7.  Exit Interview in Relation to Hunger and Eating Behavior PROs  
At the time point of the primary endpoint  
 patients will be interviewed to ensure the Hunger 
PRO is fit -for-purpose under the context of use for GLD patients ( Table  6). Results from exit 
interviews will also be used to contextualize findings on the COA assessments. Each interview 
will last approximately 60  minutes and will be conducted by trained external in terviewers 
following a semi -structured interview guide.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.6.  Pharmacokinetic/Drug Concentration and Immunogenicity Samples  
9.2.6.1.  REGN4461 Concentration Measurements  
Samples for REGN4461 will be collected during DBTP 1 at the visits listed in Table  4, during 
DBTP 2 and 3 at the visits listed in Table  5, and during O LTP 4 and 5 at the visits listed in Table  6 
and Table  7. All samples will be collected prior to dose administrations with the exception of IV 
loading dose samples, which will be collected both prior to and after dose administrations, as 
described in table footnotes.  Any unused samples may be used for future biomarker research for 
patients who consent.   
9.2.6.2.  Soluble LEPR (sLEPR)  
Leptin circulates in the bloodstream both as a free entity and also can be bound to an sLEPR, which 
is generated via shedding of the LEPR ectodomain (Sinha, 1996 ) (Lammert, 2001 ). Soluble LEPR 
is present in circulation of healthy subjects and patients with disease. It is a non -signaling form of 
the leptin receptor that is able to bind to leptin and may regulate its bioavailability (Lou, 2010 ). It 
is possible that REGN4461 bioavailability might be influenced by sLEPR levels. It is also possible 
that sLEPR level s might be influenced by REGN4461, either through increasing sLEPR stability 
or shedding from LEPR. Therefore, sLEPR will be assessed at time points noted in Table  3, 
Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7. 
9.2.6.3.  Circulating Biomarkers for Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Angiopoietin -Like Protein 3 ( ANGPTL3)  
Angiopoietin -like protein 3 is an endogenous inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase, which regulates 
circulating levels of TG (Tikka, 2016 ). Levels of ANGPTL3 can be regulated by feeding, leptin, 
and/or insulin (Minicocci, 2012 ) (Nidhina Haridas, 2015 ). Levels of ANGPTL3 are elevated in 
patients with lipodystrophy and are reduced after treatment with metreleptin (Muniyappa, 2017 ). 
The reduction of ANGPTL3 following metreleptin treatment might affect lipase clearance of TG -
rich lipoproteins. Therefore, ANGPTL3 might be a PD marker of REGN4461 activity, increasing 
leptin receptor signaling. ANGPTL3 will therefore be assessed at time points noted in Table  3, 
Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7.  
Total Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9)  
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 is a convertase enzyme that promotes degradation of 
the LDL receptor, resulting in reduced LDL clearance. Gain -of-function mutations in PCSK9 are 
associated with elevated LDL -C levels, while loss -of-function mu tations are associated with lower 
serum LDL -C and protection from cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors have been approved for 
treating hypercholesterinemia and have been efficacious at reducing serum cholesterol levels and 
decreasing the rate of major car diovascular events. Female GLD patients had a reduction in plasma 
PCSK9 levels after 4 to 6 months of metreleptin therapy (Levenson,  2016 ). PCSK9 might be a 
mechanistic marker indicative of the lipid -lowering effects of REGN4461. To tal PCSK9 will 
therefore be assessed at time points noted in Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.6.4.  Immunogenicity Measurements and Samples  
Samples for ADA assessment will be collected at time points li sted in Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, 
Table  6, and Table  7.  
9.2.7.  Pharmacodynamic and Exploratory Biomarker Procedures  
9.2.7.1.  Endocrine Hormones  
Lipodystrophy patie nts have disruption in endocrine hormone regulation that can result in 
amenorrhea and hyperandrogenism. Hyperandrogenism and amenorrhea are corrected in a subset 
of individuals on metreleptin therapy. Metreleptin therapy resulted in lower testosterone leve ls 
within 4 months of therapy and restored regular menstrual cycles in patients with irregular 
menstrual cycles or primary amenorrhea (Musso, 2005 ). Endocrine levels will be assessed at time 
points noted in Table  3, Table  4, Table  5, and Table  6. Endocrine hormones include, but are not 
necessarily limited to, luteinizing hormone, follicle -stimulatin g hormone, estradiol, and 
testosterone.  
9.2.7.2.  Immunophenotyping  
In patients with congenital GLD, infections have been described as one of the major causes of 
mortality, which suggests a compromised immune system (Lima, 2018 ). As leptin signaling is 
associated with inducing immune cell activation (Dayakar, 2016 ), it is possible that REGN4461 
treatment in patients with lipodystrophy might affect, in a positive manner, immune cell numbers 
or function. To explore this possibility, whole blood will be collected for performing flow 
cytometry analysis of immune cell populations, including T cell subsets ( Table  4 and Table  5).

 CONFIDENTIAL  10. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONITORING  
10.1. Obligations of Investigator  
The investigator  must promptly report to the IRB/EC all unanticipated problems involving risks to 
patients, according to local regulations. This may include death from any cause and all SAEs 
related to the use of the study drug. It is recommended that all SAEs be reported  to the IRB/EC, 
according to local regulations.  
10.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction [SUSAR]), to the health authorities, IRBs/ECs, as appropriate, and to the 
investigators in a blinded manner.  
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Reference Safety Information section of the 
Investigator’s Brochure will be  considered as unexpected. Any worsening of or new onset of 
symptoms related to GLD which occur during the screening/washout period prior to study drug 
administration will be considered expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report in all other SAEs to th e health authorities, according to local 
regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorities and ECs/IRBs as appropriate.  
10.3. Definitions  
10.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal labor atory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of  a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
10.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger)  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of t he event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization  – 
In-patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital (a ny duration), or an 
                                        VV-RIM-00328257-1.0 Approved - 08 Dec 2023 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 115 of 143 
 CONFIDENTIAL  emergency room stay for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization 
is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event 
or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as dete rmined by the investigator 
or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  – (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event – Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an eme rgency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse)  
Note: In addition to the criteria above, a new diagnosis or progression of a malignan cy in patients 
enrolled in the study will also be considered an SAE.  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events. See Section  10.4 for more 
information on recording and reporting SAEs.  
10.3.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which o ngoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate. Such an event might warrant 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature of the 
event, rapid communication by the trial sponsor to other parties (eg, regulators) might also be 
warranted (Section  10.4.3 ). AESI for this study include:  
• Hypoglycemia, defined as blood  glucose <54 mg/dL.  
• New onset diabetes mellitus (NODM)  
For patients with no diabetes at baseline:  
a. Two values of fasting ( ≥8 hr) plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol) during 
treatment period  
OR 
b. Two values of HbA1c  ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) during treatment period  
Patients who meet either of these criteria during the PBO run -in period will be 
considered to have diabetes at baseline.  
• Hyperglycemia requiring treatment: this is defined as:  
a. HbA1c ≥10.5% AND increase in HbA1c of ≥1.5% from baseline value  
OR

10.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the end of study.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provide d in Section  10.4.6 . Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Section  10.4.5 . 
10.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be document ed in a follow -up report. 
Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical records and diagnostic test reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will appl y: 
• SAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of study or within 112 days of last study 
drug administration if the patient early -terminated from the study – the SAE will be 
reported to the sponsor. The investigator should make every effort to obtain follo w-up 
information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
• SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/early termination 
visit – only fatal SAEs and those deemed by the investigator to be drug -related SAEs 
will be reported to the sponsor. The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
10.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:

 CONFIDENTIAL  Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times the 
intended dose of study drug within the intended t herapeutic window, if associated 
with an AE.  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female study patient, or female partner of a male study 
patient, during the study or within 112 days of the last dose of study drug. Any 
complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient or female partner of a 
male study patient, and/or fetus and/or newb orn that meets the SAE criteria, must 
be reported as an SAE. Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the 
sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest:   All AESIs, serious and nonserious, must be reported within 
24 hours of identification using the  same reporting process as for SAE reporting, 
per Section  10.4.2 . Adverse events of special interest for this study are detailed in 
Section  10.3.3 .  
10.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days.  
10.4.5.  Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptom(s), and/or  
• The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
• The test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, s ignificant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact the medical monitor in the event that the investigator feels an abnormal test finding should 
be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed acc ording to the scale outlined 
in Section  10.5.1 . 
10.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected until the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
10.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild: Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning level. It 
may be an annoyance. Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms but may 
be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:  Produces some impairment of functi oning but is not hazardous to health. It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment. Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
Severe:  Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard 
to the patient’s health. Treatment for sym ptom may be given and/or patient hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Infusion Reactions  
The severity of infusion reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of the grade):  
Mild : Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated  
Moderate : Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds p romptly to symptomatic 
treatment (eg, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated 
for ≤24 hours  
Severe : Prolonged (eg, not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption 
of infusion); recurrence  of symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for 
clinical sequelae; life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; death  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to t he following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of grade):  
Mild : Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of erythema or 
induration that does not interfere with activity  
Moderate : Pain that requires repea ted use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or interferes 
with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or induration or induration 
that interferes with activity  
Severe : Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that p revents daily activity; 
significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily activity; requires ER 
visit or hospitalization; necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis

10.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any que stions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion. The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The medical/study director will have primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments 
(eg, Global Patient Safety; Biostatistics and Data Management). Safety monitoring will be 
performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a periodic, cumulative 
aggregate basis.

11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the SAP for the study . The SAP may be revised during the study 
to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to 
unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The final SAP 
will be issued before the d atabase is locked.  
The first -step analysis will be conducted as soon as all patients have been randomized and all data 
through week 36 has been entered, cleaned and locked. The first -step analysis will be conducted 
on all randomized patients who receive st udy treatment. These statistical analyses will include the 
primary and secondary endpoints collected during the double -blind period, as well as the 
open -label week 36 visit in OLTP 4.  
The second -step analysis will be conducted as soon as all patients have been randomized and all 
data through week 56 has been entered, cleaned and locked. The second -step analysis will be 
conducted on all randomized patients who receive study treatment. These statistical analyses will 
include pharmacokinetic and safety measure s. 
The third -step analysis will be conducted as soon as all patients have been randomized and all data 
through week 64 has been entered, cleaned and locked. The third -step analysis will be conducted 
on all randomized patients who receive study treatment. T hese statistical analyses will include 
efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety measures.  
The fourth -step analysis will be conducted as soon as all patients have been randomized and all 
data through week 76 has been entered, cleaned and locked. The fourth -step analysis will be 
conducted on all randomized patients who receive study treatment. These statistical analyses will 
include efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety measures.  
The fifth -step and final analysis will be conducted at the end of the study, and will  consist of the 
final analysis for efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety measures.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  5.  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested. This study will assess the effects of REGN4461 on 
glycemic parameters in a subset of patients with elevated baseline HbA1c (≥7%) and fasting serum 
TG in a subset of patients with elevated baseline TG (≥250 mg/dL). HbA1c at screening visit 
(HbA1c ≤8% vs. HbA1c >8%)  is the stratification factor for patient randomization.

 CONFIDENTIAL  11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
The size of th e study is determined by feasibility assessments. Due to the limited number of 
patients not being treated with metreleptin in the world, up to 26 patients will be enrolled for the 
study,  with approximately a 20% dropout rate . The primary objective is estim ating the treatment 
effect of REGN4461 on glycemic and lipids parameters.  
Metreleptin demonstrated a 2% drop in HbA1c (standard deviation [SD]=1.5%) and a 50% drop 
in fasting TG (SD=40%) from baseline to month 4 (Myalepta, 2018 ) (FDA, 2013 ). As a 
conservative treatment effect estimation for 8 weeks, the antici pated drop in HbA1c is 1.5%. The 
change in fasting TG is expected to be the same at week 8 as at week 16. With 20 patients 
completing the study (10 patients per study arm, assuming approximately a 20% dropout rate from 
26 patients), the minimal detectable change (MDC) and power for the study are provided in Table  8 
as below, for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 test.

*Assuming SD for HbA1c is 1.5%, fasting glucose is 76 mg/dL, and fasting TG is 40% (FDA, 2013 ).  
& SD for WMG is 75% of SD for fasting glucose (57 mg/dL).  
If the glycemic and lipid subsets for the primary analysis have fewer patients with abnormal TGs 
or fasting glucose values, the table below ( Table 9) provides minimal detectable change and power 
for the subset analysis.

11.4.2.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment arm 
(Treatment Arm A or Treatment Arm B), and by all patients combined.  
11.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
The goal of the study is to estimate the effect of REGN4461 on metabolic parameters in patients 
with GLD. Comparisons to baseline and between -group comparison will be pro vided with nominal 
p-values. There will be no statistical hypothesis testing and no multiplicity will be applied. 
Logarithm transformation will be performed to normalize the fasting TG.  
11.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary objective is estimating the treatment effect of REGN4461 on improving metabolic 
abnormalities. The glycemic endpoint will be run in the glycemic subset of patients (subset with 
baseline HbA1c ≥7%), and fasting TG endpoint will be run in the TG subset of patients (subset 
with baseline TG ≥250 mg/dL).  
For primary endpoints, fasting TG, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and WMG, the study assesses the 
treatment effect of REGN4461 from baseline to week 8 for patients receiving REGN4461 in the 
DBTP 1 (within -group comparison) and for all patients (between -group comparison). Published 
data (Oral, 2002 ) suggest that fasting glucose and fasting TG had the greatest improvement within 
the first 2 months following metreleptin initiation.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Summary statistics includin g mean change from baseline, standard error (SE), corresponding 95% 
confidence interval, and nominal p -value will be provided by treatment group (REGN4461 or 
placebo at the DBTP 1), using a mixed effect repeated measurement model (MMRM), which will 
account  for the missing data. The model includes the factors (fixed effects) for treatment, week, 
and treatment -by-week interaction. Relevant baseline HbA1c and/or TG will be included as a 
continuous covariate. An unstructured covariance structure will be used (i f that does not converge, 
then structured covariance structures such as autoregressive heterogeneous [ARH] will be 
assessed). If the model does not converge with the MMRM, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA ) 
will be used to estimate the treatment effect of REG N4461. Additional details will be provided in 
the SAP.  
Mean absolute value changes in WMG (mg/dL), HbA1c (%), fasting glucose (mg/dL), and mean 
percent change in fasting TG will be summarized by treatment group at the DBTP 1. Mean changes 
(±SE) will be pl otted over time by the treatment group. A spaghetti plot will be provided for 
primary endpoints by the treatment group.  
In addition, posterior probability that the improvement in each of the primary endpoints is greater 
than zero will be computed at week 8 separately for patients receiving REGN4461. Non -
informative prior will be used for the posterior probability. The posterior probability will also be 
used to assess the treatment effect of REGN4461.  
11.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Most of the secondary endpoi nts will use the FAS for the analyses. Other secondary endpoints will 
use a subset of patients, eg, with elevated baseline HbA1c; with elevated baseline TG; qualify to 
perform the MRI test; at sites with clamp capability, etc, in the FAS.  
For secondary en dpoints measured in the double -blind period, summary statistics, including mean 
change from baseline, SE, 95% confidence interval, and nominal p -value will be provided using 
the MMRM with contrast. For secondary endpoints measured after the double -blind pe riod (after 
week 24), descriptive statistics will be provided. Unless otherwise specified , all secondary analyses 
will be considered as within -group comparison. Details will be provided in the SAP.

Change from week 8 to week 16 for patients in Treatment Arm A will be provided as above to 
estimate the treatment effect of t he low dose. If the patients do not have a significant reduction in 
HbA1c or TG from baseline to week 8, defined as change in HbA1c (absolute value change is less 
than -0.4%, change in TG [percent change] is less than -20%), then their data from week 8 to week 
16, after they have switched to the low dose of REGN4461, will be pooled with data from baseline 
to week 8 for patients in Treatment Arm B, to evaluate the treatment effect of low dose on fasting 
glucose, fasting TG, WMG, MMTT, and HbA1c. Similarly, i f there is not a significant reduction 
from baseline to week 8 for patients in Treatment Arm A, data from patients in Treatment Arm A 
(change from week 16 to week 24) will be pooled together with data from patients in Treatment 
Arm B (change from week 8 to  week 16) to estimate the treatment effect of increasing the dose 
from a low -dose regime to a high -dose regime. MMRM or ANCOVA will be used.  
Mean and/or percent change from baseline will be plotted over time by treatment group based on 
the DBTP 1.  
For th e secondary objective, the REGN4461 treatment effect will be evaluated based on a 
composite “Z score” of HbA1c and TG to see whether REGN4461 can improve the metabolic 
abnormality. The composite score is constructed as follows:  
For every patient, the comp osite “Z score” is derived based on HbA1c and fasting TG in the 
placebo run -in period (at baseline) and at the end of DBTP 1 (week 8). The REGN4461 treatment 
effect for each patient is calculated as:  
Z(𝐻𝑏𝐴1𝑐_𝑐ℎ𝑔) = 𝐻𝑏𝐴1𝑐𝐵𝐿−𝐻𝑏𝐴1𝑐𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘8
𝑆𝐷(𝐻𝑏𝐴1𝑐)  
Z(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑇𝐺_𝑐ℎ𝑔) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑇𝐺𝐵𝐿−𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑇𝐺𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 8 
𝑆𝐷(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑇𝐺)  
SD (HbA1c)  and SD (logTG)  will be computed using the baseline data from all patients:

13. STUDY MONITORING  
13.1. Monitoring of Study Sites  
Regeneron uses a study -specific risk -based approach to study monitoring and oversight, aligned 
with risk based quality principles, outlined in ICH E6 (R2) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. 
Risk-based quality monitoring methodology focuses on employing a fit -for-purpose monitoring 
strategy, supported either directly by Regeneron as sponsor, or via our CRO partners. Risk -based 
quality monitoring strategies include: reduced s ource data verification, targeted source data 
review, the use of off -site/remote and triggered on -site monitoring visits, and centralized 
monitoring to identify site level risks and study level trends. The investigator must allow study -
related monitoring a ctivities to occur.  
The study monitors will perform ongoing source data review to verify that data recorded in the 
CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents, 
that the safety and rights of patients are bei ng protected, and that the study is being conducted in 
accordance with the current approved protocol version and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, 
and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
13.2. Source Document Requirements  
Investigators are required to pre pare and maintain adequate and accurate patient records (source 
documents).  
The investigator must keep all source documents on file with the CRF (throughout this protocol, 
CRF refers to either a paper CRF or an electronic CRF). Case report forms and source  documents 
must be available at all times for inspection by authorized representatives of the sponsor and 
regulatory authorities.  
13.3. Case Report Form Requirements  
Study data obtained in the course of the clinical study will be recorded on electronic Case Repo rt 
Forms (eCRFs) within the EDC system by trained site personnel. All required CRFs must be 
completed for each and every patient enrolled in the study. After review of the clinical data for 
each patient, the investigator must provide an electronic signatur e. A copy of each patient CRF 
casebook is to be retained by the investigator as part of the study record and must be available at 
all times for inspection by authorized representatives of the sponsor and regulatory authorities.

The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB/EC. A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF and documentation 
of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped t o the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient and his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s) prior to the 
patient’s participation in the stud y and after the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards 
of the study have been explained to the fullest possible extent in language that the patient and the 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can understand. The ICF should be signed and dated by the p atient’s 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the same investigator or designee who explained the ICF.  
Local law must be observed in deciding whether 1 or both parents’/guardians’ consent is required. 
If only 1 parent or guardian signs the consent form, the investigator must document the reason the 
other parent or guardian did not sign. The patient may also be required to sign and date the ICF, 
as determined by the IRB/EC and in accordance with the local regulations and requirements.  
• Patients who can write bu t cannot read will have the assent form read to them before 
writing their name on the form.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read 
to them in the presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the IC F to 
confirm that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s  study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF must 
be reviewed and updated appropriately. All stud y patients and their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) 
must be informed of the new information and provide their written consent if they wish the patient 
to continue in the study. The original, signed revised ICF must be maintained in the patient’s study 
record and a copy must be given to the patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
15.2. Patients Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
patient will be maintained. Patients sh ould be identified by a patient identification number only, 
on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor. Documents that will not be submitted to 
the sponsor (eg, signed ICF) must be kept in strict confidence.

be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The sponsor shall take all 
appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by any unauthorized third party.  
15.3. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee  
An appropriately constituted IRB/EC, as described in ICH guidelines for GCP, must review and 
approve:  
• The protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the patients 
(eg, advertising) before any patient may be enrolled in the study  
• Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before implementation, 
unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the patient, in which 
case the IRB/EC should be informed as soon as possible  
• Ongoing studies on an annual basis or at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk  
In addition, the IRB/EC should be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of patients or 
the continued conduct of the clinical study.  
A copy of the IRB approval  letter with a current list of the IRB members and their functions must 
be received by the sponsor prior to shipment of drug supplies to the investigator. The approval 
letter should include the study number and title, the documents reviewed, and the date o f the 
review.  
Records of the IRB review and approval of all study documents (including approval of ongoing 
studies) must be kept on file by the investigator.  
16. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
The sponsor may not implement a change in the design of the protocol or ICF wi thout an IRB/EC -
approved amendment. Depending on local legislation, regulatory authority approval may also be 
required.  
17. PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY OR 
CLOSE -OUT OF A SITE  
17.1. Premature Termination of the Study  
The sponsor has the right to terminate the study prematurely. Reasons may include efficacy, safety, 
or futility, among others. Should the sponsor decide to terminate the study, the investigator(s) will 
be notified in writing.  
17.2. Close -Out of a Site  
The sponsor and the investigator have the right to cl ose out a site prematurely.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Investigator’s Decision  
The investigator must notify the sponsor of a desire to close out a site in writing, providing at least 
30 days’ notice. The final decision should be made through mutual agreement with the sponsor. 
Both parties will arrange the close -out procedures after review and consultation.  
Sponsor’s Decision  
The sponsor will notify the investigator(s) of a decision to close out a study site in writing. Reasons 
may include the following, among others:  
• The investigator has received all items and information necessary to perform the study 
but has not enrolled any patient within a reasonable period of time.  
• The investigator has violated any fundamental obligation in the study agreement, 
including but not l imited to breach of this protocol (and any applicable amendments), 
breach of the applicable laws and regulations, or breach of any applicable ICH 
guidelines.  
• The total number of patients required for the study are enrolled earlier than expected.  
In all ca ses, the appropriate IRB, EC and health authorities must be informed according to 
applicable regulatory requirements, and adequate consideration must be given to the protection of 
the patients’ interests.  
18. STUDY DOCUMENTATION  
18.1. Certification of Accuracy of Da ta 
A declaration assuring the accuracy and content of the data recorded on the eCRF must be signed 
electronically by the investigator. This signed declaration accompanies each set of patient  final 
eCRFs that will be provided to the sponsor.  
18.2. Retention of Re cords  
The investigator must retain all essential study documents, including ICFs, source documents, 
investigator copies of CRFs, and drug accountability records for at least 15  years following the 
completion or discontinuation of the study, or longer, if a  longer period is required by relevant 
regulatory authorities. The investigator must obtain written approval from the sponsor before 
discarding or destroying any essential study documents during the retention period following study 
completion or discontinu ation. Records must be destroyed in a manner that ensures confidentiality.

v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  2 Over the past decade, following the initial suggestion that pharmacological 'harnessing' of the in vivo 
stability of GLP -1 may be a novel approach to the management of type 2 diabetes (1), two separate 
strategies to overcome the inherent drawbacks in using native GLP -1 have been investigated by academic 
laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry alike (2, 3) . The outcome of this research has been the design 
of long -acting, DPP IV -resistant analogs, and/or derivatives of GLP -1, suitable for exogenous 
admini stration, and the development of inhibitors of DPP IV to enhance the endogenously released 
hormone.  
 
Linaglitpin and other DPP -IV inhibitors reduce blood glucose concentrations by stimulating c -AMP 
dependent insulin release from the  cell, suppressing pos t prandial glucagon increase and by slowing 
gastric emptying. Linagliptin  is a potent, long - acting, competitive, reversible inhibit or of DPP IV. 
Linagliptin once daily increases postprandial plasma intact GLP -1 levels by 1.5 -to 3-fold compared with 
placeb o. Lin agliptin also decreases postprandial glucagon levels in patients with type 2 diabetes during 
12 weeks of therapy, thereby lowering fasting glucose concentrations and reducing glucose excursions 
after a meal. Linagliptin has been studied as a monother apy in drug - naïve patients with type 2 diabetes, 
and in combination with other glucose lowering medications.  It is not yet known if linagliptin is anti -
inflammatory.  
 
Obesity, diabetes and inflammation  
Both obesity and diabetes have been shown to be associated with oxidative stress (4-7) and inflammation 
(8-12). One possible reason why obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with oxidative stress and 
inflammation is the state of insulin resistance. This is due to the  fact that 1) resistance is associated with 
the presence of pro -inflammatory factors including cytokines (13); 2) insulin has been shown to exert an 
anti-inflammatory and anti -oxidant effects at the cellular and molecular level both, in vitro , and in vivo  
(14-17). A low dose infusion of insulin (2  IU/h) has been shown to reduce ROS generation by mononuclear 
cells (MNC), suppress NADPH oxidase expression and intranuclear NF B binding, induce I B 
expression and suppress plas ma ICAM -1 and MCP -1 concentrations (17). It also suppresses intranuclear 
Egr-1, plasma tissue factor (TF), PAI -1 and MCP -1 concentrations (14). An interruption of insulin signal 
transduction would prevent the anti -inflammatory effect of insulin from being exerted. The anti-
inflammatory and pro -fibrinolytic effects of insulin have also been confirmed in the setting of acute ST 
segment elevation myocardial infarction  (18).  We have previously demonstrated that macronutrient intake 
(glucose, protein and lipids) induce ROS generation and cause oxidative stress in humans. Glucose or a 
fast food mixed meal intake cause an increase in NF B and a fall in total cellular I B, the two cardinal 
indices of inflammation at the cellular level (19-21). Mixed fast food meal also induces an i ncrease in C -
reactive protein (CRP) (19).  Glucose intake has further been shown to increase the ratio of phosphorylated 
IB to native non -phosphorylated I B and to induce an increase in I B kinase (IKK ) and IKK . At 
a cellular level, the changes that occur in the MNC foll owing a glucose challenge are very similar to those 
which occur after endotoxin challenge.  
It is possible that obesity is a pro -oxidative and pro -inflammatory state resulting from chronically 
increased macronutrient intake. An increasing amount of epidemi ologic data show that persistent, low -
grade inflammation is an independent predictor of ischemic heart disease (22, 23) , stroke (24, 25) , diabetes 
(26, 27) , and all -cause mortality (28, 29) . In addition to these epidemiologic findings, experimental 
evidence shows that markers of chronic inflammation, such as pro -inflammato ry cytokines IL -6 and TNF -
 and the acute -phase reactant CRP, play a direct role in the etiology of atherosclerosis and insulin 
resistance (30, 31) . Diet-induced weight loss decreases concentrations of CRP, IL -6, and TNF -  (8, 32 -
37). It is also relevant that caloric restriction in the obese and a fast in normal subjects result in a reduction 
v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  3 in oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators (5, 8, 38)  In this regard, it is interesting to not e that TNF -
 and IL -1 have been shown to reduce hypothalamic GnRH and LH secretion in animals and in vitro .(39, 
40) It is therefore possible that inflammatory cytokines may partly mediate hypogonadotrophic 
hypogonadism (HH) of obesity and type 2 diabetes.  
  
Measuring Inflammation and Oxidative Stress  
Inflammation at the cellular level can be described as an increase in the pro -inflamma tory transcription 
factor, NF B, in the nucleus and with a concomitant decrease in its inhibitors I B and/or I B. NFB 
is a heterodimer, and usually consists of two proteins, a p65 (RelA) subunit and a p50 subunit. In the basal 
state NF B is bound to its  inhibitor protein I B, which restricts NF B to the cytoplasm. Stimulation of 
cells by cytokines like TNF  or IL -1 or endotoxin results in phosphorylation of I B, unbinding of NF B 
from I B and activation of NF B with its subsequent translocation into the nucleus (41, 42) . This in turn 
induces the transcription of pro -inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF , IL-1 and IL -6), adhesion 
molecules (ICAM, VCAM), chemokines (such as MCP -1 and MIF), adhesion molecules, 
metalloproteinase s (MMP -1, and MMP -9) and many other genes that regulate transcription, apoptosis and 
cell proliferation.  
  Oxidative stress can be defined as an increase in ROS generation. The term ROS is a collective term that 
includes not only oxygen -centered radicals s uch as superoxide (O·2−) and hydroxyl (OH), but also some 
non-radical derivative of oxygen such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), singlet oxygen and hypochlorous 
acid (HOCL). A critical balance exists between generation and detoxification of ROS in respiring ce lls of 
normal individuals. The various risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, 
and diabetes, have in common the generation of oxidative stress. ROS are able to break off cell membrane 
proteins, fuse membrane lipid and prot eins, hardening the cell membrane and exposing genetic material 
in the nucleus, leaving the DNA open for mutation or destruction. They may damage the endothelium of 
blood vessels, thereby leading to atherosclerosis. ROS -mediated lipid peroxidation is a car dinal step in 
the initiation of atherosclerosis (43, 44) .  NF B is one of the transcription factors that may be contr olled 
by the redox status of the cell (45). NADPH oxidase complex, composed of  cytoplasmic (p47phox p67phox, 
small GTP -binding p21rac) and plasma membrane components  (heterodimer of gp91 & p22phox)  is a key 
enzyme involved in the production of ROS. (46)  
Lipid Peroxidation and Protein Oxidation : Lipid peroxidation is an autocatalytic free radical -mediated 
chemical mechanism in which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) undergo oxidation to form lipid 
hydroperoxide (LHP)  (47, 48) . Lev els of 15 -isoprostane F2 in urine are useful for the non -invasive 
assessment of oxidant stress in vivo  (49). There is evidence that oxidative modification of proteins may 
be physiologically important, serving as a “marking” step for initiating protein degradation. Oxidation of 
proteins by microsomal oxidases and metal -catalyzed oxidation trea tment is known to produce carbonyl 
modifications of amino acids (50). Phe reacts with the hydroxyl r adical (OH) to form the hydroxylated 
products ortho -, meta -, and para -tyrosine ( o-, m-, and p-tyr). The aromatic hydroxylation of Phe can be 
used to detect OH formation and is considered as a marker of protein oxidation (51).  
 
Incretins and Infl ammation  
 Use of exenatide in type 2 diabetes patients on insulin has shown very promising and exciting results . We 
studied the effect of exenatide in an observational study in our clinic patients  (52). We found  that in  
addition to improvement in glycemic control over 12 weeks, levels of CRP fell by 30% in patients. A 
reduction of 25 -30% in fast acting insulin requirements were also observed in patients along with a 
significant weight loss. This study, for the first time, show ed the potential anti -inflammatory action of 
synthetic incretins. We then did a randomized prospective placebo controlled blinded trial in patients with 
v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  4 type 2 diabetes (53). Type 2 diabetic patients on insulin received exenatide or placebo for 12 weeks. There 
was a s ignificant reduction in reactive oxygen species generation and nuclear factor -κB binding by 22 and 
26%, respectively after use of exenatide. The mRNA expression of TNFα, IL -1β, JNK -1, TLR -2, TLR -4, 
and SOCS -3 in mononuclear cells also decreased by 16 -31%.  We also showed that a single injection of 
exenatide has an anti -inflammatory effect.   
 
DPP -IV and inflammation  
Recent advances in the understanding of DPP IV have provided new insight s into the link between 
inflammation and DPP IV. It has been found to have a role in activation and function of T cells. DPP IV 
serves as a target of  efficient enzymatic inhibitors which induce autocrine production of TGF - β1 and 
subsequent suppression of T  cell proliferation and cytokine release (54). In vivo, targeting DPP IV has 
provid ed a potent therapeutic approach for the treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, 
an animal model of multiple sclerosis.  It has been suggested that DPP IV inhibition of pathogenic T cells 
represents a novel and efficient therapy for autoimm une disease of the central nervous system by a 
mechanism that involves an active TGF -β1 mediated anti -inflammatory effect at the site of pathology.  
  We investigated the anti -inflammatory effect s of sitagliptin in insulin naïve patients with type 2 
diabete s. Twenty -two patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either 100 mg daily of 
sitagliptin  or placebo for 12wk  (55). Fasting glucagon -like peptide -1 concentrations increased 
significantly, whereas the mRNA expressi on in mononuclear cell of CD26, the proinflammatory cytokine, 
TNFα, the receptor for endotoxin, Toll -like receptor (TLR) -4, TLR -2, and proinflammatory kinases, c -
Jun N -terminal kinase -1 and inhibitory -κB kinase (IKKβ), and that of the chemokine receptor CC R-2 fell 
significantly after 12 wk of sitagliptin . TLR -2, IKKβ, CCR -2, and CD26 expression and nuclear factor -
κB binding also fell after a single dose of sitagliptin . There was a fall in protein expression of c -Jun N -
terminal kinase -1, IKKβ, and TLR -4 and in plasma concentrations of C -reactive protein, IL -6, and free 
fatty acids after 12 wk of sitagliptin . These effects are consistent with a potent and rapid anti -inflammatory 
effect of sitagliptin  and may potentially contribute to the inhibition of atherosc lerosis. The suppression of 
CD26 expression suggests that sitagliptin  may inhibit the synthesis of DPP -IV in addition to inhibiting its 
action.  This contributes to lower GLP -1 concentrations in plasma after such meals. Therefore, it would be 
extremely inte resting to determine what effect linagliptin has on GLP -1, GIP, and c -peptide 
concentrations.  
 
Insulin Sensitization by L inagliptin  
  As mentioned above,  sitagliptin exerts a potent and rapid anti -inflammatory effect as reflected in the 
suppression of ROS generation and intranuclear NFκB binding (55). In association with this action, we 
also observed the suppression of the expression of SOCS -3, a protein whose expression is induced by the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF α, IL-1β and IL -6 and which interferes with insulin signal transduction. 
This inter ference occurs at the IRS -1 level. The expression of SOCS -3 has been shown to be increased in 
the obese and is related to BMI and HOMA -IR, NFκB activity and TNF α expression (56). Furthermore, 
SOCS -3 is also induced by a high fat high carbohydrate meal in p arallel with the increased expression of 
TNF α and IL -1β (57). More recently, it has been shown that weight loss following gastric bypass surgery 
is associated with a reduction not only in inflammatory i ndices but also that of SOCS -3 expression  (58). 
Protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase -1B (PTP -1B) is another key protein which d ephosphorylates 
proteins and interferes with insulin and leptin signaling and is also induced by the HFHC meal (59, 60) . 
Indeed , a recent study has show n that Sitagliptin treatment for 6 weeks in patients with  type 2 diabetes 
increases insulin sensitivity by 10% (measured as oral glucose insulin sensitivity during a meal test) (61). 
The same study also showed that Sitaglipti n decreases endogenous  glucose production in fasting as well 
v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  5 as post -prandial state by ~5%. While the effect of Sitagliptin on endogenous glucose output is probably 
caused by glucagon suppression, the mechanism underlying its insulin sensitizing effect is n ot known.  
  On the basis of the above, we suggest that sitagliptin and other DPP -IV inhibitors like linagliptin could 
potentially increase insulin signal transduction and increase insulin sensitivity  by suppressing 
inflammatory mediators of insulin resista nce including SOCS -3 and PTP -1B. 
  Therefore, in a study directed to investigate the potential anti -inflammatory effect of linagliptin, we 
would like to also test whether linagliptin exerts an insulin sensitizing effect. The methodology used will 
be based on the measurement of insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps before and 
after the institution of linagliptin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.  
      
Rationale for study  
Linaglitpin has been shown to result in better glycemic c ontrol in type II diabetes patients. As described 
above, obesity and diabetes are states of increased inflammation and are also major risk factors for 
atherosclerotic disease. In view of the data suggesting that DPP -IV is a pro -inflammatory mediator and 
that its inhibition may suppress autoimmune inflammatory  mechanisms, it is likely that linagiptin  may 
exert an anti -inflammatory effect in the human. The increase in GLP -1 concentrations may also exert an 
anti-inflammatory effect similar to that observed wit h exenatide.  Indeed, our investigations on the anti -
inflammatory effects of sitagliptin, the first DPP -IV inhibitor to be licensed, have demonstrated profound 
evidence to this effect. Our findings are  summarized under preliminary data below.  
Preliminary data:  
In a study on obese type 2 diabetics, the administration of sitagliptin 100 mg daily for 12 weeks resulted 
in several  novel observations. There was an inhibition of DPP -IV enzyme by 90% within 2 h ours of the 
first dose. In addition, there was a suppression of CD26 expression. CD26 is a pro -inflammatory mediator 
expressed on the cell membranes and is the cellular analog of the DPP -IV enzyme. Thus, sitagliptin and 
possibly other DPP -IV inhibitors may  also inhibit the expression and synthesis of DPP -IV. In addition, 
there was a reduction in plasma concentrations of FFA, CRP and IL -6; a reduction in the expression of 
CCR -2, IKKβ, JNK -1, TNFα  (see figures  below ).

Meal Challenge description  
Subjects will arrive after having fasted overnight (10 hr) around 8 -8:30AM. Subcutaneous fat biopsy will 
be done.  The subjects will eat a meal that consist s of 900 kcal of HFHC breakfast (egg muffin and sausage 
muffin sandwiches and two hash browns which contain 81g carbohydrates, 51g fat and 32 g protein).   
Meal must be consumed within 15 minutes.  Blood samples will be obtained at baseline (before the meal)  
and at the following time points after the meal is consumed: 15min, 30min, 45min, 1hr, 75min, 90min, 
105min, 2hr, 3hr, and 5 hr.   Samples will measure fasting and post meal  glucose, insulin, glucagon, GLP -
1, GIP , c-peptide  in plasma , and indices of inflam matory stress, specifically intra -nuclear NF ĸB, 
expression of TNFα, and JNK -1 in MNC .  Blood will be collected from an intravenous cannula in a 
superficial forearm vein. Samples at 15, 30, 45, 75, 90, 105, and 120 min will each be 5mL. Samples at 
baseline (0h) and 1hr , 3hr and 5hr are 3 5mL each. The total amount of blood drawn during this meal 
challenge is 1 75mL.  Fat biopsy will be repeated after 5 hours.  Samples for GLP -1, GIP and c -peptide 
measurement will be collected in DPP -IV inhibitor and protease inh ibitors containing tubes.  
 
 
 LABORATORY PROCEDURES  
 
1. MNC isolation: Blood samples (30 -40ml) is  collected in Na -EDTA and carefully layered on 
Lympholyte medium (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON)  according to manufacturer’s instructions . 
Samples are centri fuged and two bands separate out at the top of the RBC pellet. The MNC band was 
harvested and washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). This method provides yields 
greater than 95% MNC preparation.  
2. ROS generation measurement by chemiluminesce nce: Five hundred L of MNC (2 x 105 cells) are 
delivered into a Chronolog LumiAggregometer cuvette. Luminol is then added, followed by 1.0 L 
of 10 mM formylmethionyl leucinyl phenylalanine (fMLP).  Chemiluminescence  is recorded for 15 
minutes. Our method, developed independently (62, 63) , is similar to that published by Tosi and 
Hamedani (64). In this assay system, the release of superoxide radical as measured by 
chemiluminescence, has been shown to be linearly correlated with that measured by the 
ferricytochrome C method .  The interassay coefficient of variation of this assay is 8 %. We have 
further established that the biological variation in reactive oxygen species generation in n ormal 
subjects is approximately 6 % for readings obtained 1 to 2 weeks apart. Similarly, the variation in 
reactive oxygen species generation in the obese over a period of 1 to 2 weeks is less than 8 %.  
3. Quantification of IKKβ, JNK -1, TNFα , IL-6, IL -1, TLR4 , TLR2,  SOCS -3, PTP -1B, CCR -2 and 
CD-26 Expression: The mRNA expression is measured in MNC and adipose tissue by RT -PCR: 
Total RNA was isolated using commercially available RNAqueous® -4PCR Kit (Ambion, Austin, 
TX). One µg of total RNA is reverse transcribe d using Advantage RT -for-PCR Kit (Clontech, CA). 
Real Time RT -PCR was performed using Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR System (La Jolla, CA), 
Sybergreen master mix (Qiagen, CA) and gene specific primers (Life Technologies, MD). The 
specificity and the size of the PCR products are tested by adding a melt curve at the end of the 
amplifications and by running it on a 2% agarose gel. All values were normalized to the expression 
of a group of housekeeping genes including actin, ubiqui tin C and cyclophilin A . 
4.   Western blotting:  MNC and adipose tissue total cell lysates are prepared by suspending the cells in 
150 μL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris -HCl, 150mM NaCl, 0.2 % Triton X and proteases and phospatases 
v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  13 inhibitors). After 30 min incuba tion on ice, samples are centrifuged at 12000 Xg for 10 min, 
supernatants are collected and total protein concentrations are determined. Sixty μg of total cell lysate 
are boiled in 2X SDS buffer (100 mM Tris -HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.06 % bromophenol bl ue 
and 200 mM DTT), proteins separated by SDS -PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane. 
Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against p47phox, JNK -1, IKK -, SOCS -3, PTP -1B and TLR -4, 
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) will be used and the 
membranes are developed using super signal, chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce Chemical, IL).  
Densitometry is performed using molecular analyst software (Biorad, CA) and all values are 
corrected for loading with actin.  
5. NFB DNA binding:  Nuclear  NFkB DNA binding activity is measured by electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear extract is prepared from MNC and fat tissue by high salt extraction as 
described by Andrews et al. Protein concentrations are determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce, 
IL). NFkB gel retardation assay is performed using double -stranded oligonucleotide consensus 
sequence for the NFkB -binding site (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) radiolabeled with -P32 by T4 
kinase. Seven and a half µg of the nuclear extract are mix ed with the incubation buffer (10 mM Tris 
(pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) containing 0.5µg poly dI -dC and 
0.2 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA to a final volume of 20 mL and the mixture is preincubated on ice 
for 15 min. Labeled oligonucleoti des (60,000 cpm) are added, and the mixture is incubated at room 
temperature for 20 min. Samples are then applied to wells of 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. 
The gel is dried under vacuum and exposed to x -ray film. Densitometry is performed using Bio -Rad 
molecular analyst software (Hercules, CA). The specificity of the bands is confirmed by supershifting 
these bands with specific antibodies against Rel -A (p65) and p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) 
and by competition with cold oligonucleotides. Alternativley, binding to DNA can be performed 
using TransAM NF B (p65) kit (Active motive, Carlsbad, CA) on NE.  
6. Plasma glucose, insulin and FFAs measurements : Insulin levels are determined using an ELISA kit 
from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories Inc. (Webster, TX). Glucose levels are measured in plasma 
by YSI 2300 STAT Plus glucose analyzer (Yellow Springs, Ohio). FFAs levels are measured by a 
colorimetric assay  (Roche , Richmond, VA)  Active  GLP -1 will be measured using ELISA kit  
(Millipore, MA) from samples collected in DPP -IV inhibitor (Millipore, MA) to prevent GLP -1 
degradation. GLP -1 assay sensitivity is 1.5pM.  
7.   15-isoprostane F 2t (also known as 8 -epi-PGF2α  or 8-iso-PGF2α) in urine samples and TBARS will 
be measured by an ELISA kit from Oxford Biomedical Research (Oxford, MI).  
8.   Plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines:  Concentrations of IL -6 and TNF  are measured 
in plasma using sensitive and high se nsitive ELISA kits (R&D Systems, MN).  ELISA will be used 
to measure C -reactive protein (American Diagnostica Inc., CT) and DPPIV activity (reported as 
relative fluorescence units/sec (RFU/sec).  
9.   Measurement of whole body glucose uptake and endogenous glucose production by HE clamp:  
Subjects will come to the clinical research center after an overnight 10 hour fast. The patient ’s blood 
sugar before the clamp is started should be ≤10mmol/L. Patients  with blood sugar >10mmol/l will be 
re-scheduled. Oral hypoglycemic medications will be held on the morning of HE clamp. Long acting 
insulin will be held the night before the clamp. HE clamp will be done  using radioactive glucose ( 3-
3H-glucose ) as previous ly described (65, 66) . Subjects will arrive at 8 AM for HE clamp with a prime -
continuous infusion of 3 -3H-glucose. The 3-3H glucose prime will be 20 Ci x (fasting plasma 
glucose/100); the continuous infusion will be given at the rate of 0.20 Ci/min for 420 minutes (180 
minute s for isotopic equilibration and 240 minutes during the insulin clamp). Insulin clamp will be 
started at 180 min with a priming dose of short acting human insulin given over 10 minutes and then 
v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  14 an infusion at the rate of 80mU/m2. 20% glucose infused throug h the cephalic vein will be started at 
5 minutes and  glucose infusion rate will be titrated to maintain blood glucose concentration at the 
fasting glucose level in the obese and at 5.5mmol/l in T2D . Plasma samples for titrated  glucose will 
be obtained at 10 minute intervals starting 30 minutes before the clamp, to quantitate rates of whole 
body glucose disposal and suppression of endogenous (primarily hepatic) glucose production. Blood 
sample will be collected for insulin and f ree fatty acids (FFA) concentrations every 30 minutes during 
the clamp. Calculations will be done using Steele’s equation (67). 
Calculations : Under steady -state postabsorptive conditions, the rate of endogenous glucose 
appearance (Ra) will be calculated as the 3[3H] glucose infusion rate (d isintegrations per minute per 
minute) divided by the steady -state plasma 3[3H] glucose -specific activity (disintegrations per minute 
per milligram). During the euglycemic insulin clamp, the rate of Ra will be calculated using Steele’s 
equation, using a dis tribution volume of 250 ml/kg. Endogenous (primarily hepatic) glucose 
production (EGP) will be calculated by subtracting the mean exogenous glucose infusion rate during 
the last 60 minutes (after steady state has been achieved)  from Ra. The rate of insulin -mediated total 
body glucose disposal (Rd) will be determined by adding the rate of residual EGP to the exogenous 
glucose infusion rate . Insulin sensitivity will be expressed as Rd/lean body mass.  
10. Fat aspiration procedure:  Subjects who are taking antiplate let or anticoagulant medications  will be 
excluded from the fat biopsy portion of the study.  Subcutaneous fat tissue aspiration will be 
performed on abdomen at a 10 cm distance from umbilicus. The skin will first be prepared and a 
sterile drape will be plac ed around the appropriate area. Under local anesthesia , 500mg -3g of fat 
tissue will be obtained. The adipose tissue will be centrifuged to remove blood and fluid 
contaminants. The upper adipose tissue will be collected into a separate sterile tube, washed twice 
with cold sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and centrifuged to remove the PBS. Total RNA, 
nuclear extracts and total cell lysates will be prepared from the adipose tissue.   
 
 
DATA ANALYSIS  
 
This is a prospective study to evaluate  oxidative stress befo re and after treatment with lina gliptin. The 
similarities between the study groups, baseline values for subject’s demographics will be compared 
using appropriate parametric tests. Transformations  of the data on order to meet statistical assumptions 
may be considered.  All statistical analysis will be carried out using SPSS software  (SPSS Inc, Chicago, 
Illinois) . Comparison  of each endpoint will be made using an analysis of covariance model, with 
baseline medications, change in BMI and change in HbA1c  as covariates . The primary endpoint  of the 
study is to detect a change in JNK-1 protein  in MNC  before and after linagliptin use as compared to 
placebo . We have chosen this as the primary endpoint becaus e JNK -1 is an inflammatory mediator 
that also interferes with insulin signaling. Our prior  data with sitagliptin show a 24% fall (with SD of 
24%) in JNK-1 following 12 weeks of treatment in type 2 diabetics (55). There was a 6 % non -
significant increase in JNK -1 protein in the placebo group in that study. Cons ervatively  estimating a 
difference in change in JNK-1 cellular concentrations  of 24% among the two groups , a sample size of 
20 patients per group (assuming a drop -out rate of 15%) should provide adequate power (  = 0.2) to 
detect a significant difference (  = 0.05), provided the standard deviation of the residuals is not equal 
to or greater than the mean difference (see table below).  
 
 
 
v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  15 Sample Size Estimate  
 
Justification of drop -out rate: The analysis will adjust for only one baseline covariate: baseline 
medications. Two other covariates are change in BMI (which is not expected with linagliptin or 
placebo) and change in HbA1c. Sulfonylureas, metformin and subcutaneous insulin are not likely to 
induce insulin sensitization or decrease inflammation. Subjects currently on GLP -1 agonists or DPP -
IV inhibitors will be excluded from the study. Thiazolidinediones can induce insulin sens itization as 
well as decrease inflammation. The use of thiazolidinediones should be equally distributed among the 
two groups. Less than 20% of our research subjects ore on thiazolidinediones. Therefore it is likely 
that adjustment for thiazolidinediones sh ould decrease sample size by <5%.  Based on this justification 
and on our previous experience in diabetes trials, we have estimated that our drop -out rate will be 15% 
of 20 patients (3 patients per group).  
 
The secondary endpoints for the study will be comp arison of the relative change from baseline in a) 
inflammatory mediators in serum and adipose tissue, b) single dose effect of linagliptin on 
inflammation and oxidative stress, c) HFHC induced inflammation in serum and adipose tissue and d) 
insulin sensiti vity and hepatic glucose output ; before and after using Linagliptin  for 12  week s.

v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  17 Assessment of adverse events  
Definitions of adverse events  
Adverse event  
An adverse event (AE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an exacerbation of a 
pre-existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a pharmaceutical product. The 
event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with th is treatment.  
Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately life -threatening, 
results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, requires or prolongs patient hospitalisation, is a  
congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important 
medical event when based upon appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to preve nt one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definitions.  
Patients may be hospitalised for administrative or social reasons during the study (e.g. days on which 
infusion takes place, long distance from home to site,). These and other hospitalisations p lanned at the 
beginning of the study do not need to be reported as a SAE in case they have been reported at screening 
visit in the source data and have been performed as planned.  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Based on regulatory recommendation that i s based on the experience with other compounds  
in the DPP -4 inhibitor class, the following events should be defined as adverse events of special interest.  
•  Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, angioedema -like events, and  
anaphylaxis  
•  Skin lesions such as exfoliative dermatitis, and exfoliative rash  
• Renal adverse events (e.g. renal failure, >=2x increase of creatinine from baseline)  
• Pancreatitis  
Hepatic adverse events such as hepatitis,  liver injury,  and increased liver enzymes . Hepatic  injury is 
defined by the following alterations of liver parameters: For patients with normal liver function (ALT, 
AST and bilirubin within normal limits) at baseline an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN 
combined with an elevation of bilirubin >2 fol d ULN measured in the same blood draw sample.  
 
Refer to the appendix 1 for a list of prefered terms (PT’s) that are considered as AEs of Special 
Interest.  
 
Protocol -specified significant events are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to Serious 
Adverse Events, even if they do not meet any of the seriousnes s criteria.  
 
 
Intensity of adverse event  
The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following:  
v5 1 13; v12 9 13, v 3 14, v4 14, v5 22 14  18 • Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) which is/are easily tolerated  
• Moder ate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity  
• Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities  
 
Causal relationship of adverse event  
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, consi dering all relevant factors, including 
pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, confounding factors such as 
concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history. Assessment of causal relationship 
should be reco rded in the case report forms.  
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product  administered 
and the AE.  
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product  administered 
and the AE.  
 
Worsening of the underlying disease or other pre -existing conditions  
Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre -existing conditions will be recorded as an (S)AE in 
the (e)CRF.  
Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination, and laboratory test results  
Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results will be recorded as an (S)AE 
in the (e)CRF , if they are judged  clinically relevant by the investigator.  
Responsibilities for SAE reporting  
The Sponsor  shall report  (i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the trialdefined follow -
up period)  all SAEs and  non-serious AEs  occurring at the same time and/or which are medically related 
to the SAE and Adverse Events of Special Interest by fax or other secure method to the BI Unique Entry 
Point  in accordance with timeline  specified in the pharmcovigilance agreement  
 
For each adv erse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity, treatment required, 
outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. The investigator will determine the 
expectedness of the investigational drug to the AEs  as defined in the Listed Adverse Events section of the 
Boehringer Ingelheim’s (BI’s) Investigator Brochure for the Product or BI Drug Information e.g. 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or Product Information (PI) for the authorised Study Drug 
provided by BI.

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT IV (6-21-17) 33 
 34 
This amendment applies to subjects participating in the optional extension study from >3 years 35 
to 8 years after randomization, which is described in Protocol Amendment II.  36 
 37 
Protocol Change #1  38 
 39 
Current Protocol (Protocol Amendment III 6 -18-15) 40 
Symptoms of d iplopia are not assessed in the current version of the protocol.  41 
 42 
Proposed Change  43 
To assess symptoms of diplopia by asking subjects to complete the Diplopia Questionnaire at the 44 
8-year visit.   45 
 46 
Rationale for Change  47 
Diplopia (double vision) is an important long -term outcome following surgery for strabismus  and 48 
may be an adverse effect of either or both the surgical approaches used in the study . We 49 
proposed to collect standardized data to determine the frequency of this potential adverse effect 50 
and whether it differs between treatment groups.   The Diplopia Questionnaire1 is a validated, 51 
reliable 8-item self -administered questionnaire designed to assess the presence and frequency of 52 
diplopia in specific gaze positio ns.   53

 61 
This amendment applies to subjects participating in the  optional  extension study  described in 62 
Protocol Amendment II .  63 
 64 
Protocol Change #1  65 
 66 
Current Protocol  (Protocol Amendment II 2 -10-15) 67 
 In the additional 5 years of follow up provided for by Protocol Amendment II (>3 y ears to 8 68 
years after randomization), t he study will cover the costs of each annual visit  because they 69 
include  testing procedures that are not standard care in all practices .  Any other visits that are 70 
part of routine care will be the subject’s (or his/her  insurance companies) responsibility.   71 
 72 
Proposed Change  73 
In the additional 5 years of follow up provided for by Protocol Amendment II (>3 years to 8 74 
years after randomization), t he study will pay for visits specific to the research study, but will not 75 
pay for usual care visits that would occur whether  or not  the child was in the study . The cost of 76 
usual care visits will be the parent(s) or their insurance company’s responsibility.  77 
 78 
Rationale for Change  79 
Some visits will be needed as part of normal care; whi le some will be research related.  The 80 
investigator will determine whether each annual visit is considered routine patient care or 81 
specific to the research study.  82

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT II (2-10-15) 90 
 91 
This optional amendment provides for  study subjects to have  an additional five years of follow 92 
up after the 3-year primary outcome  (>3 years to 8 years from randomization) .  93 
 94 
Objective  95 
To compare long -term outcomes between subjects originally treated with bilateral lateral rectus 96 
muscle recession versus unilateral  lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection for the 97 
treatment of basic type and pseudo divergence excess type intermittent exotropia.  98 
 99 
Protocol Specified Follow -up Visits  100 
Visits will occur at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years ( ±2 months ) from randomization.  Additional follow -up 101 
visits are at investigator discretion.   102 
 103 
Study Procedures and Data Collection  104 
The following testing procedures will be performed  in the following order: * 105 
 106 
1. Health -Related Quality of Life Questionnaire  (8-year visit only)   107 
2. Diplopia Question naire (8-year visit only)  108 
3. Visual acuity  109 
 Testing will be performed using the electronic E-ETDRS testing protocol  110 
 Testing must be performed in current refractive correction , if worn.     111 
 If prism is currently prescribed, visual acuity testing should be performed with prism.   112 
 If deliberate overminus ** is currently prescribed, visual acuity testing should be 113 
performed with the overminus correction.  114 
 If visual acuity is 20/32 or worse (75 letters or less)  in either eye, a manifest refraction 115 
must be performed. If the examiner believes that the patient’s current correction is not 116 
optimal, trial frames with new correction should be used for all testing at the visit.  This 117 
includes testing vis ual acuity again, with the patient wearing trial frames.    118 
4. Control of exodeviation assessment at distance and near #1:   119 
 Testing must be performed in current refractive correction.    120 
 If prism is currently prescribed, testing should be performed without prism.   121 
 If deliberate overminus ** is currently prescribed, testing should be performed in trial 122 
frames without the overminus component of the prescription.   123 
5. Preschool Randot stereoacuity testing at near (performed at 40 cm)  124 
 Testing must be performed in cur rent refractive correction .     125 
 If prism is currently prescribed, stereoacuity testing should be performed with prism.   126 
 If deliberate overminus ** is currently prescribed, stereoacuity testing should be 127 
performed with the overminus correction.    128 
 Stereoacuity is tested immediately following the first assessment of control of the 129 
exodeviation ; no 10 -minute break is needed.  130 
6. Ocular alignment  testing in prism or deliberate overminus (for patients currently prescribed 131 
prism or deliberate overminus)    132 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17   Measure ocular alignment at near  only, in the primary position using cover/uncover , 133 
SPCT  and PACT  134 
 This testing should be performed with prism or deliberate overminus (as applicable).   135 
7. Control of exodeviation assessment at distance and near #2 (repeat) ( see item #2 ) 136 
 The second control testing is performed immediately after the previous testing —it does 137 
not need to be performed before dissociative testing  and no 10 -minute break is needed.  138 
 The same examiner  should assess IXT control each of the three different times that 139 
control is assessed during the annual study visit.    140 
8. Ocular alignment in the primary position using cover/uncover , SPCT  and PACT at distance 141 
and near   142 
 Testing must be performed in current refractive correction.    143 
 If prism is currently prescribed, ocular alignment testing should be performed without 144 
prism.   145 
 If deliberate overminus ** is currently prescribed, ocular alignment testing should be 146 
performed in trial frames without the overminus component of the prescript ion.   147 
9. Control of exodeviation assessment at distance and near  #3 (repeat) ( see item #2 ) 148 
 The third control testing is to be performed immediately after the previous testing —it 149 
does not need to be performed before dissociative testing  and no 10 -minute break  is 150 
needed.  151 
 The same examiner  should assess IXT control each of the three different times that 152 
control is assessed during the annual study visit.   153 
10. Cycloplegic refraction (7-year visit only)  154 
 If the current correction at the 7 -year visit is not optimal ba sed on the cycloplegic 155 
refraction, new spectacles should be prescribed.   156 
 157 
*Testing procedures are performed as described in section 2.5 unless otherwise specified  above .   158 
 159 
**Deliberate overminus lenses = lenses that yield > 0.50 D more minus  spherical equivalent (SE) 160 
than the refraction SE.  161 
 162 
All testing procedures are assessed unmasked .   163 
 164 
At each annual visit, data on treatment s used or  prescribed , current refractive correction,  and the 165 
last refraction will be recorded.    166 
 167 
Treatment  168 
Treatment in the extension study is at investigator discretion , including non -surgical treatment 169 
and reoperation.    170 
 171 
Costs  172 
The parent/guardian of each subject will be compensated $50 per visit for completion of each 173 
annual protocol -specified follow -up visit (4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8 - year) for a maximum of $250.  If 174 
there are extenuating circumstances, and the subject is unable to complete the annual study visits 175 
without additional funds due to travel costs, additional funds may be provided.  176 
  177 
In the additional 5 years of follow up provided for by Protocol Amendment II (>3 years to 8 178 
years after randomization), t he study will pay for visits specific to the research study, but will not 179 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17  pay for usual care visits that would occur whether or not the child was in the study. The cost of 180 
usual care visits will be the parent(s) or their insurance company’s responsibility.  181 
 182 
Treatment is at investigator discretion and is not part of this protocol.  Any costs associated with 183 
treatment will not be paid for by the study.  The study will pay for a pair of spectacles (lenses 184 
and frames) at the 7 -year visit; spectacle changes / new spectacles prescribed at other times will 185 
not be paid for by the study.   186 
 187 
Risks  188 
The procedures in this study are part of daily eye care practice in the United States and pose no 189 
known risks.  190 
 191 
Subject Contact During Follow Up  192 
Between annual visits, subjects will be called by the Jaeb Center to promote retention; birthday 193 
and holiday cards will be sent annually, and a subject newsletter may be sent.    194 
 195 
Re-consenting of Subjects  196 
An informed consent form for the extension study will be signed by parents who elect to 197 
continue their child’s study participation. An assent for the extension  study will be signed by the 198 
participating subject , as applicable.  Re -consenting generally will occur at the 3 -year visit but 199 
could occur at other times either before or after participation in the 3 -year study has ended.  A 200 
subject (and respective parent)  may withdraw from the study at any time.   201 
 202 
Statistical  Analysi s 203 
Statistical analyses will primarily be cross -sectional comparisons of outcomes including ocular 204 
alignment, exotropia control, and stereoacuity between treatment groups at each annual visit .   205 
 206 
The analysis of the primary basic IXT cohort  will be considered primary whereas the analyses in 207 
the smaller primary pseudo divergence excess IXT cohort and the secondary cohort  will be 208 
considered exploratory.  209 
 210 
Statistical analyses may also be performed combining some or all of the cohorts.  211 
 212 
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to the completion of the 213 
study  and may supersede the plan briefly described herein.   214

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT (4 -30-10) 221 
 222 
This amendment provides for the following protocol changes:  223 
 224 
Protocol Change #1  225 
 226 
Current Protocol  227 
One of the eligibility criteria requires the largest exodeviation at either distance or near to be 228 
between 15 and 50 PD (inclusive) by prism and alternate cover test (PACT).  229 
 230 
Proposed Chang e 231 
Change the eligibility criteria to require that the largest exodeviation at either distance, near, or 232 
remote distance  be between 15 and 50 PD (inclusive) by prism and alternate cover test (PACT) 233 
(sections 1.3, 1.4, 2.2.1, and 6.1).  Add an additional eli gibility criterion requiring that the 234 
exodeviaton must be at least 15 PD at distance or near (sections 1.3, 1.4, and 2.2.1).   235 
 236 
Rationale for Change  237 
Surgical dose must be based on the largest angle uncovered by PACT at distance (6 meter), near, 238 
or remote distance (at least 50 feet). The largest angle in the surgical dose tables in the protocol 239 
is 50 PD because BLRrec is considered by many clinicians to  be inadequate for correcting angles 240 
larger than 50 PD.  Because randomization would not be appropriate for patients with angles 241 
greater than 50 PD, the eligibility criteria is being tightened to exclude not only patients with 242 
distance or near angles >50 P D, but also those patients with remote distance angles >50 PD.  243 
 244 
Because one of the criteria for surgical success at 3 years requires a reduction of more than 10PD 245 
in the largest of the distance and near angles at enrollment, the additional eligibility cri teria 246 
requiring that the angle be at least 15 PD at distance or near was needed to ensure that more than 247 
10 PD improvement would be possible in at least the distance or the near angles.   248 
 249 
Protocol Change #2  250 
 251 
Current Protocol  252 
There is no upper limit on the  amount of hyperopia allowed for eligibility. Refractive correction is 253 
required for patients with hyperopia >+5.00 D and the guidelines for prescribing refractive correction 254 
specify that residual (uncorrected) hyperopia cannot exceed +5.00 D.    255 
 256 
Proposed Change  257 
Add an eligibility criterion which specifies ‘no hyperopia greater than +3.50 D spherical 258 
equivalent (SE) in either eye’ (sections 1.3, 1.4, and 2.2.1). Omit from the enrollment chapter the 259 
guideline requiring spectacle correction be prescribed for hyperopia >+5.00 D and the guideline 260 
requiring that spectacle correction have no more than +5.00 D residual hyperopia (section 2.2.1).  261 
For follow up, change to require refractive correction for patients with hyperopia >+3.50D 262 
(section5.3.1) and change ref ractive correction guidelines to specify that residual (uncorrected) 263 
hyperopia cannot exceed +3.50 D (section5.3.2).          264 
 265 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17  Rationale for Change  266 
The proposed changes are to make refractive error eligibility and prescription guidelines 267 
consistent with th ose in the IXT2 study.  The reasons for this change are as follows: 1) it was felt 268 
that making these items parallel between the two studies will avoid confusion among study 269 
investigators, 2) it is expected that the percentage of otherwise -eligible IXT pati ents with 270 
hyperopia greater than +3.50 D SE is very low, and 3) that patients with very high hyperopia 271 
might be more likely to have a neurologic condition and might be a different than the typical IXT 272 
patient  273 
 274 
Protocol Change #3  275 
 276 
Current Protocol  277 
All patie nts are randomized regardless of whether the magnitude of their exodeviation increased or 278 
decreased out of study eligibility range (15 to 50 PD) before surgery has occurred.     279 
 280 
Proposed Change  281 
Patients in whom the magnitude of the largest of the most rec ent distance, near, and remote 282 
distance angles has decreased to <15 PD or increased to >50 PD before surgery will be dropped 283 
from the study if they have not yet been randomized. If such patients have already been 284 
randomized, it is at investigator discretio n whether to perform surgery and what type of surgical 285 
method to perform (i.e. BLRrec, R&R, or any other type of procedure). Changes made to 286 
sections 2.6 and 3.1.    287 
 288 
Rationale for Change  289 
The study is aiming to evaluate surgical outcomes in patients whose largest preoperative angle is 290 
between 15 and 50 PD.  Given that the surgery window extends to 60 days after enrollment and 291 
that surgery could potentially occur even later, it is possible that a patient’s exotropia could 292 
increase or decrease out of the elig ibility range of 15 to 50 PD before surgery. As discussed in 293 
protocol change #1 above, randomization to BLRrec or R&R would not be appropriate in 294 
patients whose angle was greater than 50 PD.  In addition, the largest preoperative angle is 295 
required to be a minimum of 15 PD to ensure that a reasonable amount improvement would be 296 
required to meet one of the study’s treatment success criteria --an exodeviation less than 10 PD 297 
by PACT at distance and near and reduction of more than 10 PD from largest of distance and 298 
near angles at enrollment.  299 
   300 
Protocol Change #4  301 
 302 
Current Protocol  303 
Currently the surgical dose tables start with doses for 15 PD angles.   304 
 305 
Proposed Change  306 
In surgical dose tables 1 and 2 (section 3.3), removed 15 PD angles, added 16 PD angles using 307 
the 15 PD doses, and added 18 PD angles using the 20 PD doses.  308 
 309 
Rationale for Change  310 
There was an inconsistency between the angles listed in the surgical dose tables and the prism 311 
increments that the IXT1 Procedures Manual specifies should be used for meas uring ocular 312 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17  alignment. Prisms in 2 PD increments should be used for angles between 10 and 20 PD, therefore 313 
an angle between 15 -20 PD could be measured as 16 PD or 18 PD, but not as 15 PD.   314 
 315 
Protocol Change #5  316 
 317 
Current Protocol  318 
Control of exodeviation is measured at enrollment only.   319 
 320 
Proposed Change  321 
Control of exodeviation would be measured at masked exams as well as at enrollment (sections 322 
1.3 and 4.5).  323 
 324 
Rationale for Change  325 
Although control of exodeviation will not be included in the definition of the  primary outcome of 326 
surgical failure, it is felt worthwhile to evaluate whether patients who received one type of 327 
surgical procedure might have better control if their exodeviation persists or recurs, particularly 328 
if the primary analysis does not find a di fference in surgical failure rates between the two 329 
procedures.  330 
 331 
Protocol Change #6  332 
 333 
Current Protocol  334 
Currently the protocol is inconsistent with regard to whether treatment with overminus refractive 335 
correction is allowed during postoperative follow up. The  protocol on post -operative treatment 336 
(section 4.1) indicates that any non -surgical treatment of any overcorrection, undercorrection, or 337 
deviations associated with diplopia is at investigator discretion at any time during the study.  338 
However, the guideline s for refractive correction during follow -up (section 5.3.2) indicate that 339 
deliberate overminus using refractive correction with more than 0.50 D of overminus will not be 340 
allowed.   341 
 342 
Proposed Change  343 
The prohibition of deliberate overminus with more than 0. 50 D of overminus will be removed 344 
from the refractive correction guidelines during follow up (section 5.3.2), although it will be 345 
retained in the refractive correction guidelines for enrollment.  346 
 347 
Rationale for Change  348 
This change resolves a protocol inconsi stency.   349 
 350 
Protocol Change #7  351 
 352 
Current Protocol  353 
Mandatory treatment with prism is currently required for patients with a constant esotropia of 354 
greater than  6 PD at distance and near at 8 weeks, however the level of constant esotropia at 355 
distance and near which constitutes surgical failure at 6 months or later is at least  6 PD.  356 
 357 
Proposed Change  358 
Require mandatory treatment with prism at 8 weeks for patients w ith a constant esotropia of at 359 
least 6 PD at distance and near (sections 1.4, 4.1, and 4.4.1).   360 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17   361 
Rationale for Change  362 
Although these concepts are different —i.e. what level of constant esotropia should receive 363 
mandatory prism treatment for patient safety, and what level is appropriate for determining 364 
surgical failure —it was felt it would be less confusing and easier for investigators to remember if 365 
the cutoffs used were identical.       366 
 367 
Protocol Change #8  368 
 369 
Current Protocol  370 
The current protocol does not spe cify whether patients wearing prism and/or overminus should 371 
have clinical assessments performed with prism and/or overminus, or without.   372 
 373 
Proposed Change  374 
Clarified refractive correction to be used for testing during follow -up (section 4.3, 4.4, 4.5).  375 
Ocular alignment testing (and control assessments at masked exams) should be performed in 376 
current correction without any prism or deliberate overminus that has been prescribed.  377 
Stereoacuity testing and visual acuity testing should be performed in current co rrection with any 378 
prism or deliberate overminus that has been prescribed.  379 
 380 
Rationale for Change  381 
For ocular alignment, it was felt that the patient’s true deviation should be assessed and that this 382 
would best be achieved by taking measurements in current c orrection but without prism and 383 
without overminus  384 
For stereoacuity and visual acuity testing, it was felt that we should measure the patient’s best 385 
stereoacuity and visual acuity, which for patients prescribed prism and/or deliberate overminus 386 
would likely  be achieved with current correction including prism and/or deliberate overminus.  387 
 388 
Protocol Change #9  389 
 390 
Current Protocol  391 
Protocol change #8 specifies that during follow up, stereoacuity testing should be performed with 392 
any prism or deliberate overminus tha t has been prescribed.  393 
 394 
Proposed Change  395 
At the 3 -year visit, patients who are currently prescribed prism and/or deliberate overminus will 396 
have Preschool Randot Stereoacuity at near repeated without wearing prism or overminus 397 
(sections 4.5.3 and 6.3.1). This additional Preschool Randot retest without prism and without 398 
overminus should occur after all initial stereoacuity testing has been completed (ie. after the 399 
Titmus Fly at near) and before the cont rol of exodeviation assessment. This testing without prism 400 
and overminus is for an exploratory analysis and is not considered in the determining whether 401 
the patient meets surgical failure criteria.             402 
 403 
Rationale:  404 
Although patients wearing prism w ill have stereoacuity measured with prism, is of interest to 405 
know whether a patient classified as a success would still be classified as a success if the patient 406 
had been measured without prism.  Because ‘success’ only applies to the 3 -year visit (whereas 407 
failure can be called at any visit from 6 months onward), we propose to measure stereoacuity 408 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17  both with prism and without prism at the 3 -year visit only. The with -prism measurement will 409 
count toward the primary outcome, and the without -prism measurement wil l be used in an 410 
exploratory analysis which would avoid calling a patient a success at 3 -years on the basis of a 411 
better stereo that is enhanced by prism. The same logic should apply to patients wearing 412 
deliberate overminus —ie. stereoacuity should be measure d with the overminus throughout the 413 
study but that it should be repeated without the overminus at the 3 -year exam with this latter test 414 
used in the exploratory analysis.    415 
 416 
 417 
 418 
 419 
This amendment also provides for the following minor protocol clarifications:   420 
 Clarified guidelines for prescribing the spherical component of refractive correction (sections 421 
2.2.1 and 5.3.2)  422 
 Specified test distances for stereoacuity testing and for ocular alignment testing (sections 2.5, 423 
4.3, 4.4, 4.5).    424 
 Clarified refractive err or eligibility criteria that treatment with prism or overminus lenses 425 
must be discontinued at least one week prior to enrollment (section 2.2.1).  426 
 Clarified eligibility criteria that visual acuity in the worse eye must be ‘0.3 logMAR or 427 
better,’ to elimina te confusion about whether ‘at least 0.3 logMAR’ meant at least 0.3 428 
logMAR numerically (meaning worse acuity) or qualitatively (meaning better acuity) 429 
(sections 1.4 and 2.2.1).    430 
 Clarified that hangback, hemi -hangback, and adjustable techniques will not b e allowed for 431 
this protocol, however, the surgeon may make epi -scleral tickbites at the intended insertion 432

 CHAPTER 1:  BACKGROUND AND SUMMA RY 535 
 536 
This study is being conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) and 537 
funded through a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute.  It is one of a series of 538 
randomized trials and observational studies underway or planned that address management of 539 
intermittent exotropia.  540 
 541 
1.1 Background  542 
Intermittent exotropia (IXT) is the most common form of childhood onset exotropia with an 543 
incidence of 32.1 per 100,000 in children under 19 years of age.2  Intermittent exotropia is 544 
characterized by an exotropia that is not constant and is mainly present when viewing at distance , 545 
but may also be present at near.  Normal binocular single vision (BSV) is typically present at 546 
near when the exotropia is controlled, with evidence of normal (occasionally sub -normal) 547 
stereoacuity.  Although the natural history of the condition is largely unknown, many children 548 
with IXT are treated using either surgical or non -surgical in terventions.  The rationale for 549 
intervention in childhood IXT is that extended periods of misalignment may lead to entrenched 550 
suppression, resulting in loss of BSV.  Intervention may also aim to address the social effects 551 
caused by the appearance of misali gned eyes.  Many children treated for IXT are currently 552 
treated surgically.3-5 553 
 554 
There is poor agreement as to which type of surgery is most effective for the correction of IXT 555 
and the debate has long been related to differentiation between IXT sub -types.  Based on 556 
distance -near angle disparity, IXT sub -types are classified  as: 1) basic (similar magnitude of 557 
misalignment at distance and near); 2) true divergence excess (larger at distance); 3) pseudo 558 
divergence excess (initially larger at distance, but near angle increases following occlusion or 559 
with addition of plus lenses at near); 4) convergence insufficiency (larger at near).  Basic and 560 
pseudo divergence excess appear to be the most common of the sub -types,6 and are also the types 561 
for which there is most disagreement regarding the optimum surgical approach.  The t wo most 562 
common procedures are bilateral lateral rectus recession (BLRrec) and unilateral lateral rectus 563 
recession combined with a medial rectus resection in the same eye (R&R).  Traditionally, 564 
BLRrec has been advocated where there is a larger distance angl e, and R&R where there is a 565 
similar angle at distance and near.7,8  A survey of American strabismus surgeons published in 566 
19909 found that the majority performed BLRrec for both basic and divergence excess types.  567 
Similarly, we found by polling our investigator group that the majority still perform a BLRrec 568 
for basic type IXT .  Nevertheless, controversy sti ll exists as to which of these surgical 569 
approaches is superior.10  Advocates of the BLRrec procedure tend to hold that surgery should be 570 
based purely on the distance angle of deviation.5,11  Proponents of R&R surgery suggest 571 
resection of the medial rectus best addresses the exodeviation at near.7,12   572 
 573 
The proposed advantage of the R&R procedure is that resecting the medial rectus, with a 574 
possible longer term initial overcorrection, is necessary for a stable and superior long -term 575 
outcome.  Nevertheless, those who fav or the BLRrec procedure suggest that the more profound 576 
and prolonged initial overcorrection occurring with R&R is not only unnecessary, but may in 577 
fact be harmful.  A persistent overcorrection may be associated with the development of 578 
diplopia, amblyopia, and loss of stereoacuity.  On the other hand, critics of the BLRrec 579 
procedure suggest that long -term recurrence rates are high er.  Poor motor outcomes are likely to 580 
require reoperation and therefore the long -term success rates of these surgeries have public 581 
health importance in terms of cost to society.  582 
 583 
 
 Evaluating initial and long -term surgical outcomes in the proposed RCT will a nswer questions 584 
regarding the failure rates of these surgeries and also provide needed data on the potential harm 585 
of each procedure.   586 
 587 
Only one prospective randomized clinical trial addresses success rates of BLRrec versus R&R 588 
for IXT.12  After  between 12 -15 months of follow up, 82% of 17 patients  undergoing an R&R 589 
had a satisfactory outcome compared to 52% of 19 patients undergoing a BLRrec.  Nevertheless, 590 
there are some important limitations of this previous study.  The sample size was very small.  591 
The study population was a sub -group of patients with basic type IXT, excluding patients with 592 
basic IXT whose angle of deviation increased at far distance or following occlusion, thus 593 
limiting the generali zability of the results.  In addition, outcom es were assessed unmasked, 594 
potentially biasing the results.  One observational  study13 of 103 patients (90% of whom  had 595 
basic type IXT ) found 1-year success rates of 56% for BLRrec and 60% for R&R.  A 596 
retrospective study14 of 115 patients  with basic t ype IXT reported  success rates  of 69% for 597 
BLR rec and 77% for R&R after an average of 15 months o f follow up.   Other studies comparing 598 
surgery types  are limited not only by retrospective study design  but also by  inclusion of other 599 
types of exotropia, making it difficult to interpret results.  In addition, many different criteria for 600 
success are used, precluding meaningful comparison of success rates between studies.  This lack 601 
of evidence makes it very difficult to counsel parents of children with IXT regarding the likely 602 
success and complication rate of either procedure, limiting our ability to make i nformed 603 
management decisions.  Establishing the respective failure rates through the proposed study will 604 
allow physicians to offer patients the type of surgery with the highest chance of long -term 605 
success, minimizing suboptimal results and repeat surgeries .  606 
 607 
The present study is being conducted to compare the effectiveness of BLRrec with R&R for the 608 
surgical treatment of basic type and pseudo divergence excess type IXT.  609 
 610

 CHAPTER 2:  ENROLLMENT  AND RANDOMIZATION  683 
 684 
2.1 Eligibility Assessment and Informed Consent  685 
A minimum of 378 subjects (189 with basic type IXT and 189 with  pseudo divergence excess 686 
type IXT ) are expected to be enrolled for the primary cohort ( section 6. 1), with a goal to enroll 687 
an appropriate representation of minorities.  An additional 76 patients are expected to be enrolled 688 
for the secondary cohort ( section 6.3 ) during recruitment for the primary cohort.  As the 689 
enrollment goal approaches, sites will b e notified of the end date for recruitment.  Subjects who 690 
have signed an informed consent form can be randomized up until the end date, which means the 691 
expected recruitment might be exceeded.  The maximum number of randomized subjects will be 692 
474. 693 
 694 
For pat ients who appear eligible for the study following a “standard -care” or preliminary 695 
examination, the study will be discussed with the child’s parent(s) or guardian(s) (referred to 696 
subsequently as parent(s)).  Parent(s) who express an interest in the study w ill be given a copy of 697 
the informed consent form to read.  Written informed consent must be obtained from the parent 698 
prior to performing any study -specific procedures that are not part of the patient’s routine care.  699 
 700 
2.2 Eligibility and Exclusion Criteria  701 
2.2.1 Eligibility  702 
The following criteria must be met for the patient to be enrolled in the study:  703 
1. Age 3 to < 11 years  704 
2. Intermittent exotropia (manifest deviation) meeting all of the following:  705 
 Intermittent exotropia at distance OR constant exotropia at distance and either 706 
intermittent exotropia or exophoria at near  707 
 Exodeviatio n at least 10 PD at distance AND  near by PACT  708 
 Exodeviatio n at least 15 PD at distance OR near by PACT  709 
 Largest exodeviati on at distance , near OR remote distance  between 15 and 50 PD 710 
(inclusive) by PACT  711 
 Basic type or pseudo divergence excess type (as defined in section 2.3 ) 712 
3. Stereoacuity of 400 arcsec or better at near by Preschool Randot  stereotest  (better o f 2 713 
measures  if initial test shows worse than 40 arcsec ) 714 
4. Visual acuity in the worse eye 0.3 logMAR or better (20/40 by ATS HOTV for patients < 7 715 
years old or 70 letters E-ETDRS testing for patients ≥ 7 years old ) 716 
5. No hyperopia greater than +3.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye  717 
6. Patients must be wearing spectacles  or contact lenses  for at least one week  if refractive error 718 
(based on cycloplegic refraction  performed within 6 months prior to enrollment ) meets any 719 
of the following : 720 
 Myopia > -0.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye  721 
 Anisometropia > 1.00  D spherical equivalent  722 
 Astigmatism > 2.00  D in either eye  if ≤ 5 years old and > 1.50 D if > 5 years old   723 
Refractive correction for p atients meeting the above refractive error criteria must meet the 724 
following guidelines:   725 
 Anisometropia spherical equivalent must be  within 0.25  D of full correct ion. 726 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    2-3 
 
  Astigmatism cylinder must be within 0.25  D of full correction and axis must be 727 
within 5 degrees of full correction .   728 
 For hyperopia, the spherical component can be reduced at investigator discretion 729 
provid ed the reduction is symmetrical.   Prescribing any refractive correction to yield 730 
lenses that are m ore myopic  than -0.50 D spherical equivalent ( SE) is considered 731 
deliberate overminus and is not allowed at enrollment . However, prescribing no 732 
correction or prescribing less than the full cycloplegic hyperopic correction (i.e., 733 
prescribing reduced plus) is not  considered the same as overminusing for this protocol 734 
and is allowed because most patients  without intermittent exotropia and hyperopic SE 735 
refractions in this range would not typically be prescribed a refractive correction.   736 
 For myopia, the intent is to fully correct, but the spherical component can be 737 
undercorrected by investigator discretion provided the reductio n is symmetrical and 738 
results in no more than -0.50 D SE residual (i.e., uncorrected) myopia. Prescribing a 739 
correction that yields more than 0.50 D more minus  SE than the cycloplegic refraction 740 
SE is considered deliberate overminus and is not allowed  at enr ollment . 741 
Patients who have  undergone treatment with prism or deliberate overminus refractive 742 
correction (as defined above) must have discontinued prism and /or any deliberate 743 
overminus for at least one week prior to enrollment.   744 
Note that the r efractive co rrection guidelines and the requirement to wear refractive 745 
correction for at least one week apply not only to patients who require  refractive correction 746 
under the above criteria but also to any other patient who is wearing refractive correction .  747 
7. No atropi ne use within the last week  748 
8. Gestational age > 34 weeks  749 
9. Birth weight > 1500 grams  750 
10. Investigator plans to perform surgery, is willing to perform either surgical procedure, and is 751 
not planning to use adjustable sutures .  752 
11. Parent understands protocol , has agreed  to surgery,  and is willing to accept randomization to 753 
one-eye surgery or two -eye surgery  754 
12. Parent has home phone (or access to phone) and is willing to be contacted by Jaeb Center 755 
staff 756 
13. Relocation outside of area of an active PEDIG site within next 3 years is not anticipated  757 
 758 
2.2.2 Exclusion Criteria  759 
1. Coexisting vertical deviation, o blique muscle dysfunction , DVD, or A or V pattern , any of 760 
which  the investigator plans to address with  vertical transposition of horizontal rectus 761

deviations, oblique muscle dysfunction, DVD, and A  or V patterns not requiring surgery are 763 
allowed  764 
2. Limitation of ocular rota tions due to restrictive or paretic strabismus  765 
3. Craniofacial malformations affecting  the orbits  766 
4. Interocular visual acuity difference of more than  0.2 logMAR (2 lines on ATS HOTV 767 
for patients 3 to < 7 years old or 10  letters  on E-ETDRS  for patients ≥ 7 years old ) 768 
and/or investigator plans to initiate amblyopia treatment  at this time .   769 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    2-4 
 
 5. High AC/A ratio ( exclude > 6:1 by gradient method)  770 
6. Prior strabismus surgery or botulinum toxin injection  771

8. Prior intraocular or refractive surgery  773 
9. Significant  neurological impairment such as cerebral palsy.  Patients with mild speech and/or 774 
learning disabilities are eligible.  775 
10. Investigator planning to change refractive correction at this time  (if the patient is otherwise 776 
eligible, the investigator should consider prescribing refractive  correction and bringing the 777 
patient back a t a later time for enrollment) . 778 
 779 
2.3 Determination of IXT Type  780 
IXT will be classified ( see classification below ) at enrollment prior to randomization as:  781 
 Basic  Type  782 
 Pseudo Divergence Excess  Type  783 
 784 
The following types of IXT are not eligible:  785 
 True Divergence Excess  Type  786 
 Convergence Insufficiency Type  787 
 High AC/A Type  788 
 789 
Classification of IXT type will be done  as follows  (also see flowchart on next page ):   790 
 791 
Using the PACT at distance and near:  792 
 If the measured deviation at near is > 10 PD larger than at distance, the IXT is classified as 793 
convergence insufficiency type .  794 
 If the distance and near deviations are within 10 PD of one another, the IXT is classified as 795 
basic  type.   796 
 If the measured deviation at distance is > 10 PD larger than at near, +3.00 D lenses should be 797 
placed over the current correction (using  trial frames or Halberg clips ) and the deviation at 798 
near should be re -measured by the PACT.  799 
o If the angles equalize (dis tance and near within 10 PD) OR near exceeds distance by > 10 800 
PD, the +3.00 D lenses at near should be removed and -2.00 D lenses should be placed 801 
over the current correction (using  trial frames or Halberg clips ) and the deviation at 802 
distance should be re -measured.  803 
 If the distance angle with the -2.00 D lens es decreases by > 12 PD (compared to 804 
the distance measure without the -2.00 D lens es), the IXT type is classified as 805 
high AC/A type ; otherwise the IXT type is classified as pseudo divergence 806 
excess type . 807 
o If the distance angle exceeds near by > 10 PD measured with the +3.00 D lenses at near, 808 
the patient should be occluded for 45 minutes, after which the distance and near 809 
deviations should be measured again in the current refractive correction, while 810 
maint aining the dissociation .  If the near and distance deviations equalize (within 10 PD) 811 
or if near exceeds distance, the type of IXT is classified as pseudo divergence excess 812 
type.  Otherwise, the type IXT is classified as true divergence excess type . 813 
 814

  815 
2.4 Historical Information  816 
Historical information elicited will include the following: date of birth, gender, race , ethnicity, 817 
prior treatment, and spectacle correction.   In addition, investigators will be asked to provide the 818 
reason(s) for performing surgery.  819 
 820 
2.5 Examination Procedures at the Enrollment Visit  821 
1. Health -Related Quality of Life  Questionnaire : Health -related  quality of life (HRQOL) will be 822 
assessed using the Intermittent Exotropia Questionnaire (IXTQ).15  This questionnaire 823 
consists of 3 components:  824 
1. Child questionnaire (for children ages 5 years or older) – consists of 12 items which 825 
assess how the child feels about his/her eye condition.   826 
o The version for children aged 5 to < 8 years has a  three -level response scale  (not at 827 
all, sometimes, a lot)  and is adm inistered by clinical staff either verbally or using a 828 
matching card .   829 
o The version for children aged 8 years and older has a  five-level response scale 830 
(never, almost never, sometimes, often, almost always)  and is self -administered.  831 
However, it may be administered verbally by clinical staff if the child cannot read 832 
the questionnaire by him- or herself . 833 Assess deviation at distance and near by PACT

IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    2-6 
 
 o If possible, children should be positioned such that they are unable to view their 834 
parents during testing and parents should be advised not to influence their child’s 835 
responses.  836 
o Children 4 years and younger will not complete a child questionnaire.  837 
2. Parent proxy questionnaire – consists of 12 items which assess how the parent f eels the 838 
child’s eye condition affects the child.  839 
o The questionnaire has a five -level response scale (never, almost never, sometimes, 840 
often, almost always) and is self -administered.   841 
3. Parental questionnaire – consists of 17 items which assess how the child’ s eye condition 842 
affects the parent.  843 
o The questionnaire has a five -level response scale (never, almost never, sometimes, 844 
often, almost always) and is self -administered.   845 
2. Stereoacuity Testing : stereoacuity will be assessed in current refractive correction  using the 846 
following:  847 
 Preschool Randot stereotest at near  (performed at 40 cm) : If stereoacuity is worse than 40 848 
arcsec, it must be retested and the  better of the 2 mea surements  will be used  for 849 
eligibility . 850 
 Distance Randot stereotest (performed at 3 meters)  851 
 Titmus Fly & Circles stereotest  at near (performed at 40 cm) (note: Animals are not 852 
tested)  853 
Stereoacuity should be tested  before any other clinical testing .  If stereoacuity is not tested 854 
first, the patient must take a 1 0 minute break following any  dissociative testing (e.g. , visual 855 
acuity or ocular alignment) prior to testing stereoacuity.    856 
3. Control of exodeviation : Control of exodeviation will be measured in current refractive 857 
correction at distance and near using the Office Control Score .16  858 
 Distance ( 6 meters )  - fixating  on an accommodative target such as a video for younger 859 
children or  reading optotype letter s for older children  860 
 Near (1/3 meter – fixating  on Lang -near viewing stick or similar accommodative target)  861 
 862 
The scale below applies to both dis tance and near.  863 
Intermittent Exotropia Control Scale16 864 
5 = Constan t Exotropia  865 
4 = Exotropia > 50% of the 30 -second period before dissociation  866 
3 = Exotropia < 50% of the 30 -second period before dissociation  867 
2 = No exotropia unless dissociated, recovers in > 5 seconds  868 
1 = No exotropia unless dissociated, recovers in 1 -5 seconds  869 
0 = No exotropia unless dissociated, recovers in < 1 second (phoria)  870 
 871 
 Levels 5 to 3 are assessed during a 30 -second period of observation first at distance 872 
fixation and then assessed at near fixation for another 30 -second period.  873 
 If no exotropia is observed during the 30 -second period of observation, l evels 2 to 0 are 874 
then graded as the worst of three rapidly successive trials:  875 
1. An occluder is placed over the right eye for 10 seconds and then removed, 876 
measuring the length of time it takes for fusion t o become re -established.  877 
2. The left eye is then occluded for a 10 -second period and the time to re -establish 878 
fusion is similarly measured.  879 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    2-7 
 
 3. A third trial of 10 -second occlusion is performed, covering the eye that required the 880 
longest time to re -fuse.  881 
 The wors e level of control observed following the three 10 -second periods of occlusion 882 
should be recorded .  If the patient has a micro -esotropia by SPCT but an exodeviation by 883 
PACT, the scale applies to the exodeviation.  884 
 Testing of control must be performed by a p ediatric ophthalmologist, pediatric 885 
optometrist, or a certified orthoptist.  886 
 Testing must be done prior to dissociati ve testing  or at least 10 minutes after such testing . 887 
4. Ocular alignment testing :  888 
 Strabismic deviations will be assessed in current refractiv e correction  (either spectacles , 889 
contact lenses , or a trial frame) by the cover/uncover test and then measured with the 890 
Simultaneous Prism and Cover Test (SPCT) (if tropia is of sufficient duration to 891 
measure) and Prism and Alternate Cover Test (PACT) in p rimary position at near (1/3 892 
meter) , distance ( 6 meters) and remote distance (at least 50 feet, e.g. , out the window or 893 
down a long hallway) (PACT only) as outlined in the IXT Testing Procedures Manual . 894 
 The deviation will be recorded as constant  if a manifest tropia is present 100% of the time 895 
during the examination, determined by at least 3 cover/uncover tests (one must be before 896 
any dissociation), or as intermittent  if a manifest tropia is present (including after 897 
dissociation) but not 100% of the time  during the entire exam .  The magnitude of the 898 
deviation may change (vary) independently of the frequency of the deviation; frequency 899 
of tropia (constant vs. intermittent) is determined solely by whether the manifest tropia is 900 
present all or some of the time , including after dissociation .  If a tropia is not observed at 901 
any time but a phoria is present, then the deviation will be recorded as not tropic (phoric 902 
only).  If no deviation is present at any time, ‘no deviation’ will be recorded.   903 
o If the  child appears to have a constant tropia but shows excellent stereoacuity that 904 
may be inconsistent with the diagnosis of constant tropia, the examiner should look 905 
over the child’s polarized glasses to determine whether the child is indeed 906 
constantly tropic  (by direct observation by cover/uncover test).  907 
 The deviating eye will be recorded as "right", "left", or "alternates."  908 
 Testing will be performed following control of exodeviation testing and prior to any 909 
cycloplegia.  910 
 Ocular motility will be assessed inclu ding: ductions, oblique muscle  dysfunctions , 911 
dissociated vertical deviations, and nystagmus . 912 
 Ocular alignment testing must be performed by a pediatric ophthalmologist, pediatric 913 
optometrist, or certified orthoptist.  914 
5. Visual Acuity Testing : Visual acuity tes ting will be done with current refractive correction  915 
without cycloplegia by a certified examiner with the Electronic Visual Acuity tester (EVA) 916 
using the ATS single surround HOTV protocol for patients < 7 years old and using the E - 917 
ETDRS for patients ≥ 7 years old.  The protocol for conducting the visual acuity testing is 918 
described in the ATS Testing Procedures Manual.  For each patient, t he same visual acuity 919 
testing protocol used at enrollment will be used throughout the study.    920 
6. Ocular Examination  as per investigator’s clinical routine (if not performed within 6 months)  921 
7. Cycloplegic Refraction  (if not performed within 6 months)  922 
 If refractive error as measured by cycloplegic refraction meets any of the following , then  923 
the patient must be  wearing spec tacles or contact lenses for at least a week : 924 
o Myopia > -0.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye  925 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    2-8 
 
 o Anisometropia > 1.00  D spherical equivalent  926 
o Astigmatism  > 2.00  D astigmatism in either eye  if ≤ 5 years old and > 1.50 D if > 5 927 
years old   928 
 929 
2.6 Randomization  930 
Randomization will be done on the day  of surgery  or the working day before surgery , to 931 
minimize potential treatment -group -related patient withdrawals between randomization and 932 
surgery .  933 
 934 
Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized (1:1) to receive surgical correction of their IXT 935 
by one of the 2 following surgical procedures:  936 
1. Bilateral lateral rectus recession s (BLRrec)  937 
2. Unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection  (R&R)  - a unilateral lateral 938 
rectus recession combined with a medi al rectus resection in the same eye .  Choice of eye at 939 
investigator discretion based on any interocular difference, position under anesthesia, fixation 940 
preference, or forced duction testing.  Reason for choice of eye  will be recorded.  941 
 942 
The Jaeb Center will  construct a separate Master Randomization List using a permuted block 943 
design stratified by site  and cohort type (patients with basic type IXT with baseline angle size 944 
15-40 PD , patients with pseudo divergence excess type IXT with baseline angle size 15 -40 PD, 945 
all other patients)  which will specify the order of treatment group assignments .  A patient is 946 
officially enrolled when the website randomization process is completed.  947 
 948 
Patients in whom the magnitude of the largest of the most recent distance, near, and remote 949 
distance angles has decreased  to <15 PD or increased  to >50 PD before surgery will be dropped 950 
from the study if they have not yet been randomized.  If such patients  have already been 951 
randomized, it is at investigator discretion  whether to perform  surgery and what type of surgical 952 
method to perform (i.e. BLR rec, R&R, or any other type of procedure).     953 
 954 
Patients not randomized within 12 months of enrollment will be dropped from the study.   955 
 956 
2.7 Repeat Enrollment Visit  957 
If surgery is delayed for any rea son to a date more than 60 days from the enrollment visit, the 958 
visit must be repeated.  All examination procedures listed in section 2.5  must be repeated at this 959 
visit.  For surgeries occurring within 60 days of enrollment, the investigator has the option of 960 
repeating  the alignment measurements prior to surgery —if repeated , the measurement  used to 961 
determine surgical dose  will be recorded on the Randomization Form . 962 
 963 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    3-1 
 
 CHAPTER 3:  SURGICAL TREATMENT  964 
 965 
3.1 Surgery Timing  966 
Once randomized, the investigator is required to perform the assigned surgery type the same day 967 
or the next working day.   968 
 969 
In the rare case that surgery is cancelled after randomization, surgery should be rescheduled 970 
within 60 days.  For surgeries occurring within 60 days of enrollment, the investigator has the 971 
option of repeating  the alignment measurements prior to surgery.  If surgery is not performed 972 
within 60 days, the enrollment exam must be repeated ( section 2. 7).  973 
 974 
If a patient  has been rando mized but the magnitude of the  largest of the  most recent  distance, 975 
near, and remote distance angles has decreased to <15 PD or inc reased to >50 PD before  surgery, 976 
it is at investigator discretion  whether to perform surgery and  what type of surgical method to 977 
perform (i.e. , BLR rec, R&R, or any other type of procedure).     978 
 979 
If a patient has been randomized , even if surgery is not performed, the patient will remain in the 980 
study and will complete all follow -up visits between 6 months and 3 years  from randomization . 981 
 982 
3.2 Surgical Treatment  983 
Each patient is randomly assigned to one of the two surgical procedures . 984 
1. Bilateral lateral rectus recession s (BLRrec)  985 
2. Unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection  (R&R) – a unilateral 986 
lateral rectus recession combined with a medial rectus resection in the same eye .  Choice 987 
of eye is at investigator discretion based on any interocular difference, position under 988 
anesthesia, fixation preference, or forced duction testing.  Reason for choice of eye will 989 
be recorded.  990 
 991 
3.3 Surgical Dose  992 
The magnitude of deviation for which to perform surgery will be the largest preoperative 993 
deviation  recorded at near, distance , or remote  distance fixation  by PACT .  Data on this 994 
deviation  will be entered on the Randomization Form. The recommended surgical doses are 995 
listed in Table 1 and Table 2,  and will be generated as part of the randomization report .  For 996 
reces sions, the measurement of surgical dose should be made  from the insertion of the muscle  997 
after muscle disinsertion .  For resections, the measurement of surgical dose should be made from 998 
the insertion of the muscle prior to muscle disinsertion .  Surgeons may adjust the surgical dose 999 
within 1.0 mm for each muscle at their discretion to account for individual patient variables, such 1000  
as lateral incomitance and age.   1001  
 1002  
Hangback , hemi -hangback, and adjustable technique s will not be allowed for this pro tocol, 1003  
however, the surgeon may make epi-scleral tickbite s at the intended insertion site and then bring 1004  
the sutures forward to take a standard scleral bite at the original insertion site .  1005  
 1006  
The target deviation, actual surgical dose , and any reasons for d eparture from the recommended  1007  
dose tables will be recorded  on the Surgery Form .  Any complications during surgery will be 1008  
recorded.  1009

 CHAPTER 4:  FOLLOW -UP 1019  
 1020  
4.1 Treatment  1021  
Initial treatment consists of the random ly-assigned surgery as described in chapter 3.  1022  
 1023  
Following the surgery, nonsurgical treatment of any overcorrection, undercorrection, or 1024  
deviations associated with diplopia is at investigator discretion  at any time during the study , with 1025  
the following  stipulation :  1026  
 If at the 8 week visit a constant esotropia at least 6 PD by SPCT at distance  and near is 1027  
present, the condition must be managed with prism (section 4.4.1 ).  1028  
 1029  
Reoperation or treatment with botulinum toxin is not permitted during the first 6 months  1030  
following surgery .  After the 6 -month exam, a patient may undergo reoperation or treatment with 1031  
botulinum toxin only after criteria for surgical failure are met ( section 4. 5.1). 1032  
 1033

IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    4-3 
 
 Any additional post-surgical  complications  which have  been recognized since the 1 -week visit  1110  
will be recorded.   1111  
 1112  
4.4.1 Management of Esotropia  and Diplopia  at the 8 -week Exam 1113  
At the 8 -week exam:  1114  
 Constant e sotropia at least 6 PD by SPCT at distance AND  near must be ma naged with prism 1115  
(either ground -in or Fresnel Press -On Optics ; however , the study will only provide temporary 1116  
press -on prisms ).  The amount of prism prescribed should be the minimum amount of prism 1117  
needed to neutralize the angle.  At each subsequent visit, an attempt should be made to 1118  
reduce or discontinue prism.  Despite initiat ion of treatment  with prism , patients will not be 1119  
considered a surgical failure at the 8 -week exam.  1120  
o Treatment of any esotropia greater than 6 PD that cannot be managed with prism 1121  
should be discussed with the protocol chair.   If a second surgical treatment is 1122  
considered, this should be discussed with the protocol chair.  1123  
 Any other esotropia , exotropia,  or diplopia can be managed with nonsurgical treatment at 1124  
investigator’s discretion (section 4.1 ).   1125  
 1126  
4.5 Masked Exams at Six -month  Intervals from Six Months to 3  Years  1127  
The six masked exams are timed every 6 months from randomization as foll ows:  1128  
 6 months ± 1 month after randomization  1129

 1135  
Prior to the patient’s examination , spectacle correction will be verified using a lensometer .  For 1136  
patients wearing cont act lenses, a dry over -refraction (i.e. , noncycloplegic retinoscopy) should be 1137  
performed.  1138  
 1139  
At these visits, the following testing procedures will occur  in the specified order :  1140  
1. Health -related quality of life questionnaires  (6-month and 3 -year visits only)  1141  
2. Stereoacuity (masked) - stereoacuity will be assessed in current refractive correction , with 1142  
prism if applicable,  using the following  as in section 2.5  and 4.5.2 :   1143

Testing must be performed in current refractive correction.   1148  
 If prism is currently prescribed, stereoacuity testing should be performed with prism.   1149  
 If deliberate overminus is currently prescribed, stereoacuity testing should be 1150  
performed with the overminus correction.  1151  
In the case of a protocol testing order violation, stereoacuity should be performed 10 1152  
minutes after any dissociation.  1153  
3. Control of exodeviation : Control of exodeviation will be measured at distance (6 meters) and 1154  
near (1/3 meter) using the Office Control Score16 as described in section 2.5.  1155  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    4-4 
 
  Testing must be performed in current refractive correction.   1156  
 If prism is currently prescribed, te sting should be performed without prism.   1157  
 If deliberate overminus is currently prescribed, testing should be performed in trial 1158  
frames without the overminus component of the prescription but which correct the 1159  
remaining refractive error to within study gui delines.   1160  
4. Ocular alignment  (masked)  in the primary position using cover/uncover,  SPCT  (if tropia is of 1161  
sufficient duration to measure) , and PACT, at both distance (6 meters) and near (1/3 meter) 1162  
fixation s (section s 2.5 and 4.5.2 ). 1163  
 Testing must be performed in current refractive correction.   1164  
 If prism is currently prescribed, ocular alignment testing should be performed without 1165  
prism.   1166  
 If deliberate overminus is currently prescribed, ocular alignment testing should be 1167  
performed in t rial frames without the overminus component of the prescription but 1168  
which correct the remaining refractive error to within study guidelines.   1169  
 Testing must be performed without cycloplegia.  1170  
5. Retesting of stereoacuity and /or ocular alignment to confirm surgi cal failure (masked) (if 1171  
required)   1172  
o If any of the surgical failure criteria appear to be met ( section 4.5.1 ) based on initial 1173  
testing, the criterion met will be retested by a masked examiner (section 4.5.2) .   1174  
o All retesting should be performed at least 10  minutes after the initial ocular 1175  
alignment testing.   1176  
6. Visual acuity  in current refractive correction  (without prism if worn) by the same testing 1177  
method used at enrollment  1178  
 Testing must be performed in current refractive correction.   1179  
 If prism is currently prescribed, visual acuity testing should be performed with 1180  
prism.   1181  
 If deliberate overminus is currently prescribed, visual acuity testing should be 1182  
performed with the overminus correction.  1183  
 If visual acuity is found to be reduced by 0.2 log MAR  from the previous visit and the 1184  
patient is wearing a Fresnel  prism , visual acuity should be retested  in trial frames.  1185  
 If visual acuity is found to be reduced by 0.2 logMAR or more ( 2 lines or 10 letters)  1186  
from the previous visit (after removal of Fresnel prism if applicable) , a cycloplegic 1187  
refraction must be performed and visual acuity retested in  current  refractive 1188  
correction based on the cycloplegic refraction . 1189  
7. Cycloplegic refraction  if not performed within the last 12 months   1190

In addition, the following will be recorded:  1193  
 Any nonsurgical treatment  of exotropia, esotropia  or symptomatic diplopia (e.g., prism)  1194  
 Any treatment of amblyopia  [interocular visual acuity difference  of more than 0.2 1195  
logMAR (2 lines on ATS HOTV or 10 letters  on E-ETDRS ) and worse eye acuity of 1196  
worse than 0.3 logMAR  (20/40 on ATS HOTV or 70 letters on E -ETDRS ] 1197  
 Any c hange in refractive correction  1198  
 1199

IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    4-5 
 
  Nonsurgical treatment of any overcorrection, undercorrection, or deviations associated 1201  
with diplopia is at investigator discretion.   1202  
 If any of the surgical failure criteria are met  (section 4.5.1 ), the investigator may elect to 1203  
reoperate ( section  4.7).  If no ne of the  surgical failure criteria are met, the investigator 1204  
should not reoperate . 1205  
 1206  
All patients should continue in follow up through 3 -years, regardless of whether they undergo 1207  
reoperation.   1208  
 1209  
4.5.1 Surgical Failure Criteria  1210  
Patients will be considered a surgical failure if at any visit occurring 6  months or later any of the 1211  
following failure criteria are present  by masked exam iner testing (section 4.5.2) *:  1212  
1. Exotropia at distance OR near at any time during the exam (i.e., can be constant or 1213  
intermittent ; determined by a cover/uncover test) with a magnitude of at least  10 PD by 1214  
SPCT, confirmed by a retest   1215  
2. Constant esotropia at distance OR near (determined by at least 3  cover/uncover test s—one 1216  
must be before any dissociation ) with a magnitude of at least 6 PD by SPCT, confirmed by  a 1217  
retest  1218  
3. Decrease in Preschool Randot near stereoacuity at least 2 octaves ( at least 0.6 log arcsec) ( see 1219  
Table 3) from the enrollment measurement , or to nil , confirmed by a retest  1220  
 1221  
Table  3: Prescho ol Randot  Stereotest  1222  
 
Baseline Stereoacuity, in arcsec  Level needed at follow up  visit to meet 
surgical failure criteria, in arcsec  
40” 200”  or worse  
60” 400”  or worse  
100”  400”  or worse  
200”  800”  or worse  
400”  Nil 
 1223  
*Note that both the initial testing and the retest must be performed by a masked examiner 1224  
(section 4.5.2 ).  If a patient appears to have met one or more of the above surgical failure criteria 1225  
but the retest(s) do not confirm that at least one criterion  is met, the patient is not  considered to 1226  
be a surgical failure.  1227  
 1228  
Patients will also be considered a surgical failure if they undergo a second surgery or treatment 1229  
with botulinum toxin  at any  time during the study.   1230  
 1231  
All patients will continue to return for all protocol -specified follow -up exams regardless of 1232  
whether surgical failure criteria are met.  1233  
 1234  
4.5.2 Masked Examiner Testing   1235  
Stereoacuity and o cular alignment  testing at the visit must be performed  by a masked examiner.  1236  
 1237  
If retesting is needed,  retesting should be performed at least 10 minutes after the initial ocular 1238  
alignment testing.   1239  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    4-6 
 
  First, if the surgical failure criterion related to a drop in Preschool Randot stereoacuity at 1240  
near appears to be met  (section 4.5.1 ); the masked examiner will retest Preschool Randot 1241  
stereoacuity at near.  1242  
 Second, if  either of the surgical failure criteri a related to presence of a tropia appear to be 1243  
met ( section 4.5.1 ), the masked examiner will retest cover/uncover testing  and SPCT at 1244  
distance and near (if tropia is of sufficient duration to measure).  1245  
 1246  
Because this examiner must be  masked to the patient’ s treatment group , the masked examiner 1247  
must be someone other than the investigator/ surgeon . 1248  
 1249  
4.5.3 Patients Wearing Prism and/or  Deliberate Overminus at 3 -Years   1250  
In addition to the assessments listed in section 4.5, at the 3 -year masked exam only , patients who 1251  
are currently prescribed prism and/or deliberate overminus will have Preschool Randot 1252  
Stereoacuity at near repeated  in curr ent refractive correction  but without prism or overminus.  1253  
This additional Preschool Randot retest without prism and without overminus should occur after 1254  
all initial stereoacuity testing has been completed (ie. after the Titmus Fly at near) and before the 1255  
control of exodeviation assessment. This testing without prism and overminus is for an 1256  
exploratory analysis only (section 6.3.1) and is not considered in determining whether the patient 1257  
meets surgical failure criteria for the primary analysis.        1258  
 1259  
4.6 Addit ional Visits  1260  
Investigators may schedule additional visits at their own discretion.  If the investigator feels the 1261  
patient has met surgical failure criteria, then he/she  must arrange a masked examiner testing 1262  
(section 4. 5.2) to confirm surgical failure crit eria before performing additional surgery .  If the 1263  
masked e xam does not confirm that the surgical failure criteria have  been met, additional surgery 1264  
should not  be performed.   1265  
 1266  
The patient will continue to follow the regular follow -up exam schedule following this additional 1267  
visit.  1268  
 1269  
4.7 Re-operation  1270  
Re-operations of IXT and treatment with botulinum toxin for IXT are allowed during the study 1271  
after completion of the first 6 -month follow -up exam, if the patient meets the surgical failure 1272  
criteria at any foll ow-up exam 6 months or later (see section 4. 5.1).  The exception is patients 1273  
with non -manageable esotropia following the 8 -week exam  who may require a second surgery 1274  
before the 6 -month exam.  Any reoperation or botulinum toxin treat ment  prior to the 6 -mont h 1275  
exam must be discussed with the protocol chair .  All patients undergoing either surgery a second 1276  
time or treatment with botulinum toxin will be considered a surgical failure for the primary 1277  
analysis.  The reason for the re -operation  or botulinum toxin treatment must be recorded and the 1278  
patient will continue to return for all protocol -specified follow -up exams . 1279  
 1280  
4.8 Treatment of Amblyopia  1281  
Treatment of amblyopia is allowed at investigator discretion at any time during follow up if a 1282  
patie nt has an interocular difference of visual acuity more than 0.2 logMAR (2 lines on ATS 1283  
HOTV or 10  letters  on E-ETDRS ) with a worse eye visual acuity of worse than  0.3 logMAR 1284  
(20/40 on HOTV or  70 letters  on E-ETDRS) .  The method of treatment is at investigator 1285  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    4-2 
 
 discretion but cannot include atropine  or overplus  spectacle lenses .  Any a mblyopia treatment 1286  
will be recorded.  1287  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    5-1 
 
 CHAPTER 5:  MISCELLANEOUS CONSID ERATIONS IN FOLLOW -UP 1288  
 1289  
5.1 Contacts by the Jaeb Center for H ealth Research  1290  
The Jaeb Center will maintain direct contact with the parents of each patient  at least 2 times per 1291  
year.  Permission for such contacts will be included in the Informed Consent Form.  The 1292  
principal purpose of the contacts will be to develop and maintain rapport with the patient and/or 1293  
family and to help coordinate scheduling of the outcome examination s.  Additional contacts will 1294  
be made if necessary for the scheduling of follow -up visits.  1295  
 1296  
5.2 Patient Withdrawals  1297  
A patient (and respective parent)  may withdraw from the study at any time.  This is expected to 1298  
be a very infrequent occurrence in view of the study design’s similarity to routine clinical 1299  
practice.  If the patient or parent indicates that they want to withdraw from the study, the 1300  
investi gator personally should attempt to speak with them to determine the reason.  If their 1301  
interest is in transferring their care to another eye care provider, every effort should be made to 1302  
comply with this and at the same time try to keep the patient in the s tudy under the new 1303  
provider’s care.  1304  
 1305  
5.3 Management of Refractive Error  1306  
A cycloplegic refraction should be performed every 12 months.  In addition, a refraction should 1307  
be performed whenever the investigator suspects that refractive error may not be optimally 1308  
corrected.  1309  
 1310  
For patients whose refractive error meets criteria for requiring a refractive correction ( section  1311  
5.3.1), the correction prescribed should meet the refractive  correction guidelines ( section 5 .3.2).  1312  
 1313  
For patients whose refractive error does not  meet the criteria for a required correction ( section 1314  
5.3.1), it is at investigator discretion whether to prescribe correction ; however, if refractive 1315  
correction is prescribed, it should meet the refractive correction guidelines (section 5 .3.2). 1316  
 1317  
5.3.1 Refractiv e Error Requiring Correction   1318  
The following are the criteria for requiring refractive error correction:  1319  
 Myopia > -0.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye  1320  
 Hyperopia > + 3.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye  1321  
 Anisometropia > 1.00 D spherical equivalent  1322  
 Astigmatism in either eye > 2.00 D if ≤ 5 years old and > 1.50 D if > 5 years old  1323  
 1324  
5.3.2 Refractive Correction Guidelines  1325  
The following are the guidelines for refractive correction which apply to patients meeting criteria 1326  
for requiring refractive error correctio n (section 5. 3.1) and to any other patient wearing refractive 1327  
correction.   1328  
 Anisometropia spherical equivalent must be within 0.25  D of full correct ion.  1329  
 Astigmatism cylinder must be within 0.25  D of full corre ction and axis must be within 5 1330  
degrees of full correction .   1331  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    5-2 
 
  The spherical component can be reduced by investigator discretion provided the reduction is 1332  
symmetrical and results in residual (i.e., uncorrected) spherical equivalent refractive error 1333  
that does not exceed  +3.50D hyperopia o r -0.50 D myopia.  1334  
 1335  
The study will not pay for spectacles required at enrollment, but will pay for lens changes and/or 1336  
new spectacles which are needed during follow up to keep the correction within the study 1337  
guidelines (section 5.3).   All other new spectacles and/or lens changes will not be paid for by the 1338  
study, as they are part of normal care.  The study will not pay for contact lenses.  1339  
 1340  
5.4 Risks  1341  
There are no risks involved in this study that would not be part of usual care.   1342  
 1343  
5.4.1 Risks of Examination Procedures  1344  
The procedures in this study are part of routine eye care practice in the United States and as part 1345  
of this study they pose no additional known risks.  1346  
 1347  
5.4.2 Risks of Surg ery 1348  
All surgical procedures are standard care.  The risks of surgery  in this study are no different than 1349  
surgery performed outside of the study.  1350  
 1351  
There is a very rare risk of death  (less than 1 in 100,000) , there is a very rare risk of loss of 1352  
vision, and there is a risk of overcorrection or undercorrection which could  require subsequent 1353  
surgeries.  1354  
 1355  
5.4.3 Risk Assessment  1356  
It is the investigators’ opinion that the protocol’s level of risk falls under DHHS 46.404 which is 1357  
research not involving greater than minimal risk.   1358  
 1359  
5.5 Reporting of Adverse Events  1360  
Each site is responsible for informing its IRB of serious treatment -related adverse events and for 1361  
abiding by any other reporting requirements specific to his or her IRB.  Data on the 1362  
complications of the study treatments will be tabulated regularly by the  Coordinating Center for 1363  
review by the Steering Committee.  Serious complications will be reported expeditiously to the 1364  
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which will receive a full adverse event report semi - 1365  
annually.  Following each DSMC data review, a summary will be provided to IRBs.  1366  
 1367  
5.6 Discontinuation of Study  1368  
The study may be discontinued by the Steering Committee (with approval of the Data and Safety 1369  
Monitoring Committee) prior to the preplanned completion of enrollment and follow -up for all 1370  
patients . 1371  
 1372  
5.7 Travel Reimbursement  1373  
The parent /guardian  of each patient will be compensated $30 per visit for completion of each 1374  
protocol -specified follow -up visit, for a maximum of $2 40.  If there are extenuating 1375  
circumstances, and the patient is unable to complete study visits without additional funds due to 1376  
travel costs, additional funds may be provided.  1377  
 1378  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    5-3 
 
 5.8 Study Costs  1379  
The subject or his/her insurance will be responsible for the costs that are considered standard 1380  
care.  This includes the initial examination, all fol low up visits, all surgical procedures, and all 1381  
costs involved in managing surgical complications.  1382  
  1383  
The study will not pay for spectacles required at enrollment, but will pay for lens changes and/or 1384  
new spectacles which are needed during follow up to keep  the correction within the study 1385  
guideline s (section 5.3).   All other new spectacles and/or  lens changes will not be paid for by the 1386  
study, as they are part of normal care.  The study will not pay for contact lenses.  1387  
 1388  
The study will provide  temporary press -on prisms and spectacles to mount the prism (if needed 1389  
and the patient isn’t wearing glasses).  1390

 CHAPTER 6:  SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATI ON AND STATISTICAL A NALYSIS  1392  
 1393  
The approach to sample size and statistical analyses are summarized below.  A detaile d statistical 1394  
analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to the completion of the study.  The analysis plan 1395  
synopsis in this chapter contains the framework of the anticipated final analysis plan.  1396  
 1397  
6.1 Primary Data Analysis   1398  
The primary analysis cohort consists of patients whose largest exodeviation by PACT at 1399  
distance , near, or remote distance  at the enrollment exam is between 15 and 40 PD inclusive.  1400  
 1401  
The primary analysis will be a treatment group comparison of the proportion of patients with 1402  
surgical failure by 3 years  (section 6.1.1.) .The primary analysis is stratified by IXT type (basic 1403  
type and pseudo divergence excess type).  1404  
 1405  
The cumulative proportion of patients meeting criteria for failure by 3 years will be obtained 1406  
using the Kaplan -Meier method  and compared between treatment groups using the Z test .  This 1407  
will allow patients who drop out prior to 3 years to contribute to the estimation of the proportion 1408  
of surgical failure at 3 years.  In this analysis, all patients who meet surgical failure criteria prior 1409  
to 3 years will be counted as failures at the first visit at which surgical failure criteria are met.  1410  
The primary analysis will follow the intent -to-treat principle.   1411  
 1412  
6.1.1 Classification of Outcome  1413  
At the 3 -year visit, each patient’s c ondition will be classified as either surgical failure, success, 1414  
or indeterminate as follows:  1415  
 1416  
Failure  = ANY of the following criteria are met at a visit 6 months or later:   1417  
1. Exotropia at distance OR near at any time during the exam (i.e. , can be constant or 1418  
intermittent; determined by a cover/uncover test) with a magnitude of at least  10 PD by 1419  
SPCT, confirmed by a retest   1420  
2. Constant esotropia at distance OR near (determined by at least 3 cover/uncover tests — 1421  
one must be before any dissociation) with a magnit ude of at least 6 PD by SPCT, 1422  
confirmed by a retest  1423  
3. Decrease in Preschool Randot near stereoacuity at least 2 octaves ( at least 0.6 log arcsec) 1424  
(see Table 3) from the enrollment measurement, or to nil, confirmed by a retest  1425  
4. Reoperation or treatment with b otulinum toxin  1426  
 1427  
Success  = ALL of the following criteria are met at the 3 -year visit:  1428  
1. Exodeviation less than 10 PD (tropia or phoria) by PACT at distance and ne ar and 1429  
reduction of more than 10 PD from largest of distance and near angles at enrollment  1430  
2. Esotro pia less than 6 PD  at distance and near  by SPCT  1431  
3. No decrease in Preschool Randot stereoacuity of 2 or more octaves from the enrollment 1432  
stereoacuity and no drop to nil  1433  
4. No reoperation or treatment with botulinum toxin  1434  
5. No non -surgical treatment for IXT during  the study  1435  
 1436  
Indeterminate  = ALL of the following criteria are met at the 3 -year visit:  1437  
1. Patient meets one or more of the following:  1438  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    6-2 
 
  Exophoria >=10PD by PACT at distance or near   1439  
 Exodeviation less than 10PD by PACT at distance and near but no reduction of more 1440  
than 10 PD from largest of distance and near angles at enrollment  1441  
 Intermittent esotropia or esophoria >=6PD at distance and/or near  1442  
2. No decrease in Preschool Randot stereoacuity of 2 or more octaves from the enrollment 1443  
stereoacuity or a drop to nil  1444  
3. No reoperation or treatment with botulinum toxin  1445  
 1446  
6.2 Secondary Data Analysis  1447  
All secondary analyses will be conducted on the primary cohort  and stratified by IXT type . 1448  
 1449  
6.2.1 Subgroup Analyses  1450  
A secondary analysis will assess whether the treatment group difference  in the proportion of 1451  
patients with surgical failure by 3 years varies in subgroups based on baseline factors .  1452  
Interpretation of subgroup analyses will depend on whether the overall analysis demonstrates a 1453  
significant treatment group difference .  Subgroup  analyses will be interpreted with caution , 1454  
particularly in the absence of an ove rall treatment group difference.  1455  
 1456  
The primary subgroups of interest are baseline monofixation status as determined using Titmus 1457  
stereoacuity data, baseline monofixation status  determined as using Preschool Randot 1458  
stereoacuity data, and age.  Other baseline factors which will be assessed in exploratory 1459  
subgroup analysis are prior treatment, near stereoacuity, distance stereoacuity, control of IXT, 1460  
whether a constant exotropia wa s present at distance , and quality of life .  In accordance with NIH 1461  
guidelines, a subgroup analysis of treatment efficacy according to gender, as well as 1462  
race/ethnicity, will also be conducted.   1463  
 1464  
The general approach for subgroup analyses will be to determine the proportion of patients with 1465  
surgical failure for each treatment group within each subgroup , using the same method as for the 1466  
primary analysis .  Factors showing evidence of interaction with tre atment effect will be formally 1467  
assessed by including an interaction term in a Cox proportional hazards model that includes  the 1468  
factor .  In general, power will be low for formally detecting interactions unless the interaction is 1469  
very large.  1470  
 1471  
6.2.2 Surgic al Failu re Proportion at 3 Year Timepoint   1472  
The binomial propor tion of patients who m eet surgical failure criteria at the 3 year visit  (as 1473  
opposed to by the 3 year visit) will be estimated for each treatment group and  compared using 1474  
Fisher’s exact test.   1475  
 1476  
Patients who do not return for the 3 year visit will not be included in the analysis, including 1477  
patients who met surgical failure criteria at an intermediate visit.  Patients who complete the visit 1478  
will be classified based on their status at 3 years, regar dless of whether they met surgical failure 1479  
criteria at an earlier timepoint, unless they have been re -operated (or treated with botulinum 1480  
toxin), in which case they will be classified as a surgical failure.  1481  
 1482  
The potential for bias in the  treatment group co mparison is recognized .  Once a patient has met  1483  
the clinical criteria for surgical failure criteria at an interim follow up visit, the decision to 1484  
reoperate —and thus permanently classify the patient as a surgical failure for the analysis  at 3 1485  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    6-3 
 
 years —is at the discret ion of an unmasked investigator and therefore could be related to 1486  
treatment group.   To assist in assessing f or potential bias, the extent to which treatment group is 1487  
related to the decision to reoperate will be evaluated .   1488  
 1489  
6.2.3 Success Proportion at 3 Year Timepoint  1490  
The estimated proportion of patients who meet criteria for ‘success’ at the 3 -year outcome exam 1491  
(section 6.1.1) will be calculated  and compared between treatment groups  using a Fisher’s exact 1492  
test.  A 95% confidence interval on the diffe rence of proportions between the two groups also 1493  
will be calculated.   1494  
 1495  
The potential for bias in th is treatment group comparison is recognized.  Once a patient has met 1496  
the clinical criteria for surgical failure criteria at an interim follow up v isit, the decision to 1497  
reoperate —and thus prevent the patient from being classified as a success for the 3 year 1498  
analysis —is at the discretion of an unmasked investigator and therefore could be related to 1499  
treatment group.   To assist in assessing for potential bias, the extent to which treatment group is 1500  
related to the decision to reoperate will be evaluated.   1501  
 1502  
6.2.4 Analysis of Secondary  Outcomes  1503  
Additional s econdary analyses will be performed to assess whether treatment group di fferences 1504  
exist  for secondary outcomes : near stereoacuity, distance stereoacuity, monofixation status as 1505  
determined using Titmus stereoacuity data, monofixation status determined as using Preschool 1506  
Randot stereoacuity data, development of amb lyopia, and qu ality of life.  1507  
 1508  
6.3 Exploratory Analyses  1509  
6.3.1              Exploratory Analyses in Primary Cohort  1510  
Exploratory analyses will be stratified by IXT type and conducted in the primary cohort (i.e.  1511  
patients whose largest angle by PACT at enrollment is between 15 and 40 PD inclusive) .   1512  
 1513  
As exploratory analyses, t he primary analysis comparing failure proportions by 3 years (section 1514  
6.1), the comparison of failure proportions at 3 years (6.2.2) the comparison of success 1515  
proportions at 3 years (6.2.3) will be repeated using the same outcome classification of surgical 1516  
failure, success, or indeterminate  as described section 6.1.1., with the following exception : 1517  
 At the 3 -year visit, f or patients who are currently prescribed prism and/or deliberate 1518  
overminus : the Preschool Randot at near score to be used for the outcome classification will 1519  
be the one tested without wearing prism or overminus.   If this measurement shows a  decrease 1520  
of at least 2 octaves ( at least 0.6 log arcsec) from the enrollment measurement, or to n il, to 1521  
avoid adding to testing burden and to the complexity of visits, a confirmatory retest  is not  1522  
needed  to be considered a surgical failure  for this analysis .   1523  
 1524  
 1525  
6.3.2 Exploratory Analyses in Patients with Baseline Angle > 40 to 50 PD  1526  
Additional e xploratory  analyses will be stratified by IXT type and conducted in a secondary 1527  
cohort  of patients whose largest angle by PACT at enrollment is > 40 to 50 PD .   1528  
 1529  
The proportion of pa tients with surgical failure by 3 years will be calculated and will be 1530  
compared between treatmen t groups  using  the same method as for the primary analysis . 1531  
 1532  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    6-4 
 
 6.4 Safety Analyses  1533  
Postoperative complications will be tabulated according to treatment group.   1534  
 1535  
6.5 Additional Tabulations and Analyses  1536  
The following will be tabulated according to treatment g roup:  1537  
1. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics  1538  
2. Baseline data for study completers vs. non-completers  1539  
3. Protocol deviations  1540  
 1541  
A flow chart will be constructed that accounts for all subjects .  Visit completion rates will be 1542  
tabulated according to treatment group for each visit .  The percentage of subjects with visits 1543  
completed in window, out of window, and missed for each visit will be tabulated.  1544  
 1545  
6.6 Interim Analysis  1546  
There are no plans to formally assess surgical failure at a timepoint earlier than 3  years because it 1547  
is the long -term outcome that is of clinical interest  and because t he treatment groups are 1548  
expected to differ in the timing of surgical failure  and in the criteria met for surgical failure .  1549  
Patients receiving unilateral lateral rectus re cession with medial rectus resection  (R&R) are 1550  
expected to fail earlier, due primarily to consecutive esotropia  (i.e., overcorrection)  which cannot 1551  
be managed with prism , whereas patients receiving bilateral lateral rectus recessions (BLR rec) 1552  
are expected to have better short -term motor outcomes but fail later , due primarily to  recurrence 1553  
of the intermittent exotropia  over the long term .  A treatment group comparison of failure 1554  
proportions at a timepoint before 3 years would therefore be expected to be bias ed against R&R.   1555  
 1556  
An interim analysis of partial 3 -year data is not planned because by the time 50% of the cohort 1557  
has 3 -year data, recruitment will have ended and all patients will have had surgery.  1558  
 1559  
6.7 Sample Size Estimation  1560  
The study is powered  for an appro priate n umber of patients of  each IXT type in the primary 1561  
cohort .  1562  
 1563  
Table 4  shows the estimated number of patients needed per group to detect specific differences  1564  
in the proportion of patients meeting surgical failure criteria by  3 years (section 6.1.1 ) with 1565  
power of 0.90 and type I error rate of 0.05 using the Fisher’s exact test:  1566  
 1567  
Table  4: Sample size needed per group to detect the tabled difference in proportion of 1568  
failure with type I error=5% and power=90%  1569

 1570  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    6-5 
 
 Based upon estimates in the literature  for basic type IXT , the difference in failure proportion 1571  
between bilateral lateral recessions (BLR rec) and unilateral lateral rectus recessions with medial 1572  
rectus resections  (R&R) for the treatment of IXT ranges from as little as 4% (failure rates of 44% 1573  
vs. 40% respectively )13 to as much as 3 0% ( failure rates of 48% vs. 18%  respectively).12  It was 1574  
felt clinically meaningful to power the study to detect a difference bet ween treatment groups 1575  
only if the true difference was at least 25% , assuming a failure rate of 25% in the BLR rec group 1576  
and 50% in the R&R group , respectively) .  In the absence of literature comparing surgical 1577  
outcomes in  patients  with pseudo divergence excess  type IXT, the analysis for these patients will 1578  
be powered similarly to the analysis for basic type IXT patients.   1579  
 1580  
Given estimated failure proportions of 50 % with BLRrec  and 25 % with R&R , and accounting 1581  
for 10% loss to follow -up prior to repeat oper ation, 378 patients will need to be enrolled in the 1582  
primary cohort  (189 with basic type IXT and 189 with pseudo divergence excess type IXT),  half 1583  
of whom will be randomized to each treatment group.   1584  
 1585  
An additional 76 patients whose largest exodeviation by  PACT at enrollment is > 40 to 50 PD  1586  
(38 with basic type IXT and 38 with pseudo divergence excess type IXT)  are expected to be 1587  
enrolled as a secondary cohort during recruitment for the primary cohort .  Recruitment for the 1588  
secondary cohort  will be monitored during recruitment of the primary cohort .  If a secondary 1589  
cohort is enrolling fewer patients than expected, recrui tment for the secondary cohort  could be 1590  
terminated before recruitment for the primary cohort  has ended.   1591  
 1592  
As the enrollmen t goal approaches, sites will be notified of the end date for recruitment .  1593  
Subjects who have signed an informed consent form can be randomized up until the end date, 1594  
which means the expected recruitment might be exceeded .  The maximum number of 1595  
randomized  subjects will be 474.  1596

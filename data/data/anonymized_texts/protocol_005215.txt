ABSTRACT  
 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterize d by obliteration of the pulmonary 
vascular bed. Right -sided heart failure ensues with severe limitation of exercise and 
eventual progression to death.  
 
The role of female sex in PAH has long been recognized.  Certain types of PAH are  more 
common in women  and some have implicated hormone therapy in causing or worsening 
PAH.  A genetic study has shown that variation in estrogen metabolism is a risk factor for 
PAH. These data strongly suggest estrogen as a potential therapeutic target in the 
treatment  of PAH .  
 
Fulvestrant is an FDA- approved estrogen receptor (ER)  antagonist , used to treat 
postmenopausal women who are diagnosed with hormone receptor -positive metastatic 
breast cancer. Fulve strant binds to ER  in a competitive manner and downregulates the 
ER prot ein. We aim to determine if fulvestrant will decrease circulating pro -angiogenic 
hematopoietic progenitors in the plasma and plasma estradiol levels as well as lower right ventricular systolic pressure in patients diagnosed with PAH.

 12 Chapter 1. Backgro und and Significance  
 
1.1 Definition and characterization of PAH  
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension  (PAH) is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure 
> 25 mm Hg, a pulmonary vascular resistance > 3 WU , and a normal pulmonary capillary 
wedge pressure . Endothel ial thickening, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and in situ 
thrombosis are present in small pulmonary arteri es, however the disease mechanism is 
unknown. The three year survival is only 60 %. 
 1.2 Hormonal  effects on the vasculature  
In PAH, abnormal endothelial cell  proliferation and expression of angiogenesis markers 
characterize the pulmonary vascular lesions . Animal models and patients with PAH have 
increased pro -angiogenic hematopoietic progenitor  cells (HPCs) in the bone marrow  and 
circulating in blood .
1 Estradiol stimulates HPC mobilization via the estrogen receptor α 
(ERα), and ER  α blockade reduces HPC colony formation and endothelial growth. 
Estradiol is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes to metabolites which have both pro -angiogenic (16α -OHE1, signaling via ERα) and anti- angiogenic (2 -OHE, 2 -
methoxyestradiol [2ME] ) effects. The rs1800440 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
in CYP1B1 (enzyme that metabolizes estrone)  produces a higher urinary 16α -OHE1/2 -
OHE ratio, and both the SNP and urinar y ratio are risk factors for heritable PAH.
2  
Androstenedione and testosterone are converted by aromatase to estrone and estradiol (E2) which signal via ER  α and β . Female sex and estrogen are traditionally thought to 
have beneficial effects on the lung vasculature. Estrogen attenuates pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular changes in hypoxic and monocrotaline animal models 
of pulmonary hypertension.
3-5 These findings are however inconsistent with human 
PAH. First, female sex increases the risk of idiopathic and heritable PAH and 
portopulmonary hypertension.6 Austin et al. showed that subjects with certain 
genotypes of CYP1B1 had lower 2 -hydroxyestrone:16a -hydroxyestrone ratio and had a 
higher r isk of PAH.2 We have shown that SNPs in aromatase raised circulating E2 levels 
and increased the risk of PAH.7 
E2 metabolites may also contribute to pathogenesis. CYP1B1 is highly expressed in the lung and oxidizes E2 to 2 -OHE and then 2 -ME which inhibits angiogenesis and 
endothlein -1.
8, 9 16α-OHE 1 increases DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation via ER  α 
stimulation. The dominant hydroxylation pathway (affected in part by variation in the rs1800440 SNP (A>G, Asn453Ser) in CYP1B1) determines the ratio of these E2 
metabolites. The rs180044 0 CYP1B1 SNP is associated with a higher 16α- OHE
1/2-OHE 
urinary ratio (the “readout” of CYP1B1) and with a higher risk for cancer, a finding 
attributed to enhanced angiogenesis. Accordingly, in the monocrotaline model of pulmonary hypertension, administration of 2- ME reduced vascular remodeling by > 50% 
and improved survival.
10 All of the known vascular and angiogenic effects of estrogen 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 13 hormones act via ER  α, mak ing this the pivotal receptor in these processes. In summary, 
these data show that female sex and genetic variation in E2 production, activity, and 
metabolism are important risk factors for PAH. These findings implicate that the 
mechanistic pathway between estrogen signaling and PAH warrants exploration.  
1.3 Fulvestrant and estrogen inhibition  
Fulvestrant is an FDA- approved ER  antagonist, used to treat postmenopausal women 
who are diagnosed with hormone receptor- positive metastatic breast cancer. 
Fulvestrant bi nds to ER  in a competitive manner and downregulates the ER protein.  
1.4 Summary  
 
Data  suggest that E2  may contribute to  PAH . Treatment with fulvestrant, an ER 
antagonist , may therefore be effective in PAH .

 17 Chapter 4. Treatment  
 
4.1 Fulvestrant  
 
Fulvestrant is given intramuscularly (IM). Steady state concentrations are reached within the first month and plasma levels are mainta ined for at least one month. It is 
metabolized by the liver as well as multiple biotransformation pathways. Metabolites 
are less active or have similar activity to parent compound.  
 The majority of clinical studies have been conducted in patients with estrogen- positive 
breast cancer such as the Comparison of Faslodex in Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer (CONFIRM) trial, a randomized, double -blind, phase III trial that enrolled 746 
women. Patients were randomly assigned to fulves trant at two doses: 500 mg or 250 mg 
at days 0, 14, 28 and every 28 days.  
 The CONFIRM tria l suggest ed that fulvestrant 500  mg is superior to fulvestrant 250  mg. 
The researchers found that there was a 19% reduction in risk of death and a 4.1 month difference in overall survival in subjects who were randomized to 500  mg fulvestrant 
dosage compare d with fulvestrant 250  mg. The higher dose was well tolerated with no 
new safety  concerns. Patients with Child -Pugh  Class  B liver disease could be safely given 
doses of fulvestrant 250  mg. 
 
This study will utilize  fulvestrant 500 mg administered intramuscu larly into the buttocks 
slowly (1 -2 minutes per injection) as two 5  mL injections, one in each buttock, on days 0, 
14, 28 and 56. Fulvestrant 250 mg (one 5 mL injection) will  be used in patients with 
Child -Pugh Class B liver disease.   
 
4.2 Management of ot her medical therapies during the trial  
 The subjects ’ pre -study medical regimen will be continued after enrollment in the study.  
There will be no constraints on the management of the subjects ’ PAH  medication during 
the study period.

5.1 Study visit  
 5.1.1 Screening  
Potential s ubjects will be identified by the research staff and medical staff who care for 
patients with PAH at Penn Medicine. After reviewing the potenti al subject’s chart to see 
if she meets most of the inclusion/exclusio n criteria, the subject will be approached by a 
research team member during a scheduled PH clinic visit. The study will be explained to the subject. A fter all questions are answered and  if the subject agrees to participate, she 
will be scheduled for a scre ening visit.  
 The following procedures will be performed during the screening process:  
 • Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Sign and date the informed consent and HIPAA release  (must be done before any  
study procedures)   
• Review medical history  
• Review current medications  
• Labs/Phlebotomy: complete blood count, hepatic function panel, platelet count,  
 coagulation studies, and FSH (if needed)  
• Provide instructions on recording of new concomitant medications and dose  
changes  
• Instruct subj ects to bring a list of routine medications to baseline visit, do not eat  
or drink (except water) 12 hours before baseline visit, and to avoid heavy exercise for 12 hours before the baseline visit  
 If the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria fo r the study, the subject will be 
scheduled for a baseline study visit within 28 days at the study center. The research coordinator will call the subject and the PAH clinician 24 hours after the study visit if laboratories were obtained.  
 The screening vis it can be combined with the baseline visit for participants who are 
known to be post- menopausal (i.e., (1) > 50 years old and have not menstruated during 
the preceding 12 months or (2) have undergone bilateral oophorectomy ). Review of 
medical history, medications, and informed consent must be obtained prior to the 
combined visit.   
 
5.1.2 Study Day – Visit 1  (Baseline ), Day 0  (− 2 days ) 
The research coordinator will call the subject 1 -2 days before the visit as a reminder to 
not eat or drink (except water) and to avoid heavy exercise for 12 hours before the 
study day assessment. Subjects will be instructed to bring a list of the  current  
medications and to take all medications before the visit other than any oral PAH medication(s). The subject should bring her  oral PAH medication(s) with her  to be taken 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0

 19 after the blood draw. The subject will be reminded to wear appropriate clothin g and 
shoes to complete a 6MWT.  
 
Baseline information will be used to characterize the participants. Safety laboratories 
obtained at the screening visit will be used as baseline measurements. All baseline data will be collected prior to study drug administ ration. If a combined Screening Visit and 
Baseline Visit is performed, all labs (other than FSH for female subjects who are known 
to be post -menopausal  per inclusion criteria) must be confirmed and all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria must be met prior to stud y drug administration.  
 
The subject will arrive at the study site outpatient clinic. The following procedures will be performed:

occurred since last visit  
• Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Administration of study drug, fulvestrant, by the study physician or research  
nurse  
• Reinforce instructions on recording of ne w medications and dose changes   
 
*Screening labs should be drawn if performing a combination baseline/screening visit. All screening laboratory tests must be received and all inclusion/exclusion criteria confirmed by the PI before the subject can receive study drug.   There is no particular order in which these procedures must be done EXCEPT for the administration of the study drug, which should be performed last and only if the subject is eligible per inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
Blood samples for rese arch study assays will be  kept a room temperature and shipped 
to be  processed as well as processed on site and banked  in a freezer  at -70⁰ C . 
 
Echocardiography will be performed. The PI or research nurse  will take a history and 
perform a physical examination and the subject will complete the 6MWT.

 24  5.3 Subjects ’ retention and drug compliance  
 
We will enforce subject retention in several ways. We will record extensive contact 
information for each subject  at their enrollment in the trial. This will include home, 
work, and cellular telephone numbers. The research coordinator  will call before each 
study visit to remind the subject  to attend. The resea rch coordinator  and physician will 
explain the importance of compliance with the study protocol  at each subject  contact . If 
a subject fails to comply with a study visit, the coordinator  will contact her by 
telephone. If this fails, the coordinator  will sen d two letters by UPS , one week apart, to 
request follow -up. 
 If a subject  wishes to drop- out from the treatment phase of the study or ha s a serious 
adverse event  (whether related to study drug s or not) , we will continue to follow -up 
with the subject for st udy assessments to assist with safety monitoring and to avoid the 
problems introduced by missing data.   5.4 Subject reimbursement  
 Subjects will be reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses and the inconvenience of the study procedures necessary for parti cipation. We acknowledge that participation in this 
study is very burdensome due to many factors such as the route of administration of the study drug, the time needed to complete procedures associated with the study, and the 
frequent trips to the clinic to perform study procedures. The subject will be reimbursed 
$100 for completing the screening vi sit. Each subsequent visit completed  (visits 1 -5) will 
be reimbursed $250  for a total reimbursement of $1350.  
 
The study drug will be provided free of charge.

 25 Chapter 6. Outcome Measures  
 
6.1 Assessment s of efficacy  
 
• E2 levels and HPCs  
• RV systolic pressure , tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion  (TAPSE),  
and RV s troke volume index  
• Six-minute walk distance  
• Plasma NT-proBNP level  
• Safety and side effects associ ated with short -term fulvestrant 
administration in subjects with PAH  
 6.1.1 Plasma Estradiol (E2) Levels  
Plasma E2 levels will be measured using a d ouble antibody radioimmunoassay . 
 6.1.2. H ematopoietic Progenitor Cells (H PCs)  
Plasma H PC levels will be measured using flow cytometry.  
 6.1.3 Echocardiographic Measures  
The ultimate determinant of outcome in subjects  with PAH  is RV function which will 
measured by transthoracic echocardiography . Thus, we have focused on TAPSE, which 
reflects RV shortening and is  a strong predictor of survival in PAH.  We will also assess RV 
systolic pressure, stroke volume index, RV  fractional area change and other parameters.  
  
6.1.4  Six minute walk distance  
Walking is the most basic form of exercise and is integral to daily activities. The  6MWT  is 
a standardized, timed submaximal test of unencouraged, s elf-determined distance 
walked  which is reliable and valid . We will use s tandardized test methods as well as  
scripted and timed statements  that have been established  in prior studies of PAH  that 
have been recommended by the American Thoracic Society in 2002 . The 6WMT is also 
non-invasive and safe.  
 The subject will be instructed to wear comfortable clothing and shoes. The test will be 
performed at approximately the same time of day at each visit. The Borg score for dyspnea and oxygen saturation will be recorded at the  beginning and conclusion of each 
test.  
 6.1.5 Plasma NT -pro BNP  
Plasma NT -proBNP reflects right ventricular function in PAH and is a very strong 
predictor of outcome in PAH.  
 6.1.6  WHO functional class  
The WHO functional classification for PAH has been modified from the well- known New 
York Heart Association functional classification.  This functional classification is based on 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0

 26 symptoms, with Class I being defined by no s ymptoms  with physical activity , Class II as 
having mild limitation in physical activity  and are comfortable at rest , Class III as having 
markedly limited physical activity  and are comfortable at rest,  and Class IV as being 
unable to perform any physical ac tivity  without symptoms . The WHO functional class 
will be assessed at baseline , Week 4 and Week 9 .

Chapter 7. Statistical Considerations  
 
7.1 Study design  
 
To address the aims of this study , we will conduct an open -label, single -arm trial.  B lood 
sampling, e chocardiography  and 6MWT will be performed at baseline and nine weeks .  
 
7.2 Disposition of subjects and baseline summaries  
 
Summaries of all subjects screened and recruited, and the number who complete visits 
at baseline , week two, week four, week eight, and week nine  will be provided, according 
to the CONSORT guidelines.  
 
7.3 Statistical procedures   7.3.1 Data analysis  
Prior to the formal analysis, the distributions of the key variables t o be used in the 
analyse s will be examined using summary statistics and graphical tools.  
 Outcomes of interest  will be evaluated  with a per -protocol analysis. Subjects who are not 
compliant or stop the treatment portion of the study will be replaced (although their 
data will als o be considered in secondary analyses). Outcomes include estradiol levels, 
TAPSE  and other echocardiographic measures , 6MWD, plasma  NT-proBNP level , and 
other variables as well as  safety and side effects.  
 
These measures will be assessed both at baseline a nd nine weeks. Summary statistics 
will be produced with both the repeated measures as well as the calculated differences 
from the baseline. We will summarize demographics and other predictors of clinical status. Continuous variables will be summarized by t he mean, median, standard 
deviation, and range, as appropriate. We will use contingency tables for discrete and 
dichotomous variables.  
 
Hypothesis testi ng will use two -sided α= 0.05. All statistical analyses will be performed 
using SAS and R.  
 
7.3.2 Univariate analysis  
Univariate analyses will be performed for all variables of interest. These will be carried 
out by comparing the changes from baseline usin g signed rank tests for continuous 
variables and McNemar’s test for categorical variables.  
 
7.3.3 Missing data and dropouts  
Patients who drop out from treatment or assessment plan will be replaced.  
 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0

7.4 Sample size and power calculations  
 
Formal power ca lculations  have not been performed.  This study is intended for 
hypothesis generation and to show feasibility.  
 
7.5 Interim monitoring guidelines  
 
We have not planned for formal interim analyses for efficacy . 
 
7.6 Protocol violations  
 
Serious protocol violations such as discontinuation of experimental treatm ent unrelated 
to AEs will be carefully recorded and regularly reviewed by the Principal Investigator  at 
each site and by the lead site . Remedial changes in procedure will be recommended 
where feasible to  reduce the incidence of such violations. The causes and circumstances 
of all violations will be documented where known for purposes of future secondary 
analyses and interpretation . 
  
7.7 Safety  
 All subjects  will be assessed for toxicity and included in the safety analysis. This analysis 
will include summaries of the incidence and grade of toxicities.

Chapter 8. Quality Control  
 Design strategies and monitoring activities throughout the study will ensure the integrity and high q uality of the data. Design strategies training and certification of 
personnel. The monitoring program includes data queries  over the time of the trial.  
 
8.1 Personnel training  
 
Prior to enrollment  of the first subject in the study protocol, the PI will e nsure that staff 
has completed appropriate training and that all documentation including IRB appr oval is 
completed and available. The purpose of  training is to ensure that study personnel are 
carrying out the protocol in a consistent way and are adhering to good clinical practice 
guidelines. Staff will have current Human Subjects Training Certification on file at the IRB office. Before enrollment begins, study coordinators and research assistants who will perform the outcome assessments will be trained in all procedures, including completion of case -report forms (CRFs).  
 The PI and research staff will constitute the first line of monitoring of the safety of the human participants. Surveillance for AEs  will consist of questioning subjects about 
potential AEs at every study contact, having subjects report any adverse event to the 
study team, and having subjects undergo vital sign checks and physical exams during each study visit. Laboratories will be performed and checked at screening before enrolling the subj ect in the study.  
 
All study personnel are req uired to read the consent form and the protocol .  
 8.2 Data quality   
 The PI will perform continuous monitoring of data quality and c ompletion of CRFs . 
The PI  will review database forms and source documents to ensure that the information 
on the forms is complete and consistent with the source documents.

Chapter 9. Participant Safety and Confidentiality  
 
9.1 Consent  
 
Consent will be obtained for enrollment from participants . For each consent process,  
study personnel will discuss the details of the study, the risks and benefits, and the  
subject’s  rights and responsibilities if they choose to participate in the trial and their 
right to refuse to participate.  It will be made clear that their clinical care will not be 
affected by their decision.   
 
9.2 Institutional Review Board process  
 
IRB approval must be obtained and on file before  enrolling participants into the clinical 
trial.  
 9.3 Laboratory values  
 The following clinical laboratory tests will be  measur ed at screening  (or baseline  for known 
postmenopausal women ) and nine  week  visits  and as clinically indicated . 
 9.3.1 Hematology 
Complete blood count  will be performed  at screening.  
 9.3.2 Hepatic function panel  
Hepatic function panel will be perfo rmed at screening.  
 9.3.3 Coagulation studies  
Prothrombin time, INR  will be performed at screening .  
 9.3.4 Follicle -stimulating hormone  
FSH will be performed at screening.  
 9.4 Fulvestrant -related laboratory abnormalities and d rug interactions  
 
Hypersen sitivity reactions including urticarial and angioedema have been reported. Use 
of fulvestrant in patients with a history of bleeding disorders (including 
thrombocytopenia) should be approached with caution. Subjects on anticoagulant 
therapy will not be  enrolled in the study.  Aspiring is permitted as a concomitant 
medication.  Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment will be given a lower dose of 
fulvestrant.   
  9.5 Other events  
 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 31 We will not discontinue study drug for clinical events not thought to be serious drug -
related AEs. For example, a hospitalization for clinical worsening will not result in 
cessation of trial participation. Such events could result in missing data for primary and 
secondary endpoints, comprising the integrity of the analysis. As the tr ial does not 
prohibit any therapies which is the standard of care in P AH, there is no ethical or safety 
reason to stop trial participation under such circumstances. Even if subjects  are 
withdrawn from the study drug outcome assessments will continue . Subje cts who are 
not compliant or stop the treatment portion of the study will be replaced . 
 9.6 Safety and Adverse events  
 9.6.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problem (UP ): Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 2) related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
 
3) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previous ly known 
or recognized.    
 Possibly related to participation in the research: There is a reasonable po ssibility that 
the AE , experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in 
the research.  
 Adverse event  (AE) :  Any symptom, sign, i llness or expe rience that develops or worsens 
in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AE s if 
the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious AE  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 Serious adverse event (SAE):  Adverse reactions are classified as serious or non -serious.  
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal  
• life-threatening  
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 32 • requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outc omes noted above.  For 
example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -subject 
hospitalization or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department 
would typically be considered serious.  
 All AEs that do not meet any of t he criteria for serious should be regarded as non -
serious AEs.

 The intensity of clinical AEs is graded on a three -point scale –  mild, moderate, severe –  
and is reported on specific AE pages of the CRF.  
 If the intensity o f an AE worsens during study drug administration, only the worst 
intensity should be reported on the AE page. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required.  
 
The three categories of intensity are defined as follows:  
• Mild - The event  may be noticeable to the subject . It does not influence daily 
activities, and usually does not require intervention.  
 
• Moderate - The event may make the subject uncomfortable. Performance of 
daily activities may be influenced, and intervention may be neede d. 
 
• Severe - The event may cause noticeable discomfort, and usually interferes with 
daily activities.  The subject may not be able to continue in the study, and 
treatment or intervention is usually needed.  
 Expectedness  
 AEs must be assessed as to whether t hey were expected to occur or were unexpected, 
meaning not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.  
 Expected:  an AE known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study . 
 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 33 OHRP defines an unexpected AE  as any AE occurring in one or more subjects 
participating in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not 
consistent with either:  
1) the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the proced ures involved in the 
research that are described in a) the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -
approved informed consent document, and b) other relevant sources o f information, 
such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
2) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.  
 Rela tedness  
 1) Definite:  the AE is clearly related to the intervention  
 2) Probably: the AE is likely related to the intervention  
 3) Possible: the AE may be related to the intervention  
 4) Unlikely: the AE is doubtfully related to the intervention  
 5) Unrela ted: the AE is clearly not related to the intervention  
 For each identified AE, an AE form will be completed. Reporting procedures should be started immediately upon learning of a SAE.  
 
9.6.3 Interpretation of definitions  
AE Reporting Period  
The study pe riod during which AEs  must be reported is normally defined as the period 
from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up 
at week 12 .   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an AE  if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
 General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an AE  must also be recorded and documented as an AE .  
 
Post -study AE 
All unresolved AE s should be fol lowed by the investigator until the events are resolved, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or the AE is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled 
visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be 
related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the study sponsor of 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 34 any death or AE  occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated 
study participa tion that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should 
also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer 
or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated  in this study.  
 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE  if any one of the 
following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 Hospitaliza tion, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious AE  unless specifically instructed otherwise in this 
protocol.  Any condition responsible for surge ry should be documented as an AE if the 
condition meets the criteria for an AE .  
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are 
reported as an AE  in the following circumstances:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalizat ion for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an 
outcome of an AE  if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the 
outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hos pitalization required to allow efficacy 
measurement for the study.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinic al investigator.  
 9.6.4 Reporting procedures for AE s 
The University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires expedited reporting of those 
events related to study participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased ris k of harm.  The Penn IRB  require s researchers to submit 
reports of the following problems within 10 working days from the time the investigator 
becomes aware of the event:  
• Any non-fatal, non -life threatening AE (regardless of whether the event is serious 
or non -serious, on -site or off -site) that occurs any time during or after the 
research study, which in the opinion of the principal investigator is:  
Unexpected  
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 35 AND  
Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research 
procedures” if in th e opinion of the principal investigator or sponsor, the event 
was more likely than not to be caused by the research procedures.)  
 
Non -fatal, non -life threatening unexpected suspected serious adverse reactions will be 
reported to the NHLBI within 15 calendar days. Any fatal or life -threatening unexpected, 
suspected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the Penn IRB within 3 days.  
Serious and un expected  AEs which are fatal or life -threatening must be reported within 
7 days to the NHLBI.  
 UPs that are not SAEs  must be reported within two weeks to the NHLBI .  All UPs that are 
not SAE s must be reported within 30 days to OHRP by the P enn IRB.  
 Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to th e Penn  IRB using the institution required form or as a written report of the 
event (including a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or 
other study documentation).  
The Primary  Investigator is expected to provide as much of the following information as 
is available:  
• Protocol name and number  
• Subject identifiers  
• Demographic data  
• Nature of the event  
• Severity of the event  
• Probable relationship (ca usality) of AE to study procedure  
• Date and time of AE onset  
• Date and time of AE resolution, if available  
• Concomitant medications that the participant was taking for an 
underlying medical condition or disease and the therapeutic 
agents used for the treatment of the adverse event 
• Clinical assessment of participant conducted at time of SAE/AE  
• Results of any laboratory and/or diagnostic procedures, and 
treatment  
• Follow -up plan  
• Outcome  
• Autopsy findings (if appropriate)  
 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 36 The Principal Investigator  and research co ordinator will provide details about the AE as 
they become available. If additional information cannot be obtained for whatever 
reason, this will be documented.  
 
The Principal Investigator should promptly determine an assessment of causality.  
 
The Principal  Investigator/designee should keep originals or photocopies of all relevant 
documentation, including facsimile confirmations and email exchanges,  and file them in 
the participant's file.  
The Principal Investigator /designee should file copies of all corres pondence with the IRB 
in the appropriate section of the Regulatory Master File or site study file.  
Other Reportable events:  
The following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB:  
• Any adverse experience that, even without detaile d analysis, represents an  
unexpected SAE that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
• Any AE that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by the IRB to 
assure protection of human subjects.  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the 
research, in terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response 
to treatment than initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your 
researc h study is of no therapeutic value.  
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be resolved by the research team.  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opinion of the investigator placed one or more 
participants at increased risk, or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 37 9.6.5 Subject  withdrawal  
A subject has the right to withdraw from the study entirely at any time for any reason 
without prejudice to future medical care by the inve stigator or other physician. The 
investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects  from the study in the event of 
concurrent illness, AEs, or other reasons deemed to be in the subject ’s best interest.  
 
A subject should be withdrawn from the study if the re is:  
 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Termination of the study by the funding agency  
 In order to preserve the integrity of the study , even if the subject is withdrawn from the 
treatment portion of the protocol  (either due to subject, physician, or investigator 
decision) , we will  continue with the scheduled follow -up assessments both for the 
safety of the subject and for completeness of data collection. This will be explained to potential subjects at the time of informed consent. The importance of compliance with 
study visits will be reinforced throughout the trial.  If the both treatment is permanently 
withdrawn, the subject will return to the center  for safety assessment (history, physical 
examination, and clinical laboratories, if necessary).  In the event of clinical worsening, 
subjects  will be continued on their assigned study medication. If a subject  develops an 
indication for fulvestrant  therapy (such as breast cancer), the subject will be withdrawn 
from receiving  study drug in this clinical trial but  will cont inue to be  assessed per 
protocol.  
 
9.7 Confidentiality of s tudy data 
 Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to 
the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA).  Those re gulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject 
of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected  prior to the revocation 
of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
Several mechanisms will be in place to maintain confidentiality. Patient names will not 
be abstracted and all of the data will be reported in aggregate. Each subject in all phases 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 38 of the study will be assigned a  unique identifier  to be u sed on all data forms, study 
records, and blood samples. A list of patient names and code numbers will be 
maintained separately in locked file cabinets or on password protected computers. Only the investigators and project staff will have access to this in formation. No other 
personally identifiable information will be available.   9.7.1 Global unique i dentifier  
 
In order to share detailed medical and other information with researchers while 
protecting the subject’s  privacy in the future, a global unique ID (GUID)  number will be 
generated  for use in this study . The subject’s name , birth date,  and other “identifying” 
information from the subject’s  medical information  will be removed  before providing 
data  to researchers. This information is “de -identified” beca use it has had a ll personal 
identifiers removed. The subject’s  information will be labeled with the GUID and stored 
on secured computers and servers and protected with encryption and passwords. Only authorized people will have access to the key to the code  and will be able to identify the 
subject  if needed.  
 9.8 Potential risks 
 The most common side effects  for fulvestrant  (greater than 10%) reported are injection 
site pain, back pain, nausea, and increased liver enzymes.  Less common side effects 
(less th an 10%) were headaches, fatigue, weakness, pain in arms or legs (extremities), 
hot flashes, vomiting, loss of appetite, constipation, bone, joint and muscle pain, cough, 
and shortness of breath.  Very uncommon side effects (less than 1%) were rapid swelling  
of the under the skin (angioedema), skin rash, inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), liver failure, hypersensitivity, leukopenia, osteoporosis, blood clots, elevation of bilirubin levels, elevation of gamma GT , and vaginal bleeding.  Because the drug is processed and 
broken down mostly in the liver, subjects with moderate liver disease will receive a 
lower dose of the medication (250 mg instead of 500mg).  
 Women  of child -bearing potential or breast- feeding mothers will not be enrolled in this 
study there fore there  are no risks to unborn children or children who are being breast -
fed.  
 We will obtain several blood samples from each subject. There is a risk of bruising, 
hematoma, and infection after phlebotomy, which are possible but not considered 
serious AEs. Fainting although unlikely, may occur.   
 The probe used during the echocardiogram may lead to mild soreness in the area for about a day.  
 The 6MWT  may cause light -headedness, chest pain, or musculoskeletal discomfort;  
however the risks of this study to  subjects  are minimal. In addition, subjects  with PAH 
ERA PAH   Protocol V1.0                                                                   
________________________________________________________________________ 
     
 39 routinely undergo 6MWT  for clinical indications, so this study procedure does not 
increase risk above usual clinical care.  
 
As subjects  will be allowed to continue their other therapy, there are no alt ernative 
therapies to the ones being studied.  
 9.9 Potential benefits  
 
The results from the study could be applied in the future to subjects  (including those in 
the study) who stand to benefit from the information. There may be cl inical benefits to 
the use  of fulvestrant  in subjects  with PAH . As the study involves the risks of 
administration of fulvestrant,  phlebotomy, exercise testing, and loss of confidentiality, 
and there is a potential for future benefit for both subjects in the study and for future 
subjects , the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.  
 9.10 Alternatives  
 The use of the medications for this study requires that other medications including hormone therapy not be used. Therefore, the alternative is to not participate in this 
study and to continue having the option to take these medications .  
 
9.11 Ethical Considerations  
 This study is to be conducted accordance with applicable US government regulations 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 This protocol and any amendments will be submitted  to a properly constituted 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)  in agreement  with local legal prescriptions  for formal 
approval of the study c onduct.  The decision of the IRB concerning t he conduct of the 
study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be 
provided to the NIH  before commencement of this study.   
 All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for 
review and approval by the IRB for the study.  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study 
procedure.  The consent form must be signed by the subject or legally acceptable surrogate, and the investigator- designated research professional obtaining the consent.

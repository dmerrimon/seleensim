26-Apr-2021   • Estimation of the Bland -Altman 95% limits of 
agreement of TatchSleep Pro and PSG AHI by 
position (supine v. non -supine).  
 
Primary Safety Endpoints : 
• Incidence of Adverse Events ( AEs) and Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) related to the device throughout the study 
perio d. 
 
Study Design:  
 
 
 
 This is a multi -center, single -arm, quantitative study evaluating 
the effectiveness  of the TatchSleep Pro wireless sensors as a 
tool to aid in sleep apnea diagnosis as compared to an overnight 
PSG evaluation.  
 
Investigators will identify approximately 50 eligible patients who 
have been recommended to receive an overnight PSG for the 
detection/evaluation of sleep apnea. After informed consent is 
obtained, a brief sleep -related medical history will be collected 
including  relevant  demographics. Females of chi ldbearing 
potential will be asked to undergo a urine dipstick pregnancy test 
to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the study.  
 
Patients will undergo their PSG test while simultaneously 
wearing 2 TatchSleep Pro patches and an FDA -cleared pulse 
oximeter compatible with and connected to the TatchSleep Pro 
system for a single night at the clinic.   The same make and model 
of pulse oxim eter will be used for all subjects . Patients will be 
observed overnight by trained sleep technicians who will setup 
the TatchSleep Pro device and collect the sleep data via the 
companion smartphone application.  
 
A follow -up communication will be made with patients within 5 
days after the s leep study  to assess any adverse events . 
 
Following the data collection, sleep data from PSG and 
TatchSleep Pro will be scored by an independent qualified sleep 
technologist  (the primary reader)  to yield an analysis of the 
accuracy of TatchSleep Pro compar ed with the PSG signals .  At 
least one and up to two additional readers  (secondary readers)  
will score only the TatchSleep Pro  data to obtain  an estimate of 
inter-rater reliability.  
 
Study Device:  TatchSleep Pro paired with the same make and model of  
comp atible FDA cleared pulse oximeter  for al l subjects  
Eligibility Criteria:  Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Be at least 21 years of age.

and an FDA -cleared pulse oximeter in conjunction with a 
polysomnogram, for a single night.  
4. Be able and voluntarily willing to sign a written informed 
consent form prior to the initiation of any study procedures. 
Adult patients unable to provide written informed consent 
on their own behalf will not be eligible for the study.  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Women who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or who 
have a positive  urine  pregnancy test on the day of the

Data Elements:  The following data elements will be collected:  
• Height, weight, age, gender, skin tone (according to the 
Fitzpatrick scale), presence or lack of body hair under 
TatchSleep Pro patches . 
• TatchSleep Pro data (including patient movement, sleep 
position, pulse oximetry, and respir ation)  
• PSG data (including sleep stages, total sleep time, sleep 
position, pulse oximetry, heart rate, and respiration).  
• Adverse events  
Statistical 
Methods:  Accuracy of the TatchSleep  Pro device will be demonstrated by 
comparing the Pearson correlation of TatchSleep Pro and PSG 
AHI to a performance goal. The performance goal is based on a 
meta -analysis of FDA -cleared  similar devices. Fisher's 
transformation and one -sided Z -test will be used to test the 
hypotheses with a significance level of 0.025 . The upper and 
lower 95% Bland -Altman limits of agreement will be calculated 
and statistically compared using a Wald test to performance 
goals based on a meta -analysis of FDA -cleared si milar devices.

26-Apr-2021   2. Background and  Rationale  
 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by reduced breathing and breathing 
cessation during sleep. It is a highly prevalent condition that affects an estimated 14% of 
adult men and 5% of adult women aged 30 to 70 [1] . OSA is associated with more than 
30 chronic conditions , such as increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and  
daytime  fatigue and sleepiness. While the clinical gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA 
is polysomnography, these in -laboratory tests are expensive, time consuming, and labor 
intensive.  
In recent years there is a growing use of  home sleep tests (HSTs) as a more convenient 
and cost -effective alternative to diagnose sleep disorders. Nevertheless, HSTs currently 
on the market contain several complex wires and tubes that may make it difficult for 
patients to use on their own. In add ition, patients report that they can be intrusive and 
uncomfortable. These factors lead to unreliable data collection and ineffective diagnosis 
of OSA [2]. 
TatchSleep Pro  is a system comprised of flexible, thin, and wireless adhesive patch es, 
coupled with a n FDA -cleared compatible  pulse oximeter, for the detection of sleep apnea. 
The wearable sensor s detect various physiological parameters related to sleep quality, 
including respiration , SpO2,  and sleep position, and transmits data wirelessly t o a 
smartphone app in real time. The data recorded by the patches is relayed to remote secure 
storage, from where it  is downloaded to a local PC. The study output file is prepared by 
Tatch staff for review by a qualified sleep scorer.  
The TatchSleep Pro  device was bench -tested against industry standard polysomnography  
devices to compare the different sensors. Using its proprietary technology, TatchSleep 
Pro showed excellent accuracy and sensitivity in measuring respiration and sleep position. 
Previous feas ibility testing was conducted on approximately 30 patients  to evaluate the 
user experience and effectiveness in using the patch technology.  
As a low -cost and user -friendly home sleep testing system, TatchSleep Pro  has the 
potential to improve the detection of OSA while reducing the burden on patients and 
providers caused by complicated and invasive sleep kits.  
 
In the current study , TatchSlee p Pro  will be evaluated as a tool to assist physicians in 
determining the overall Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI) of a patient. Tatch , Inc. has 
partnered with the multiple clinical sites  for this study.

8. Study Procedures and Assessments  
 
8.1 Eligibility Assessment and Informed Consent  
An informed consent form (I CF) must be signed by prospective patients prior to initiating 
any study -specific procedures.  
 
The Investigator or designee will confirm that the patient meets  all inclusion and  no 
exclusion criteria.  
15  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021    
The patient must sign a written ICF prior to the initiation of any study procedures.  The  
enrolled  subject will be given a sign ed copy of the ICF to take home. Adult subjects unable 
to provide written informed consent on their own behalf will not be eligible for the study.  
 
The ICF and any other written information provided to the patients will be revised 
whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the 
patient 's consent, or if there is an amendment to the protocol which necessitates a change 
to the content of the patient 's informed consent. Any written ICF and written information 
must receive approval by the IRB in advance of use. Only the most up to date IRB -
approved ICF must be used to consent new patients.  
 
8.2 Urine Pregnancy Test  
Females of childbearing potential will be asked to undergo a urine dipstick pregnancy test 
on Day 1 in order to rule out pregnancy prior to starting the study.  
 
8.3 Complete Patient Case Report Form (CRF)  
CRFs will be provided for the recording of data. The I nvestigator or designee will record 
data from all observations and assessments specified in the protocol, including 
demographics, physical attributes and adverse events  on the CRFs provided by the 
Sponsor.   
 
8.4 Polysomnogra phy  
Patients will be hooked up to a PSG  on Day 1 (Night) according to the standard of care at 
the clinical site.  This will record brain waves, blood oxygen level, heart rate and breathing, 
as well as eye and leg movements.   
 
8.5 TatchSleep Pro  Administration   
The TatchSleep Pro will be connected to the patient by the investigator or designee 
according to the instructions in the  provided  User Manual. The investigator or designee 
will follow the instructions in the pre -loaded smartphone app to place the patches on the 
patient 's chest and abdomen, as well as the pulse oximeter on the patient 's finger. Once 
the sensors are set up  and the participant is ready for bed , the investigator or designee 
will start the data collection using the app.  
 
Details about TatchSleep Pro  management can be found in Protocol Section 11. 
 
8.6 Follow -up Communication  
A follow -up communication (email or phone call) will be made with patients within 5 days 
after the sleep study to check in on how they are doing and follow -up on any adverse 
events. If after three documented attempts the patient could not be reached for fe edback, 
the patient will be considered as "lost to follow -up".

PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021   8.7 Onsite PSG Study Scoring  and Export  
After the completion of data collection from patients, de-identified PSG signals will be 
exported from the PSG at the clinical site including , at a minimum,  manual position 
annotations and sleep staging scored according to the standard of care  by a sleep 
technologist at the study site . Raw PSG sleep data  (including, at a minimum, respiratory 
effort, respiratory pressure , respiratory flow and oxygen sa turation  signals ) will be 
extracted and presented to qualified readers as described below.  
 
9. Study Scoring  
Once study enrollment and all sleep tests are complete,  and all exported PSG data (with 
position annotat ions and sleep staging ) has been received by the Sponsor,  the primary 
reader  will score all sleep study recordings made simultaneously with TatchSleep Pro and 
the PSG device  from all sites .  The primary reader  will be blinded to the device used to 
collect the data under review as well as any information which may allow them to link the 
two studies from each patient.  The AHI will be calculated for each study, and the set of 
AHIs derived from TatchSleep Pro data  will be compared with those derived from PSG 
data using Pearson correlation to demonstrate accuracy (see Protocol Section 11 for more 
details).   At least one and up to two additional readers (secondary readers) will each score 
all sleep study recordings m ade using the TatchSleep Pro device  at all sites .  The AHIs 
derived from these scorings will be used to calculate the inter -rater reliability for the 
TatchSleep Pro device signals.   
 
9.1 Scoring Population  
Studies of subjects whose TatchSleep Pro recording doe s not encompass the sleep period 
indicated by PSG will not be scored [3].  Studies from a ll other  participants who are 
enrolled, meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, and whose PSG 
study has >4 hours of sleep duration  will be scored  [3].   
 
9.2 Reasons for Data Exclusion  
Time periods marked by the reader as "Movement" or "Artifact" (collectively referred to as 
"invalid") in a study will not contribute to the total sleep time for the purpose of calculating 
AHI for that study (per guidelines in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 
Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events section IX: Home Sleep Apnea 
Testing Rules for Adults).   Percentage of "invalid" time will be reported for each study.  
 
9.3 Blinding  
All stud ies will be presented on the same viewing and scoring platform.  The readers will 
be blinded to patient identification and the data collection device for each study.  
Specifically:  
 
• All data presented to the reader will be fully anonymized and will not inc lude any 
information which could allow the reader to link a subject 's two data sets.  All 
Protected Health Information (PHI), ID numbers, and study meta -data such as time 
17  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021   and date will be removed.  
• The reader will review patient studies in a predetermined r andomized order such 
that sequential readings of data from the same patient will be avoided.  
• All studies will be reviewed using the same analysis software, and using identical, 
system -agnostic signal labeling (eg, "Flow " will be used to label both the 
TatchSleep Pro TATCH -SUM -FLOW and the PSG Airflow waveforms).  
 
9.4 Scoring Procedure  
Readers  will be asked to score studies using the provided viewing software as they 
normally would in a clinical setting and in accordance with the AASM Manual for the 
Scoring of S leep and Associated Events.  Hypopneas will be scored using the 
recommended rule 1A criterion as laid out in the AASM (v2.6), Chapter VIII Respiratory 
Rules Part 1: Rules for Adults, Section D: Scoring of Hypopneas.  
 
The same data channels will be presente d to the reader in the same order and with the 
same labelling for every study, including:  
• Abdominal respiratory effort, labelled "ABD" from either the PSG system or the 
TatchSleep Pro patches, as applicable  
• Thorax respiratory effort, labelled "THX" from either the PSG system or the 
TatchSleep Pro patches as applicable  
• Position channel, labelled "Position " from either the PSG system or the

11. TatchSleep Pro  Materials and Management  
 
11.1 TatchSleep Pro  Description  
TatchSleep Pro  is a system comprised of wearable  and wireless sensors designed to 
collect physiological parameters related to sleep disorders in patients. The system has two 
sensor patches and makes use of a compatible  FDA-cleared  pulse oximeter.  Each patch 
consists of a wearable sensor and a bottom layer of double coat medical -grade a dhesive. 
This adhesive is safe for patient use and enables the patch to stay affixed to the body 
(thorax and abdomen) throughout the night. The sensor also connects directly to a battery 
which is hidden within the patch.  During the study, patients will be asked to wear all three 
sensors  (one patch on the abdomen, one patch on the thorax and the pulse oximeter on 
a finger ).   Data from the patches and pulse oximeter are transmitted wirelessly throughout 
the night to a secure cloud server via the companion mobile application for clinicians to 
upload to a sleep analysis platform.  
 
11.2 Shipping , Storage  and Accountability  
TatchSl eep Pro  sensors will be sent in packages to the clinical site  by a tracked postal 
service  prior to the enrollment of the patients . Each shipment will  include up to 10  patient 
kits, depending on the site projected enrollment rate.  E ach TatchSleep Pro  kit will contain 
2 patches, a pulse oximeter,  and a User M anual . Smartphones will be provided to the 
clinical  site with the TatchSleep Pro  companion application pre -loaded. Study staff will be 
trained on the use and functionalities of TatchSleep Pro  and the companion application 
prior to  enrollment.  
 
19  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021   TatchSleep Pro  kits will be stored at room temperature at the clinical site  in a secured , 
limited access l ocation, under the supervision of the Investigator  or designee . 
The Investigator or designee will be responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment 
of TatchSleep Pro  kits received  and comparing it with the accompanying shipping invoice  
to confirm accuracy of the shipment and its contents . All used and unused TatchSleep Pro  
wearable sensors will be retained at the site. After full device  accountability and 
reconciliation, the Investigator will return the used  and unused  kits to the Spons or or its 
designee. Disposition and use of all TatchSleep Pro  sensors should be documented, 
including any  that are lost or damaged.  
 
11.3 TatchSleep Pro  Associated Risks  
Per the FDA guidelines "Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies " 
[4] and based on 21 CFR 812.3(m), TatchSleep Pro  qualifies as a Non -Significant Risk 
device since TatchSleep Pro : 
• Is not intended as an implant and does not  present a potential for serious risk to 
the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• Is not purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life 
and does not  present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of 
a subject;  
• Is not for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or 
treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and does 
not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
or 
• Does not  otherwise present  a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject.  
 
Although there is minimal risk in using the TatchSleep Pro technology, p atients may 
experience some slight discomfort wearing the TatchSleep Pro  patches or the compatible 
pulse oximeter  throughout the night. It is possible that patients with sensitive skin may 
experience mild skin irritation  due to the patch adhesive. A similar  skin irritation  risk exists 
in the PSG test. Patients will be clearly ins tructed that they are allowed to remove the 
TatchSleep Pro  patches, pulse oximeter,  or the adhesive from the PSG study if they 
experience skin irritation  or significant discomfort at any point. A previous analysis showed 
no adverse events amongst a cohort of 19 patients undergoing full night tests wearing the 
TatchSleep Pro patches . 
 
There is also a risk that the technology will not function as anticipated causing partial 
recording of the study night which might make data unusable. It will be explained to t he 
participants that these technologies are still evolving, and they may experience glitches or 
malfunctions during the study.  
 
12. Adverse Events  
 
12.1 Adverse Event Definition  
20  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021   An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should 
be regarded as adverse events.   Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are c onsidered 
to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the invest igator to be of clinical significance  
 
An adverse device effect (ADE) is any reported AE that is considered device -related.  
 
12.2 Severity  
Adverse events will be classified by the investigator as mild, moderate, severe, life 
threatening, or fatal.  
 
When the severity of the AE increase s over time, the change in severity will be recorded 
in the source documents as a new AE and the original AE will stop when the new AE starts. 
The Principal Investigator or the delegated person must record all AEs  that occur duri ng 
the study from the time of TatchSleep Pro  placement  until study completion or Early 
Termination, regardless of their relationship to study device or procedure.  
 
The Principal Investigator will evaluate the severity of AEs  and determine their relationshi p 
to the study device or procedures. Any action or procedure followed by the pa tient or 
clinical staff  to alleviate the AE  will be  documented regardless of who recommended such 
action or procedure. The clinical course of each event  will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, or clinically significant improvement that requires no further  follow -ups in the 
opinion of the Investigator . 
 
12.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) may or  may not be considered related to the device and  
may be described as follows:  
• Death due to any cause  
• Life-threatening condition  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Any event resulting in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization  
• Congenital abnormality  
• Is considered an important medical event by the Investigator or Sponsor  
 
A UADE is any serious adverse effect on health or safety , or any life -threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or dea th was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan 
or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
21  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021   serious problem associated with a device that relates to the  rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
 
 
12.4 Event Reporting  
All AEs will be recorded  on the CRF  by the Investigator or designee  regardless of their 
relationship to the study device. SAEs and ADEs should be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event  using the SAE/ADE Report Form provided by the 
Sponsor.  UADEs must be reported by the clinical investigator to the sponsor and the 
reviewing IRB, no event later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the 
event.   Sponsors must immediately conduct an evaluation of a UADE and must report the 
results of the evaluation to FDA, all reviewing IRBs, an d participating investigators within 
10 working days after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect.  
 
13. Early Termination  
 
Study patients  may decide to withdraw from the research study without any penalty and 
for any reason. Study patients  may be cons idered withdrawn if they state an intention to 
withdraw or fail to participate. Although patients  are not required to provide a reason for 
withdrawal, they will be asked by research staff about their decision. The Investigator  also 
reserve s the right to re move a study participant from the study at any time for any reason 
(e.g. non -compliance with study requirements, safety reasons).  
Study patients  may also withdraw permission for the use and disclosure of any of their 
protected information for research but  must do so in writing to the Principal I nvestigator.  
 
14. Data Analysis  
14.1 General Considerations  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the mean, standard deviation, 
median, and range. Categorical variables will be presented as counts and percentages. 
All confidence intervals provided will be calculated at the 95% confidence level, unless 
otherwise noted. All null hypotheses will be tested against two -sided alternatives at the 5% 
significance level, unless otherwise noted. Any other details  not included in this protocol 
will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
14.2 Analysis Population  
Subjects with less than 4 hours of valid oximetry and flow data in either the PSG or 
TatchSleep Pro recording (taking "movement" and "artifact" annotations into account 
following scoring – see protocol sections 8.4 and 8.5) will not be included in the anal ysis 
population [3].  All other  participants who are enrolled, meet all the inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria, and whose sleep studies have >4 hours of recorded and 
valid data from both systems will be included in the Analysis Populatio n [3].

VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021    
14.3 Safety Population  
All participants who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and 
participated in the sleep study will be included in the Safety Population.  
 
14.4 Demographics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics ( age, sex, BMI , skin tone and presence of body 
hair) will be tabulated.   The flowing table shows the measurement units/scale and 
approximate expected ranges for these characteristics : 
 
Characteristic  Units or Scale  Expected Range

14.5 Primary Outcome Evaluation  
The first co -primary performance objective is to demonstrate that the correlation between 
PSG and TATCH AHI is greater than the performance goal (PG) using a significance level 
of 0.025.  
The hypotheses to be tested are:  
𝐻0:𝜌 ≤𝑃𝐺    versus  𝐻𝑎: 𝜌 >𝑃𝐺  
 
where ρ is the Pearson correlation between PSG and TatchSleep Pro AHI and 𝑃𝐺 is the 
performance goal. The performance goal is set to be 0.862, the lower 95% confidence limit 
for the correlation of RDI and AHI between PSG and Peripheral Arterial Tonometry  (PAT) 
as calculated in a meta -analysis of 12 studies [ 5]. Fisher 's transformation and one -sided 
Z-test will be used to test the hypotheses with a significance level of 0.025.  
 
The second co -primary performance objective is to demonstrate that the 95% limi ts of 
agreement  between PSG and TATCH AHI within the  performance goal s (PG L and PG U) 
using a significance level of 0.05.  
The hypotheses to be tested are:  
𝐻01:𝑈𝐿≥𝑃𝐺 𝑈vs.𝐻𝑎1:𝑈𝐿<𝑃𝐺 𝑈 
𝐻02:𝐿𝐿≤𝑃𝐺𝐿vs.𝐻𝑎2:𝐿𝐿>𝑃𝐺 𝐿 
 
where 𝑈𝐿 and 𝐿𝐿 are the upper and lower 95% limits of agreement between PSG and TATCH 
23  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021   AHI. The performance goals 𝑃𝐺 𝑈 and 𝑃𝐺 𝐿 are set to be the upper and lower limits, 
respectively, of the 95% confidence interval in a meta -analysis of 7 FDA approved devices 
(28.4 an d -30.6).  The full meta -analysis is detailed in Appendix 1.  A Wald  Z-test will be used 
to test the hypotheses with a significance level of 0.05.  All three null hypotheses need to be 
rejected in order for the trial to be successful.  
 
 
14.6 Secondary Outcomes Ev aluation  
• A weighted Deming regression of TatchSleep Pro AHI on PSG AHI will be run. 95% 
confidence intervals for the slope and intercept will be obtained.  
• The inter -rater reliability, measured as the intra -class correlation (ICC) of AHI readings 
and its 9 5% confidence interval will be calculated.  
• Agreement between TatchSleep Pro and PSG apnea classification (mild, moderate, and 
severe, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine definition) will be 
calculated.  
• Bland -Altman plots and e stimation of the 95% limits of agreement between 
TatchSleep Pro and PSG  AHI for each position (supine vs. non -supine) . 
 
 
14.7 Primary Safety Evaluation  
The primary safety endpoints are the incidence of AEs and SAEs related to the device 
throughout the study per iod. 
 
 
14.8 Sample Size  
The correlation of PSG and TATCH AHI data on 19 subjects previously rated by a single 
rater was estimated to be 0.98.  We calculated the probability of rejecting the null 
hypothesis when the true correlation is 0.98 using the Pearson 's Correlation Tests 
Procedure of NCSS Power Analysis Statistical Software, Version 20 (PASS 20, [ 6]). A 
sample size of 46 subjects yields a power of 99.99%.  
 
The ICC of PSG and TATCH AHI data on 19 subjects was 0.95, we use this as an estimate 
for the sample size calculation. A sample of 46 subjects yields a 95% margin of error for 
the ICC of 5%, assuming a true ICC value of 0.95, using the Confidence Intervals for 
Intraclass Correlation Procedure of NCSS Power Analysis Statistical Software, Version 20 
(PASS 2 0, [6]). 
 
The upper and lower limits of agreement of  PSG and TATCH AHI data on 19 subjects 
previously rated by a single rater was estimated to be 10.6 and -3.2, with a standard deviation 
of 3.5 . Because the standard deviation increases with increasing AHI,  and the previous AHI 
range was 0 to 30 events/hour, we conservatively  assumed  a standard deviation of 7.0 
events/hour , yielding a standard deviation for the LOA of √3𝜎=12.1, as described in Bland -
24  
 
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TCH -110  
VERSION 1 .1 
26-Apr-2021   Altman. We calculated the power to reject the null hypothesis using the One Sample T -Tests 
Procedure of NCSS Power Analysis Statistical Software, Version 20 (PASS 20, [ 6]). A sample 
size of 46 subjects yields an 99.9% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis f or both the 
upper and lower LOAs.  
 
A total sample size of 46 subjects yields sufficient power for the primary objective and 
allows for sufficient precision in estimating the inter -rater reliability, which is a secondary 
objective ; approximately  50 subjects will be enrolled to allow for a 5 -8% drop -out rate.  
 
 
15. Study  Administration

A random effects model was utilized to generate an estimate of the average lower and upper 
LOA across the 7 studies.  The random effects estimate was calculated using the Metafor  [1] 
(Meta -Analysis Package for R) package.  Restricted maximum likelihood wa s used to estimate 
the mean success rate and the variability among studies.  The mean lower LOA and 
confidence intervals for each of the 7 studies, as well as the random effects (RE) summary 
results are presented in Figure 1; results for the upper LOA are presented in Figure 2.  The 
random -effects model estimates a weighted least squares mean upper limit of 21.8 with a 95% 
confidence interval of 15.1 to 28.4; the random -effects model estimates a weighted least 
squares mean lower limit of -24.0 with a 95% co nfidence interval of -30.6 to -17.4.  From this 
analysis, it is reasonable to use 28.4 for the upper limit performance goal and -30.6 as the 
lower limit performance goal for the LOA primary effectiveness endpoint analysis in our study.

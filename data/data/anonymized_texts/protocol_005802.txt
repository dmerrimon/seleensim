Abstract
We investigated whether dual bronchodilator therapy (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate; GFF; Bevespi Aerosphere) would increase
exercise tolerance during a high-intensity constant work rate exercise test (CWRET) and the relative contributions of dead space venti-lation (V
D/VT) and dynamic hyperin ﬂation (change in inspiratory capacity) to exercise limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD). In all, 48 patients with COPD (62.9 ± 7.6 yrs; 33 male; GOLD spirometry stage 1/2/3/4, n= 2/35/11/0) performed a
randomized, double blind, placebo (PL) controlled, two-period crossover, single-center trial. Gas exchange and inspiratory capacity (IC)were assessed during cycle ergometry at 80% incremental exercise peak work rate. Transcutaneous P
CO 2(TcP CO 2) measurement
was used for V D/VTestimation. Baseline postalbuterol forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) was 1.86 ± 0.58 L (63.6% ± 13.9 predicted).
GFF increased FEV 1by 0.18 ± 0.21 L relative to placebo (PL; P<0.001). CWRET endurance time was greater after GFF vs. PL
(383 ± 184 s vs. 328 ± 115 s; difference 55 ± 125 s; P= 0.013; con ﬁdence interval: 20 –90 s), a 17% increase. IC on GFF was above pla-
cebo IC at all time points and fell less with GFF vs. PL ( P/C200.0001). Isotime tidal volume (1.54 ± 0.50 vs. 1.47 ± 0.45 L; P= 0.022) and
ventilation (52.9 ± 19.9 vs. 51.0 ± 18.9 L/min; P= 0.011) were greater, and respiratory rate was unchanged (34.9 ± 9.2 vs. 35.1 ± 8.0 br/
min, P=0 . 8 6 5 ) .I s o t i m eV D/VTdid not differ between groups (GFF 0.28 ± 0.08 vs. PL 0.27 ± 0.09; P= 0.926). GFF increased exercise
tolerance in patients with COPD, and the increase was accompanied by attenuated dynamic hyperin ﬂation without altering V D/VT.
NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study was a randomized clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) that collected detailed physiology data to
investigate the effect of dual bronchodilator therapy on exercise tolerance in COPD, and additionally to determine the relativecontributions of changes in dead space ventilation (V
D/VT) and dynamic hyperin ﬂation to alterations in exercise limitation. We uti-
lized a unique noninvasive method to assess V D/VT(transcutaneous carbon dioxide, TcP CO 2) and found that dual bronchodilators
yielded a moderate improvement in exercise tolerance. Importantly, attenuation of dynamic hyperin ﬂation rather than change in
dead space ventilation was the most important contributor to exercise tolerance improvement.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) experience expiratory ﬂow limitation, breathless-
ness, dyspnea, and reduced exercise tolerance relative to ageand sex matched controls ( 1–4). A prominent mechanism re-
sponsible for exercise intolerance in COPD is thought to be
dynamic hyperin ﬂation (DH) during exercise due to end ex-
piratory lung volume increase, usually assessed by a com-mensurate decrease in inspiratory capacity (IC) ( 5,6). The
effects of dynamic hyperin ﬂation on dyspnea and exercise
intolerance are ampli ﬁed in COPD by an increased ventila-
tory requirement for exercise, related to increased deadspace to tidal volume ratio (V
D/VT)(7,8). Treatment with
bronchodilators (BD) are partially effective at reducing expir-atory ﬂow limitation, and the optimal regimen in COPD
appears to be achieved with a ﬁxed dose, long-acting inhaled
combination medications (LABA/LAMA, long-acting betaagonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists) ( 1,2,9–11).
In patients with COPD, LABA/LAMA bronchodilator therapy
reduces DH and increases exercise tolerance ( 12). However,
the effect of LABA/LAMA bronchodilator therapy on V
D/VT
during exercise in COPD is controversial ( 13). Although
short-acting bronchodilator therapy in COPD does not in ﬂu-
ence estimated V D/VT, long-acting bronchodilation, which
increases ventilation to both well- and poorly perfused lung

units, has the potential to worsen V D/VTand increase ventila-
tory requirement. LABA/LAMA bronchodilators also increase
pulmonary blood ﬂow, as demonstrated using gadolinium-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging at rest ( 14). Therefore,
should the negative effects of COPD on alveolar ventilation to
pulmonary blood ﬂow ratio (V _A/Q_) distribution during exer-
cise be ameliorated by LABA/LAMA bronchodilators, then
VD/VTmay be reduced and, thus, contribute to the mecha-
nism by which LABA/LAMA bronchodilators increase exer-
cise tolerance.
We hypothesized that glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate
(GFF, Bevespi Aerosphere) would increase exercise tolerance
during high intensity, constant work rate, cycle ergometer
exercise in stable COPD patients by simultaneously reducing
DH and V D/VTduring exercise. To assess the relative contribu-
tions of these two variables, we aimed to determine DH using
serial IC measurements and breath-by-breath V D/VTusing
transcutaneous P CO2(TcP CO2) measurements and compare
these measurements at isotime during constant work rate
exercise to intolerance while receiving GFF or placebo (PL).
METHODS
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (Study No. 21752-01). Written
informed consent was obtained from each subject before
participation.
Study Design
This was a single center, randomized, double blind, PL
controlled, two-period, crossover clinical trial conducted
between March 2017 and February 2019 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
Participants
Male or females were enrolled, who were between 40 and
80 yr with a clinical diagnosis of COPD (postalbuterol FEV 1/
FVC ratio <0.70) and stable, without change in medications
or exacerbation within the prior 4 wk. Participants were cur-
rent or ex-smokers with >10 pack-years smoking history.
Exclusion criteria included: signi ﬁcant diseases other than
COPD that affect exercise tolerance: e.g., a history of heart fail-
ure or arthritis; a documented history of childhood or family
asthma, treatment with oral corticosteroid medications above
10 mg/day, daytime oxygen use >6 hours/day, desaturation
(from pulse oximetry) during exercise to <80%; a physical
contraindication for exercise, e.g., marked exercise induced
hypertension, serious arrhythmia; and other unstable condi-
tions as evaluated by the principal investigator. Participants
were categorized into Global Initiative for Chronic Obstruct-
ive Lung Disease (GOLD) spirometry groups: GOLD 1 (FEV 1/C21
80% predicted), GOLD 2 (50% /C20FEV 1predicted >80%), GOLD
3( 3 0 % /C20FEV 1predicted >50%), GOLD 4 (FEV 1<30%
predicted).
Procedures
Pulmonary function testing.
Participants continued their usual medications for screening.
Prebronchodilator spirometry, body plethysmography, and
single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbonmonoxide (DL CO) were measured according to recommended
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society
(ATS/ERS) standards ( 15–18). Postbronchodilator spirometry
was measured 20 min after inhalation of 4 puffs of albuterol
(400 mg). Predicted values for spirometry and vital capacity(VC) were from National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) III ( 19); predicted lung volumes were from
ERS ( 20); and predicted DL
COwas from Cotes et al. ( 21).
Chest computed tomography.
Subjects underwent a volumetric computed tomography
(CT) scan of the chest at full inspiration and relaxed expira-tion. For this study, inspiratory CT data were used.
Emphysema was de ﬁned as percentage of lung attenuation
areas below /C0950 Houns ﬁeld Units. Airway wall thickening
was measured using mean segmental wall thickness in mm
of a theoretical airway of 10-mm luminal perimeter ( 22,23).
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
Symptom-limited exercise tests were performed using car-
diopulmonary measurements of gas exchange and ventila-
tory variables (Vmax Encore, Vyaire, Yorba Linda, CA, orCPX Ultima, Medical Graphics Corporation, St. Paul, MN)
with electromagnetically braked cycle ergometry (Excalibur
Sport PFM, Lode, Groningen, NL). Each subject started and
ﬁnished all exercise tests (incremental and constant work
rate) using the same cardiopulmonary system and cycle er-gometer. Daily calibration as well as monthly biological
calibrations were performed according to vendor recom-
mendations and guidelines ( 24).
Incremental exercise testing.
Participants were screened with a ramp-incremental exercise
test at 10 Watts (W)/min. A 3-min rest period was followed by
3 min of unloaded cycling, then increasing work rate (10 W/
min) until intolerance, determined as the inability to main-
tain pedaling cadence >50 rpm despite encouragement. The
test was concluded with at least 3 min of unloaded cycling.
Subjects breathed through a mouthpiece with a nose clip in
place. Heart rate was derived from a 12-lead electrocardio-gram. Inspiratory capacity (IC) was measured every 2 min
according to ATS standards ( 25,26). Blood pressure (sphyg-
momanometer) and ratings of breathlessness and leg effort
(modi ﬁed Borg CR-10 scale) were also assessed every 2 min.
Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) was estimated asFEV
1/C240, where FEV 1was measured seated on the cycle er-
gometer immediately before exercise testing ( 26). Peak work
rate was determined as the value during the last 10 s of exer-cise. For variables measured breath-by-breath, peak values
were de ﬁned as the average of the last 30 s of exercise aver-
aged over three 10-s time bins. For variables assessed every 2
min, end-exercise values were taken as the last value during
exercise before or during that 30-s window. The estimatedlactate threshold (LAT) was assessed using the V-slope
method and corroborated with ventilatory equivalent and
end-tidal partial pressure responses (P
ETO2and P ETCO2)(27).
For V E/VCO2slope, data calculated as 30-s averages were ﬁt
by linear regression. The lower point for the regression was
at a work rate above 20 watts and the upper point was at the
respiratory compensation point. Predicted values for ramp
exercise variables were those of Hansen et al. ( 26).

Constant work rate exercise testing.
The work rate for constant work rate exercise testing
(CWRET) was 80% of the peak work rate measured duringincremental exercise. A 3-min rest period was followed by3 min unloaded cycling, then the work rate was increased as astep change to 80% peak incremental work rate. Exercise tol-
erance during CWRET was determined at the time between
the start of loaded exercise (work >0 watts) and when the
subject could no longer maintain pedaling cadence >50 rpm
despite encouragement (speci ﬁc a l l y ,t h et i m eb e t w e e nt h e1 0 -

side the 3 –8 min guideline duration ( 4), a second screening
CWRET was performed at an /C245 W higher or lower work rate
—whichever was appropriate to obtain a 3 –8-min CWRET du-
ration ( 28). In analysis of these data, for variables measured
breath-by-breath, end-exercise values were de ﬁned as the av-
erage of the last 30 s of exercise averaged over three 10-s timebins. For variables assessed every 2 min, end-exercise valuesw e r et a k e na st h el a s tv a l u ed u r i n ge x e r c i s eb e f o r eo rd u r i n g

VD/VTestimation.
Transcutaneous CO 2(TcP CO2) and oxygen saturation by pulse
oximetry (SpO2; Tosca 500, Radiometer America, Brea, CA)
was recorded breath-by-breath during incremental and con-stant work rate exercise. The sensor was attached to the leftearlobe /C2410 min before exercise testing to allow the TcP
CO2
measurement to stabilize. The device was set to a probe tem-
perature of 44/C14C. TcP CO2was substituted for Pa CO2inEq.1
for dead space estimation, and the fraction of the dead space
of resulting from the mouthpiece breathing apparatus (V DS=
110 mL) was subtracted from the total.

Protocol
The study protocol diagram is provided in Fig. 1 .Visit 1
included obtaining informed consent, vital signs includingSpO2; a focused physical examination; full pulmonary func-
tion testing (PFT) on usual respiratory medications; 6-minwalk test; BODE (Body Mass index, Air ﬂow Obstruction,
Dyspnea, Exercise Capacity) index ( 29); modi ﬁed Medical
Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score ( 30); inspiratory
and expiratory (I þE) CT scan ( 31); and assessment of exac-
erbations in the past year (de ﬁned as new antibiotic prescrip-
tion, new or increased oral corticosteroids, or a visit to theemergency room or hospital).
Eligible participants underwent a 2-wk washout period
where all LABA and LAMA bronchodilators were withheld.Short-acting beta agonists (SABA) and/or short-acting mus-carinic antagonists (SAMA) were allowed during washout.Participants who were currently using inhaled corticoste-roids before enrollment (either individual or as a componentof a combined inhaler) were continued on a single inhaledcorticosteroid agent at appropriate dosages (beclomethasonedipropionate; QVAR). Participants who were not using LABA
or LAMA therapy did not require washout.
After the appropriate washout period, participants per-
formed screening ramp-incremental and CWRET exercise
tests ( visit 2 ) separated by at least 1 h of rest. Participants and
study personnel were blinded to the statistician created ran-domization that the research pharmacist followed to provideeither PL ﬁrst or GFF for visits 3 and5. A coded, indistin-
guishable inhaler (either GFF or PL) was dispensed at visit 3
and used for 2 wk. At visits 4 and6spirometry was followed
by CWRET. Visit 5 was preceded by another 2-wk washout
period, after which participants received their crossed-overinhaler (either PL or GFF) and took the ﬁrst dose in the clinic.
The acute effect of either PL or GFF on spirometry was deter-mined 2 h postdose on visit 5 . Participants then resumed
their prestudy medications, and a follow-up visit ( visit 7 )w a s
performed 1 wk later to assess patient safety.
Statistics
Data are presented as mean ± SD or 95% con ﬁdence inter-
val (CI). Differences in physiologic and perceptual responsesbetween study drug and placebo were analyzed using pairedStudent ’sttests or repeated measures analysis of variance
(rmANOVA). Statistical signi ﬁcance was accepted at P<0.05.
Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to deter-mine whether differences between study drug and placebofor a variety of physiologic variables were predictive ofincreases in endurance time (Sigmaplot v.14, Systat Software,

RESULTS
Participants
Sixty participants were consented. Eight subjects failed
screening procedures related to failure to meet pulmonaryfunction inclusion criteria (5), recent hospitalization for
heart failure (1), chest mass found on the study CT scan (1),
and inability to tolerate bronchodilator washout (1). The four
subjects who entered, but did not complete the study, all
withdrew consent in the prerandomization period (before
visit 3 ), related to family emergency (1), knee pain (1), and
unhappiness with the possibility of being in the placebo
group (1); one subject declined to give a reason for with-
drawal. Forty-eight subjects completed the study.
Participant demographics were: age 62.9 ± 7.6 yr; height
172.5 ± 8.6 cm; weight 86.7 ± 18.4 kg; body mass index 29.1 ±
5.9 kg/m

1/2/3/4 was n= 2/35/11/0. Thirty were past smokers, 18 were
current smokers. The average pack-years of cigarette smoking
was 38 ± 21. All participants were stable for at least 4 weeks
before screening, but 11 (23%) had experienced a COPD exac-
erbation within the prior year and one subject had experi-
enced two exacerbations. At screening, the mean 6-min walk
distance was 393 ± 86 m, BODE ( 8)i n d e xw a s1 . 8 3 ± 1 . 3 6a n d
mMRC score was 1.75 ± 0.5. Five (11%) subjects had been
receiving LABA, four (8%) had been receiving LAMA therapy;
nine (19%) had been receiving dual LABA/LAMA therapy.Nineteen participants (40%) had been receiving inhaled corti-
costeroids, which were continued during the study using
inhaled beclomethasone at a dosage of either 40 or 80 mgdepending on the previous dosage. None of the subjects had
been receiving PDE4 inhibitors or daily azithromycin.Average hemoglobin concentration was within the normal
range (14.4 ± 1.6 g/dL) and the average eosinophil count was
209 ± 165 cells/uL or 2.66 ± 1.79%. CT scans ( n= 46, 2 subjects
had recent CT scans, which were not repeated for the study)
demonstrated emphysema 9.09 ± 7.71% and mean segmental
wall thickness 3.61 ± 0.47 mm.
Pulmonary Function
Screening pulmonary function with usual medications
and before washout are presented in Table 1 . The majority of
participants had mild-moderate (71%) or severe (23%) COPD.The FEV
1/FVC ratio was 51.8 ± 11.6%. After 4 puffs of albu-
terol, the average FEV 1increase (0.14 ± 0.14 L and 9.1 ± 9.4%)
and FVC increase (0.21 ± 0.30 L and 6.2 ± 8.8%) did not ful ﬁll
ATS/ERS criteria for a positive bronchodilator response ( 17).
The subjects on average were not hyperin ﬂated with respect
to TLC (101 ± 17% predicted); however, the RV (118 ± 45%) and
FRC (110.5 ± 39.9%) were elevated. The average gas transfer/DL
COwas reduced at 59.3 ± 16.2% of predicted with DL CO
ranging from 23 to 88% of predicted.
Atvisit 5 , 23 subjects received GFF and 25 subjects
received PL per their randomization sequence. Spirometry
obtained 2-h after GFF or placebo inhalation at visit 5 follow-
ing a 2-wk wash out from long-acting bronchodilators
(LABA/LAMA) is displayed in Table 2 . After administration
of GFF, FEV 1increased by 0.18 ± 0.20 L (11.8 ± 15.6%, P<
0.001 versus predose). There was no increase in FEV 1follow-
ing PL (0.01 ± 0.10 L; P>0.050 vs. predose).
Incremental Exercise Test
Table 3 presents the baseline characteristics during screen-
ing ramp-incremental exercise. Participants had impairedaerobic function: reduced V _
O2peak [1.36 L/min, 67 ± 19% pre-
dicted ( 26), 15.8 ± 4.9 mL/kg/min], low LAT (0.88 ± 0.20 L/min,
92% ± 21 of predicted lower limit of normal). They had a peak
work rate of 91 ± 33 W, abnormal indices of ventilatory

0.16), increased V _E/V_CO2at the LAT (34.5 ± 5.1), and V _Eversus
V_CO2slope (29.5 ± 6.3). Twenty-two of the 48 subjects (46%)
had a peak V _E/MVV above 0.75, and subjects showed signs of
dynamic hyperin ﬂation, as evidenced by a fall in IC, with
inspiratory reserve volume (IRV, IC-V T)a v e r a g i n g0 . 6 0 ±

LAT was 0.29 ± 0.08.
Constant Work Rate Exercise Test
Figures 2 and 3present the time course of a number of
physiologic and perceptual responses to CWR exercise inresponse to GFF and placebo. The average CWRET work ratewas 73 ± 27 W. The endurance time (primary outcome) was383 ± 184 s on GFF versus 328 ± 115 s on PL, with a mean indi-vidual difference of 55 ± 125 s (17% increase; P=0 . 0 1 3 ,C I2 0 –
90 s). Figure 4 displays the individual CWRET responses in
seconds for 48 subjects on placebo and GFF. There were largeincreases in exercise tolerance in certain individuals, withthe average increasing by 55 ± 125 s. The MCID for endurance
time for CWRET has been postulated to be 100 s or 33% ( 34);
by both of these metrics, 18 of 48 subjects, demonstrated
clinically important increases in exercise tolerance. Isotime
occurred 4.53 ± 1.45 min after the onset of loaded CWRETexercise.
InFig. 2 A,V_
Eincreased progressively during CWRET in
both GFF (solid circles) and Placebo (open circles) studies,
but were little changed from 2.5 min onward. V _Ewas statisti-
cally signi ﬁcantly higher with GFF versus Placebo at 4.5 min,
isotime, and peak exercise time points. In Fig. 2 B, tidal vol-
ume (V T) peaked at approximately /C241.5–1.6 L and decreased
thereafter; however, V Tin GFF remained statistically signi ﬁ-
cantly higher than placebo at isotime and peak exercise. In
Fig. 2 C, respiratory rate increased progressively throughout
exercise with an acceleration at peak exercise, but the time
course was essentially identical in GGF and placebo studies.
InFig. 2 D,V_E/MVV was slightly lower throughout exercise in
the GFF studies; this achieved statistical signi ﬁcant at 30 s,
2.5 min, isotime, and recovery.

InFig. 2 I,V_E/V_CO2was higher in the GFF group relative

achieved statistical signi ﬁcance at peak exercise and recov-

throughout exercise and recovery. In Fig. 2 K, transcutane-

InFig. 2 M, end-inspiratory lung volume was lower with
GFF at 30 s, 2.5 min, and 4.5 min relative to placebo, but wasnot statistically different at isotime or peak exercise. For
end-expiratory lung volume, GFF was statistically signi ﬁ-
cantly lower at all times during exercise as well as in recov-ery compared to placebo. In Fig. 2 N, IRV with GFF remained
slightly higher than placebo throughout exercise, and was
statistically different at unloaded cycling, 30 s, 2.5 min, andrecovery. In Fig. 2 O, IC remained statistically signi ﬁcantly
higher in GFF as compared to placebo studies throughout all

DISCUSSION
The physiologic mechanisms limiting exercise in COPD
include increased ventilatory requirements consequent to
one or more mechanisms including, greater V _A/Q_inequality,
lower LAT, larger V D/VT, and abnormal ventilatory mechan-
ics (dynamic hyperin ﬂation; constrained V T; lower IRV;
increased respiratory muscle work) ( 3,7,8,26,35,36). These
mechanisms are not exclusive, and may potentiate one
another, exacerbating dyspnea and reducing exercise toler-
ance. This study aimed to determine the contributions of
alterations in DH and V D/VTto the increases in exercise tol-
erance observed with LABA/LAMA bronchodilator therapy
in COPD. We found, as anticipated, that LABA/LAMA

BRONCHODILATOR THERAPY, HYPERINFLATION, & EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN COPD

bronchodilator therapy (GFF) signi ﬁcantly increased exer-
cise tolerance in patients with mild to very severe COPD(/C2417%), while reducing isotime dynamic hyperin ﬂation (on
average by /C24150 mL or /C247% increase in IC) without signi ﬁ-
cant isotime change in V
D/VT. Together these data suggest
that the primary mechanism by which LABA/LAMA bron-chodilator therapy increases exercise tolerance in patientswith COPD is via bene ﬁcial effects on respiratory mechanics
to reduce dynamic hyperin ﬂation, rather than increased
ventilatory ef ﬁciency (reduced V
D/VT).
The increase in exercise tolerance LABA/LAMA treatment
in this placebo controlled, double blinded, study was modest(17%). The average increase in exercise tolerance by 55 s (CI20–90 s) was less than the consensus MCID of 105 s or 33%
increase, based on interventions including bronchodilatortherapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen supplementationand noninvasive ventilation ( 4). Our ﬁndings were, however,
approximately equal to the lower 95% con ﬁdence interval of
the MCID (60 s or 22% increase) ( 4) and similar to previousstudies of LABA/LAMA or short-acting beta agonists (SABA)
and short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) therapy ( 4).
A subanalysis of our data showed that the average increasein exercise tolerance tended to be greater in GOLD 3 –4t h a n
GOLD 1 –2 participants (124 ± 143 s, or 38% increase vs.
34 ± 144 s or 10% increase; P= 0.076). Although our study
was not powered to identify the effect of combination LABA/
LAMA across disease severities, these observations are con-
sistent with earlier studies that found that bronchodilator
therapy is less effective in patients with COPD with mild
obstruction in whom exercise limitation may be dominated
by peripheral muscle function ( 2).
Assessment of ventilatory inef ﬁciency during exercise is
challenging. The ratio of ventilation to CO
2output (V _E/V_CO2)
at LAT (or nadir) is commonly used to infer inef ﬁcient ventila-
tion. However, because V _E/V_CO2depends on both ventilatory
efﬁciency (V D/VT)a n dP a CO2, it is inaccurate to determine the
normalcy (or not) of V D/VTin patients with intermediate V _E/
V_CO2values ( 32). Further, using end-tidal P CO2values (rather
than arterial P CO2)t oc a l c u l a t eV D/VTis highly inaccurate, in
all but normal subjects ( 37–39). The most appropriate method
to calculate V D/VTuses Pa CO2, utilizing the modi ﬁed Bohr-
Enghoff correction ( 40,41). However, the blood draws during
exercise that this necessitates, either from an indwelling cath-
eter or from a single arterial puncture, is painful, time con-
suming and yields poor time resolution. Pa CO2may be
estimated noninvasively using transcutaneous P CO2(33,34,
42–45), and may be reasonably applied (i.e., have good agree-
ment with Pa CO2)t oe s t i m a t eV D/VTon a breath-by-breath ba-
sis during a cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with
COPD ( 37).
To address the mechanism(s) of the observed improve-
ment in exercise tolerance resulting from LABA/LAMA ther-
apy, we assessed both dynamic hyperin ﬂation using serial
inspiratory capacity maneuvers every 2 min and the V D/VT
calculated breath-by-breath using TcP CO2. At isotime during
constant work rate exercise, we observed that LABA/LAMA
bronchodilator therapy yielded signi ﬁcantly greater tidal
volume, allowing greater ventilation and V _E/V_CO2for an
identical exercise task ( Fig. 2 B). End-exercise comparisons
also showed greater V _E,V_E/V_CO2,a n dV Tas well as higher
TcP CO2with bronchodilator therapy, consistent with relief of

pulmonary mechanical constraints ( Fig. 2, A,B,I,andK).
Average respiratory rate was not statistically different.
However, the overall effect on V D/VTboth at isotime and at
end-exercise for GFF versusplacebo was negligible, and didnot reach statistical signi ﬁcance. Therefore, contrary to our
hypothesis, increased exercise tolerance following LABA/LAMA therapy in COPD was not associated with reducedexercising V
D/VT. Consistent with the literature, increased
exercise tolerance following LABA/LAMA therapy in COPDwas coincident with an attenuated fall in IC (reduceddynamic hyperin ﬂation).
Some previous studies (but not all) suggest that V
D/VTis
increased following bronchodilation therapy ( 14,46,47).
Elbehairy et al. studied 20 patients with COPD who per-formed constant work rate exercise following acute adminis-tration of LABA/LAMA bronchodilators versus placebo; nodifference in isotime V
D/VTwas detected ( 7). Marvin et al.
(47) studied 15 men with COPD who performed 6 min of low-
intensity constant work rate exercise after receiving oral the-ophylline plus an oral short acting beta agonist or placebofor 10 days; a trend for a greater exercise-induced fall in V
D/
VTwas seen with the combination oral bronchodilator ( 23).
Vogel-Claussen et al. utilized gadolinium-enhanced MRI andphase-resolved functional lung MRI to measure pulmonarymicrovascular blood ﬂow and regional ventilation, respec-
tively, in 62 patients with COPD receiving 2 wk of LABA/LAMA versus placebo; though V
D/VTwas not directly meas-
ured, LABA/LAMA therapy was found to decrease both non-ventilated and hypoventilated lung regions ( 14).
This could occur by increased ventilation of poorly per-
fusion lung regions following bronchodilation in the prox-imal airways. Nevertheless, our RCT found no differencebetween V
D/VTat isotime in GFF and PL groups ( Fig. 2 L),
suggesting that GFF does not have a negative effect on V _A/
Q_inequality during exercise in COPD, leading to an
increase in V D/VT.
Although this was a rigorous physiologic study of a phar-
maceutical intervention in COPD subjects, there were someweaknesses. First, the small overall effect size on endurancetime was likely due to the majority of participants (75%)being mild or moderately obstructed. The effects on exercisetolerance and V
D/VTmay have been different if more severe
patients had been included in the study. Second, V D/VTesti-
mation relied on TcP CO2measurements and we did not draw
simultaneous arterial bloods samples for Pa CO2.
We conclude that combination bronchochodilator therapy
(glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate; GFF) increases exercisetolerance in patients with COPD by attenuating dynamichyperin ﬂation without increasing dead space ventilation
(V
D/VT).

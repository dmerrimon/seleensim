Dear Ms. Kruhm,  
 
Enclosed please find Amendment #9 to protocol ANHL12P1, A Randomized Phase 2 Trial 
of Brentuximab Vedotin (SGN35, NSC# 749710), or Crizotinib (NSC#749005, 
commercially labeled) in Combination with Chemoth erapy for Newly Diagnosed Patients 
with Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL)  for CTEP review.  
 
This amendment is being submitted in response to a Request for Rapid Amendment 
(RRA) from Dr.  John J. Wright (wrighttj@ctep.nci.nih.gov), dated January 22, 2019. In this 
amendment, the revised CAEPR for Crizotinib (Version 2.3, October 30, 2018) has been 
inserted in the protocol, and the associated risk information in the informed consent 
document has been revised accordingly.  
 
In addition, changes have been made in response to a RRA for SGN -35 (brentuximab 
vedotin) from  Dr. Elad Sharon (sharone@mail.nih.g ov), dated June 13, 2018. A notation 
has been made in the protocol to indicate that the SGN -35 arm is closed  to accrual and 
treatment and that the CAEPR will not be updated further. T he associated risk information 
in the informed consent document has been revised accordingly.  
 
Revisions to the protocol and consent document are detailed in the pages below.  
 
Please let me know if we can offer further information.

ABSTRACT  
Despite numerous treatment strategies over the last 20 years failure rates r emain 25 -30% for pediatric 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Two novel agents that have demonstrated high response rates as 
single agents in ALCL will be studied in this trial. Brentuximab vedotin (previously known as SGN35; 
currently marketed under t he brand name Adcetris) is an antibody -drug conjugate containing an anti -CD30 
monoclonal antibody linked to a tubulin inhibitor (monomethylauristatin E). After binding CD30, a 
transmembrane receptor expressed on all ALCLs, brentuximab vedotin is internaliz ed and the drug is 
released into the cytoplasm where it causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Tubulin inhibitors are active 
agents in ALCL as evidenced by responses using vincristine and vinblastine.  The response rate of 
brentuximab vedotin in patients w ith relapsed/refractory ALCL is impressive and the FDA has approved 
brentuximab vedotin for the treatment of patients with ALCL that have failed one line of therapy . Crizotinib 
is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases  including anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma kinase (ALK). ALK plays a central role in the pathogenesis of ALCL due to a chromosomal 
translocation that results in expression of an oncogenic kinase fusion protein. Crizotinib inhibits ALK 
phosphorylation result ing in antitumor activity. Crizotinib has also shown impressive response rates in 
patients with refractory/relapsed ALK positive ALCL.  
 
The primary aim of this pilot phase II study is to determine the toxicity and efficacy of the addition of two 
novel agen ts (brentuximab vedotin or crizotinib) to standard chemotherapy (best arm of ALCL99) in 
children with newly diagnosed ALCL. In this protocol, patients with newly diagnosed ALCL will be 
randomized to receive standard chemotherapy plus brentuximab vedotin (A rm BV) or standard 
chemotherapy plus crizotinib (Arm CZ).  All patients will initially receive a 5  day prophase followed by 6 
cycles of chemotherapy. The novel agent (either brentuximab vedotin or crizotinib) will start with C ycle 1 
and be given in all 6 cycles.  Each cycle lasts 21  days with the total therapy lasting approximately 19  weeks. 
Each arm wil l be evaluated for toxicity. Each arm will independently be evaluated for differences in EFS 
compared to historical data for ALCL99. A secondary aim of the trial will be to determine if minimal 
disease at diagnosis and/or minimal residual disease during tr eatment can identify patients at high risk of 
recurrence.  Minimal disseminated disease (MDD) and minimal residual disease  (MRD)  will be measured 
using peripheral blood at 3 separate time points (diagno sis, after prophase, and after C ycle 1). The r esults 
from this pilot p hase II study will provide necessary information to incorporate these novel agents into 
future trials and potentially improve the treatment of children with ALCL.

1.0 GOALS AN D OBEJCTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Aims  
1.1.1  Tolerability  
To determine the tolerability of brentuximab vedotin given in combination with 
standard chemotherapy (ALCL99) and to determine the tolerability of crizotinib 
given in combination with chemotherapy (ALCL99).  
 
1.1.2  Event Free Survival  
To estimate the Event Free Survival ( EFS) of Arm BV and Arm CZ and contrast 
these to historical control data.  
 
1.2 Secondary  Aim 
1.2.1  MDD/MRD  
To determine the prognostic significance of minimal disseminate d disease (MDD) 
at diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) as measured by RT - polymerase 
chain reaction ( PCR ) in peripheral blood.  
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a distinct form of non -Hodgkin lymphoma 
(NHL) which accounts for 10 -15% of all childhood lymphomas.1,2 First described in 1985 
by Stein et al.,3 ALCL is a T or null cell lymphoma char acterized by the malignant cell 
expression of CD30 (Ki -1). Despite numerous treatment strategies, EFS remains around 
70%.2,4-10 
Protocol  Stratification  Number  Duration (months)  EFS 
HM 89 / 91  None  82 8 66% 
NHL -BFM 90  Disease Stage  89 5 76% 
ALCL 99  Clinical Features  352 5 73% 
UKCCSG  Disease Stage  72 7-8 59% 
POG 9315  None  86 12 72% 
CCG 5941  None  86 12 68% 
LSA2 -L2 modified  None  34 24 65% 
 
ANHL0131 tested the substitution of vinblastine for vincristine in children with ALCL 
when given with APO (Doxorubicin, Prednisone, and Vincristine ) chemotherapy (52 
weeks of therapy). Results showed similar EFS to other studies and no benefit to the 
patients receiving the additional vinblastine (3 yr EFS of 75% for APO vs. 80% for APV, 
p = 0.73). The international ALCL99 trial used chemotherapy based  on BFM -NHL -90 
(duration of 4  months). The first randomization compared methotrexate 1 g/m2 
administered over 24 hours with intrathecal chemotherapy throughout therapy versus 
methotrexate 3  g/m2 administered over 3 hours with intrathecal chemotherapy only in 
prophase of therapy. Overall, 352 patients were randomized. While the 2 year EFS (73% 
versus 75%) did not differ between the 2 arms, the toxicity from the methotrexate 
administered over 3 hours was significantly less and the 2 CNS relapses both occurred  on 
the arm with 1 g/m2 and intrathecal chemotherapy.5 Therefore, it is now considered 
standard of care when using the ALCL99 regimen to use 3  g/m2 of methotrexate  over 
3 hours and intrathecal chemotherapy only in the prophase. The second randomization was

Version Date: 02/01/2019  13 
 
for patients with clinically “high -risk features”, i.e. involvement of skin, mediastinum, 
liver, lung and/or spleen. Patients were randomized to standard chemotherapy ± vinblastine 
weekly as maintenance for a total duration of 1 year of therapy. While vinb lastine delayed 
relapses, there was no difference in the 2 year EFS (73% versus 70%) in the 217 
randomized patients.10 Thus, the ALCL99 trial demonstrated a failure rate of 
approximately 30%, all but initial intrathecal chemotherapy can safely be omitted when 
using 3 g/m2 of methotr exate administered over 3 hours, and the addition of vinblastine 
maintenance did not improve EFS.  
 
While studies have used a wide range of chemotherapy strategies, no intervention has been 
able to improve on the approximate failure rate of 25 %-30% that exi sts regardless of 
treatment strategy. The addition of vinblastine, either with chemotherapy or as single agent 
in maintenance, failed to show any improvement in EFS in both the ANHL0131 and 
ALCL99 trials. CCG 5941 showed no advantage to intensifying multi -agent chem otherapy 
given over 11 months. Intensification with intermediate dose methotrexate and high dose 
cytarabine on an APO backbone did not improve outcome (POG 9315). Intensification 
with high dose cytarabine, etoposide and methotrexate did not impro ve outcome in high 
risk patients (NHL -BFM 95). The Italian group (AIEOP) was unable to demonstrate benefit 
of longer duration of therapy using a modified LSA2 -L2 acute leukemia regimen (duration 
2 years ; 65% EFS).  
 
In addition, progression while receiving chemotherapy portends a very poor prognosis in 
children with ALCL, with only 25% of patients who progress on therapy expected to 
survive even with aggressive salvage therapy, including allogeneic transplant.11,12 
Therefore, interventions that prevent relapse, especially on -therapy progression of disease, 
will have the g reatest impact on overall survival and toxicity.  
 
2.2 Brentuximab vedotin Background  
The CD30 antigen is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that is expressed on all 
systemic ALCL in children.13 Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30 targeted antibody (cAC10) 
conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Brentuximab vedotin binds to CD30, 
becomes internaliz ed, and then releases MMAE that causes apoptosis as an antitubulin 
agent.  
 
Preclinical data demonstrated that MMAE binds to the same site on tubulin as vinblastine. 
Using mouse xenografts of a Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), which also highly expresses 
CD30, cell line, Alley et al. were able to demonstrate that brentuximab vedotin had a peak 
tumor concentration 10 -30 fold greater than MMAE or vinblastine delivered in a non -
targeted fashion, or systemic administration.14 In addition, over a three day period, the 
tumor exposure to the anti -tubulin agent after brentuximab vedotin was 5 -10 fold higher 
than when given as a non -targeted agent.  
 
There have been two phase I studies of brentuximab vedotin involving patients with 
relapsed HL or ALCL.15-17 In the first phase I study, brentuximab vedotin was given every 
3 weeks. Of the 45 patients enrolled, 33 (73%) had previously received a stem cell 
transplant. Despite this high am ount of pretreatment, toxicity was tolerable. The most 
common toxicities were fatigue (40%), pyrexia (33%), peripheral neuropathy (31%), 
diarrhea (22%), nausea (22%), headache (20%), and vomiting (20%). The vast maj ority of 
these toxicities were G rade 1 or  2. In this study, the dose limiting toxicities were prostatitis, 
hyperglycemia, and unrelated acute renal failure. The dose recommended for future studies

Version Date: 02/01/2019  14 
 
was 1.8  mg/kg every 3  weeks. In addition, brentuximab vedotin was determined to be 
minimally immunog enic. Of the 45 patients treated, only 2 developed low levels of human 
anti-brentuximab vedotin antibody which showed no effect on cle arance of the drug. The 
second p hase I study gave brentuximab vedotin weekly with similar toxicities: fatigue 
(24%), perip heral neuropathy (18%), nausea (26%), neutropenia (18%), and 
hyperglycemia (12%). In  these p hase I trial s, 6/7 patients wi th ALCL had a complete 
response  and 1 had stable disease.  
 
A phase II multicenter trial using brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg every 3 we eks for 
patients over 12 years of age with relapsed or refractory ALCL has recently been 
completed.18,19 Brentuximab vedotin was adm inistered over 30 minutes as an outpatient 
every 3 weeks. A total of 58 patients were enrolled with an overall response rate of 86% 
(53% CR, 33% PR) and 97% of patients demonstrated tumor reduction. There was no 
difference between those patients who had ALK posi tive versus ALK negative ALCL. The 
responses have been durable, with the median duration of CR for patients off treatment not 
having been reached. Adverse events were manageable with  a toxicity profile similar to 
phase I study. The most common toxici ties were nausea (38%), peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (38%), fatigue (34%), pyrexia (33%), diarrhea  (29%), and neutropenia (21%). 
Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were rare (Grade 3/4: neutropenia 12%/9%, peripheral sensory 
neuropathy 10%/0%, thrombocytopenia 9%/5 %, anemia 7%/0%). Because brentuximab 
vedotin is an anti -tubulin agent, toxicities involving neuropathy were closely monitored. 
Grade 1/2, 3, or 4 toxicity rates included peripheral sensory neuropathy (28%,  10%, and 
0% respectively), pares thesias (5%, 0%, and 0%) and peripheral motor neuropathy (3%, 
2%, and 0%). Most patients (79%) showed improvement or resolution of their sympt oms 
over time. In addition, a p hase II multicenter trial using brentuximab vedotin 1.8  mg/kg 
every 3 weeks for patients over 12  years of age with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin 
Lymphoma enrolled 102 patients and had a similar toxicity profile.  
 
Brentuximab vedotin has recently been combined with chemotherapy for adults with newly 
diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma.20 Brentuximab vedotin was given in combination with 
ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) to 25  patients and in 
combination with AVD (no bleomycin) to 19 patients. In the ABVD cohort, 10 of 
25 patients developed pulmonary toxicity that prompted the change to AVD. Seven of the 
10 patients who developed pulmonary toxicity went on to receive brentuximab vedotin and 
AVD without any further pulmonary toxicity. None of the patients in the AVD cohort have 
experienced pulmonary toxicity. Of note,  there was minimal lung toxicity in the phase II 
single agent studies that included many patients who had lymphoma involvement of the 
lungs, suggesting that the pulmonary toxicity seen on this study was a result of the 
combination of brentuximab vedotin wi th bleomycin. Overall, 44 patients received 
brentuximab vedotin with chemotherapy and there were 0 DLTs observed concluding that 
a dose of 1.2  mg/kg every 2 weeks can be gi ven with AVD. The most common G rade 3+ 
toxicities occurring in the 44 patients were neutropenia (77%), anemia (14%), fever and 
neutropenia (11%), pulmonary toxicity (11%), dypsnea (9%), and syncope (9%). Of note, 
although 52% of patients had G rade 1 or 2 periphe ral neuropathy, no patient had G rade 3 
or 4 neuropathy.  
 
Brentuximab vedotin h as also been given with CH -P (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
prednisone) chemotherapy to newly diagnosed patients with ALCL. Patients were given 
brentuximab vedotin at 1.8  mg/kg ev ery 3 weeks with CH -P therapy. De-escalation was 
not required as none of the  initial six patients enrolled on this arm experienced a D ose

Version Date: 02/01/2019  15 
 
Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)  defined as greater than 7 day delay in chemotherapy 
administration. Of the 20 total patients who have received concurrent brentuximab and 
CH-P, the most common side effects have been rash (10%), fever neutro penia (20%), and 
nausea (25%). The authors concl ude that the recommended dose for brentuximab with 
CH-P chemotherapy is 1.8  mg/kg [personal communication, T -cell Lymphoma Forum Jan. 
2012] . 
 
In addition, brentuximab vedotin given in combination with gemcitabine (AHOD1221) is 
currently open to enrollment and will provide additional data as patients receive therapy.  
 
2.3 Crizotinib Background  
Pediatric ALCL is characterized by having the vast majority of cases express anaplastic 
large cell lymphoma kinase (ALK).21 ALK is a gene found on chromosome 2 and 
translocations affecting the ALK gene can result in the expression of oncogenic fusion 
proteins. The ALK protein is a fusion protein produced by a genetic translocation most 
commonly t(2;5) involving the ALK gene on chr omosome 2 and the nucleophosmine 
(NPM) gene on chromosome 5. The formation of ALK fusion proteins results in activation 
and dysregulation of the gene’s expression and signaling which can contribute to increased 
cell proliferation and survival in tumors exp ressing these proteins. The ALK protein has 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of pediatric ALCL.22  
 
Crizotinib is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases inclu ding ALK and Hepatocyte 
Growth F actor Receptor (HGFR, c -Met).  Crizotinib inhibits ALK phosphorylation 
resulting in antitumor activity. Crizotinib was found to poten tly inhibit cell proliferation in 
ALK positive ALCL cells but not ALK negative cells.23 Crizotinib  has also been shown to 
have antitumor activity in mice expressing tumors with the ALK fusion protein.  
 
Crizotinib has been evaluated in two single -arm adult clinical trials for the treatment of 
locally advanced or metastatic ALK -positive NSCLC.24 Among the 397 patients for whom 
information on deaths and serious adverse reactions are available, the most common 
adverse reactions (≥  25%) were  vision disorder, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, edema, and 
constipation. Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions in at least 4% of patients in both studies included 
increased ALT and neutropenia.  The rates of treatment -related adverse events resulting in 
permanent disco ntinuation were 6% in one study and 3% in the other. Serious adverse 
events in greater than or equal to 2% of patients included pneumonia, dyspnea, and 
pulmonary embolism.  
 
Crizotinib is also effective in treating patients with relapsed ALCL. A report from the New 
England Journal of Medicine reported 2 adult patients with recurrent ALK positive ALCL 
who achieved CRs after receiving single agent crizotinib.25 These authors updated their 
experience at the International Lymphoma Meeting in June 2011 reporting 2 additional 
patients with responses of CR and PR demonstrating clear activity in ALK positive ALCL . 
 
ADVL0912 is an ongoing p hase I1/II study of crizotinib in children with 
Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors, Primary CNS Tumors, and Anaplastic Large Cell 
Lymphoma. Seventy subjects have been enrolled on the pediatric phase 1 study of 
crizotinib including 8 with ALCL.26 The toxicity profile overall has been good with DLT 
reached in 2/7 patients at 215  mg/m2/dose BID and 1/6 at 365  mg/m2/dose BID. A separate 
stratum of 18 patients with known ALK mutations were enrolled at 1 dose level lower than 
A1 stratum. On e patient experienced a DLT of G rade 4 neutropenia. Eight patients with

Version Date: 02/01/2019  16 
 
ALCL have received crizotini b (6 at 165  mg/m2/dose BID which is roughly equivalent to 
the dose used in the adult studies and 2 at 280  mg/m2/dose BID). Of the 8 patients, there 
have been 7 CRs for a complete response rate of 88%. Many of these responses are ongoing 
as the patients are continuing to receive medication [personal communication - Y. Mosse ]. 
 
ADVL1212 is a recently opened study evaluating the safety and tolerability of crizotinib 
administered in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide or vincristine and 
doxorubicin.  As this study accrues, more information will be available to  support the safety 
of combination chemotherapy with crizotinib.  
 
2.4 Study Rationale  
 
2.4.1  Rationale for ALCL99  
Though APO regimen can be given as outpatient therapy, it is 52  weeks in 
duration. While ALCL99 therapy usually requires hospitalization, the duration is 
only 19 weeks. The APO regimen gives doxorubicin at a cumulative dose of 
300 mg/m2; whereas ALCL99 gives 150  mg/m2 total of doxorubicin. Additionally, 
the ALCL99 study demo nstrated that giving methotrexate (3  g/m2 over 3  hours ) 
resulted in less toxicity and no increased risk of CNS relapses, than methotrexate 
1 g/m2 given over 1  hour plus intrathecal therapy.  Lastly, the BFM finding of 
prognostic value of minimal disease and minimal residual disease was a 
retrospective, subset analysis of patients on BFM -NHL -90 and ALCL99. By using 
the ALCL99 for the backbone of chemotherapy, we will reduce the exposure to 
anthracycline, reduce intrathecal chemotherapy, reduce time in treatment, have the 
ability to compare results directly to the largest trial in pediatric ALCL, and have 
the opportunity to confirm or dispute the BFM findings regarding minimal disease 
and minimal  residual disease in a prospective fashion.  
 
2.4.2  Rationale for eligibility  
Patients must have disease that is both CD30 positive and ALK positive since these 
are the targets of brentuximab vedotin and crizotinib respectively. Patients with 
skin disease only will not be eligible as skin only disease exhibits very different 
characteristics than systemic disease. Since patients with central nervous system 
disease are rare and we do not want to cloud any neurological toxicity associated 
with either drug, pat ients with CNS  disease will not be eligible. Patients with Stage 
II, III, and IV disease will be eligible. Attarbaschi et al. demonstrated that patients 
with Stage II disease have similar EFS and OS as more advanced stage disease 
using ALCL -99 therapy.27 In addition, in a multivariate analysis of 225 children 
with ALCL of all stages, stage was not predictive of outcome.28 While recent COG 
trials have not included Stage II patients, there are no data that Stage II patients 
have a n outcome different than  patients with higher stage disease.  
 
2.4.3  Rationale for brentuximab vedotin and crizotinib  
Since all cases of ALCL express CD -30, this is an ideal target for directed therapy. 
Brentuximab vedotin is a unique antibody drug conjugate which delivers a tubulin 
inhibitor directly to the tumor cells. Tubulin inhibitors are active agents in ALCL 
as evi denced by responses using vincristine and vinblastine. The response rate 
using brentuximab vedotin as a single agent for patients with relapsed/refractory 
ALCL is impressive. We hypothesize that the toxicity will be tolerable and that 
this agent will be active and this agent will advance into larger, more definitive

studies. We plan to utilize a dose of 1.8  mg/kg every 3  weeks whi ch is the dose 
utilized in the p hase II trials for ALCL. This dose gives similar exposure to the 
1.2 mg/kg every 2 weeks that was  tolerable in combination with chemotherapy in 
the upfront Hodgkin lymphoma trial and is the current dose being evaluated with 
CH-P therapy in upfront ALCL. There will be a de -escalation of the dose should 
patients experience delays in chemotherapy as the DLT.  
 
Because pediatric ALCL is characterized by having the vast majority of cases 
express ALK and the ALK protein is postulated to be the oncogenic drive in the 
pathogenesis for pediatric ALCL, this is an ideal target for treatment.  The rationale 
for the use of inhibitors directed toward oncogenic tyrosine kinases that are 
genetically altered is supported by many recent examples such as imatinib in 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors with mutant c -Kit or chronic myelogenous 
leukemia with BCR -Abl gene translocations. Moreover, AALL0031 demonstrated 
remarkable clinical efficacy when combining a targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(imatinib) with standard chemotherapy for Ph+ ALL.  We hypothesize that the 
toxicity will be tolerable and that thi s agent will be active and this agent will 
advance into larger, more definitive studies. We plan to use the 165  mg/m2/dose 
BID dose as this has shown reasonable toxicity in ADVL0912 with excellent 
response rates.  
 
Despite numerous treatment strategies over  the last 20  years , failure rates remain 
25-30% for pediatric ALCL. This study proposes to randomize patients to 2 arms. 
Arm BV will add brentuximab vedotin to standard chemotherapy per ALCL99 
(3 g/m2 methotrexate and prophase i ntrathecal chemotherapy only ). Arm CZ will 
add crizotinib to standard chemotherapy per ALCL99 (3  g/m2 methotrexate and 
prophase intrathecal chemotherapy only). This design will allow for determination 
of toxicity of brentuximab vedotin and crizotinib with chemotherapy, as well as 
provide preliminary information on EFS when compared to historical controls. The 
results of this study will provide all the necessary information to design mo re 
definitive studies testing the benefit of novel agents in improving the outcome of 
children with A LCL.  
 
2.5 Biology  
 
2.5.1  Minimal Disseminated Disease (MDD) / Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)  
Clinical and histological characteristics have limited prognostic value in children 
with ALCL. As the majority of ALCL in children possess a genetic translocation 
involving the anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase ( ALK) gene,21 a polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) for NPM -ALK  provides an ideal platform to assess minimal 
disease. In a report from Damm -Welk et al., minimal disease in bone marrow or 
peripheral blood found by PCR at diagnosis identified a group of patients with a 
high incidence of relapse.29 Overall there was a cumulative incidence of relapse of 
50% for the 38 patients who were PCR positive and a cumulative incidence of 
relapse of 15% for the 42 patients who were PCR negative (p  < 0.001). In 
multivariate analysis, the r elative risk of relapse for patients with quantitative PCR 
positive bone marrow was 4.74 (p=0.006) but only 1.67 (p  = 0.32) for the clinical 
risk features previously considered high risk by some groups.28,29 In multivariate 
analysis, the relative risk of relapse for patients with qualitative PCR positive bone 
marrow was 3.47 (p  = 0.028). Although fewer samples were tested in peripheral

Version Date: 02/01/2019  18 
 
blood, there was a high concordance rate (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.84; 
p < .001) between the bone marrow PCR results and the peripheral blood PCR 
results. Overall, both quantitative and qualitati ve PCR in either peripher al blood 
or bone marrow identified  high risk patients in this small selection of patients.  
 
Since minimal disease at diagnosis may be prognostic, it follows that minimal 
residual disease during therapy may also hold prognostic sign ificance. Defining 
MRD  as qualitative PCR positivity, the same researchers who studied minimal 
disease at diagnosis , examin ed minimal residual disease at D ay 6 and after course 
1, in a very limited number of samples. Minimal residual disease at both time 
points identified patients at higher risk for relapse (personal communication - W. 
Woessman ). We hypothesize that MDD/MRD  will be of great importance in the 
future of treatment for ALCL allowing us to identify patients early in treatment 
who have a high risk  of recurrence.  
 
2.6 Thromboembolic  Background  
Thromboembolic adverse events, which are frequently multifactorial in causality, have 
been reported with many of the chemotherapy agents given on ANHL12P1 including 
crizotinib and brentuximab vedotin. Amendmen t #5 modified the ANHL12P1 protocol and 
consent document to reflect the potential risk of thromboembolic events. Further evaluation 
of the thromboembolic events on this trial has been undertaken. Briefly, there have been 
15 thromboembolic events on ANHL12P 1 as of September 27, 2017 (4 subjects had a 
pulmonary embolism (2 of 4 known to be catheter -related) and 11 had a catheter -related 
clot). Nine of the catheter -related thromboses (6 in Arm CZ and 3 in Arm BV) have been 
asymptomatic and discovered on routin e tests (echo or CT) for other purposes. One 
catheter -related thrombosis (Arm CZ) was symptomatic with neck discomfort from the 
central line migrating position into the neck and another (Arm BV) was symptomatic with 
arm swelling. The incidence point estima te for a Grade 2+ Adverse Event of a catheter -
related thrombosis is 17.1% (95% CI 7.2% –32.1%) on Arm CZ and 6.0% (95% CI 1.7% –
14.6%) on Arm BV with the larger CI for Arm CZ mostly due to fewer patients enrolled 
to date on that arm. All 4 pulmonary emboli o ccurred on Arm CZ (giving an incidence 
point estimate of 9.8%; 95% CI 2.7% –23.1%). No deaths have occurred due to 
thromboembolic events. The increased risk of thromboembolic events in Arm CZ has 
resulted in the requirement to use anticoagulation for prophy laxis  as of Amendment #6A .

Regulatory Office or compliance communicated per protocol instructions . 
 
3.1.3  Study Enrollment  
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment 
Network (OPEN). OPEN is a web -based registration system available on a 24/7 
basis. To access OPEN, the site user must have an active CTEP -IAM account 
(check at  https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ) and a 'Registrar' role on either the lead 
protocol organization (LPO) or participating organization roster.  Registrars must 
hold a minimum of an AP registration type. If a DTL is required for the study, the 
registrar(s) must also be assigned the OPEN Registrar task on the DTL.  
 
All site staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study. It is integrated with the 
CTSU Enterprise Sys tem for regulatory and roster data and, upon enrollment, 
initializes the patient position in the Rave database . OPEN can be accessed at 
https://open.ctsu.org  or from the OPEN tab on the CTSU members’ side of the 
website at https://www.ctsu.org . To assign a n IVR or NPIVR as the treating, 
crediting, consenting, drug shipment (IVR only), or investigator receiving a 
transfer in OPEN, the IVR or NPIVR must list on their Form FDA 1572 in RCR 
the IRB number us ed on the site’s IRB approval. If a DTL is required for  the study, 
the IVR or NPIVR must also be assigned the appropriate OPEN -related tasks on 
the DTL.  
 
Prior to accessing OPEN, site staff should verify the following:  
• All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes.  
• All patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA 
authorization form (if applicable).  
 
Note:  The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of 
registration and treatment information.  Please print this confirmation for your records.  
 
Further instructional information is  provided on the CTSU  members' web site 
OPEN tab or within the OPEN URL ( https://open.ctsu.org ). For any additional 
questions contact the CTSU Help Desk at 1 -888-823-5923 or

Version Date: 02/01/2019  21 
 
 
3.1.5  Randomization  
Randomization will take place at the time a patient is enrolled via OPEN.  
Eligible patients will be stratified as follows:  
• Stratum 1 : Patients with BSA ≥ 0.9  m2  
• Stratum 2 : Patients with BSA < 0.9  m2  
 
Eligible patients in Stratum 1 will be randomized (1:1) to Arm BV or Arm CZ.  
Eligible patients in Stratum 2 will be non -randomly assigned to Arm BV becaus e 
crizotinib is only available in certain strengths.  
 
3.1.5.1  Two exceptions to randomization:  
1) If one arm is temporarily closed, patients will be non -randomly assigned 
to the other arm.   
2) If Arm BV is temporarily closed and the patient is < 0.9 m2, then the 
patient  is not eligible for the study.  
 
3.2 Patient Eligibility  Criteria  
Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and 
cannot be waived (per COG policy posted 5/11/01).  All clinical and laboratory data 
require d for determining eligibility of a patient enrolled on this trial must be available 
in the patient's medical/research record that will serve as the source document for 
verification at the time of audit.  
 
All clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 
7 days prior to enrollment unless otherwise indicated.  Laboratory values used to 
assess eligibility must be no older than seven (7) days at the start of therapy. 
Laboratory tests need not be repeated if therap y starts within seven (7) days of 
obtaining labs to assess eligibility. If a post -enrollment lab value is outside the limits 
of eligibility, or laboratory values are >  7 days old, then the following laboratory 
evaluations must be re -checked within 48  hours  prior to initiating therapy: CBC with 
differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum creatinine.  If the recheck is outside 
the limits of eligibility, the patient may not receive protocol therapy and will be 
considered off protocol therapy. Imaging studies , if applicable,  must be obtained 
within 2  weeks prior to start of protocol therapy (repeat the tumor imaging if 
necessary).

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72  hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG 
administrative Policy 5.14 (ex cept where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan 
 
Eligible patients will be stratified as follows:  
• Stratum 1: Patients with BSA  ≥ 0.9 m2  
• Stratum 2: Patients with BSA  < 0.9 m2  
 
At study enrollment:  
• Eligible patients in Stratum 1 will be randomized (1:1) to Arm BV or Arm CZ.  
• Eligible patients in Stratum 2 will be non -randomly assigned to Arm BV because 
crizotinib is only available in certain strengths.  
 
Arm BV : Patients receive standard chemotherapy plus brentuximab vedotin . 
 
Arm CZ: Patients receive standard chemotherapy  plus crizotinib . 
 
Two exceptions to randomization:  
1) If one arm is temporarily closed, patients will be non -randomly assigned to the other arm.  
2) If Arm BV is temporarily closed and the patient is < 0.9 m2, then the patient is not eligible 
for the study.  
 
All patients will receive a 5 day prophase followed  by alternating C ourses (A and B) 
administered every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles  (3 cycles of C ourse A and 3 cycles of 
Course B). The study agents will begin on Day 1 of Cycle 1  following the prophase.  Growth 
factors are not required but will be permit ted as the standard chemotherapy backbone 
causes neutropenia and both brentuximab vedotin and crizotinib have been shown to cause 
neutropenia. If used, t he use of growth factor should be reported.  
 
4.1.1  Supportive Care Guideline s 
 
• Thromboembolic events are known side effects of chemotherapy and/or the 
presence of a central venous catheter. Many thromboembolic events have 
multifactorial causes. Whenever possible, treating physicians should make 
every attempt to eliminate additional r isk factors such as tobacco use, 
dehydration, concomitant medications, etc. that increase the risk for 
thrombosis.  
 
• Tumor Lysis: Patients with massive tumor burden should be hydrated prior to 
initiation of chemotherapy and monitored for tumor lysis syndrom e. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  25 
 
• Prophylactic anticoagulation is re quired  for patients on Arm CZ due to the 
potential risk of thromboemb olic events (see Section 2.6). Anticoagulation 
may be implemented according to each institution’s standard of care for 
prophylactic anticoagulation O R utilizing low molecular weight heparin with 
a goal Anti -Xa of 0.1 -0.3 units/mL. More information can be found at : 
https://childrensoncologygroup.org/dow nloads/COG_SC_Thrombosis_Guide
line_Document.pdf .  
It is important to note potential drug interactions between the 
chemotherapeutic agents on Arm CZ  and certain anticoagulation medications 
(including but not limited to warfarin , apixab an, and rivaroxaban).  
 
• Risk of bleeding secondary to chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia 
should be minimized using platelet transfusions according to each institution’s 
standard of care for thrombocytopenic patients receiving anticoagulation.  
 
• Central venous line: Insertion o f a central venous line is recommended prior 
to the administration of treatment. Two lumens are preferred for ease in 
chemotherapy administration. This may have to be delayed in the event of a 
large mediastinal mass, being a contraindication to surgery.  
 
• Mucositis: Mucositis is expected particularly after C ourse B  (Cycles 2, 4, and 
6). Patients  should be instructed on the importance of meticulous oral hygiene 
to reduce oral infections and prevent mucositis.  
 
• Anti-emetics: Anti-emetics s hould be given during each chemotherapy cycle . 
Steroids should not be used as anti -emetic therapy.  
 
• Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia prophylaxis: Appropriate prophylaxis 
should be given per institutional standards.  
 
For COG Supportive Care Guidelines see:  
https://childrensoncologygroup.org/cog -supportive -care-guidelines . 
 
4.1.2  Concomitant Therapy Restrictions  
 
• Strong  inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A  enzymes should be avoided.  
 
• See Appendix IV  for full list.  
 
• The metabolism of the two investigational agents (crizotinib and brentuximab 
vedotin) is predominantly mediated by the CYP3 A isozymes. Co-
administration with drugs  that are CYP3A inhibitors and inducers may change 
the plasma concentrations of crizotinib  and/or brentuximab vedotin  in humans. 
The chronic concurrent use of potent CYP3A inhibitors and potent CYP3A 
inducers (with the exception of protocol defined therapy ) must be avoided until 
treatment discontinuation. The list of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers 
in Appendix IV  should be avoided whenever possible, and therapeutic 
alternatives to these agents are recommended. P lease see Appendix IV  for a 
list of common substrates, inhibitors, and inducers of CYP3A4.

4.3 Course A (21 days) – Arm BV  (Cycles 1, 3 and 5)  
Peripheral blood for minimal residual disease (MRD) shou ld be drawn prior to 
beginning C ycle 1.  (Time point #2)  
 
Cycle 1 should begin on Day 6 of the prophase. Cycles 3 and 5 should begin on Day 2 2 of 
the previous cycle when peripheral counts have recovered with ANC ≥ 500/mm3 and 
platelets  ≥ 50,000/mm3 (whichever occurs later) . Therapy may be delayed for severe 
complication . The use of growth factors should be noted if they are administered.  
 
Brentuximab vedotin : IV over 30  minutes  (Do NOT give as IV push)  
Day 1  
Dose: 1.8 mg/kg/dose.  (Maximum dose is 180 mg)  
 
Special precautions : Brentuximab should be administered on Day 1 prior to other 
chemotherapy.  Brentuximab vedotin should be administered over approximately 30 
minutes and cannot be mixed with other medications. In-line filters should not be used 
during the IV admi nistration.  
 
Dosing is based on patient weight according to the institutional standard. Actual weight 
will be used except for patients weighing greater than 100 kg; the dose for patients with 
weight greater than 100 kg will be calculated based on 100 kg.  
 
Dilute reconstituted product in either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, Lactated 
Ringer’s solution, USP, or dextrose 5% in water (D5W), USP. The final concentration of 
brentuximab vedotin in infusion bag should be in the range of 0.4 –1.8 mg/mL.  Refer t o 
Section 6.1 for additional details.  
 
Dexamethasone: PO (may admin ister IV if patient unable to take oral medications)  
Days : 1-5 
Dose: 5 mg/m2/dose BID on Days 1-5. 
 
Each dose may be adjusted upward to the nearest 0.25 mg as necessary for tablet size. 
Liquid preparations are also acceptable. Intravenous preparation may be used temporarily 
as needed.  
 
Ifosfamide: IV over 60 minutes  
Days : 1-5 
Dose: 800  mg/m2/dose  once a day . On Day 1 administer prior to methotrexate. Mesna use 
as described below.  
 
Suggested hydration : Prehydrate at 125  mL/m²/hour with a fluid containing D5W/0.45% 
NaCl or 0.9% NaCl. Achieve urine specific gravity  ≤ 1.010 prior to start of ifosfamide. 
Consider adding potassium and magnesium to pre vent electrolyte deficiencies. After 
completion of ifosfamide, continue hydration with fluids as recommended for 
methotrexate. Following clearance of the methotrexate, patient should receive IV or oral 
fluids at a rate of 3000  mL/m2/day unt il 12 hours after the last dose of ifosfamide.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  29 
 
Mesna : IV over 15 minutes (or continuous infusion as below)  
Days : 1-5 
Dose: 160 mg/m2/dose IV at hours 0  (either 15 minutes prior to or concurrently with 
ifosfamide) , 4, and 8 following ifosfamide daily . 
 
When administered intravenously, the total daily mesna dose is equal to 60% of the daily 
ifosfamide dose and is administered in 3 divided doses. For example, if the dose of 
ifosfamide is 1000  mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600 mg; 200 mg of mesna w ill 
be given 15 minutes before or with the ifosfamide dose (Hour 0) and 2 boluses of 200 mg 
each w ill be given at Hours 4 and 8. Mesna can also be administered as a continuous IV 
infusion.  The continuous infusion should be started 15 -30 minutes before or a t the same 
time as the ifosfamide and finished no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifosfamide 
infusion.  For example, if the dose of ifosfamide is 1000  mg, then the total daily mesna dose 
is 600  mg; the 600  mg mesna continuous infusion will start 15 -30 minutes before or at the 
same time as the ifosfamide and be completed no sooner than 8 hours after the end  of the 
ifosfamide infusion . If continuous infusion mesna is required, it should be given through a 
separate IV from the bicarbonate IVFs. Alterna tively, mesna may be given orally as 
described below.  
 
Patients able to tolerate oral mesna may receive the second and/or the third dose(s) by 
mouth at a dosage of 40% of the ifosfamide dose. The first dose of mesna should be given 
intravenously. The oral  dose of mesna is twice the IV dose and each oral dose should be 
given 2  hours earlier than an intravenous dose would be given. For example, if the dose of 
ifosfamide is 1000  mg, the first MESNA dose would be 200  mg IV at the time of the 
ifosfamide dose, f ollowed by oral doses of 400  mg at hours 2 and 6, rather than at hours 4 
and 8.  If a dose is missed, administer dose immediately. Give the next scheduled dose 
according to the original dosing schedule. Do not deviate from the original schedule. Notify 
provider i f a dose is delayed or missed. If the patient vomits within  2 hours following an 
oral dose, repeat the oral dose or administer  an IV dose of mesna.  
 
Methotrexate : IV over 3 hours  
Day 1  
Dose: 3000  mg/m2/dose.  
 
HD MTX Infusion Guidelines  
Methotrexate should be given on Day 1 at least 2 hours after the completion of brentuximab 
vedotin, after Day 1 ifosfamide dose, and when urine parameters are met.  
 
Hold trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP -SMX) and any nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory medications, penicillins, proton pump inhibitors or aspirin -containing 
medications on the day of HD MTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after the start of the 
HD MTX infusion and until the MTX level is less than 0.1 μM /L. 
 
Suggested h ydration: Prehydrate with D5 ¼ NS with 30  mEq NaHCO3/L at 125 
mL/m2/hour for a minimum of 2  hours beginning after completion of brentuximab vedotin 
and until urine output  is > 100  mL/m2/hour and  pH is  ≥ 7.0. Ringers Lactate may be used 
as the initial fluid if a bicarbonate containing solution is unavailable. Adjust fluid volume 
and sodium bicarbonate to maintain urine output  and pH at above parameters. A 
bicarbonate bolus (25  mEq/m2 over 15 minutes) may b e given to raise the urine pH 
relatively quickly;  a normal saline bolus may also be helpful in facilitating hydration. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  30 
 
Continue hydration and alkalinization throughout MTX infusion  until level is  < 0.1  μM/L 
(hydrate for a minimum of 48  hours after MTX  comp letion ). Sodium bicarbonate is 
incompatible with many medications; infuse via separate line or lumen unless compatibility 
is known.   
 
Methotrexate levels: Hours 24, 48 and at least every 24  hours until level is < 0.1  μM/L:  
Draw  MTX level and serum creatinine . For SCr > 125% of baseline or for MTX levels 
exceeding 50  μM/L at 24 hours or desired levels at any other time point, increase hydration 
to 200  mL/m2/hr.  
 
Leucovorin: IV  or PO  
Begin  24 hours from the start of methotrexate  infusion  
Dose: 15  mg/m2/dose every 6 hours until MTX level is < 0. 1 µM/L . 
 
IV push or short infusion: Inject by IV push over a minimum of 3 minutes or by short 
infusion over 15 to 120  minutes. Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, 
no more than 160  mg of leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16  mL of 
a 10 mg/mL solution per minute). IV leucovorin and sodium  bicarbonate are incompatible.  
 
Oral: Administer with or without food. Doses  > 25 mg should be given IV due to the  
saturation of absorption.  If the level does not fall as expected, increase the leucovorin as 
shown below :

Brentuximab vedotin: IV over 30 minutes  (Do NOT give as IV push)  
Day 1  
Dose: 1.8  mg/kg/dose. (Maximum dose is 180  mg) 
 
Special precautions : Brentuximab should be administered on Day 1 prior to other 
chemotherapy. Brentuximab vedotin should be administered over approximately 30 
minutes and cannot be mixed with other medications. In-line filters should not be used 
during the IV administration.  
 
Dosing is based on patient weight according to the institutional standard. Actual weight 
will be used except for patients weighing greater than 100  kg; the dose for patients with 
weight greater than 100 kg will be calculated based on 100  kg. 
 
Dilute reco nstituted product in either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, Lactated 
Ringer’s solution, USP, or dextrose 5% in water (D5W), USP. The final concentration of 
brentuximab vedotin in infusion bag should be in the range of 0.4 –1.8 mg/mL.  
 
Dexamethasone: PO  (may administer  IV if patient unable to take oral medications)  
Days 1 -5 
Dose: 5  mg/m2/dose BID on Days 1 -5. 
 
Each dose may be adjusted upward to the nearest 0.25  mg as necessary for tablet size.

Methotrexate: IV over 3 hours  
Day 1  
Dose: 3000  mg/m2/dose.  
 
HD MTX Infusion Guidelines  
Methotrexate should be given on Day 1 at least 2 hours after the completion of brentuximab 
vedotin, after Day 1 cyclophosphamide dose, and when urine parameters are met.  
 
Hold trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP -SMX) and any nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory medications, penicillins, proton pump inhibitors or aspirin -containing 
medications on the day of HD MTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after the start of the 
HD MTX infusion and until the MTX level is less than 0.1  μM/L. 
 
Suggested hydration: Prehydrate with D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq NaHCO 3/L at 125 
mL/m2/hour for a minimum of 2  hours beginning after completion of brentuximab vedotin 
and until urine output is > 100  mL/m2/hour and pH is  ≥ 7.0. Ringers Lactate may be used 
as the initial fluid if a bicarbonate containing solution is unavailable. Adjust fluid volume 
and sodium bicarbonate to maintain urine  output and pH at above parameters. A 
bicarbonate bolus (25  mEq/m2 over 15  minutes) may be given to raise the urine pH 
relatively quickly; a normal saline bolus may also be helpful in facilitating hydration. 
Continue hydration and alkalinization throughout  MTX infusion until level is < 0.1  μM/L 
(hydrate for a minimum of 48  hours after MTX completion).  Sodium bicarbonate is 
incompatible with many medications; infuse via separate line or lumen unless compatibility 
is known .  
 
Methotrexate levels: Hours 24, 48  and at least every 24 hours until level is  < 0.1 μM/L:  
Draw MTX level and serum creatinine.  
 
For SCr  > 125% of baseline or for MTX levels exceeding 50  μM/L at 24  hours or desired 
levels at any other time point, increase hydration to 200  mL/m2/hr.  
 
Leucovorin: IV or PO  
Begin 24  hours from the start of methotrexate infusion  
Dose: 15  mg/m2/dose every 6 hours until MTX level is  < 0.1 µM/L.  
 
IV push or short infusion: Inject by IV push over a minimum of 3 minutes or by short 
infusion over 15 to 120  minut es. Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, 
no more than 160  mg of leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16  mL of 
a 10 mg/mL solution per minute). IV leucovorin and sodium  bicarbonate are incompatible.  
 
Oral: Administer with or without food. Doses  > 25 mg should be given IV due to the 
saturation of absorption.

4.5 Course A (21 days) – Arm CZ (Cycles 1, 3 and 5)  
Prophylactic anticoagulation is required for all patients on Arm CZ starting with the 
first dose of crizotinib. See Sections 2.6  and 4.1.1  for detail.  
 
Peripheral blood for minimal residual disease (MRD) should be drawn pri or to 
beginning C ycle 1. (Time point #2)  
 
Cycle 1 should begin on Day 6 of the prophase. Cycles 3 and 5 should begin on Day 2 2 of 
the previous cycle when peripheral counts have recovered with ANC ≥ 500/mm3 and 
platelets ≥  50,000/mm3 (whichever occurs later).  Therapy may be delayed for severe 
complication.  
 
The use of growth factors should be noted if they are administered.  
 
Crizo tinib: PO BID 
Day: 1 -21 
Dose: 165  mg/m2/dose  (Refer to Appendix V  for dosing nomogram)  
 
For patients receiving crizotinib , the capsules should not be opened and must be swallowed 
whole. If a dose is missed or forgotten at the due time, it can be taken up to (but not greater 
than) 6 hours later to help prevent missed doses.  If a patient vomits after a dose, it should 
not be repeated. See Section 6.2  regarding administration ins tructions. Refer to the dosing 
nomogram in Appendix V  for correct dose . Drug doses should be adjusted based on the 
BSA determined based on height and weight obtained within one week prior to the 
beginning of eac h cycle.  
 
Dexamethasone: PO (may administer IV if patient unable to take oral medications)  
Days: 1 -5 
Dose: 5  mg/m2/dose BID on Days 1 -5. 
 
Each dose may be adjusted upward to the nearest 0.25 mg as necessary for tablet size. 
Liquid preparations are also acceptable. Intravenous preparation may be used temporarily 
as needed.  
 
Ifosfamide: IV over 60 minutes  
Days: 1 -5 
Dose: 800  mg/m2/dose  once a day . On Day 1 administer prior to methotrexate. Mesna use 
as described below.  
 
Suggested hydration : Prehydrate at 125  mL/m²/hour with a fluid containing D5W/0.45% 
NaCl or 0.9% NaCl.  Achieve urine specific gravity ≤ 1.010 prior to start of ifosfamide. 
Consider adding potassium and magnesium to prevent electrolyte deficiencies. After 
completion of ifosfami de, continue hydration with fluids as recommended for 
methotrexate. Following clearance of the methotrexate, patient should receive IV or oral 
fluids at a rate of 3000  mL/m2/day until 12 hours after the last dose of ifosfamide.  
 
Mesna: IV over 15 minutes ( or continuous infusion as below)  
Days: 1 -5 
Dose: 160  mg/m2/dose IV at hours 0, 4, and 8 following ifosfamide daily.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  38 
 
When administered intravenously, the total daily mesna dose is equal to 60% of the daily 
ifosfamide dose and is administered in 3 divided do ses. For example, if the dose of 
ifosfamide is 1000  mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 600  mg; 200  mg of mesna will 
be given 15 minutes before or with the ifosfamide dose (Hour 0) and 2 boluses of 200  mg 
each will be given at Hours 4 and 8. Mesna can also be administered as a continuous IV 
infusion. The continuous infusion should be started 15 -30 minutes before or at the same 
time as the ifosfamide and finished no sooner than 8 hours after the end of the ifosfamide 
infusion. For example, if the dos e of ifosfamide is 1000  mg, then the total daily mesna dose 
is 600  mg; the 600  mg mesna continuous infusion will start 15 -30 minutes before or at the 
same time as the ifosfamide/cyclophosphamide and be completed no sooner than 8 hours 
after the end  of the ifosfamide in fusion.  If continuous infusion mesna is required, it should 
be given through a separate IV from the bicarbonate IVFs. Alternatively, mesna may be 
given orally as described below.  
 
Patients able to tolerate oral mesna may receive the second an d/or the third dose(s) by 
mouth at a dosage of 40% of the ifosfamide dose.  The first dose of mesna should be given 
intravenously. The oral dose of mesna is twice the IV dose and each oral dose should be 
given 2 hours earlier than an intravenous dose would be given. For example, if the dose of 
ifosfamide is 1000  mg, the first MESNA dose would be 200  mg IV at the time of the 
ifosfamide dose, followed by oral doses of 400  mg at hours 2 and 6, rather than at hours 4 
and 8.  If a dose is missed, administer dose i mmediately. Give the next scheduled dose 
according to the original dosing schedule. Do not deviate from the original schedule. Notify 
provider if a dose is delayed or missed. If the patient vomits within 2  hours following an 
oral dose, repeat the oral dose  or administer  an IV dose of mesna.  
 
Methotrexate: IV over 3 hours  
Day 1  
Dose: 3000  mg/m2/dose.  
 
HD MTX Infusion Guidelines  
Methotrexate should be given on Day 1 after Day 1 ifosfamide dose and when urine 
parameters are met.  
 
Hold trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP -SMX) and any nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory medications, penicillins, proton pump inhibitors or aspirin -containing 
medications on the day of HD MTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after the start of the 
HD MTX infusion  and until the MTX level is less than 0.1 μM /L. 
 
Suggested hydration: Prehydrate with D5 ¼ NS with 30  mEq NaHCO 3/L at 
125 mL/m2/hour for a minimum of 2  hours and until urine output is > 100  mL/m2/hour and 
pH is  ≥ 7.0. Ringers Lactate may be used as the initial fluid if a bicarbonate containing 
solution is unavailable. Adjust fluid volume and sodium bicarbonate to maintain urine 
output and pH at above parameters. A bicarbonate bolus (25  mEq/m2 over 15 minutes) may 
be given to raise the urine pH relatively  quickly; a normal saline bolus may also be helpful 
in facilitating hydration.  Continue hydration and alkalinization through out MTX infusion 
until level is  < 0.1 μM/L (hydrate for a minimum of 48 hours after MTX completion).  
Sodium bicarbonate is incompati ble with many medications; infuse via separate line or 
lumen unless compatibility is known.   
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  39 
 
Methotrexate levels: Hours 24, 48  and at least every 24  hours until level is < 0.1 μM/L : 
Draw MTX level and serum creatinine.  For SCr > 125% of baseline or for MTX levels 
exceeding 50  μM/L at 24  hours or desired levels at any other time point, increase hydration 
to 200  mL/m2/hr.  
 
Leucovorin: IV or PO  
Begin 24  hours from the start of methotrexate infusion  
Dose: 15  mg/m2/dose every 6  hours until MTX level is < 0.1  µM/L.  
 
IV push or short infusion: Inject by IV push over a minimum of 3 minutes or by short 
infusion over 15 to 120  minutes. Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, 
no more than 160  mg of leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16  mL of 
a 10 mg/mL solution per minute). IV leucovorin and sodium  bicarbonate are incompatible.  
 
Oral: Administer with or without food. Doses > 25  mg should be given IV due to the 
saturation of absorption.  
 
If the level does not fall as expected, increase the leucovorin as shown below:

infusion over 15 to 120 minutes. Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, 
no more than 160 mg of leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16  mL of 
a 10 mg/mL solution per minute).  IV leucovorin and sodium bicarbonate are incompatible.  
 
Oral: Administer with or without food. Doses  > 25 mg should be given IV due to the 
saturation of absorption.  
 
If the level does not fall as expected, increase the leucovorin as shown below:

Event  CTCAE.v4.0 
Grade  Action to be Taken  
Allergic reactions,  
or  
Acute infusional 
reactions/ cytokine 
release syndrome  Grade 1 -2 
 For first reaction:  
• Hold the infusion and wait 30 to 60  minutes (depending upon the 
reaction severity) . 
• Treat reactions with diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg (max 50  mg), or 
follow local institution guidelines. Depending on the reaction 
severity, dexamethasone 0.2  mg/kg (max 10  mg) IV should be used . 
• Upon resolution of the symptoms, at the physician’s discretion, it may 
be possible to resume treatment by administering an H2 blocker 
approximately 30  minutes before restarting the infusion. 
Acetaminophen can also be considered. Dosing of SGN -35 should be 
administered at half of the previously administered rate . 
For subsequent doses:   
• Utilize diphenhydramine with or without acetaminophen as pre -
treatment for all subsequent infusions.   
• Dosing should be administered over the shortest period that was well 
tolerated.  
If Grade 1 -2 infusion reactions recur despite the above measures, either 
during re -challenge or subsequent treatments:  
• Take the measures outline d above . 
• With subsequent dosing, add dexamethasone 0.2  mg/kg (max 10  mg) 
IV or equivalent to medications above prior to infusion .

Version Date: 02/01/2019  46 
 
Event  CTCAE.v4.0 
Grade  Action to be Taken  
Grade 3  • Stop infusion immediately.  
• Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 1  mg/kg IV (max 50 mg), 
dexamethasone 0.2  mg/kg (max 10 mg) IV (or equivalent), 
bronchodilators for bronchospasms, and other medications as 
medically indicated.  
• Once symptoms recover, brentuximab vedotin should not be resumed 
for that course.  
• Subsequent courses of brentuximab vedotin may be considered at 
physicians’ discretion, after a discussion and approval by CTEP.  
• All subsequent infusions should use the following premedications 
prior to infusion, diphenhydramine hydrochloride 1  mg/kg IV (m ax 
50 mg), dexamethasone 0.2  mg/kg (max 10  mg) IV (or equivalent). In 
addition, the infusion should be administered at 50% of the previous 
infusion rate.  
Grade 4  • Stop infusion immediately . 
• Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 1  mg/kg (max 50  mg) IV, 
dexamethasone 0.2  mg/kg (max 10  mg) IV (or equivalent), and other 
anaphylaxis medications as indicated . 
• Epinephrine or bronchodilators should be administered as indicated . 
• Hospital admission for observation may be indicated . 
• Discontinue SGN -35. 
Anaphylaxis  Any Grade  • If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue 
administration of SGN -35 and administer appropriate medical therapy . 
Pancreatitis  Grade 2  • Withhold dose until toxicity has returned to baseline, then continue on 
protocol therapy but should resume at one dose reduction.  
• If Grade 2 pancreatitis recurs after one dose reduction, the patient must 
be removed from protocol therapy.  
Grade 3 -4 • Permanently discontinue brentuximab vedotin.  
Peripheral Neuropathy  Grade 1  • Continue at same dose level . 
Grade 2  • Reduce dose by one level and continue treatment. If already dose 
reduced previously then continue dosing at that level.  
Grade 3  • Treatment should be delayed up to 1 week after all other parameters to 
proceed are met to see if neuropathy improves to ≤ Grade 2. If 
neuropathy returns to ≤ Grade 2  then proceed with next treatment 
reduced by one dose level. If neuropathy remains Grade  3 then SGN -
35 should be held and then reduced by one dose level for subsequent 
treatments assuming neuropathy has returned to ≤ Grade 2 . 
• Patients who develop G rade 3 neuropathy after dose reduction of 
SGN -35 will have  SGN -35 discontinued  
Grade 4  • Discontinue SGN -35.

Event  CTCAE.v4.0 
Grade  Action to be Taken  
Pneumonitis  Grade 1  • Continue at same dose level.  
Grade 2  • If suspected, strongly consider administration of 100 mg of oral or 
intravenous prednisolone in single daily or t wo divided doses. The 
suggested dose for patients who develop pulmonary toxicity is 
methylprednisolone 1  mg/kg IV every 12 hours for a minimum of 
seven days.  
• Upon occurrence of pneumonitis, study therapy should be held, and 
the Study Chair and Research Coordinator should be notified within 
48 hours.  
• CTEP must  be notified within 7 days of study chair notification of each 
instance of Grade 2 pneumonitis. The Study Chair and CTEP will 
review the history of the affected patient and the pulmonary toxicity 
for the trial as a whole before proceeding with the recommen dation to 
resume protocol therapy at a lower dose level. Failure to discuss a case 
of pulmonary toxicity will lead to suspension of accrual.  
Grade 3 -4 • If suspected, strongly consider administration of 100 mg of oral or 
intravenous prednisolone in sing le daily or two divided doses. The 
suggested dose for patients who develop pulmonary toxicity is 
methylprednisolone 1  mg/kg IV every 12 hours for a minimum of 
seven days.  
• Discontinue brentuximab vedotin.  
• The Study Chair and Research Coordinator should be notified within 
48 hours . 
• CTEP must be notified within 7 days of the notification of the 
Study Chair.  
Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy 
(PML)  Any Grade  If PML is suspected, a diagnosti c work -up should be performed. The work -
up may include, but is not limited to the following:  
• Neurologic examinations and neurology consultation, as warranted.  
• Brain MRI. Features suggestive of PML include presence of unifocal 
or multifocal lesions, mainly of the white matter, which are typically 
non-enhancing and do not have mass effect.  
• PCR analysis. JCV DNA, detectable in CSF or in a brain biopsy, is 
suggestive of PML.  
Brentuximab vedotin dosing should be held if PML is suspected.  
If PML is confirmed, brentuximab vedotin should be permanently 
discontinued.  
Lymphopenia  Grade 1 -4 • Continue at same dose level . 
Neutropenia  Grade 1 -2 • Continue at same dose level . 
Grade 3 -4 • Neutropenia is to be expected on this protocol. Patients who are unable 
to start a cycle  > 35 days after the start of the previous cycle (>14  day 
delay) due to neutropenia with no other dose -limiting toxicity should 
receive the same dose in the n ext cycle with myeloid growth factor 
support.  
• Patients who are unable to start a cycle  > 35 days after the start of the 
previous cycle (>14  day delay) with myeloid growth factor support 
due to neutropenia with no other dose -limiting toxicity should have 
SGN-35 reduced by 1 dose level.

Grade  Action to be Taken  
Thrombocytopenia  Grade 1 -2 • Continue at same dose level . 
Grade 3 -4 • Thrombocytopenia is expected on this protocol. Continue at current 
dose level . 
Non-hematologic events 
(except electrolyte 
abnormalities and those 
noted elsewhere in table) 
that are probably or 
definitely related   Grade 1 -2 • Continue at same dose level . 
Grade 3 -4 • Withhold dose until toxicity is ≤ Grade 2 or has returned to baseline, 
then continue on protocol therapy but should resume at one dose 
reduction . 
• If same non -hematological Grade 3 -4 toxicity recurs after one dose 
reduction, SGN -35 should be omitted . 
Electrolyte Abnormalities  Grade 1 -4 • Continue at same dose level, provided electrolyte toxicity is not 
medically consequential and has been readily corrected . 
• If electrolyte abnormality is medically consequential, refer to 
guidelines above for non -hematologic events . 
Renal Impairment   • Omit for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr   < 30mL/min)  
Mucositis  Grade 1 -3 • Continues at same dose level  
Grade 4  • Withold drug until toxicity is ≤ Grade 2, then resume treatment 
reduced by one dose level  
 
5.2 Crizotinib  
 
5.2.1  Hematological Toxicity  
Patients who are unable to start a cycle  > 35 days after the start of the previous 
cycle (>  14 day delay) due to neutropenia with no other dose -limiting toxicity 
should receive the same dose in the next cycle with myeloid growth factor support.  
 
Patients who a re unable to start a cycle  > 35 days after the start of the previous 
cycle (  > 14 day delay) with myeloid growth factor support due to neutropenia with 
no other dose -limiting toxicity should have crizotinib reduced by 1 dose level.  
 
5.2.2  Therapy Delay  
Crizoti nib should only be given for 21  days each cyc le. If the next cycle  is delayed 
due to other reasons, crizotinib should not b e given until the next cycle is started.  
 
5.2.3  Hepatic Toxicity  
Patients are expected to have temporary increases in liver enzymes secondary to 
other chemotherapeutic agents.  
 
Patients with Gr ade 3 -4 liver enzyme elevation, including ALT/AST/GGT, will 
have crizotinib held until levels recover  to ≤ Grade 1 (< 2.5 X ULN) or baseline.  
See below table for adjustments.  
 
5.2.4  Renal Cyst  
The development of complex renal cysts has been reported in so me patients with 
NSCLC treated with crizotinib. These cysts may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, 
and have usually developed within the first several months of starting crizotinib. 
The precise nature and significance of these cysts is unclear; however, while  no 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  49 
 
evidence of malignancy has been found based on aspiration of cyst fluid and biopsy 
in the reported cases, complex renal cysts may be associated with renal 
malignancy, and thus consultation with a n urologist or suitable alternate medical 
expert is recommended. Monitoring of complex renal cysts with appropriate 
imaging should be performed as scheduled per protocol with contrast -enhanced 
CT scanning or magnetic resonance imagining assuring full visualization of the 
kidneys.  
Event  CTC AE.v4.0 
Grade  Action to be Taken  
Hepatic toxicity:  
Increased ALT  
Grades 3 – 4 Patients with Grade 3 -4 liver enzyme elevation, including 
ALT/AST/GGT, will have crizotinib h eld until levels recover to ≤ Gr ade 1 
(< 2.5 X ULN) or baseline.  
• If levels recover within 7  days of study drug interruption, this is not 
considered dose limiting and crizotinib will be continued at the same 
dose.  
• If levels recover > 7  days after interruption of study drug but < 21 
days from the planned start of the next cycle, th e patient may 
continue on protocol therapy but should receive subsequent doses of 
crizotinib at the next lower dose level ( see Appendix V  and reduce 
by one dose group).  
• If levels do not meet criteria within 21  days after the planned start of 
the next treatment cycle, this is a DLT and the patient should not 
receive any further crizotinib.  
Left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction  Grades 1 – 2 • Continue at the same dose level . 
Grades 3 – 4 • Discontinue treatment and do not retreat . 
Pneumonitis  
(in absence of disease 
progression in the lung, 
infection, other 
pulmonary disease, or 
radiation effect)  Grade 1  • Continue at the same dose level . 
Grade 2  • If suspected, strongly consider administration of 100  mg of oral or 
intravenous prednisolone in single daily or two divided doses.  The 
suggested dose for patients who develop pulmonary toxicity is 
methylprednisolone 1  mg/kg IV every 12  hours for a minimum of 
seven days.  
• Upon occurrence of pneumonitis, study therapy should be held, and 
the Study Chair and Research Coordinator should be notified within 
48 hours . 
• CTEP must be notified within 7  days of study chair no tification 
of each instance of G rade 2 pneumonitis. The Study Chair and 
CTEP will review the history of the affected patient and the 
pulmonary toxicity for the trial as a whole before proceeding 
with the recommendation to resume protocol therapy at a lower 
dose level. Failure to discuss a case of pulmonary toxi city will 
lead to suspension of accrual.

Prolonged QTc interval 
(as confirmed by a 
cardiologist at the site)  Grade 1  • Continue at the same dose level.  
Grade 2  • Continue at the same dose level. Assess electrolytes (particularly 
Ca++, K+, Mg+) and concomitant medications  
• Correct any electrolyte abnormalities.  
Grade 3  • Withhold current dose until recovery to Grade 1. Assess and correct 
electrolytes (particularly Ca++, K+, Mg+) and concomitant 
medications . Upon recovery to Grade 1, resume treatment by 
reducing the dose by 1 dose level if no other cause for QTc 
prolongation is found, otherwise resume at the same dose.  
Grade 4  • Discontinue treatment and do not retreat.  
Thromboembolic 
Events  Grade 1  • Continue at same dose  level.  
Grades 2 -3 • Crizotinib should be held at least 1 week and up to 2 weeks. If the 
thrombosis is considered controlled on anticoagulation and the 
patient is able to proceed with chemotherapy then proceed with 
treatment reduced by one dose level. If after 2 wee ks patient still has 
clinical symptoms from the event, then crizotinib should be 
discontinued permanently.  
• Patients who develop a subsequent Grade 2 -4 event after dose 
reduction will have crizotinib discontinued permanently.  
Grade 4  • Discontinue  crizotinib  treatment permanently.  
Non-hematologic events  
(except electrolyte 
abnormalities and 
those noted elsewhere 
in table) that are 
probably or definitely 
related  Grades 1 – 2 • Continue at same dose level.  
Grades 3 – 4 • Withhold dose until toxicity is  ≤ Grade 2 or has returned to baseline, 
then continue on protocol therapy but should receive subsequent 
doses of crizotinib at the next lower dose level ( see Appendix V  and 
reduce by one dose gr oup). 
• If same non -hematological Grade 3 -4 toxicity recurs after one dose 
reduction (as stated above), crizotinib should be omitted . 
Visual Disturbance  
Grades 1 -2 • Continue at the same dose level. Repeat Ophthalmologic 
examination.  
Grade 3  • Interru pt crizotinib  until recovery. Repeat ophthalmologic 
examination+. Resume treatment by reducing by one dose level.

Mucositis  Grade 1 -3 • Continues at same dose level  
Grade 4  • Withold drug until toxicity is ≤ Grade 2, then resume treatment 
reduced by one dose level  
 
5.3 Cyclophosphamide  
 
5.3.1 Hematuria   
Omit in the presence of macroscopic hematuria. If there is a history of previous 
significant hematuria, hydrate before cyclophosphamide until specific gravity is 
< 1.010 and hydrate at 125  mL/m2/hr for 24  hours after dose.  If mesna was initially 
given in 3 separate boluses, change administration to continuous IV infusion. The 
continuous infusion should be st arted 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as 
cyclophosphamide and finished no sooner than 8 hours after the end of 
cyclophosphamide infusion. If the patient develops hematuria while receiving 
mesna continuous IV infusion at 60% dosing, increase mesna dosing to 100% of 
the cyclophosphamide dose. If hematuria persists with 100% mesna administration 
by continuous infusion, omit remaining doses during that cycle.  
 
5.3.2 Renal Dysfunction   
If creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR is  < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, reduce dose 
of cyclophosphamide by 50%. Prior to dose adjustment of cyclophosphamide, the 
creatinine clearance should be repeated with good hydration.  
 
5.4 Dexamethasone  
 
5.4.1 Hypertension   
Dose should not be reduced. Sodium restriction and anti-hypertensives should be 
employed in an effort to control hypertension. Avoid calcium channel blockers due 
to their potential prohemorrhagic effect.  
 
5.4.2 Hyperglycemia   
Dose should not be reduced for hyperglycemia.  Rather, insulin therapy should be 
employed to control the blood glucose level.  
 
5.4.3 Pancreatitis   
Do not modify dose for asymptomatic elevations of amylase and/or lipase. 
Discontinue steroids, except for stress doses, in the presence of hemorrhagic 
pancreatitis or severe pancreatitis.  
 
5.4.4 Varicella   
Steroids should be held during active infection except during Cycles 1 and 2 . Do 
not hold during incubation period following exposure.

5.5 Doxorubicin  
 
5.5.1 Cardiac Toxicity   
If prolongation of the QTc interval (> 0.48 sec .), or a decrease in the shortening 
fraction to  < 27% is observed, the doxorubicin -containing chemotherapy should 
be postponed 1 week, any existing malnutrition corrected and the tests repeated. If 
the abnormalities persist, doxo rubicin should be discontinued.  
 
5.5.2 Hyperbilirubin emia   
If direct bilirubin is between 1.2  mg/dL  and 3  mg/dL, give 50% of the dose, if 
between 3.1  mg/dL and 5  mg/dL, give 25% of the dos e, and if  > 5 mg/dL omit 
dose.  
 
5.5.3 Mucositis   
If patient has severe infection or severe mucositis (Grade 3 -4), may delay start of 
cycle.  Doses should be given at full dose.   
 
5.6 Etoposide  
 
5.6.1 Allergic Reaction   
Premedicate with diphenhydramine (1 -2 mg/kg slow IV push, maximum dose is 
50 mg; if unavailable, other H1 antagonists may be used as appropriate). If 
symptoms persist, add hydrocortisone 100 -300 mg/m2. Continue to use 
premedication before etoposide in the future.  Also consider substituting an 
equimolar amount of etoposide phosphate, in the face of significant allergy and/or 
hypotension. Etoposide phosphate is a water soluble prodrug that does not contain 
polysorbate 80 and polyethyleneglycol, the solubilizing agent in etoposide that 
may induce allergic reactions and hypotension. Etoposide phosphate is rapidly 
converted to etoposide in vivo and provides total drug exposure, as represented by 
AUC (0 -infinity) that is statistically indistinguishable from that measured for 
etoposide at equimolar doses.  
 
5.6.2 Hypotension   
If diastolic or systolic blood pressure (BP) falls 20  mm Hg during infusion, reduce 
infusion rate by 50%. Start a simultaneous infusion of NS 10 mL/kg if BP fails to 
recover or falls further. Stop infusion if BP does not recover, continue NS. If the 
patient has had any episode of hypotension, prehydrate with 0.9% NaCl at 
10 mL/kg/hr for 2  hours prior to any subsequent infusion.  
 
5.6.3 Renal Insufficiency   
If renal function decreases, adjust etoposide as follows: C rCl/GFR 10 -50 
mL/min/1.73  m2, decrease dose by 25%; if CrCl/GFR  < 10 mL/min/1.73  m2, 
decrease dose by 50%.  
 
5.6.4 Hyperbilirubinemia   
If direct bilirubin is  > 2 mg/dL, decrease dose by 50%. If direct bilirubin 
is > 5 mg/dL, hold etoposide.

Version Date: 02/01/2019  53 
 
5.7 Ifosfamide  
 
5.7.1 Hematuria  
Omit in the presence of macroscopic hematuria. If there is a history of previous 
significant hematuria, hydrate before ifosfamide  until specific gravity is <  1.010 
and hydrate at 125  mL/m2/hr for 24  hours after dose. If mesna was initially given 
in 3 separate boluses, change administration to continuous IV infusion. The 
continuous infusion should be started 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as 
ifosfamide and finished no sooner than 8 hours afte r the end of ifosfamide infusion. 
If the patient develops hematuria while receiving mesna continuous IV infusion at 
60% dosing, increase mesna dosing to 100% of the ifosfamide dose. If hematuria 
persists with 100% mesna administration by continuous infusio n, omit remaining 
doses during that cycle.  
 
5.7.2 Neurotoxicity  
This is an organic brain syndrome, manifestations of which range from mild 
confusion and disorientation to seizures, ataxia, and coma. It may be aggravated 
by impaired renal function, low serum albumin and possibly other conditions such 
as large tumor burden in the pelvis, short infusion times, or prior CNS disease. It 
usually, but does not always, resolve spontaneously; it may or may not recur with 
subsequent doses. Methylene blue has been  reported to reverse the ifosfamide -
related -encephalopathy syndrome in some, but not all, patients. If other causes for 
the neurological symptoms have  been ruled out and G rade III or greater 
neurotoxicity is present, methylene blue may be administered unti l symptoms 
improve.  Since ifosfamide -induced neurotoxicity may not recur, ifosfamide 
therapy may be con tinued with the next scheduled cycle.  
 
5.7.3 Nephrotoxicity  
If estimated CrCl/GFR is <  50 mL/min/1.73  m2 and the patient is well -hydrated, 
defer ifosfami de containing chemotherapy for 1 week.  If after a 1 week delay the 
estimated CrCl/GFR is still <  50 mL/min/1.73  m2 (in a well -hydrated patient), hold 
ifosfamide. Estimated creatinine clearance should be repeated with good 
hydration.  A timed, 24  hour urine collection for creatinine clearance or 
radionuclide GFR should be performed to confirm renal dysfunction  
 
5.8 Meth otrexate  
 
5.8.1  Nephrotoxicity  
For patients with CrCl/GFR  < 60 mL/min/1.73  m2, delay further courses of 
methotrexate until CrCl/GFR  ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73  m2. 
 
5.8.2  Hepatic Toxicity  
ALT or AST < 20 times normal give full dose. ALT or AST ≥  20 times normal of 
upper limits, check every 48  hours until < 10  times  normal, then give full dose. If 
not recovered by 1 week after cycle is due, hold methotrexate.

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
Please see Appendix VI  for drug interactions associated with the drugs used in this study.  
 
6.1 Brentuximab  vedotin                                                                                         11/09/15 
(SGN35, Adcetri sTM, NSC#749710 ) 
 
6.1.1  Structure and molecular weight  
Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30 -directed antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) 
consisting of three components: the chimeric IgG1 antibody cAC10, specific for 
human CD30, the microtubule disrupting agent MMAE, and a protease -cleavable 
linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10. Approximately 4 molecules of 
MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Brentuximab vedotin is produced 
by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule compone nts. The 
antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small 
molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. Brentuximab vedotin 
has an approximate molecular weight of 153 kDa.  
 
6.1.2  Supplied by  
Seattle Genetics, Inc. and the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis 
(DCTD), NCI.  Do NOT use commercial supply.  
 
6.1.3  Formulation  
The agent is supplied as a sterile, white to off -white preservative -free lyophilized 
cake or powder in individually -boxed single -use vials containing 50  mg 
brentuximab vedotin per vial.  
 
6.1.4  Storage  
Store vial dry under refrigeration at 2 -8°C (36 -46°F) in the original carton to 
protect from light  until reconstitution and use.  
 
6.1.5  Solution Preparation  
Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing 
solutions.  
 
Please note that the dose for patients weighing greater than 100  kg should be 
calculated based on a weight of 100  kg. 
Preparation consists of 2 steps: dilution of the stock solution  and dilution of the final 
solution.  
Step 1 : Make a 5  mg/mL concentration . Use vials from the same Lot number 
for each dose . 
1. Reconstitute the 50  mg lyophilized powder brentuximab vedotin  with 
10.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Final concentration is 5  mg/mL 
(Note: total volume is 11  mL).  
2. Swirl the vial gently. Do not shake.  
3. Let the reconstituted vial settle for one minute to eliminate bubbles. The 
reconstituted solution should be colorless, clear to slightly opalescent and 
should NOT have visible particulates.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  55 
 
4. Store the reconstituted vial under refrigeration (2° – 8° C) and protect from 
light if not used immediately. Discard after 8  hours.  
Step 2 : Further dilute the IV solution . 
1. Withdraw the calculated amount of drug from the 5 mg/mL r econstituted vial 
in step 1.  
2. Inject the required amount of drug into 0.9% NS, Lactated Ringer’s Solution, 
USP, or dextrose 5% in Water (D5W), USP to a final concentration between 
0.4 – 1.8 mg/mL .  
3. Brentuximab vedotin  solution is compatible in polyvinylchloride (PVC), 
ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyolefin, or polyethylene.  
4. Do not shake. Gently invert the bag  (or syringe)  to mix.  
5. The prepared IV bag (or syringe) is to be stored at refrigeration (2° – 8° C) 
and must b e used within 24 hours of initial product reconstitution (or sooner 
per institutional practice for agents without a preservative). Protect the 
prepared IV solution from direct sunlight if not used immediately.  
6. Prior to administration, inspect the IV bag (or syringe) for discoloration or 
floating particulates. Do not use the IV solution if the solution is discolored 
or/and have particulates.  
 
6.1.6  Stability  
The stability testing of the intact vials is ongoing. Reconstituted agent must be 
diluted and admini stered within 24  hours.  
CAUTION: The single -use lyophilized dosage form contains no antibacterial 
preservatives. Therefore, the reconstituted product (from Step 1) should be 
discarded within 8 hours after initial entry/puncture.  
 
6.1.7  Administration  
Infuse the prepared IV solution over 30  minutes. Do not mix with other 
medications. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. Do not use an in -line filter 
for the IV administration. The IV bag (or syringe) does NOT need light protection 
during the IV administration.  
 
6.1.8  Potential drug interactions : 
In vitro data indicates that the active metabolite of brentuximab vedotin , 
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A4 but 
is neither a sensitive substrate nor a str ong inhibitor/inducer of CYP3A4. However, 
patients should be monitored for potential drug -interaction when administered 
drugs known to be a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor/inducer with brentuximab vedotin . 
In vitro, MMAE is a substrate of P -gp transporter and is not an inhibitor of P -gp. 
See Appendix IV  for a list of CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors.

6.1.9  Patient Care Implications  
• New signs and symptoms of CNS system abnormalities may indicate 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).  
• Tumor lysis syndrome, particularly in patients with highly proliferative 
tumors or high tumor burden prior to treatment.  
• Infusion -related reactions, inc luding anaphylaxis, may occur.  
• Signs and symptoms of peripheral ne uropathy may include  tingling or 
numbness of the hands, feet, or any muscles weakness.  
• Steven -Johnson syndrome . 
• High fever (≥ 100.5° F) or other signs of potential infection.

6.2.7  Administration  
General Informatio n: 
Crizotinib is given orally and may be admini stered on an outpatient basis. Patients 
should be instructed to take their medication at approximately the same time each 
day and to not take more than the prescribed dose at any time. The dose may be 
taken wi th or without food or beverage. If a dose is missed or forgotten at the due 
time, it can be taken up to (but not greater than) 6 hours later to help prevent missed 
doses. If a patient inadvertently takes 1  extra dose during a day, the patient should 
not ta ke the next dose of crizotinib. If a patient vomits after a dose of crizotinib, 
that dose  will not be repeated ; wait until the next scheduled time to administer  a 
dose. Crizotinib  is a substrate for and moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4/5; refer to

6.2.9  Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability  
NCI supplied agents may be requested by the responsible i nvestigator (or their 
authorized designee) at each partic ipating institution. Pharmaceutical Management 
Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution 
where the patient is to be treated. PMB does not permit the transfer of agents 
between institutions (unless prior approval from PM B is obtained.) The CTEP 
assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP supplied 
investigational agents. The responsible investigator at each participating institution 
must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA form  
1572 (Statement of Investigator), Biosketch , Agent Shipping Form, and Financial 
Disclosure Form (FDF). If there are several participating investigators at one 
institution, CTEP supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered 
under the name  of one lead investigator at that institution.  
 
6.2.10  Clinical Drug Request  
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shipping 
designees and ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB 
Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application at https://eapps -

6.3 CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE - INJE CTION     (03/13/13) 
(Cytoxan) NSC #26271           
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent related to nitrogen mustard. Cyclophosphamide is 
inactive until it is metabolized by P450 isoenzymes ( CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4) in 
the liver to active compounds. The initial product is 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide (4 -HC) 
which is in equilibrium with aldophosphamide which spontaneously releases acrolein to 
produce phosphoramide mustard. Phosphoramide mustard , which is an active bifunctional 
alkylating species, is 10 times more potent in vitro  than is 4 -HC and has been shown to 
produce interstrand DNA cross -link analogous to those produced by mechlorethamine. 
Approximately 70% of a dose of cyclophosphamide is excreted in the urine as the inactive 
carboxyphosphamide and 5 -25% as unchanged drug. The plasma half -life ranges from 4.1 to 
16 hours after IV administration.

Frequency and 
Timing : Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of cyclophosphamide (alone or in combination 
with other antineoplastic agents) have been noted in humans. Toxicities include: 
chromosomal abnormalities, multiple anomalies, pancytopenia, and low birth weight. 
Cyclophosphamide is excreted into breast milk. Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated 
during breast feeding because of reported cases of neutropenia in breast fed infants and 
the potential  for serious adverse effects.  
1 Dependent on dose, age, gender, and degree of pubertal development at time of treatment.  
2 Risk increased with pulmonary chest irradiation and higher doses.  
(L) Toxicity may also occur later.  
 
Formulation and Stability:  
Cyclophosphamide for injection is available as powder for injection or lyophilized powder 
for injection in 500  mg, 1  g, and 2  g vials. The powder for injection contains 82  mg sodium 
bicarbonate/100  mg cyclophosphamide and the lyophilized powder for injection contains 
75 mg mannitol/100  mg cyclophosphamide. Storage at or below 25ºC (77ºF) is 
recommended. The product will withstand brief exposures to temperatures up to 30ºC 
(86ºF).  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of the 
protocol.  
 
Cyclophosphamide for Injection : If the drug will be administered as undiluted drug at the 
20 mg/mL concentration, then reconstitute to 20  mg/m L with NS ONLY to avoid a 
hypotonic solution. If the drug will be further diluted prior to administration, then first 
reconstitute with NS, SWFI, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (paraben preserved only) 
to a concentration of 20  mg/mL. Following recon stitution further dilute in dextrose or 
saline containing solutions for IV use.

6.4 CYTARABINE          
(Cytosine arabinoside, Ara -C, Cytosar®) NSC #63878          (07/13/15 ) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Cytarabine appears to act through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but 
significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported. It 
exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S -phase) 
and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S -
phase. Cytarabine is metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase  and other nucleotide kinases to 
the nucleotide triphosphate (Ara -CTP), an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Ara -
CTP is inactivated by a pyrimidine nucleoside deaminase, which converts it to the nontoxic 
uracil derivative (Ara -U). It appears that the balance of kinase and deaminase levels may 
be an important factor in determining sensitivity or resistance of the cell to cytarabine. It 
has an initial distributive phase t ½ of about 10 minutes, with a secondary elimination phase 
t½ of about 1 to 3  hours. Peak levels after intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of 
cytarabine occur about 20 to 60  minutes after injection and are lower than IV

6.5 DEXAMETHASONE  
(Decadron®, Hexadrol®, Dexone®, Dexameth®) NSC #34521   (05/09/11)  
Source and Pharmacology:  
Dexamethasone is a synthetic fluorinated glucocorticoid devoid of mineralocorticoid 
effects. Dexamethasone, 0.75  mg, has potent anti -inflammatory activity equivalent to 
approximately 5  mg of prednisone. Glucocorticoids produce widespread and diverse 
physiologic effects on carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, electrolyte and water 
balance, functions of the cardiovascular system, kidney, skeletal muscle, and the nervous 
systems. Glucocorticoids reduce the concentration of thymus -dependent lymphocytes 
(T-lymphocytes), monocytes, and eosinophils. Glucocorticoids selectively bind to the 
cortisol receptors on human lymphoid cells which are found in larger numbers on leukemic 
lymphoblasts. They also decrease binding of immunoglobulin to cell surface receptors and 
inhibit the synthesis and/or release of interleukins, thereby decreasing T -lymph ocyte 
blastogenesis and reducing expansion of the primary immune response. The specific cellular 
mechanisms that act to halt DNA synthesis are thought to be related to inhibition of glucose 
transport or phosphorylation, retardation of mitosis, and inhibiti on of protein synthesis. 
Elimination half -lives for the following age groups have been reported to be: infants and 
children under 2 years of  age: 2.3 to 9.5  hours, 8 to 16  years: 2.82 to 7.5  hours, and adults 
(age not specified): 3 to 6  hours. The biologic  half-life is 36 -72 hours. It is primarily 
metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

Frequency and 
Timing:  Fetal and teratogenic toxicities : dexamethasone crosses the placenta with 54% 
metabolized by enzymes in the placenta. In animal studies, large doses of cortisol 
administered earl y in pregnancy produced cleft palate, stillborn fetuses, and 
decreased fetal size. Chronic maternal ingestion during the first trimester has shown a 
1% incidence of cleft palate in humans. There are no reports of dexamethasone 
excretion into breast milk in  humans; however, it is expected due to its low molecular 
weight that it would partition into breast milk.

6.6 DOXORUBICIN  
(Adriamycin®) NSC #123127        (05/09/11)  
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
An anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius . The cytotoxic 
effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are thought 
to be related to nucleotide base intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities of 
doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA 
polymerases. The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA -cleavable 
complexes appears to be an important mechanism of doxorubicin  cytocidal activity. 
Doxorubicin cellular membrane binding may affect a variety of cellular functions.  
Enzymatic electron reduction of doxorubicin by a variety of oxidases, reductases, and 
dehydrogenases generate highly reactive species including the hydro xyl free radical (OH•). 
Free radical formation has been implicated in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by means of Cu 
(II) and Fe (III) reduction at the cellular level. Cells treated with doxorubicin have been 
shown to manifest the characteristic morphologic cha nges associated with apoptosis or 
programmed cell death.  Doxorubicin -induced apoptosis may be an integral component of 
the cellular mechanism of action relating to therapeutic effects, toxicities, or both.  
Doxorubicin seru m decay pattern is multiphasic.  
 
The initial distributive t ½ is approximately 5  minutes suggesting rapid tissue uptake of 
doxorubicin. The terminal t ½ of 20 to 48  hours reflects a slow elimination from tissues. 
Steady -state distribution volumes exceed 20 to 30  L/kg and are indicative of ex tensive drug 
uptake into tissues. Plasma clearance is in the range of 8 to 20  mL/min/kg and is 
predominately by metabolism and biliary excretion. The P450 cytochromes which appear 
to be involved with doxorubicin me tabolism are CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.  Approximat ely

6.7 ETOPOSIDE - INJECTION  
(Toposar ®, Etopophos ®, VP-16)  NSC #141540        (11/15/16) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that forms a complex with topoisomerase 
II and DNA which results in single and double strand DNA breaks. Its main effect appears 
to be in the S and G 2 phase of the cell cycle.  The initial t ½ is 1.5  hours and the mea n terminal 
half-life is 4  to 11 hours.  It is primarily excreted in the urine. In children, approximately 
55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as etoposide in 24  hours. The mean renal clearance 
of etoposide is 7 to 10  mL/min/m ² or about 35% of the total body clearance over a do se 
range of 80 to 600  mg/m ². Etoposide, therefore, is cleared by both renal and non-renal  
processes, i.e., metabolism and biliary excretion.  The effect of renal disease on plasma 
etoposide clearance is not known. Biliary excretion appears to be a minor rou te of etoposide 
elimination. Only 6% or less of an intravenous dose is recovered in the bile as etoposide. 
Metabolism accounts for most of the non-renal  clearance of etoposide.  
 
The maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration time curve ( AUC) 
exhibit a high degree of patient variability.  Etoposide is highly bound to plasma proteins 
(~94%), primarily serum albumin. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that etoposide 
systemic exposure is related to toxicity. Preliminary data suggests that syst emic exposure 
for unbound etoposide correlates better than total (bound and unbound) etoposide.  There 
is poor diffusion into the CSF < 5%.  
 
Etoposide phosphate is a water soluble ester of etoposide which is rapidly and completely 
converted to etoposide in plasma. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data indicate 
that etoposide phosphate is bioequivalent to etoposide when it is administered in molar 
equivalent doses.

Formulation and Stability:  
Etoposide for Injection is available as a 20  mg/mL solution in sterile multiple dose vials 
(5 mL, 25  mL, or 50  mL each). The pH of the clear, nearly colorless to yellow liquid is 3 
to 4. Each mL contains 20  mg etoposide, 2  mg citric acid, 30  mg benzyl alcohol, 80  mg 
modified polysorbate 80/tween 80, 650  mg polyethylene glycol 300, and 30.5  percent  (v/v) 
alcohol. Via l headspace contains nitrogen. Unopened vials of etoposide are stable until 
expiration date on package at controlled room temperature (20 °-25°C or 68 °-77°F). 
 
Etoposide phosphate for injection is available for intravenous infusion as a sterile 
lyophilized powder in single -dose vials containing etoposide phosphate equivalent to 
100 mg etoposide, 32.7  mg sodium citrate USP, and 300 mg dextran 40. Etoposide 
phospha te must be stored under refrigeration (2° -8°C or 36° -46°F). Unopened vials of 
etoposide phosphate are stable until the expiration date on the package.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modification  sections of the 
protocol.  
 
Etoposide : 
Dilute etoposide to a final concentration ≤  0.4 mg/mL in D5W or NS. Etoposide infusions 
are st able at room temperature for 96  hours when diluted to concentration s of 0.2  mg/mL; 
stability is 24  hours at room temperature with concentrations of 0.4  mg/mL. The time to 
precipitation is highly unpredictable at concentrations >  0.4 mg/mL.  Use in -line filter 
during infusion secondary to the risk of precipitat e formation. However, the use of an in -
line filter is not mandatory since etoposide precipitation is unlikely at concentrations of 
0.1-0.4 mg/mL. Do not administer  etoposide  by rapid intravenous injection. Slow rate 
of administration if hypotension occurs.

Leaching of diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags occurred 
with etoposide 0.4  mg/mL in NS. To avoid leaching, prepare the etoposide solution as close 
as possible, preferably within 4  hours, to the time of administration or alt ernatively as per 
institutional policy; glass or polyethylene -lined (non -PVC) containers and polyethylene -
lined tubing may be used to minimize exposure to DEHP.  
 
Etoposide Phosphate : 
Reconstitute the 100  mg vial with 5 or 10  mL of Sterile  Water for Injection, D5W, NS, 
Bacteriostatic Water for Injection with Benzyl Alcohol, or Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride 
for Injection with Benzyl Alcohol for a concentration equivalent to 20  mg/mL or 
10 mg/mL etoposide equivalent (22.7  mg/mL or 11.4  mg/mL  etoposide phosphate), 
respectively. Use diluents without benzyl alcohol for neonates and infants <  2 years of 
age or patients with hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol.   
 
When reconstituted as directed, etoposide phosphate solutions can be stored in glass o r 
plastic containers under refrigeration for 7  days. When reconstituted with a diluent 
containing a bacteriostat, store at controlled room temperature for up to 48  hours. 
Following reconstitution with SWFI, D5W, or NS store at controlled room temperature f or 
up to 24  hours.  
 
Following reconstitution, etoposide phosphate may be further diluted to a concentration as 
low as 0.1  mg/mL of etoposide with D5W or NS. The diluted solution can be stored under 
refrigeration or at controlled room temperature for 24 hours.

gene. It differs from the natural protein in that the N - amino acid is methionine and the protein 
is not glycosylated.  G-CSF is a lineage spec ific colony -stimulating factor , which regulates 
the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor 
proliferation, differentiation, and selected end -cell functional activation (including 
enhanced phagocytic ability, primi ng of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory 
burst, antibody dependent killing, and the increased expression of some functions 
associated with cell surface antigens).  Filgrastim exhi bits nonlinear pharmacokinetics with 
clearance  dependent on f ilgrastim concentration and neutrophil count . Filgrastim is cleared 
by the kidney. The elimination half -life is similar for subcutaneous and intravenous 
administration, approximately 3.5  hours.  The time to peak concentration when administered 
subcutaneousl y is 2 -8 hours .

6.9 IFOSFAMIDE  
(Isophosphamide, Iphosphamide, Z4942, Ifex®) NSC #109724    (05/09/11)  
 
  Source and Pharmacology:  
Ifosfamide is a structural analogue of cyclophosphamide. Ifosfamide requires hepatic 
microsomal activation (P450 3A isoenzymes) for the production of the reactive 4 -
hydroxyoxazaphorine intermediate which serves as a carrier molecule for the u ltimate 
intracellular liberation of acrolein and phosphoramide mustard which is an active 
bifunctional alkylating species. Acrolein is thought to be the cause of the hemorrhagic cystitis 
as seen with cyclophosphamide. Ifosfamide demonstrates dose -dependent  pharmacokinetics 
whereby the terminal half -life ranges from 7 to 16  hours at doses of 1.6 -2.4 g/m² to 3.8 -
5 g/m², respectively. At 1.6 -2.4 g/m²/d, 12 to 18% of the dose was excreted as unchanged 
drug in the urine, whereas at a 5  g/m² single -dose, 61% was excreted in the urine as the parent 
drug. Evidence also exists to suggest that ifosfamide metabolism is inducible, with more 
rapid clearance occurring in the second and later doses when a course of therapy is given as 
fractionated doses over 3 to 5  days. There is more chloroethyl side chain oxidation of 
ifosfamide (up to 50%) than of cyclophosphamide (< 10%), and the degree of such 
metabolism is more variable than with cyclophosphamide. Oxidation of the chloroethyl 
groups produces chloroacetaldehyde, which is thought to be responsible for the 
neurotoxicity and renal toxicity that have been seen with ifosfamide therapy.

  Formulation and Stability:   
Ifosfamide is available in 1  g and 3  g single dose vials of lyophilized white powder without 
preservatives and as a 50  mg/mL solution in 20  mL and 60  mL vials.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modification  sections of the 
protocol.  
Reconstitute ifosfamide lyophilized powder with sterile water for injection or bacteriostatic 
water for injection(use 20  mL for the 1  g vial and  60 mL for the 3  g vial) to produce a final 
concentration of 50  mg/mL. Use sterile water for injection without benzyl alc ohol for 
neonates and infants <  2 years of age or patients with hypersensitivity to benzyl 
alcohol.  Although the reconstituted product is stable for 7  days at room temperature and 
up to 6  weeks under refrigeration, the manufacturer recommends refrigeration and use 
within 24  hours to reduce the possibility of microbial contamination. Store unreconstituted 
vials at room temperature 20° -25°C  (68°-77°F). Protect from temperatures above 30°C 
(86° F). Ifosfamide may liquefy at temperatures >  35°C.  
Reconstituted solutions of ifosfamide or ifosfamide solution should be diluted further to 
concentrations of 0.6 to 20  mg/mL in dextrose or saline cont aining solutions. Such 
admixtures, when stored in large volume parenteral glass bottles, Viaflex bags or PAB

6.10 INTRATHECAL TRIPLES        (05/08/12) 
(Methotrexate/Hydrocortisone/Cytarabine,  IT-3)     
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
The intrathecal route of administration of a drug produces more consistent CSF drug 
concentrations at relatively smaller doses because of the volume difference between the CSF 
and blood compartments (140  mL vs. 3500  mL in an adult). (The CSF volume of chil dren 
after the first 3  years is equivalent to that of an adult). Drug half -lives are longer as well 
because clearance is related to flow rather than metabolism or protein binding. Intrathecal 
methotrexate has a biphasic elimination curve from the CSF with a t½ of 4.5 and 14  hours 
respectively. Following IT injection of cytarabine the elimination of the drug from the CSF 
is biphasic with a t½ of 1 and 3.4  hours respectively which is 8 -fold longer than the clearance 
from plasma. The elimination of hydrocortis one is similarly prolonged.

(LCV, Wellcovorin®, citrovorum factor, folinic acid) NSC #003590    
  
Source and Pharmacology:  
Leucovorin is a mixture of the diastereoisomers of the 5 -formyl derivative of 
tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). The biologically active compound of the mixture is the ( -)- l-
isomer, known as Citrovorum factor or ( -)-folinic acid. Leucovorin does not require 
reduction by the enz yme dihydrofolate reductase in order to participate in reactions 
utilizing folates as a source of “one -carbon” moieties.  Administration of leucovorin can 
counteract the therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, 
which act  by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. In contrast, leucovorin can enhance the 
therapeutic and toxic effects of fluoropyrimidines used in cancer therapy, such as 5 -
fluorouracil. Leucovorin is readily converted to another reduced folate, 5,  10-
methylenetet rahydrofolate, which acts to stabilize the binding of fluorodeoxyuridylic acid 
(an active metabolite of 5 -FU) to thymidylate synthase and thereby enhances the inhibition 
of this enzyme.  Peak serum levels of 5 -methyl THF (an active metabolite) were reached at 
approximately 1.3 -1.5 hours (IV/IM) and 2.3 hours for the oral form. The terminal half -life 
of total reduced folates was approximately 6.2  hours. Following oral administration, 
leucovorin is rapidly absorbed and expands the serum pool of reduced folates . At a dose of 
25 mg, almost 100% of the l-isomer (the biologically active form) but only 20% of the d-
isomer is absorbed. Oral absorption of leucovorin is saturable at doses above 25  mg. The 
apparent bioavailability of leucovorin was 97% for 25  mg, 75% fo r 50 mg, and 37% for 
100 mg doses.  Both oral and parenteral leucovorin raise the CSF folate levels.

Formulation and Stability:   
Leucovorin calcium for injection is supplied as a sterile ready to use liquid and a sterile 
powder for injection. The 10  mg/mL preservative free liquid is available in 50  mL vials 
containing sodium chloride 400  mg/vial. Store  preservative free liquid in the  refrigerator at 
2°-8°C (36° -46°F) protected from light. The powder for injection is available in 50  mg, 
100 mg, 200  mg, and 350  mg vials. Store at room temperature 15° -25°C (59° -77°F) 
protected fr om light. Reconstitute the sterile powder with sterile water for injection or 
bacteriostatic water for inj ection to a concentration of 10 mg/mL leucovorin calcium. Do not 
use diluents containing benzyl alcohol for d oses > 10 mg/m² or in infants < 2  years of  age 
or patients with allergy to benzyl alcohol. When Bacteriostatic Water is used, the 
recon stituted solution is good for 7 days. If reconstituted with SWFI, use solution 
immediately as it contains no preservative.  One milligram of leucovorin calcium cont ains 
0.004  mEq of leucovorin and 0.004  mEq of calcium.  
 
The oral form of leucovorin is available as 5  mg, 10  mg, 15  mg, and 25  mg tablets. Inactive 
ingredients vary depending on manufacturer but tablet formulations may include: corn 
starch, dibasic calcium  phosphate, magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch, lactose, 
microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate.  
 
Guidelines for Administration:  See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of the 
protocol.  
 
Injection:  
Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, no more than 160  mg of 
leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16  mL of a 10  mg/mL  solution per 
minute). IV leucovorin and sodium bicarbonate are incompatible.  
 
Oral: 
Oral leucovorin should be spaced evenly (e.g., every six hours) throughout the day and 
may be taken without regard to meals. Doses  > 25 mg should be given IV due to the 
saturation of absorption.  
 
Leucovorin should not be administered  < 24 hours after intrathecal injections which contain 
methotrexate unless there are special circumstances.  
 
Supplier:  Commercially available from various manufacturers. See package insert for 
further information.

6.12 MESNA - INJECTION        (11/15/16) 
(sodium 2 -mercaptoethane sulfonate, UCB 3983, Mesnex ) NSC #113891  
 
Source and Pharmacology : 
Mesna was developed as a prophylactic agent to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis 
induced by ifosfamide. Mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide 
(dimesna). Mesna disulfide remains in the intravascular compartment and is rapidly 
elimin ated by the kidneys. In the kidney, the mesna disulfide is reduced to the free thiol 
compound, mesna, which reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites 
(acrolein and 4 -hydroxy -ifosfamide) resulting in their detoxification. The first step in the 
detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4 -hydroxy -ifosfamide forming a 
nonurotoxic 4 -sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein 
and to other urotoxic metabolites. In multiple human xenograft or rodent tumor mod el 
studies, mesna in combination with ifosfamide (at dose ratios of up to 20 -fold as single or 
multiple courses) failed to demonstrate interference with antitumor efficacy.  
 
After an 800  mg dose the half lives  for mesna and dimesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, 
respectively. Approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose wa s eliminated in the 
urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna, respectively. The majority of the dose re covered 
was eliminated within 4 hours.

Prompt:  
Within 2 -3 
weeks, prior to

Unknown 
Frequency and 
Timing : Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of mesna have not been noted in animals fed 
10 times the recommended human doses. There are however no adequate and well -
controlled studies in pregnant women. It is not known if mesna or dimesn a is excreted 
into human milk  
1All currently available products in the U.S. are preserved with benzyl alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has 
been associated with death in pre -term infants weighing less than 2500  g and receiving 99 -
405 mg/kg/day. Benzyl alcohol is no rmally oxidized rapidly to benzoic acid, conjugated with glycine 
in the liver, and excreted as hippuric acid. In pre -term infants , however, this metabolic pathway 
may not be well developed. Onset of toxic illness in these infants occurred between several d ays and 
a few weeks of age with a characteristic clinical picture that included metabolic acidosis 
progressing to respiratory distress and gasping respirations. Many infants also had central -
nervous -system dysfunction, including convulsions and intracrania l hemorrhage; hypotension 
leading to cardiovascular collapse was a late finding usually preceding death. [For comparison in 
the ICE regimen of 3000  mg/m²/day of ifosfamide and a daily mesna dose of 60% of the ifosfamide 
dose = to 1800  mg/m²/day; a child wo uld be expected to receive 18 mL/m²/day of mesna 
(concentration of 100  mg/mL and 10.4  mg/mL of benzyl alcohol) 187.2  mg/m²/day of benzyl alcohol 
or 6.24  mg/kg/day.]

6.13 METHOTREXATE - IV only       (02/29/12 ) 
(MTX, amethopterin)  NSC #000740         
 
Source and Pharmacology :  
A folate analogue which reversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that reduces 
folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Inhibition of tetrahydrofolate formation limits the 
availability of one carbon fragments necessary for the synthesis of purines and the conversion 
of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate in the synthesis of DNA and cell reproduction. The 
polyglutamated metabolites of MTX also contribute to the cytotoxic effect of M TX on DNA 
repair and/or strand breaks.  MTX cytotoxicity is highly dependent on the absolute drug 
concentration and the duration of drug exposure.  MTX is actively transported across cell 
membranes. At serum methotrexate concentrations exceeding 0.1  µmol/mL,  passive 
diffusion becomes a major means of intracellular transport of MTX. The drug is widely 
distributed throughout the body with the highest concentration in the kidney, liver, spleen, 
gallbladder and skin. Plasma concentrations following high dose IV M TX decline in a 
biphasic manner with an initial half -life of 1.5 -3.5 hours, and a terminal half life of 
8-15 hours. About 50% is bound to protein. MTX is excreted primarily by the kidneys via 
glomerular filtration and active secretion into the proximal tub ules. Renal clearance usually 
equals or exceeds creatinine clearance. Small amounts are excreted in the feces. There is 
significant entero -hepatic circulation of MTX. The distribution of MTX into third -space fluid 
collections, such as pleural effusions and  ascitic fluid, can substantially alter MTX 
pharmacokinetics. The slow release of accumulated MTX from these third spaces over time 
prolongs the terminal half -life of the drug, leading to potentially increased clinical toxicity.

Frequency and 
Timing : Methotrexate crosses the placenta. Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of methotrex ate 
have been noted in humans. The toxicities include: congenital defects, chromosomal 
abnormalities, severe newborn myelosuppression, low birth w eight, abortion, and fetal 
death. Methotrexate is excreted into breast milk in low concentrations.  
1 May be enhanced by HDMTX and/or cranial irradiation. (L) Toxicity may also occur later.  
 
Formulation and Stability:   
Methotrexate for Injection is available as a lyophilized powder for injection in 1000  mg 
vials. The powder for injection contains approximately 7  mEq sodium in the 1000  mg vial. 
Methotrexate for Injection is also available as a 25  mg/mL solution in 2, 4, 8, 10, and 40  mL 
preservative f ree vials and 2 and 10  mL vials with preservative. The 2, 4, 8, 10, and 40  mL 
solutions contain approximately 0.43, 0.86, 1.72, 2.15, and 8.6  mEq sodium per vial, 
respectively. The preserved vials contain 0.9% benzyl alcohol as a preservative . 
 
Sterile methotrexate  powder or solution is stable at 20º -25ºC (68º -77ºF); excursions 
permitted to 15º -30ºC (59º - 86 Fº). Protect from light.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of 
protocol. Leucovorin rescue may be necessary with certain doses of methotrexate.  
For IV use:  Powder for injection: Dilute 1000  mg vial with 19.4  mL of preservative free 
SWFI, D5W or NS  to a 50  mg/mL concentration. The powder for injection may be further 
diluted in NS or dextrose containing solutions to a concentration of < 25mg/mL for IV use.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  84 
 
 
Do not use the preserved solution  for high dose methotrexate administration  due to 
risk of ben zyl alcohol toxicity.  Methotrexate dilutions are chemically stable for at least 
7 days at room temperature but contain no preservative and should be used within 24  hours. 
Diluted solutions especially those containing bicarbonate exposed to direct sunlight for 
periods exceeding 4  hours should be protected from light.  
 
High dose Methotrexate requires alkalinization of the urine, adequate hy dration and 
leucovorin rescue. Avoid probenecid, penicillins, cephalosporins, aspirin, proton pump 
inhibitors, and NSAIDS  as renal excretion of MTX is inhibited by these agents.

6.14 PEGFILGRASTIM         (02/10/16) 
(pegylated filgrastim, PEG filgrastim, SD/01, Neulasta®) NSC #725961     
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Pegfilgrastim is the pegylated form of recombinant methionyl human G -CSF ( filgrastim ). 
Pegfilgrastim is produced by covalently binding a 20 -kilodalton (kD) 
monomethoxypolyethylene glycol molecule to the N -terminal methionyl residue of 
filgrastim . The molecular weight of pegfilgrastim is 39  kD. G -CSF is a lineage specific 
colony -stimulating factor which regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone 
marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor prolifer ation, differentiation, and selected end -
cell functional activation (including enhanced phagocytic ability, priming of the cellular 
metabolism associated with respiratory burst, antibody dependent killing, and the increased 
expression of some functions ass ociated with cell surface antigens).  
 
After subcutaneous injection the elimination half -life of pegfilgrastim ranges from 15 to 
80 hours and the time to peak concentration ranges from 24 to 72  hours. Serum levels are 
sustained in most patients during the n eutropenic period postchemotherapy, and begin to 
decline after the start of neutrophil recovery, consistent with neutrophil -dependent 
elimination. After subcutaneous administration at 100  mcg/kg in 37 pediatric patients with 
sarcoma, the terminal eliminati on half -life was 30.1 (+/ - 38.2) hours in patients 0 to 5 years -
old, 20.2 (+/ - 11.3) hours in patients 6 to 11  years -old, and 21.2 (+/ - 16) hours in children 
12 to 21 years -old.

8.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY 
CRITERIA  
8.1 Criteria f or Removal from Protocol Therapy  
a) Progressive disease : The diagnosis of relapse or progression should be proven by biopsy 
and histology.  
b) Relapse : Relapse will be defined as a recurrence of disease at any site. The diagnosis of 
relapse or progression shou ld be proven by biopsy and histology.  
c) Refusal of further protocol therapy by patient/parent/guardian.  
d) Completion of protocol therapy . 
e) Physician determines it is in patient’s best interest.  
f) Development of a second malignancy.  
g) Repeat eligibility studies (if required) are outside the parameters required for eligibility.  
h) Study is terminated by Sponsor.  
i) Pregnancy.  
j) Adverse Event  requiring removal from protocol therapy  (See Section 5.0) . 
 
Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet the crite ria for Off 
Study (see below). Follow -up data will be required unless consent is withdrawn.  
 
8.2 Off Study Criteria  
a) Death.  
b) Lost to follow -up. 
c) Patient enrollment onto another COG  study with tumor therapeutic intent (e .g., at 
recurrence).  
d) Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission.  
e) The fifth anniversary of the date the patient was enrolled on this study . 
 
 
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
Enrollment of newly diagnosed patients with ALCL to ANHL0131 averaged about 30 
patients per year. With the ANHL12P1 expanded eligibility criteria, namely stage II 
patients to be consistent with ALCL99, COG expects to enroll about 41 patients per y ear. 
As detailed below, enrollment up to 140 patients will be required (to enroll 128 eligible 
patients, evaluable for the primary adverse events outcome) and we expect that this 
enrollment will be accomplished in about 3.5 years.  
 
9.2 Study Design  
This s tudy is designed to evaluate the feasibility of the addition of brentuximab vedotin or 
crizotinib to standard chemotherapy (ALCL99).  
 
Patients will be randomized 1:1 to ALCL99 chemotherapy plus either brentuximab vedotin 
or crizotinib.  Total enrollment wil l be up to 140 patients (70 per randomized treatment to 
assure the enrollment of 64 eligible patients on each of the 2 regimens. Should enrollment 
to one of the treatment regimens be closed (see below) prior to reaching 64 eligible patients, 
enrollment to the remaining regimen will continue to a total sample size that will assure 64 
eligible patients.

9.2.1  Primary study endpoint:   
The primary study endp oints will be the occurrence of G rade 3+ non -hematologic 
adverse events  and event -free survival  defined as the time from study entry until 
progressive disease, relapse, or death . All patients receiving any protocol treatment 
will contr ibute to the primary analysis.  
 
Patient rates of certain G rade 3+ non -hematologic toxicities for each regimen (pre-
phase plus 6 cycles of alternating A/B c ourses ) will be com pared to those seen on 
ALCL99. Information about the ALCL99 adverse event experience is primarily 
available .30 The authors report patient level incidence rates for infection (21%); 
stomatitis (42%), and liver toxicity (defined as hyperbilirubinemia or AST/ALT 
elevation) (38%).  
 
For the first 10 patients of each arm, the study chair will review reported toxicities 
on a weekly  basis through the COG system. The study committee will have 
conference calls at least every month reviewing all the adverse ex perience data, 
with focus on targeted toxicities. The study chair will review reported toxicities on 
a weekly basis and all deaths, and patients removed from study due to toxicity will 
be reported to the DSMC for review, as well. Because the patients will be 
monitored continuously by the study chair, the study committee, and the DSMC, 
the study will not be stopped after the first 10 patients of each arm to evaluate for 
toxicity.  
 
Because of concern regarding pulmonary toxicity with brentuximab vedotin and 
liver toxicity with crizotinib, these toxicities will be monitored. A 5% rate of Grade 
3+ pulmonary toxicity with brentuximab vedotin and a 5% rate of Grade 4+ liver 
toxicity with crizotinib are considered acceptable, but a true rate of 15% for either 
of th ese would be unacceptable. Thus interim analysis of these rates will be 
performed using an alpha -spending function approach using an O’Brien -Fleming 
monitoring boundary (truncated at 3 standard deviations) beginning at about 33% 
of the expected information  (21 patients per treatment).  
 
With 64 eligible subjects, if only one analysis were to be done once all patients 
had completed treatment, the rule applied would be to declare the adverse event 
experience acceptable if six (6) or fewer patients experienced the targeted grade 
3+ or grade 4+ adverse event and unacceptable if seven (7) or more experienced 
this adverse event. Using exact binomial probabilities, the probability of declaring 
the adverse event rate unacceptable when the true rate is 5% is 4% (0.0403), 
whereas the probability of declaring the adverse event rate unacceptable when the 
true rate is 15% is 86% (0.8635).  
 
However, these rates of adverse event will be monitored during the conduct of the 
study. The actual rules for declaring the  adverse event rate unacceptable will 
depend on when the monitoring takes place. The table below presents the 
boundaries should the interim monitoring be done at exactly 33%, 56%, 77% and 
100% of the expected information with the overall alpha expended equ al to or less 
than 0.05.

Percent of total 
information  Sample size 
for regimen  Rule to reject adverse 
event rate of 5%  Nominal alpha

33% 21 6+ with adverse event  0.00044  
56% 36 6+ with adverse event  0.00834  
77% 49 7+ with adverse event  0.01058  
100%  64 7+ with adverse event  0.04030  
 
Total alpha is less than 0.05 because the individual tests to be performed are with 
the exact binomial distribution and these rules generate nominal alphas less than 
the O’Brien -Fleming boundary which produces an overall alpha of 0.05. 
Application of a similar rule (an alpha -spending function approach using an 
O’Brien -Fleming monitoring boundary truncated at 3 standard deviations 
beginning at about 33% of the expected information with sub sequent interim 
looks) will have the same property.  
 
ALCL99 had 4 treatment related deaths (1%) during treatment. Therefore, we will 
suspend enrollment to any arm of the study if more than 1 patient dies to review 
the circumstances of the deaths. A recommendation to re -open enrollment might 
be made if causes other than therapy were thought to be the primary cause of death  
 
Due to the apparent increased risk of thromboembolic events and the requirement 
for prophylactic anticoagulation in Arm CZ, as of  Amendment 6A additional 
stopping rules have been added. The trial will be stopped if any of the following 
occur in patients enrolled after Amendment 6 A: 
 
• Two CVL -associated thrombotic events  
• Any one event of  
o Thromboembolic event  requiring surgical intervention , or  
o Pulmonary embolism  
• Two bleeding events , defined as Grade 2 or higher hemorrhage events as 
classified in CTCAE. Grade 2 or higher events correspond to bleeding 
events which require intervention and consist of major blee ding and 
clinically relev ant minor bleeding. Please see Section 11.10  for reporting 
details.  
 
Evidence of improvement in event -free survival outcome compared to that 
expecte d outcome with ALCL99 therapy: There is anecdotal evide nce that these 
agents are ef fective in CD30+/ALK+ disease. Long -term event -free survival (EFS) 
for ANHL12P1 p atients is expected to be 70%. We will compare the EFS outcome 
for each regimen to a fixed exponential cure model with a “cure” rate of 70%, and 
the 30% who fail failing as exponential with lambda equal to 1.5 (95% of failures 
occurring in the first 2 years). Testing at a 10% level of statistical significance (1 -
sided), there will be 90% power to detect an increase in long -term EFS from 70% 
to 84% (r elative risk: 0.50:1.00). The EFS for each of the treatment regimens will 
be compared to the fixed standard u sing a 1 -sample log -rank test. No formal 
comparison of EFS between the two ran domized treatments is planned.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  91 
 
Futility monitoring plan  
The alternative hypothesis is that, compared with standard therapy, the risk of an 
event will be reduced by 50%; that is, the event -free survival (EFS) under the 
alternative is expected to be :  
1/2exp( ( ) [0 1. .7 0.3 5 )] S t t  =− +
  
Let K be the number of failures observ ed in the available follow -up and R be the 
sum of the cumulative hazards associated with S(t) to time ti, where ti is the follow -
up for patient i. Then, under the alternative, T = K –R is approximately normal and 
may be used for interim monitoring. Under th e alternative hypothesis, we expect 
to observe a total of about 10 failures among the 64 eligible patients randomized 
to each treatment. Formal interim monitoring for futility will be done twice for 
each regimen (at ab out 5 and 10 observed events).  Should the test comparing the 
event -free survival outcome to S(t) have an associated 1 -sided p-value less than 
0.05 for either treatment group at either interim analysis (indicating poorer EFS), 
the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee may consider suspending enrollment, 
because the observed outcome is inconsistent with the expected improvement in 
EFS with the addition of crizotinib or brentuximab vedotin to standard treatment.  
 
In the event that enrollment of one regimen is suspended (because of una cceptable 
toxicity or because EFS appears worse that that seen with ALCL99 therapy, 
enrollment of patients will continue and patients will be non -randomly assigned to 
the other treatment regimen.  
 
Because 95% of failures are expected to be observed in the  first two years of 
follow -up, the minimal required follow -up for the EFS analyses will be 2 years 
from the enrollment of the last patient.  
 
9.2.2  Secondary study endpoints:   
Prognostic significance of minimal residual disease (MRD):  MRD evaluations will 
be performed at 3 time points (diagnosis, end of pro phase (Day 6), and end of 
Cycle 1 (first C ourse A). Data from Damm -Welk et al. suggests that about half of 
the patients with ALK -positive ALCL will have tumor cells detected at diagnosis 
by PCR in bone marrow or peripheral blood, and that the failure rate for those with 
tumor cells detected by PCR in bone marrow or peripheral blood is much higher 
than that for patients who are PCR negative.29 For instance, 3 of 25 patients whose 
peripheral blood was negative for NPM -ALK by PCR at diagnosis relapsed (5 -
year event -free survival: 80%) versus 10 of 27 patients whose peripheral blood 
was positive for NPM -ALK by PCR at diagnosis (5 -year event -free sur vival: 
46%). The expected long -term event -free survival for all patients re ceiving 
ALCL99 therapy is 70%. Assuming a total sample size of 128 eligible patients and 
an equal number of patients with and without peripheral blood MRD at diagnosis, 
if 25 events  is assumed to be the total expected information (allowing for the 
possibility that the ANHL12P1 EFS outcome may be improved), then there will 
be 80% power (testing at the 5% level of statistical significance, 1 -sided) to detect 
a relative risk of 2.7:1.0 (corresponding approximately to an event -free surviv al of 
82% for MRD negative and 58% for MRD positive patients) consistent with the 
results of Damm -Welk et al. These comparisons will be made using the log -rank 
test.

9.3 Methods of Analysis  
All patients will be included in the analyses provided they are eligible and evaluable for 
the particular endpoint (EFS, toxicity, etc.). The EFS for each of the treatment regimens 
will be compared to the fixed standard using Woolson’s  1-sample log -rank te st.31 No 
formal comparison of EF S between the two randomized treatments is planned. MRD 
evaluations will be performed at 3 time points (diagnosis, end of prophase (Day 6), and 
end of Cycle  1) and groups analyzed using the log -rank test. Toxicities will be summarized 
by individual toxicit y counts and incidence rate separated by arm and course.  
 
9.4 Evaluability for Toxicity  
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity and included in the toxicity tables and summaries.  
 
9.5 Gender and Minority Accrual Estimates  
The gender and minority distribution of the study population is expected to be:

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
for toxicity and performance reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate ca se report forms.  
 
Please note:  ‘CTCAE v4.0’ is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE 
v4.0 as referenced on the CTEP website (i .e., v4.02 and all subsequent iterations prior to 
version 5.0).  
 
10.2 Response Criteria Overview  
Response will be evaluated in this study using guidelines and response criteria that have 
been revised from previous protocols (ANHL0131 and ALCL99) and the recent work of 
the International Lymphoma Working Group’s revised recommendations for malignant 
lymphoma.  
 
Establishing strict response criteria for ALCL is complicated by the fact that a large number 
of patients possess extranodal disease which by its nature is more difficult to measure. In 
addition, establishing strict CT size criteria for presumptive  lymphomatous nodal 
enlargement is complicated by a number of factors, including substantial size overlap 
between benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and malignant lymphadenopathy, 
interobserver measurement variability, obliquity of node orientation to th e scan plane, 
multiplicity of criteria for size measurement (volumetric vs. bidimensional vs. 
unidimensional; short axis vs. long axis), variability of normal nodal size with body region 
and age. For children and younger adolescents, there are no establish ed size limits for 
normal lymph nodes. Furthermore, in children reactive hyperplasia is common in the 
cervical, axillary, mesenteric, and inguinal regions, and may be associated with nodes up 
to 1.5 -2 cm in diameter. In other anatomic regions, including th e supraclavicular, 
retroperitoneal, iliac, mediastinal, and hilar regions, normal nodes are typically less than 1 -
1.5 cm. Despite these limitations, certain features suggest lymphomatous involvement, 
such as contiguous nodal clustering or matting, and noda l FDG avidity.  
 
With these caveats in mind, the nodal size criterion used by previous lymphoma protocols 
will be used. For visceral organs (such as liver, spleen, kidney, lung) any focal mass lesion 
large enough to characterize is considered due to lympho matous involvement unless the 
imaging characteristics indicate an alternative nature (e.g., cyst, hemangioma, abscess, 
etc.). Lesions too small to characterize are considered indeterminate unless follow -up 
studies allow characterization or tissue sampling is performed.  
 
A measurable lesion by CT or MRI is a lesion that can be accurately measured in 2 
orthogonal dimensions. For extranodal sites, this typically involves lesions of at least 1  cm 
diameter. Lymph nodes are considered abnormal if the long axis i s  1.5 cm, regardless of 
the short axis. Lymph nodes with a long axis measuring between 1.1 -1.5 cm are only 
considered abnormal if their short axis is  1.0 cm.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  94 
 
All measurable lesions should be measured in the axial plane on CT. All measurable 
lesions, representative of all involved organs, will be measured as target lesions at baseline 
and followed for response. Target lesions will be selected on the basis of size (i.e., largest 
lesions) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imaging or c linical exam. 
Lesions will be recorded with size expressed as the PPD (product of perpendicular 
diameters). The PPD is obtained by multiplying the longest diameter of the lesion by the 
maximal diameter perpendicular to the longest diameter  in axial plane , and serves as a 
surrogate measurement of tumor volume, assuming the mass has a spherical or ellipsoid 
shape. The SPPD, or sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters, is obtained by 
adding the products of the perpendicular diameters of measured lesi ons. FDG -PET imaging 
will be performed as per clinical routine, adhering to the imaging guidelines.  
 
Non-measurable assessable lesions include permeative bone lesions, malignant ascites, 
malignant pleural/pericardial effusions, pulmonary or cutaneous lymph angitic spread, and 
lesions too small to accurately measure in 2 dimensions by CT. All non -target and non -
measurable assessable lesions should be  recorded at baseline and noted on follow -up. 
 
10.3 Response Criteria for Patients with ALCL  
 
10.3.1  Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all evidence of disease from all sites. This will be determined by 
physical exam and imaging. All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have 
regressed on CT to normal size (<  1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for 
nodes >  1.5 cm before therapy). Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy must be normal if 
initially positive and any macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging 
techniques should no longer be present. PET scans must be negative if initially 
positive.  
 
10.3.2  Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRu)  
A residual lymph node mass > 1.5  cm in greatest transverse diameter that has 
regressed by >  75% in sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters 
(SPPD)  or returned to normal size (<  1.5 cm in greate st diameter)  will be 
considered CRu. Any residual lesions in organs that have decreased by >75% and 
with a negative PET scan will be considered CRu. When disease affects the liver, 
spleen or kidneys it may be the case that residual abnormalities are seen following 
treatment. These generally measure <  1 cm diameter. Patients with only residual 
positive bone lesions on PET and/or bone scans will be considered in CRu.  Patients 
with bone involvement may have positive lesions on PET or bone scan for some 
time; therefore, th ese patients will be considered in CRu if the other residual 
lesions have disappeared, or if the residual lymph node mass or masses >  1.5 cm 
in greatest transverse diameter have regressed by >  75% in sum of the products of 
the greatest perpendicular diamet ers (SPPD).  
 
10.3.3  Partial Response (PR)  
≥ 50% decrease in the SP PD of the lesions. No new lesions.  
 
10.3.4  No Response (Stable Disease)  
Failure to qualify for a PR. No new lesions.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  95 
 
10.3.5  Progressive disease (PD)  
≥ 25% increase in the size of any lesions or appearance of new lesions.  
 
Caveat : The presence of a residual mass should not be considered as a failure in 
the majority of the cases if it is less than 25 -30% of the initial tumor volume and 
should not imply any modifications of the treatment.  In the ALCL99 series, many 
patients had a residual mass at the end of the treatment and were followed without 
evidence of progression  
 
10.3.6  Duration of Response  
 
10.3.6.1  Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is 
measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR 
(whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since  the 
treatment started). The duration of overall CR is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that 
progressive disease is objectively documented.  
 
10.3.6.2  Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of 
the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference 
the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, 
including the baseline measurements.

11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those 
who will enroll  in future studies using similar agents. Certain adverse events must be 
reported in an expedited manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. 
The following sections provide information about expedited reporting.  
 
11.2 Determination  of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient 
has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse 
event including the Grade (severity), the relationsh ip to the study therapy  (attribution), and 
the prior experience  (expectedness ) of the adverse event; 3) the p hase (1, 2, or 3) of the 
trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was associated 
with the event.  
 
An invest igational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New 
Drug Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved 
packa ge label *.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from 
a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some 
occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial *. 
 
*In this study both brentuximab vedotin and crizotinib are considered investigational 
agents and should have adverse events reported as investigational agents.  
 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the se rules appl y:  
• Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in combination with 
a commercial agent, the combination is considered to be investigational and expedited 
reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational agents.  
• Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent and a 
commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is given for a 
period of time prior to starting the investigational agent, expedited reporting of adverse 
events which occur prior to sta rting the investigational agent would follow the 
guidelines for commercial agents. Once therapy with the investigational agent is 
initiated, all expedited reporting of adverse events follow the investigational agent 
reporting guidelines.  
 
11.3 Expedited Re porting Requirements – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI 
requires that AEs be submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting tables 
assig ned to the protocol, using th e CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System ( CTEP -AERS ). 
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious  Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  97 
 
1) Death.  
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization (for ≥ 24  hours). This does not include hospitalizations which are part 
of routine medical practice.  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantia l disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug exp erience when, 
based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
 
11.4 Special Situations for Expedited Reporting  
11.4.1  SAEs O ccurring More than 30 Days After Last Dose of Study Drug  
Any Serious Adverse Event that occurs more than 30 days after the last 
administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of  
a possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must be reported 
according to the CTEP -AERS  reporting tables in this protocol.  
 
11.4.2  Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
Any AE that results in persistent or significant  incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), 
congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP -AERS if it 
occurs at any time following treatment with an agent u nder a NCI IND/IDE since 
these are considered to be serious AEs  
 
11.4.3  Death  
Reportable Categories of Death  
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the first 
28 days of life.  
• Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed 
to a C TCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed t o a CTCAE term 
associated with G rade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5  “Disease 
progression ” in the system organ class (SOC) “ General disorders and 
administration site conditions ”. Evidence that the death was a manifestation 
of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be 
submitted.  
 
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/inte rvention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  98 
 
 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days after the last dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely rel ated to the investigational agent/intervention.  
 
11.4.4 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (eg, treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A metastasis o f the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary 
malignancy.  
 
The NCI requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with 
an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are 
available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must 
also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in th is protocol.  
 
11.4.5  Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis  from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified . 
 
11.4.6 Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal  
NOTE : When submitting CTEP -AERS  reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form, available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to 301-230-0159.  The potentia l risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in 
the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS  report.  
 
11.4.6.1  Pregnancy  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
needs to be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS  as 
Grade  3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal condition s - Other 
(pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC.  
 
There is a possibility that the sperm of male patients treated on studies 
involving possible teratogenic agents may have been damaged. For this 
reason, pregnancy in partn ers of men on study needs be reported 
and followed in the same manner as a patient pregnancy . 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  99 
 
Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the baby 
is born with a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS  report 
is required.  
 
11.4.6.2 Pregnancy Loss  (Fetal Death)  
Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero .”  Any 
Pregnancy loss should be  be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy loss ” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions ” SOC . Do NOT report a  pregnancy loss  as a Grade 5 event 
since  CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
11.4.6.3  Death Neonatal   
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “Newborn death occurring 
during the first 28 days after birth ”, should be reported expeditiously as 
Grade 4, “ Death neonatal ” under the “ General disorders and 
administration ” SOC,  when the death is the result of a patient 
pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report 
a neonatal death resulting fro m a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in 
partners of men on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS  
recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
11.5 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs  
11.5.1 Baseline AEs  
Although a pertinent positive finding i dentified on baseline assessment is not an 
AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE 
terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is 
entered on a protocol with a pre -existing condition (e .g., elevat ed laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re -assessed throughout the study and reported 
if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines.  
 
a. If the pre -existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must reassess 
the event to determine if an expedited report is required.  
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the i nvestigator must re -assess the e vent to 
determine if an expedited report is required.  
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities existin g 
at baseline.  
 
11.5.2 Persistent AEs  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolut ion between 
treatment cycles.  
 
ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in a subsequent cycle . If the grade becomes more severe the 
AE must be reported again with the new grade.  
 
EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unle ss the grade 
becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent cycle .

Version Date: 02/01/2019  100 
 
11.5.3 Recurrent AEs  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves during a cycle  of therapy and then 
reoccurs in a later cycle.  
ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle must be reported by the routine procedures.  
EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle does not require CTEP -AERS  reporting unless:  
1) The grade increases OR  
2) Hospitalization is associated  with the recurring AE.  
 
11.6 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
11.6.1 Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER ) 
SPEER: Is a subset of AEs within the Comprehensive Adverse Events and 
Potential Risks (CAEPR) that contains a list of events that are considered expected 
for CTEP -AERS  reporting purposes. (Formerly referred to as the Agent Specific 
Adverse Event List (ASAE L).  
 
AEs listed on the SPEER should be reported expeditiously by investigators to the 
NCI via CTEP -AERS  ONLY  if they exceed the grade of the event listed in 
parentheses after the event. If the CAEPR is part of a combination IND using 
multiple  investigatio nal agents and has an SAE listed on different SPEERs, use the 
lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.  
 
11.6.2 Special Situations as Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
An expedited report may not be required for a specific protocol where an AE is 
listed as expected. The exception or acceptable reporting procedures will be 
specified in the protocol. The protocol specific guidelines supersede the NCI 
Adverse Event Reportin g Guidelines. These special situations are listed under the 
CTEP -AERS  reporting Table A  for this protocol.  
 
11.7 Reporting Requirements - Investigator Responsibility  
Clinical investigators in the treating institutions and ultimately the Study Chair have th e 
primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of 
attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. It is the responsibility of the treating 
physician to supply the medical documentation needed to support the ex pedited AE reports 
in a timely manner.  
 
Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP -AERS ) must also be reported via routine 
reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report 
Form (CRF) within the study database.  
 
11.8 Gene ral Instructions for Expedited Reporting via CTEP -AERS  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All 
appropriate treatment areas should  have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/ electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  
 
An expedited AE report for all studies utilizing agents under an NCI IND/IDE must be 
submitted electronically to NCI via CTEP -AERS  at: https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers .

expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
o 7 Calenda r Days - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted 
within 7  calendar days of the investigator learning of the event.  
• Any event that results in a persistent or significant incapacity/substantial disruption  
of the ability to conduct normal li fe functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
is an IME, which based upon the medical judgment of the investigator may jeopardize 
the patient and require intervention to prevent a serious AE, must be reported via 
CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs foll owing investigational agent administration.  
• Any death occurring within 30 days  of the last dose, regardless of attribution to an 
agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 
hours .  
• Any death occurring greater than 30 day s of the last dose with an attribution of 
possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24  hours .  
 
CTEP -AERS  Medical Reporting includes the following requirements as part of the report: 
1) whether the patient has received at least one dose of an investigational agent on this 
study; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  (severity), the 
relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience  (expec tedness ) of 
the adverse event; 3) the p hase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization was associated with the event.  
 
Any medical documentation supporting an expedited report (eg, H & P, admission 
and/or notes, consultations, ECG results, etc.) MUST be faxed within 48 -72 hours to 
the NCI. NOTE: English is required for supporting documentation submitted to the 
numbers listed below in order for the NCI to meet the regulatory reporting timelines.

• Targeted toxicities such as pulmonary toxicity with brentuximab vedotin and 
liver toxicity with crizotinib will be monitored closely  on this study . 
• Grade 2 or higher thromboembolic events require expedited reporting. All 
catheter -related thrombosis should be reported as thromboembolic events and 
not vascular access complications. This should be done for consistency to ensure 
that all e vents are graded similarly.  
• Grade 2 or higher hemorrhage (bleeding) events require expedited reporting. 
Please note that CTCAE uses the location of the hemorrhage to define the event 
(e.g. gastric hemorrhage, colonic hemorrhage, oral hemorrhage, etc.).  
 
Reporting Exceptions  
• Grades  1-4 myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia ; 
lymphopenia ) do not require expedited reporting.   
• Grades  1-2 AST/ALT elevations do not require expedited reporting , and Grade  3 
AST/ALT elevations do not require expedited reporting if they recover 
to ≤ Grade  1 ( < 2.5 X ULN) or baseline within 7  days of study drug interruption.  
• Grade 3 febrile neutropenia does not require expedited reporting.  
• Grade  3 infection does not require expedited reporting.  
• Grade  3 nausea and vomiting of  < 3 days duration does not require expedited 
reporting

dose of treatment with a commercial agent which can be attributed (possibly, probably, 
or definitely) to the agent and is not due to cancer recurrence must be reported via 
CTEP -AERS . 
 
 
11.12 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
Note:  The guidelines below are for routine reporting of study specific adverse events on 
the COG case report forms and do not affect the requirements for CTEP -AERS  reporting.  
 
Routine reporting is accomplished via the Advers e Event (AE) Case Report Form ( CRF) 
within the study database. For this study, routine reporting will include all toxicities 
reported via CTEP -AERS  and all Grade  3 and higher  Adverse Events  (except what is listed 
in Section  11.10), and all Grade 1 -2 Adverse Events which result in dose modifications  
(See Section 5.0 ).  
 
 
12.0 STUDY REPORTING AND MONITORING   
The Case Report Forms and th e submission schedule are posted on the COG web site  with each 
protocol under “ Data Collection/Specimens ”. A submission schedule is included.  
 
12.1 CDUS  
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) . Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due 
January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31. This is not a responsibility of institutions 
participating in this trial.  
 
12.2 Data Safety and Monitoring Committee  
To protect the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all clinical trial research 
by the Children’s Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) reviews reports of interim analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by 
the study statisticia n, in conjunction with the study chair’s report. The DSMC may 
recommend the study be modified  or terminated based on these analyses.   
 
Toxicity monitoring is also the responsibility of the study committee  and any unexpected 
frequency  of serious events on t he trial are to be brought to the attention of the DSMC . The 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  105 
 
study statistician is responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is expected to 
request DSMC review of any protocol issues s/he feels require special review. Any COG 
member may bri ng specific study concerns to the attention of the DSMC.  
 
As explained  earlier  in Section 9.2,  for the first 10 patients of each arm, the study chair will 
review reported toxicities on a weekly  basis through the COG system. The study committee 
will have conference calls at least every month reviewing all the adverse event data, with 
focus on targeted toxicities. The study chair will review reported toxicities, all deaths, and 
patients removed fr om study for due to toxicity on weekly basis and will be reported to the 
DSMC for review, as well.  
 
The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by the study commi ttee prior to 
implementation (e g, termination, dropping an arm based on toxicity res ults or other trials 
reported, increasing target sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines whether and to whom 
outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified 
in the protocol document.

13.0 PATHOLOGY GUIDELINES AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
13.1 Pathology Guidelines  
 
13.1.1  Pathology Goals  
1. Provide accurate diagnosis and classification of pediatric anaplastic large 
cell lymphoma included in this treatment protocol. The diagnosis to be 
based on both morphological and immunophenotypic criteria.  
2. Employ the World Health Organization Lymphoma Clas sification to 
facilitate concordance in diagnosis.  
3. Evaluate pediatric ALCL included in this protocol for pathologic features 
that may impact prognosis.  
 
13.1.2  Requirements for Handling Tissue or Cytology Specimens at Primary Institutions  
Tissue should, wh enever possible, be obtained fresh and delivered immediately to 
the Pathology laboratory for optimal handling and distribution (fixation, snap 
freezing, cytogenetics, etc.)  
 
Representative tissue sections should be submitted for fixation including one bloc k 
with 10% Formalin and, if possible, a second block of tissue with a different 
fixative routinely used by the local pathologist.  
 
13.1.3  Immunophenotyping Recommendations for Primary Institutions  
For initial determination of cell lineage (T or null) the methodology and criteria 
for immunophenotypic analysis defined by the submitting institution will be 
accepted. Recognized methods include paraffin section, immunohistochemistry, 
frozen section immunohistochemistry, and cytospin immunocytochemistry.  
Recommended antibodies  
• Two anti -B antibodies (CD79A, and CD20)  
• Two anti -T antibodies (CD3 and CD43 or CD3 and CD45RO)  
• CD30  
• CD15  
• EMA  
• ALK -1 
• LMP -1 and/or EBER  
13.1.4  Morphology  
The following are recognized morphological variants of anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma  
• Common type  
• Small cell variant  
• Lymphohistiocytic variant  
• Giant cell variant  
• Mixed variant: association in the same lymph node biopsy specimen 
of features of more than one morphological variant (i.e. common type 
plus small cell variant, common type plus lymphohistiocytic, small 
cell variant plus lymphohistiocytic variant etc.)  
• Unclassifiable: because of small biopsy specimens or peculiar 
morphological features (i.e. sarcomatous features, signet cells etc.).

14.0 IMAGING STUDIES RE QUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable depar tures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG 
administrat ive Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
CT and MRI guidelines are available on the COG Member site at:  
https://cogmembers.org/_files/reference/RefMaterial/DiagnosticImagingGuidelines_MRICT.pdf  
 
For PET scan guidelines please refer to the NCI guidelines fo r the recommended set of procedures 
for the acquisition and analysis of 18F -FDG PET scans of patients participating in NCI -sponsored 
diagnostic and therapeutic clinical trials, which can be found at the following link: 
https://imaging.cancer.gov/programs_resources/reports_publications/publications/clinical_trials_
guidelines.htm   
 
 
15.0 SURGICAL GUIDELINES  
15.1 Role of the Surgeon  
The role of the surgeon in patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is to obtain 
tissue for diagnosis and occasionally to treat complications related to the disease. In all 
cases, ALCL is considered a “systemic” disease and thus therapy revolves around 
chemotherapy rather than methods to achieve local control such as surgery or radiotherapy. 
For all sites, tissue should be sent to the pathologist FRESH for histopathology, 
immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetics.  
   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANHL12P1  
Version Date: 02/01/2019  113 
 
APPENDIX I:  STAGING  
Stage  Criteria for extent of disease  
I A single tumour (extranodal) or single anatomic area (nodal) with the exclusion of mediastinum 
or abdomen  
II A single tumor (extranodal) with regional node involvement  
Two or more nodal areas on the same sid e of the diaphragm  
Two single (extranodal) tumors with or without regional node involvement on the same side of 
the diaphragm  
A primary gastointestinal tumor usually in the ileocaeacal area with or without involvement of 
associated mesenteric nodes only, g rossly completely resected  
III  Two single tumors (extranodal) on opposite sides of the diaphragm  
Two or more nodal areas above and below the diaphragm  
All primary intra -thoracic tumours (mediastinal, pleural, thymic)  
All extensive primary intra-abdominal disease  
All paraspinal or epidural tumours regardless of other tumor site(s)  
IV Any of the above with initial CNS and/or bone marrow involvement  
 
Skin involvement  
Skin involvement should always be confirmed by biopsy. Skin infiltration by  continuous tumor growth 
arising by extension from a contiguous lymph node or soft tissue tumor is not considered as primary skin 
involvement.  
 
Mediastinal involvement  
Mediastinal involvement should be confirmed by X -ray or CT -scan. If the histopathological diagnosis can 
be performed by biopsy of other organs such as peripheral lymph nodes, a biopsy is not necessary for 
obvious lesions that may jeopardize the patient.  
 
Lung involvement  
Lung involvement should be confirmed by X -ray or CT -scan. If the histopathological diagnosis can be 
performed by biopsy of other organs such as peripheral lymph nodes, a lung biopsy not necessary for 
obvious lesions that may jeopardize the patient  
 
Bone Marrow  
The presence of any lymphoma cells in a bone marro w aspirate or biopsy represents involvement of the 
marrow by lymphoma. Use of CD30 and/or ALK immunostaining is suggested as it is very helpful in 
demonstrating bone marrow involvement as involvement is often morphologically subtle.  
 
CNS involvement is con sidered if:  
1. Tumor cells are present in CNS or  
2. Cranial nerve palsy is present unexplained by a local extracerebral lesion or  
3. Cerebral or spinal tumor is diagnosed by CT or MRI

APPENDIX V II: YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS  
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY ANHL12P1  
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
 
 
1 We have been talking with you about Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). ALCL is a type 
of cancer of the immune system. ALCL happens when a type of white blood cell that fight s 
infection do es not grow normally. After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of 
cancer.  
 
2 We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have ALCL. A research study is 
when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this study, we want 
to learn more about how to treat children with ALCL.  
 
3 All children who are part of this study will get the standard  treatment for ALCL. The standard  
treatment is with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is medicine that kills cancer. I n this study, one 
group of children will get an extra medicine called brentuximab vedotin and another group of 
children will get an extra medicine called crizotinib. The extra medicine you get will be decided by 
chance, like flipping a coin for “heads” or “tails .” Your doctor will tell you which group you are 
in. We do not know if treatment with either of the extra medicines will be better than usual 
treatment. That is why we are doing this study.  
 
4 Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in  a research study.  These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is getting rid of the 
cancer for as long as possible, and with fewer bad effects; but we don’t know for sure if there is 
any benefit of be ing part of this study.  
 
5 Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. There is a risk that 
you will have more bad effects from adding  either brentuximab vedotin or critzotnib to your usual 
medicines. We do not know this for sure which is why we are doing this study. Other things may 
happen to you that we don’t yet know about.  
 
6 Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. There may b e other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have.  
 
7 We are also going to collect extra blood three times during the study. We want to see if there are 
ways to tell how the can cer will respond to treatment. This sample would be taken when other 
regular blood tests are being performed.  
 
8 We are also asking permission to save leftover tissue for future research to help us learn more about 
cancer and other diseases. This would be ta ken when a regular biopsy is being performed and will 
not involve an extra procedure. You can still take part in this study even if you don’t allow us to 
collect the extra tissue and/or save leftover samples for future research.

(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age)  
 
 
1 We have been talking with you about Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). ALCL is a type 
of cancer of the immune system. ALCL happens when a type of white blood cell that fights 
infection, called “lymphocytes” grows abnormally. After doing tests, we have found that you have 
this type of cancer.  
 
2 We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have ALCL. A research study is 
when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this study, we want 
to learn more about how to treat children and teens ALCL.  
 
3 All children and teens who are part of this study will get the standard  treatment for ALCL. The 
standard  treatment is with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is medicine that kills cancer. In this study,

regul ar blood tests are being performed.  
 
8 We are also asking permission to save leftover tissue for future research to help us learn more 
about cancer and other diseases.  This would be taken when a regular biopsy is being performed 
and will not involve an extra  procedure. You can still take part in this study even if you don’t

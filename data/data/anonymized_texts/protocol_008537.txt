OBJECTIVES : 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of P6 pressure point stimulation  
as opposed to sham -point stimulation  will decrease intra operative and postoperative 
STU#: 00213854  
 Version  1.1 07/27/2023  Page 2 of 12 
HRP -593 / v05202020  nausea and vomiting (IONV and PONV) for patients undergoing non -emergent 
cesarean delivery . We hypothesize  that the addition of stimulation of the P6 pressure 
point to our institutional  current standard of care (phenylephrine infusion , intravenous 
fluid bolus,  and as needed  intraoperative ondansetron ) will decrease the occurrence of 
intraoperative emesis .   
 
 
BACKGROUND : 
Intraoperative and post operative nausea  and vomiting (IONV and PONV) are very 
common among parturients undergoing cesarean delivery  with neuraxial anesthesia , 
with an incidence up to 80%  without intervention .1 IONV and PONV are thought to be 
reduced with the use of prophylactic phenylephrine infusion post spinal anesthesia, 
however , a recent Cochrane review noted only low -quality evidence to support this  
hyopthesis .2 IONV  may decrease maternal satisfaction , increase the risk of aspiration,  
and i mpair surgical conditions .3 IONV  during cesarean delivery  is multifactorial, 
secondary to  hypotension, visceral stimulation  from uterine/ peritoneal manipulation , 
physiologic  changes of pregnancy, and neuraxial opioids.  
 
Although the mechanism is unknown, t here are multiple studies demonstrating that 
stimulation of the P6 acupressure  point decreases PONV  in a variety of  surgical 
procedures .4,5 Stimulation of the P6 acupressure point for antepartum patients has also 
been demonstrated to improve nausea .6  
 
There is mixed data on  stimulation  of the P6 pressure point alone  prevent ing IONV  
during cesarean delivery .7,8 Studies have  demonstrate d inferiority of stimulation of the 
P6 acupressure point alone compared to  ondansetron  during cesarea n delivery .9 
However, there are no studies that evaluate if P6 stimulation in addition to  ondansetron 
decreases IONV  during cesar ean delivery . Benefits of P6 stimulation include  simplicity, 
quick onset of action (~2 -3 min of pressure), minim al adverse events, no drug -drug 
interactions, low cost, and lack  of transfer to  the fetus through placenta and breast milk . 
An evaluation of the efficacy of P6 acupressure stimulation  in addition to the current 
standard of care (phenylephrine infusion , intravenous fluid bolus,  and ondansetron)  is 
warranted.  
 
 
STUDY ENDPOINTS : 
Primary Endpoint:  Presence of emesis  during  scheduled  cesarean delivery . 
 
Secondary Endpoints:  Presence of emesis after scheduled  cesarean delivery , presence 
of nausea during schedul ed cesarean delivery, presence of nausea after scheduled 
cesarean delivery, number of additional antiemetic rescue medications given 
intraoperatively and postoperatively, maternal satisfaction with IONV/PONV 
management .

STUDY INTERVENTION (S) / INVESTIGATIONAL AGEN T(S): 
The P6 pressure point is 2 inches proximal to the flexor retinaculum, between the flexor 
carpi radialis and palmaras longus.  
 
A non -coated ferrite 0.09 -inch by 0.2-inch diameter magnet with a small protrusion with 
an adhesive sti cker will be used for  P6 acupressure point stimulation  bilaterally . The 
magnets used are the same magnets used in clinical practice by Northwestern Medicine 
Osher Center for Integrative Medicine  (150 E Huron St UNIT 1100, Chicago, IL 60611) . 
 
The sham pressure point used will be more distal to the P6 acupressure point, which 
has been used in other studies comparing the effectiveness of acupressure to sham 
point.10 
 
 
PROCEDURES INVOLVE D: 
Prospective, double -blinded, sham controlled , randomized clinical trial. 
 
After signing the informed consent form, study subjects will be randomized to P6 
acupressure group (P6) vs sham point group (Sham  control ). Randomi zatio n will occur 
by randomly select ing a single  envelope  from a mixed pile of 1:1 P6 vs s ham group  
sealed envelopes  (total 200 , 100 designating P6 group, 100 designating sham group , 
will decrease by 1 envelope  after every patient enrollment). E ach study subject  will be 
assigned a study number . An envelope containing two pressure point magnet s, two 
adhesi ve sticker s, and diagram showing where to place the magnet will be opened by 
the research team member. T he magnet s will be placed on the patient by a research 
team  member . The study subject  will be in one (1) of two (2) groups:  
- P6 group:  the pressure point wil l be stimulated by the presence of  the magnet  
when positioned properly on the P6 acupressure point . Additional pressure may 
be applied as desired by the study subject  but is not necessary for P6 
stimulation.  
- Sham group : the sham pressure point (distal to the P6 acupressure point) will not 
provide any benefit .  
 
The study subject will then be taken to the operating room where a spinal anesthetic will 
be administered  according to current standard  of practice . Maternal h ypotension  will be 
defined by systolic blood pressure less than 100mmHg  or mean art erial pressure less 
than 65mmHg  or mean arterial pressure less than 20% of the baseline mean arterial 
pressure (baseline blood pressure will be considered the value in mmHg obtained b y 
the nursing staff in the preoperative area). Maternal h ypotension  will be treated with 
phenylephrine , ephedrine and/or intravenous fluid boluses  as per our current standard 
of care .  
 
A surgical anesthetic  level check will be completed per our current st andard of care. If 
the anesthesia level is  noted to be  above T2, the magnet s and adhesive will be 
removed and the patient will be excluded from the study .   
STU#: 00213854  
 Version  1.1 07/27/2023  Page 4 of 12 
HRP -593 / v05202020   
Ondansetron  8mg IV and dexamethasone  8mg IV will be given after delivery per our 
current institutional standard of care  (Northwestern University Enhanced Recovery after 
Cesarean)  or prior to delivery on an as needed basis . Additional antiemetic medications 
will be given as needed by the anesthesia provider.  Patients will not be denied 
addition al antiemetic medications when participating in the study.  All medications will be 
document ed in EPIC. If the patient experiences IONV , the “nausea”  or “vomiting”  icons 
will be documented  in the ir electronic anesthesia record (EPIC) .  
 
There will be routin e postoperative  orders placed by the anesthesia team in the post -
anesthesia care unit  (PACU). These orders include  antiemetic medications , which can 
be administered by the PACU nursing staff  as needed. Routine postoperative orders, 
including antiemetic medications as needed, will be placed by the OB team on 
admission to postpartum per our institution ’s current standard of care . Medications will 
be administered and documented by the nursing st aff in standard fashion , and this data 
will be collected by the study person nel. Patient s can provide additional pressure point 
stimulation as needed  throughout their postoperative course , for up to 72 hours or until 
discharge, whichever comes first . The p atients can contact a research team member by 
phone if a magnet is lost or moved, and the team member will help replac e the 
magnet (s) in the appropriate location.  
 
The patient will be instructed to remove the magnet s 48 hours postoperatively or upon 
discharge, whichever occurs first. Data collection will terminate at this point. Removing 
the magnet s involve s only removal of the adhesive sticker s. The magnet s can be 
disposed in the trash  or patient s may keep the magnets if desire d. Patients will then 
complete a 5-minute survey to record their  incidence and experience of nausea . This 
survey includes a validated PONV intensity and visual analog scale.11,12 
 
Standard of care is not altered in this study. All participants wil l receive the same level 
of care  if they choose to participate in th e study,  regardless of which study group they 
are in.

RECRUITMENT METHODS  
Anesthesia providers will be educated on the project, the consent process, and will 
remain blinded to P6/sham pressure point during the education process. A study team 
member will be available at all times to answer questions during the education p rocess.  
 
Potential study subjects will first be identified on the  Labor and Delivery board  as being 
both a scheduled cesarean delivery and part of ERAC . Potential study subjects will not 
be approached by a research team member until there is a documented negative result 
of their COVID -19 test.  Given COVID -19, we will attempt to minimize the number of 
people entering the subjects’ room.  Subjects that meet inclusion criteria will be 
approached after the anesthesia evaluation/consent by a study team member . The 
study team member will: ask p otential participants to sign the informed consent form ; 
answer all subjects’ questions ; and place the  magnet s on all subjects .  
 
 
COMPENSATION FOR PAR TICIPATION IN RESEAR CH ACTIVITIES  
Study subjects  will not be compensated for their participation in this study.  As noted 
above, t hey can keep their magnets at study  completion if desired.

WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS  
A subject can request withdrawal from t he study at any time. The study subject can self -
terminate their study involvement by magnet removal, an event which will be addressed 
by our post -intervention survey.  Surveys will be evaluated regularly to address any 
questions /concerns found on the post -intervention survey , and the subject  will be 
contacted if follow -up is required/requested.  A research team member will contact the PI 
by secured  email to inform her about the event le ading to early study termination. If the 
subject requests, all data collected  will not be used.  
 
 
RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS  
Due to COVID19, we will attempt to minimize the number of people entering patients ’ 
room s.  
 
The magnet s may cause mild discomfort at the pressure point site. The magnets will not 
puncture skin. There are no known systemic risks to patients with short -term st imulation 
of the P6 pressure point.  
 
The main risk in study participati on is skin irritation from adhesive that hold s the 
magnets in place. Subjects  with known adhesive sensitivity/allergy will be excluded from 
participati on. 
 
The magnets are ferrite magnets, composed of ceramic and iron, which are the same 
magnet components  used intraoperatively for deactivating defibrillators that  
Northwestern currently uses in operating rooms  with electrocautery . The magnet s could  
theoretical ly cause the patient to be at an increased rate of burns related to the 
electrocautery used  during the operation, however , this risk is minimal  to none . There 
are zero case reports of hand/wrist jewelry -related burns during any surgical procedures 
using el ectrocautery. A study involving metal microdermal implants in pigs with 
electrocautery did not show any evidence of tissue damage13. A grounding pad will be 
placed on the patient , as per the current standard of care,  decreasing the risk of 
electrical curre nt conducting through the magnet. The magnet s will be a great distance 
away from the site where electrocautery will be used.  The magnet s could also 
uncommonly cause contact dermatitis, redness of skin, skin breakdown , and possible 
temporary discoloration o f the skin . 
 
Study subjects will be excluded from the study with immediate magnet removal prior to 
incision if  a sensory dermatomal level higher than T2 to sharp tactile sensation  is 
observed.  This measure will be taken to prevent any potential burn injury from occurring 
without the patient having completely intact thermal nociception. The study subject  will 
also be excluded from the study with immediate magnet removal in the event general 
anest hesia is required at any point during their operative course. The subject  can 
verbalize to the anesthesia provider if she is  experienc ing discomfort at the site of the 
STU#: 00213854  
 Version  1.1 07/27/2023  Page 8 of 12 
HRP -593 / v05202020  magnet s during the operation , and the magnet s will be immediately remove d by the 
anesthe sia provider.  
 
There will be no known risk to the fetus from magnet  use. These magnets are frequently 
used for pregnancy -related nausea  for patients in all trimesters.  
 
If the study subject  experiences any magnet discomfort, it will be immediately removed  
by the in -room provider . 
 
 
POTEN TIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS  
Study subjects utilizing  the magnet s may experience a reduction in IONV and PONV 
and have increased satisfaction. Subjects with the magnet s over the P6 point will 
experience a benefit only while the magnet s are in place (intraoperatively and up to 
~48h post operatively or upon discharge).  
 
Subjects with the magnet s over the sham point will likely not experience a benefit.  
 
 
DATA MANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
This sample size was determined  by assuming there is a baseline rate of 33% 
intraoperative vomiting and that there will be a relative decrease of approximately 50% 
in the group that receives acupressure during cesar ean delivery14. Using a two -sided 
Fisher’s Exact Test, with a significance level of 0.05, it was determined each group 
should contain 98 participants to achieve 80.0 1% power to detect a  difference between 
the group proportions of 0.18. The proportion in the P6 group is assumed to be 0.15 
under the null hypothesis and 0.33 under the sham group. The proportion in sham 
group is 0.15.   Each group was rounded up to 100 participations for a total sample size 
of 200.  
 
The hypothesis will be analyzed using a two -sided two -tailed  independent sample t -test 
with a significance level of 0.05. The primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed 
by two -tailed independent sample t -test or Chi -square test. All of the above information 
will be entered into clinicaltrials.gov  prior to  enrollment of the first research  subject and 
within 1 year of study completion.  
 
All participants will be assigned a participant study number. A single password -
protected document will link the participant name to their participant number. This 
document will be kept in a password -protected computer in a locked office in of the 
Section of Obstetrical Anesthesiology suite in Prentice Women’s Hospital. The survey 
data and the signed consent form, will be stored in REDcap, a secure web applicati on 
speci fically geared for data capture and research studies. Only study team members 
listed in the e IRB will have access to the  REDcap files  and study data . De-identified 
data will also be password protected on  a Department of Anesthesiology dedicated 
computer.  
 After the data set has been reviewed by the PI it will be deidentified.   
STU#: 00213854  
 Version  1.1 07/27/2023  Page 9 of 12 
HRP -593 / v05202020   
 The deidentified data set will be kept in NM password protected computer 
located on the 10th floor Arkes Pavilion (Anesthesiology Administrative 
Office). Access of the data is controlled by the PI. The deidentified data set 
will be sent to Rush University statistician Robert McCarthy PharmD for 
complete statistical analysis.  The data will be sent via Northwestern 
University encrypted email after IRB approval and completion a nd execution 
of a one -way data use agreement (Northwestern University to Rush 
University).     
 
 
 
Only study ID number s will be used to identify participants during data analysis. Data, 
including final analysis, will be stored o n the departmental computer until study  
completion. E lectronic and paper data will be destroyed 5 years after study  completion 
using current standards.  
 
 
PROVISIONS TO MONITO R THE DATA TO ENSURE  THE SAFETY OF 
PARTICIPANT S 
A data safety mo nitoring board con sisting of a  Department of Anesthesiology  attending 
physician , a statistician , and study research personnel will regularly review  the data 
collected to evaluat e participants’  safety. Adverse event data  and study withdraw data  
will be reviewed using the both medical record and surveys  and stored in password -
protected adverse event/withdrawal form . It will be reviewed after 50 and 150 subjects 
have completed the study or if one of the study subject experiences symptoms 
concerning  for an intra -operative bur n from the magnet (s). If the follow -up survey s 
reveal concern s for frequent adhesive intolerance or frequent magnet removal prior to 
study end, the study will be halted for an investigation.  
 
If any study subject  request removal of the magnet s due to pain  or symptoms  
concerning for a burn intraoperatively, the magnet s will be immediately removed  by the 
anesthesia provider  with subsequent physician evaluation of the site . This information 
will be relayed  to the PI via secure email.  
 
These magnets are consi dered safe for use and are frequently used by the  
acupuncturists at Northwestern Medicine Osher Center for Integrative Medicine . 
Adhesive i ntolerance is the most likely complication (redness, irritation, pruritus, and 
rash) and removal the adhesive should resolve symptoms with no long -term 
consequences. Subjects  will be instructed during the consent to immediately remove 
the magnet s/adhesive if they experience any discomfort. The follow -up survey will 
include a question speci fically asking if the magnet s were removed early and the 
circumstances leading up to removal.  
 
Participants are at r isk for loss of confidentiality , however , there will be s trict measures 
STU#: 00213854

CONFIDENTIALITY” (above) for a detailed description.  
 
 
PROVISIONS TO PROTEC T THE PRIVACY INTERE STS OF PARTICIPANT S 
Research subjects will have limited  interactions with study team members , unless the 
patient requests further informatio n, given COVID19 and to minimize disruption . The 
patient  will discuss the research study with a n anesthesia  team member who will obtain 
written informed consent after pre-anesthesia evaluation and consent  per our current 
standard of care . All further questions and follow -up will be conducted by phone  by a 
research team member . Participant s will complete a sh ort survey (requiring less than 5 
minutes ) prior to discharge or at approximately 48 hours post -operatively if that time 
frame falls between 7am and 6 pm. P atients outside this time frame  will be contacted the 
following morni ng to not disrupt their lives /sleep .  
  
 
ECONOMIC BURDEN TO PARTICIPANT S 
Participants are responsible for all costs of their care; however, these costs are the 
same costs  they would incur if not participating in the study.  
 
 
CONSENT PROCESS  
Consent will occur in the preoperative area or in the patient’s private room, prior to 
transport to the operating room on the Labor and Delivery Unit, 8th floor, at Prentice 
Women’s Hospital. Written informed consent will be obtained from a ll study participants 
by the in -room anesthesia provider with a study team research member available for 
additional  questions . There will be no waiting period. Consent document HRP -502 will 
be followed. Anesthesia providers will spend g reater than 5  minutes discussing th e 
study with each subject and should plan for an additional 5 minutes  for any patient 
questions regarding the study or consent  document. If the subject  has further questions, 
a research team member will provide any additional information  prior to transportation to 
the operative room. The subject will  be notified  that there is no con flict of interest 
between any research team member and the protocol, nor will any research team 
member  receive financial compensation.  Participant s will be notified that study 
participation will not affect their medical care costs .

QUALIFICATIONS TO CO NDUCT RESEARCH AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE  
Northwestern’s section of  Obstetrical Anesthesiology  provides obstetric care to  
approximately 4 ,000 patients per year undergoing caesarian delivery . The principal 
investigator (Feyce M. Peralta, MD , MS) is an Associate Professor in the obstetrical 
anesthesiology section who regularly supervises  fellows, residents , and CRNAs 
providing  care to patients o n labor and delivery. An obstetric anesthesia fel low 
(Stephanie Woodward, MD) will have ample time for data collection and evaluation 
during the course of the study. The s ection of  Obstetrical Anesthesiology  has a 
dedicated group of clinical research nurses and study c oordinator who assist with  
recruitme nt and follow -up of patients in clinical anesthesiology trials. All study team 
members have CITI training.  
 
Northwestern’s Integrative Medicine Acupuncturist s were used to educate anesthesia 
providers on acupressure. These acupuncture providers maintain certification and 
regularly see patients in clinic to treat a variety of diseases/symptoms, including 
nausea/emesis. Th is study will utiliz e the same type of magnets  used in their clinical 
practice .

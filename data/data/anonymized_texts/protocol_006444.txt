21-Feb-2019, Final Approved v7.0  BMS CONFIDENTIAL  9 Visit details are provided in the Screening and Day  1 (Randomization) Procedural Outline for Part  1 and Part  2 in 
Table 1. 
Part  1 Treatment Period and Follow -up 
Approximately 60 participants meeting eligibility criteria during the screening period will be randomized into the 
Part 1 treatment period. These partic ipants will be randomized via interactive response technology (IRT) in a 
1:2:1 ratio to receive 45 mg BMS -986263 QW, 90 mg BMS -986263 QW, or placebo QW in a double -blind manner. 
The randomization of participants will be stratified by fibrosis stage (METAVI R Stage 3 or Stage 4). Participants 
will receive study treatment via IV administration for a total of 12 weeks.  
Fibrosis stage will be assessed by liver biopsy during the screening period and on Day  85. Liver stiffness will be 
assessed by MRE at baseline, Day  43, Day 85 (primary efficacy endpoint), Day  169, and Day 253.  
After 12 weeks (Day  85) of treatment, partici pants in Part  1 will enter the 24 -week follow -up period. During this 
time, they will not receive infusions of either active drug or placebo.  
See the Schedule of Activities for Part  1 in Table 2 and Table 3 (Section 1.2).  
 
Part  2 Treatment Period and Follow -up 
Participants meeting eligibility criteria during the screening period will enter the Part  2 treatment period. 
Approximately 120  participants w ill be randomized via IRT in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 45  mg BMS-986263 Q2W, 
90 mg BMS-986263 Q2W, 90  mg BMS-986263 Q4W, or placebo Q2W in a double -blind manner. Randomization 
of the participants will be stratified by fibrosis stage (METAVIR  Stage 3 or St age 4). Participants will receive study 
treatment via IV  administration for a total of 24 weeks. Liver biopsy will be performed during the screening period 
and on Day  169. MRE will be collected at Day  43, Day 85, Day 169, and Day  253 in Part  2.  
After 24 weeks (Day  169) of treatment, participants in Part  2 will enter the follow -up period for 12  weeks. During 
this time, they will not receive infusions of either active drug or placebo.  
See the Schedule of Activities for Part  2 in Table 4 and Table 6 (Section 1.2).  
STUDY POPULATION AND MAIN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:  
Inclusion Criteria  
In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Signed written informed consent  
a. Participants must be willing to participate in the study and sign the informed consent form (ICF).  
b. Participants must be willing and able to complete all study -specific procedures and visits.  
2. Participants must provide documentation showing an SVR for at least  1 year prior to the date of screening. 
SVR is defined as a negative HCV RNA at least  12 weeks from the end of antiviral therapy. Thus, the 
minimum duration is 12  weeks of negative HCV RNA (to establish SVR) plus 1 year of sustained SVR (ie, 
52 weeks + at least 12 weeks).  
3. The participant must have METAVIR Stage 3 or Stage 4 fibrosis (or equivalent if using other classification; 
eg, Ishak) assessed by liver biopsy.  
4. Participants must have a mean score of ≥ 5.0 kPa by FibroScan (Section 8.6.1.4). If a participant has not 
had a liver biopsy within 8 weeks of screening, the biopsy will be carried out during the screening peri od 
following determination of eligibility by FibroScan assessment (ie, has mean FibroScan score of ≥  5.0 kPa).

21-Feb-2019, Final Approved v7.0  BMS CONFIDENTIAL  10 5. The participant must have an adequate MRE and DXA performed during screening confirmed by the central 
imaging facility prior to randomization.   
6. Age and reproductive status  
a. Males or females ≥  21 and ≤ 75 years of age at the time of screening  
b. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test (minimum 
sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotro pin) within 24 hours prior to the 
start of study and prior to each dose of study treatment.  
c. To confirm menopause, females must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL.  
d. Women must not be breastfeeding  
e. WOCBP must agree to follow i nstructions for method(s) of highly effective contraception, as defined 
in Appendix  3, for the duration of treatment (BMS -986263 or placebo ) plus 5 half-lives of study 
treatment (5 days) plus 30  days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 35  days post -treatment.  
f. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to have their female partners follow 
instructions for method(s) of highly effective contraception, as defined in Appendix 3 , for the 
duration of treatment with study treatment (BMS -986263 or placebo) plus 5 half -lives of the study

WOCBP must use barrier methods (eg. male condom, female condom) to prevent transmission of 
seminal fluid that may contain traces of study drug. Barrier methods must be used for the duration of 
exposure with study treatment (BMS -986263 or placebo) plus 5 half -lives of the study treatment plus 
90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 95 days after treatment completion.  
h. WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are also exempt from contraceptive 
requirements, and still must undergo pregnancy t esting as described in this section.  
Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male participants (and/or their caregivers, as applicable) who are sexually 
active with WOCBP, on the importance of using highly effective pregnancy in light of the potential for t eratogenicity 
(Appendix 3 ). Investigators shall advise on the use of highly effective methods of contraception (ie, those that have 
a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently and correctly).

modified by the investigator based on clinical discretion and/or the participant’s previous tolerance of the infusion, 
including any infus ion reactions that may have occurred in the past. In addition, the investigator may choose to 
pause the infusion depending on the participant’s clinical condition and history.  
Of note, while the rate of infusion can be modified as described above; no redu ctions or modifications of the total 
dose to be administered are allowed.  
If a participant experiences an infusion -related reaction, temporary interruption of the infusion and/or reduction of 
the infusion rate (for example, but not limited to, modification  of infusion rate and/or a pause in the infusion) may 
lead to improvement of signs and symptoms. Medications, emergency equipment, and trained personnel able to treat 
immediate or delayed infusion -related reactions should be available for immediate access at the clinical site(s).  
Premedication  
To reduce the potential for possible infusion reactions, based on the discretion of the investigator, the 20 participants 
in Part 1 may be pretreated 15 to 30 minutes before the start of the study treatment infusion.  The investigator may 
choose to administer any or all of the following premedications: 50  mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride IV, 20  mg 
famotidine IV, and/or hydrocortisone 100 mg IV. Hydrocortisone IV may be replaced with methylprednisolone 
sodium succinate 125 mg IV based on the discretion of the investigator. Additionally, the investigator may choose 
not to administer any premedication. If IV diphenhydramine is not available, an oral dose of 5  mg levocetirizine 
dihydrochloride or an oral dose of 50  mg diphe nhydramine hydrochloride may be substituted and administered 2 
hours ± 15 minutes before the start of study treatment infusion.  
Participants who receive antihistamine premedication should be advised that these medications may be sedating and 
cautioned aga inst driving or operating heavy machinery for at least 3 hours after administration, although a longer 
observation period may be necessary for an individual participant. The decision to observe a study participant beyond 
the required 3 hours will be at the  discretion of the attending investigator.  
DURATION OF TREATMENT: In Part 1, each participant will undergo 12  weeks of treatment. In Part  2, each 
participant will undergo 24 weeks of treatment. All treatment groups will be followed for a total of 36 weeks, 
consisting of 24 weeks follow -up for Part  1, and 12 weeks follow -up for Part  2 (see schematic, above).  
STUDY EVALUATIONS: 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants who achieve ≥ 1 stage improvement in liver fibrosis 
(METAVIR score) as determined by liver biopsy after 12 weeks of treatment in Part  1 and after 24 weeks in Part  2. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoi nts: 
•Change in CPA, as compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in Part 1 and after 24 weeks of
treatment in Part 2
•Proportion of participants with ≥ 1 stage improvement in liver fibrosis (Ishak score), as compared to placebo
after 12 weeks of treatment in Part 1 and after 24 weeks of treatment in Part 2
•Proportion of participants with ≥ 2 stage improvement in liver fibrosis (METAVIR score), as compared to
placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in Part 1 and after 24 weeks of treatment in Part 2
•Proportion of participants with ≥ 2 stage improvement in liver fibrosis (Ishak score), as compared to placebo
after 12 weeks of treatment in Part 1 and after 24 weeks of treatment in Part 2
•Proportion of participants with ≥ 15% decrease from baseline in live r stiffness as measured by MRE at
Day 85 in Part  1 and Day  169 in Part  2

will be used to estimate improvement of treatment as compared to placebo for the proportion of participants with > 
1 stage improvement in fibrosis on liver biopsy at Week 12.  
Primary Endpoint Part  2:  
To evaluate the effect of BMS -986263 (45 mg Q2W, 90 mg Q2W, and 90 mg Q4W), on METAVIR Fibrosis Stage 
vs placebo, a stratified Cochran Armitage Trend Test controlling for hepatic fibrosis stage (Stage 3 or Stage 4) will 
be used to analyze the proportion of p articipants with ≥ 1 stage improvement in fibrosis on liver biopsy at Week  24. 
After the assessment of trend, comparisons of each treatment group with placebo will be performed utilizing a 
stratified (fibrosis stage) Cochran Mantel -Haenszel test (CMH). All  of these analyses will be performed at 1 -sided 
0.05 level of significance. In addition, 95%  CIs for the response rates and odds -ratios will be calculated. A sensitivity 
analysis using an extended CMH correlation test will be used to assess the trend among  the proportions for treatment 
groups with an adjustment to strata (fibrosis stage). Two - sided 0.1 level of significance will be used.  
Secondary  Endpoints:  
No adjustment will be made for multiplicity for secondary endpoints.  
Secondary  endpoints will be analyzed in a similar method as the primary endpoint unless otherwise 
specified in the SAP.  
Continuous endpoints may be analyzed by analysis of covariance methods.  
Categorical endpoints will be summarized using counts and percentages and when appropriate may be analyzed 
using categorical analysis methods.  
Subgroup analyses will be performed including hepatic fibrosis stage.  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety assessments will be performed using the safety population. For analysis, all treatment -emergent AEs recorded 
that occur during the conduct of the study will be listed and summarized by system organ class, preferred term, and 
treatment. Vital signs and clinical laboratory test results will be listed and  summarized by treatment. ECG readings 
will be evaluated by the investigator and abnormalities, if present, will be summarized and listed.

8.1.2 Part  1 Trea tment Period and Follow -up 
Approximately 60 participants meeting eligibility criteria during the screening period will be 
randomized into the Part  1 treatment period. These participants will be randomized via 
interactive response technology (IRT) in a 1:2: 1 ratio to receive 45 mg BMS -986263 QW, 
90 mg BMS-986263 QW, or placebo QW in a double -blind manner. The randomization of 
participants will be stratified by fibrosis stage (METAVIR Stage 3 or Stage 4). Participants 
will receive study treatment via IV admin istration for a total of 12 weeks.  
Fibrosis stage will be assessed by liver biopsy during the screening period and on Day  85. 
Liver stiffness will be assessed by MRE at baseline, Day  43, Day 85 (primary efficacy 
endpoint), Day  169, and Day 253.  
After 12 w eeks (Day  85) of treatment, participants in Part  1 will enter the 24 -week 
off- treatment follow -up period. During this time, they will not receive infusions of either 
active drug or placebo.  
See the Schedule of Activities for Part  1 in Table 2 and Table 3 (Section 1.2).  
8.1.4 Part  2 Treatment Period and Follow -up 
Participants meeting eligibility criteria during the screening period will enter the Part  2 
treatment period. Approximately 120 participants will be randomized via IRT in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
to receive 45  mg BMS-986263 Q2W, 90  mg BMS-986263 Q2W, 90  mg BMS-986263 Q4W, 
or placebo Q2W in a double -blind manner. Randomization of the participants will be stratified 
by fibrosis stage ( METAVIR  Stage 3 or Stage  4). Participants will receive study treatment via 
IV administration for a total of 24  weeks. Liver biopsy will be performed during the screening 
period and on Day  169. MRE will be collected at Day  43, Day 85, Day 169, and Day  253 in 
Part 2.  
After 24 weeks (Day 169) of treatment, participants in Part  2 will ent er the follow -up period

8.2 Data Monitoring Committee and Other Committees  
An external DMC will be used in thi s study to perform safety monitoring throughout the study.  
Data summaries and listings will be provided to the DMC to facilitate their assessments at the 
regularly scheduled times and on an ad hoc basis if needed. The safety review includes SAEs 
 
 focusing on early signal detection. Further details on the 
frequency, content, and methods of data reports to the DMC will be outlined in the  DMC 
charter along with the processes and procedures the committee will follow.  
8.3 End of Study Definition  
The start of the study is defined as the visit for first participant screening. The end of the study 
is defined as 2  years after the final Clinical Stud y Report (CSR) (including any addendums) is 
completed. A final summary report will be issued per regulations and local health authority 
requirements.  
The last participant visit is defined as the last visit or scheduled procedure shown in the 
Schedule of A ctivities (Section  1.2) for the last participant.  
The last day of the study will occur when the last participant has completed his/her Day  253 
visit or discontinues early. Study completion is defined as the final date on which data for the 
primary endpoin t in Part 2 of the study was or is expected to be collected, if this is not the 
same. If Part  2 is not initiated, study completion is defined as the final date on which data for 
the primary endpoint in Part  1 of the study was or is expected to be collected , if this is not the 
same. 
Participants will be considered to have completed the study if they complete 253  days of 
evaluation, including all follow -up periods.  
8.4 Study Population

other classification; eg, Ishak) assessed by liver biopsy.  
4. Participants must have a mean s core of ≥ 5.0 kPa by FibroScan (Section  8.6.1.4). If a 
participant has not had a liver biopsy within 8 weeks of screening, the biopsy will be carried 
out during th e screening period following determination of eligibility by FibroScan 
assessment (ie, has mean FibroScan score of ≥ 5.0 kPa).  
5. The participant must have an adequate MRE and DXA performed during screening 
confirmed by the central imaging facility prior to r andomization.  
6. Age and reproductive status  
a) Males or females ≥  21 and ≤ 75 years of age at the time of screening  
b) Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test 
(minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin) 
within 24 hours prior to the start of study and prior to each dose of study treatment.  
c) To confirm menopause, women must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone 
(FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL.  
d) Women must not be breastfeeding  
e) WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of highly effective 
contraception, as defined in Appendix 3, for the duration of trea tment (BMS -986263 
or placebo) plus 5  half-lives of study treatment (5 days) plus 30  days (duration of 
ovulatory cycle) for a total of 35  days post-treatment.  
f) Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to have their female partners 
follow instructi ons for method(s) of highly effective contraception, as defined in 
Appendix  3, for the duration of treatment with study treatment (BMS -986263 or 
placebo) plus 5 half -lives of the study treatment plus 90  days (duration of sperm 
turnover) for a total of 95 days after treatment completion. In addition, male 
participants must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time.  
g) Azoospermic  males are exempt from contraceptive requirements for the purposes of 
prevention of pregnancy (ie, male study participants with partners who are WOCBP). 
However, in addition to the use of highly effective methods of contraception, males in 
the study who ar e sexually active with WOCBP must use barrier methods (eg, male 
condom, female condom) to prevent transmission of seminal fluid that may contain 
traces of study drug. Barrier methods must be used for the duration of exposure with 
study treatment (BMS -986263 or placebo) plus 5 half -lives of the study treatment plus 
90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 95 days after treatment completion.  
h) WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are also exempt from 
contraceptive requirements, and st ill must undergo pregnancy testing as described in 
this section.  
Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male participants (and/or their caregivers, as 
applicable) who are sexually active with WOCBP, on the importance of using highly effective 
pregnancy prev ention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy in light of the potential 
for teratogenicity ( Appendix 3). Investigators shall advis e on the use of highly effective 
methods of contraception (ie, those that have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently and 
correctly).

In most cases, the study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate 
manner (e g, dose tapering if necessary for participant safety). Please contact the 
medical monitor or designee within 24  hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  
See the Schedule of Activities (Section  1.2) for details on the data to be collected at the time 
of treatment discontinuation and follow -up and any further evaluations that need to be 
completed.  
All participants who discontinue study treatment should comply with protocol-specified 
follow-up procedures as outlined in Section 1.2. The only exception to this requirement is when 
a participant withdraws consent for all study pro cedures including post -treatment study 
follow-up or loses the ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated 
for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness). Participants are not to be replaced.  
If study treatment  is discontinued prior to the participant’s completion of the study, the reason 
for the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and entered 
on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) page. As indicated, appropriat e 
follow-up and/or alternate medical care must be arranged for the participant.  
Participants who discontinue study treatment will remain in the study for continued follow -up. 
8.4.6.2  Discontinuation from the Study  
Participants who request to discontinue study trea tment will remain in the study and will 
continue to be followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to 
this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her 
or persons previously authoriz ed by participant to provide this information. Expectations are 
as follows:  
• Participants should notify the investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from 
future follow -up in writing, whenever possible.  
• The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study 
treatment only or also from study procedures and/or post treatment study follow -up, 
and entered on the appropriate eCRF page.  
• In the eve nt that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as 
appropriately directed in accordance with local law.  
• If the participant withdraws consent for  disclosure of future information, the sponsor 
may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
• Assessments for the end of treatment/end of study visit must be performed, provided 
that the participant has not withdraw n consent for these activities.  
• All required eCRF pages must be completed, including the date of and explanation for 
the withdrawal.  
• As indicated, appropriate follow -up and/or alternate medical care must be arranged for

• If investigator’s use of third -party representative to assist i n the follow -up portion of 
the study has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then the investigator 
may use a sponsor retained third -party representative to assist site staff with obtaining 
participant’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete 
the follow -up portion of the study.  
• The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public 
health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information.  
• If after all attempts, the participant remains lost to follow -up, then the last known alive 
date as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the 
participant’s medical records.  
8.4.6.4  Replacement of Participants  
If a higher than expected proport ion of participants discontinue from the study prior to the 
evaluation of the primary endpoint, the sponsor may choose to enroll additional participants to 
ensure an adequate number of participants are available for evaluation of the primary endpoint.  
Rescreening is discussed in Section 8.4.5.  
8.5 Study Treatment  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placeb o, 
or medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study 
randomization or treatment allocation.  
Study treatment includes both investigational [medicinal] product (IP/IMP) and 
noninvestigational [medicinal] product (no nIP/nonIMP) and is described in Table 7. 
An IP, also known as IMP in some regions, is defined a pharmaceutical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products 
already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) 
differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to 
gain further information about the authorized form.  
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be 
considered as nonIP .

8.5.1.1  Study Treatment Infusion Rate  
The study medication should not be infused at a duration lesser than 60 minutes. The infusion 
rate may be modified by the investigator based on clinical discretion and/or the participant’s 
previous tolerance of th e infusion, including any infusion reactions that may have occurred in 
the past. In addition, the investigator may choose to pause the infusion depending on the 
participant’s clinical condition and history.  
Of note, while the rate of infusion can be modif ied as described above; no reductions or 
modifications of the total dose to be administered are allowed.   
If a participant experiences an infusion -related reaction, temporary interruption of the infusion 
and/or reduction of the infusion rate (for example, but not limited to, modification of infusion 
rate and/or a pause in the infusion) may lead to improvement of signs and symptoms. 
Medications, emergency equipment, and trained personnel able to treat immediate or delayed 
infusion-related reactions should be  available for immediate access at the clinical site(s).   
8.5.1.2  Premedication  
To reduce the potential for possible infusion reactions, based on the discretion of the 
investigator, the participants in Part 1 may be pretreated 15 to 30 minutes before the start of 
the study treatment infusion. The investigator may choose to administer any or all of the 
following premedications: 50  mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride IV, 20  mg famotidine IV, 
and/or hydrocortisone 100 mg IV. Hydrocortisone IV may be replaced with 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate 125 mg IV based on the discretion of the in vestigator. 
Additionally, the investigator may choose not to administer any premedication. If IV 
diphenhydramine is not available, an oral dose of 5  mg levocetirizine dihydrochloride or an 
oral dose of 50  mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride may be substituted  and administered 
2 hours ± 15 minutes before the start of study treatment infusion.  
Participants who receive antihistamine premedication should be advised that the premedication 
may be sedating and cautioned against driving or operating heavy machinery f or at least 
3 hours after administration, although a longer observation period may be necessary for an 
individual participant. The decision to observe a study participant beyond the required 3 hours 
will be at the discretion of the attending investigator.

8.5.2 Method of Treatment Assignment  
Before the study is initiated, each user (at investigative sites) will receive log -in information 
and directions on how to access the IRT. Study treatment will  be dispensed at the study visits 
as listed in Schedule of Activities (Section  1.2). 
At the time of the screening visit, immediately after informed consent is obtai ned and before 
any study -related procedures are performed, the investigative site will access the enrollment 
option using the IRT for assignment of the participant number, including participants not 
subsequently randomized or treated. This number will be u nique across all sites. All enrolled 
participants will be assigned sequential participant numbers. The participant number may not 
be used for any other participant. If a potential participant is rescreened, they will be given a 
new identification number.  
Eligible participants will be centrally randomized using IRT to receive BMS -986263 or 
placebo according to a computer -generated block randomization scheme and in accordance 
with stratification criteria. Randomization to a treatment group will be assigned pr ior to dosing.

8.5.3.1  Maintaining the Blind  
Blinded treatment assignments will be managed using IRT. All vials (BMS -986263 and 
placebo) are identical in appearance, and they will be supplied as shown in Table 8. 
Investigative site staff, sponsor and designee personnel, and participants and their families will 
remain blinded to treatment assignments.  
The investigative site staff wil l include 2 individuals with well -defined roles, as follows:  
• An unblinded study drug administrator, who will be responsible for administering the 
infusion and/or adjusting the infusion rate and will ensure that the infusion set is 
concealed with adequate line-cover and bag -cover. This individual will not conduct any 
patient-facing assessments.  
• An assessor, who will be responsible for performing any study -related assessments  on 
study participants including, but not limited to, those pertaining to safety, to lerability, 
or efficacy.   
At all times, every attempt will be made to ensure that the 2 roles are able to function separately 
to ensure blinding of study treatment.  
8.5.3.2  Circumstances for Unblinding  
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity  of this clinical study. However, in 
the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant in which knowledge 
of the IP is critical to the participant’s management, the blind for that participant may be broken 
by the investigator. The participant’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant’s treatment, the investigator should 
determine that the unblinded informa tion is necessary (ie, that it will alter the participant’s 
immediate medical management). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly 
not related to the IP, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the participant is 
receiving ac tive product. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed with the medical monitor, but the investigator always has ultimate authority for 
the decision to unblind. The principal investigator or designee should only  call in for 
emergency unblinding AFTER the decision to discontinue the participant has been made.  
In case of an emergency, the investigator has unrestricted access to randomization information 
via IRT and is capable of breaking the blind through the IRT s ystem without prior approval 
from the sponsor. After the unblinding, the investigator shall notify the medical monitor and/or 
study director. The method of unblinding for emergency purposes is described in the IRT 
Manual. Participant and unblinded treatmen t information and the reason for the blind being 
broken must be recorded on the appropriate study status page of the eCRF. After unblinding 
via IRT, the investigator shall notify the medical monitor.

made to preserve the blind. Any request to unblind a participant for nonemergency purposes 
should be discussed with the medical monitor.  
Designated staff of BMS Research & Development may be unblinded (obtain the 
randomiz ation codes) prior to database lock to facilitate the bioanalytical analysis of PK 
samples . A bioanalytical scientist in the Bioanalytical Sciences 
department of BMS Research & Development (or a designee in the external central 
bioanalytical laboratory) will be unblinded to (may obtain) the randomized treatment 
assignments in order to minimize unnecessary bioanalytical analysis of samples.  
8.5.4 Study Treatment Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability  
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility 
of the investigator to ensure that IP is only dispensed to study participants. The IP must be 
dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulatio ns. 
Please refer to the study Pharmacy Manual for IP and nonIP preparation.  
Study treatment not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.  
IP documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that includes all 
processes required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of 
drug storage, administration, and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reco nstitution, and use 
of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).  
Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study treatment are provided 
in Appendix 1 .  
8.5.5 Dose Modification  
No reductions or modifications of the total dose are allowed. If a participant interrupts 
treatment due to an AE, study tr eatment can be restarted.   
8.5.6 Treatment Compliance  
As all study medication will be administered by site staff, treatment compliance will not be 
formally assessed.

All medications taken from within 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment until the 
last study visit must be recorded on the eCRF. Prior medications are defined as medications 
taken within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment and discontinued before the first dose 
of study treatment. Concomitant medica tions are defined as any medication taken after the first 
dose of study medication until  the last study visit. Concomitant medications (prescription, 
over-the-counter, or herbal) should be administered during the study only if they are prescribed 
for treatment of specific clinical events.  
Restrictions and prohibitions on prior and concomitant medications are as follows:  
1. Anti-obesity agents (eg, ORLISTAT).  
2. Ongoing therapy for HCV or received therapy for HCV within 52  weeks prior to 
administration of study tr eatment. 
3. Interferon therapy for any disease, or received interferon therapy for any disease within 
52 weeks prior to administration of study treatment.  
5. Prior exposure to BMS -986263 is prohibited.  
6. Concomitant use of nintedanib is prohibited. Prior use of nintedanib is permitted but 
must be discontinued at least 3 days befo re the first dose of study treatment.  
7. Other investigational agents. Any other investigational agent must be discontinued at 
least 12 weeks or 5 half -lives before the first dose of study treatment, whichever is 
longer.  
8.5.8 Treatment After the End of the Study  
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue to provide BMS -supplied study treatment to 
participants/investigators unless BMS chooses to extend the study. The investigator should 
ensure that each participant receives appropriate standard of care to treat  the condition under 
study. 
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS -supplied study treatment if any of the 
following occur: a) the study is terminated due to safety concerns or other reasons; b) the 
development of BMS -986263 is terminated for oth er reasons, including but not limited to lack 
of efficacy and/or not meeting the study objectives; c) the participant can obtain medication 
from a government -sponsored or private health program. In all cases BMS will follow local 
regulations.

Every effort must be made to ensure that the same evaluator(s) completes the assessment for 
each participant. If the evaluator(s) is unable to complete the evaluation, then a qualified 
individual with overlapping experience may perform the assessment. Docu mentation of who 
performed the assessment is to be recorded in source documents. Assessments should be 
performed at approximately the same time of day throughout the duration of the study. Day 1 
(Randomization) assessments must be performed per protocol (s tandard of care assessments 
may not be used for baseline). Procedures not specified in the protocol that are part of standard 
care may be performed if they do not interfere with study procedures; any data arising from 
such procedures are not to be reported  in the eCRF.  
The following procedures or tools will be used to assess participants’ fibrotic disease activity 
during the study (see Schedule of Activities in Section  1.2):  
• Liver biopsy assessments (Section 8.6.1.1) 
• Other noninvasive measures:  
o Liver stiffness as measured by MRE (Section  8.6.1.2) 
o Liver fibrosis scoring:  
▪ FibroScan (Section  8.6.1.4) 
8.6.1.1  Liver Biopsy  
Biopsies performed during screening for purposes of determining eligibility w ill be assessed 
by a local pathologist. Participants must have METAVIR Stage 3 or Stage 4 liver fibrosis to 
be eligible. If pathologic evidence suggesting a cause of liver fibrosis other than 
HVC-associated fibrosis is observed (eg, NASH), the participant is not eligible. If there is any 
question about the eligibility of a participant based on locally assessed biopsy results, the 
investigator should contact the medical monitor prior to randomizing the participant.  
Tissue from biopsies performed during the s tudy (or tissue submitted from prior biopsies when 
appropriate, see Section  8.1.1) will be collected for analysis. All histological assessments 
related to efficacy of BMS -986263 will be performed by a central reader. Details on the 
acquisition, quality requirements, histological preparation, and shipping of histological 
samples are in the Central Laboratory Manual. Due to the delay in assessing tissu e samples for 
study endpoints, a report from the central pathologist will not be provided to the study sites. If

21-Feb-2019, Final Approved v7.0  BMS CONFIDENTIAL  102 8.6.1.1.1  Histological Assessment and METAVIR scoring  
The METAVIR system is used to assess the extent of inflammation and fibrosis by 
histopathological evaluation in a liver biopsy of patients with  HCV. It assesses liver biopsies 
for activity grade (A0 -A3: A0 = no activity, A1  = mild activity, A2  = moderate activity, 
A3 = severe activity) and fibrosis stage (Stage 1 – 4: 1 = portal fibrosis without septa; 
2 = portal fibrosis with few septa; 3  = numerous septa without cirrhosis; or 4  = cirrhosis).  
8.6.1.1.2  Histological Assessment and Ishak  scoring 
The Ishak scoring system will also be used to grade fibrosis in the histology samples. The Ishak 
system (0 through 6 scale) was developed to grade portal -based liver fibrosis associated with 
viral hepatitis:  
• 0: No fibrosis  
• 1: Fibrous expansion of some portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa  
• 2: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas, with or without short fibrous septa  
• 3: Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging  
• 4: Fibrous expansion of portal areas w ith marked bridging (portal to portal as well as 
portal to central)  
• 5: Marked bridging (portal –portal and/or portal –central) with occasional nodules 
(incomplete cirrhosis)  
• 6: Cirrhosis, probable or definite  
8.6.1.1.3  Morphometric Analysis of Collagen Proportionate A rea in Stained Tissue  
There can be considerable intra - and inter-individual variation in the assessment of liver biopsy 
to determine fibrosis stage. Assessment of CPA is a method by which the amount (percentage) 
of collagen in stained tissue sections is a nalyzed using morphometric image analysis. This 
technique allows for a quantitative assessment of fibrosis. This morphometric assessment will 
be performed by a blinded central pathologist.  
8.6.1.2  MRE Imaging Assessment  
MRE is a noninvasive medical imaging technique approved by FDA in 2009. It quantitatively 
measures the stiffness of soft tissues by introducing shear waves and imaging their propagation 
using MRI. MRE has been demonstrated t o be accurate and reproducible, and highly 
concordant compared to histopathology for staging liver fibrosis .23

21-Feb-2019, Final Approved v7.0  BMS CONFIDENTIAL  103 In this study, MRE will be used to quantitate liver stiffness as  a surrogate biomarker of liver 
fibrosis.  
MRE assessments should be performed at time points indicated in Schedule of Activities 
(Section 1.2). MRE should be conducted at the early termination visit only if the participant’s 
prior MRE occurred > 4 weeks prior to termination. The central imaging facility will perform 
all MRE imaging analyses.  
Adequacy of the MRE should be confirmed by the central imaging facilit y prior to 
randomization. Image acquisition guidelines and submission processes will be outlined in the 
IM025006 Imaging Manual, to be provided by the central imaging facility. The clinical sites 
will be trained in imaging procedures prior to scanning the first study participant. Images will 
be submitted to the central imaging facility for central review. The site will be informed of 
quality issues or the need to repeat scanning from the central imaging facility.  
Any incidental findings of potential clinic al relevance that are not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by the investigator in collaboration 
with a local radiologist, as per standard medical/clinical judgement.

8.6.1.4  FibroScan  
FibroScan is an ultrasound -based medical device dedicated to the noninvasiv e measurement 
of liver stiffness, approved by FDA in 2013. The procedure is painless for the patient, 
noninvasive, rapid (5 -10 minutes), and repeatable. Presently, there are more than 2,000 
FibroScan devices available in more than 70 countries in the world . It is widely utilized in 
hepatologists’ offices for the initial evaluation of patients with liver disease before or 
potentially to forgo liver biopsy.  
Multiple studies and meta -analyses have demonstrated that liver stiffness values measured by 
FibroScan  correlate highly with advanced fibrosis in chronic liver diseases.24-27 Liver stiffness 
values above 9.6 kPa and 12.5 kPa are indicative of advanced fibrosis (Stage  3) and cirrhosis 
(Stage 4), respectively.

Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities 
(Section 1.2). All urgent safety concerns must be discus sed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.  
The safety of BMS -986263 will be assessed by evaluation of the incidence of all AEs and 
SAEs leading to withdrawal of st udy medication,  
 laboratory data, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, physical examinations, vital signs,  
 
The participants must not have documented bone abnormalities at baseline as defined in the 
Exclusion Criteria (Section 8.4.2).  
 Since DXA is required at baseline, the 
investigator should consider the results of the assessment in determi ning the eligibility of a 
potential participant.  
8.6.2.1  Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 2. 
AEs will be re ported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant’s legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definiti on of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs 
that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue before completing the study.  
The event (term), along with its start and stop dates, maximum intensity (mild, moderate, or 
severe), seriousness (yes/no), relationship to the IP (yes/no), action taken with regard to the IP, 
and outcome will be recorded in the eCRF.

Nonserious AEs will be collected from the time of the first dose of IP  through the date of the 
follow-up or last visit, and at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities 
(Section 1.2). 
The Reference Safety Information in Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 of the IB should be used to 
determine the expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting. Following the participant’s 
written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, wheth er related or not related to study 
drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified 
procedures.  
All SAEs that occur from the time ICF is signed to 30 days after the final dose of the study 
drug must be reported to P RA Drug Safety. After that time, only SAEs deemed by the 
investigator to be related to the study drug or a study procedure should be reported.  
If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later protocol -specified procedure.  
• The investigator mus t report any SAE that occurs after this time period and that is 
believed to be related to study treatment or protocol -specified procedure.  
• Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recor ded on the appropriate section of the eCRF.  
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported to sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as 
indicated in Appendix 2.  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor or designee within 
24 hours of this being available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the investigator learn s of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the 
study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor.  
The method of evaluating intensity and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in  
Appendix 2. 
8.6.2.1.2  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a participant. In order to prevent reporting bias, participants should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.  
8.6.2.1.3  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs

study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE page of 
the eCRF. Completion of supplemental eCRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory 
abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively fol low each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the 
condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to 
follow-up (as defined in Section 8.4.6.3). 
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 2. 
8.6.2.1.4  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
product under clinical investig ation are met.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate accor ding to local requirements.  
The sponsor or designee will report AEs to regulatory authorities and IECs according to local 
applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA CFR 21 CFR Parts  312 
and 320. A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious A dverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs 
and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and investigators following local 
and global guidelines and requirements.  
8.6.2.1.5  Pregnancy  
If following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5 half-lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the medical 
monitor/designee of th is event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to 
BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE 
reporting procedures described in Appendix 2. 
If the participant becomes pregnant study treatment must be discontinued immediately. Please 
contact the medical monitor or designee within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  
Follow-up informatio n regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant sh ould be reported 
to sponsor or designee. In order for sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
information from the female partner, the female partner must sign an ICF for disclosure of this

8.6.2.1.6  Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE 
eCRF page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms are only i ntended as a 
back-up option when the electronic system is not functioning.  
• Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study 
treatment discontinued or interrupted  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by 
the reporting inves tigator (eg, anemia vs low hemoglobin value).  
8.6.2.1.7  Potential Liver Injury  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. The study treatment discontinuation  
criteria are provided in Section 8.4.6.1. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined 
criteria, must be reported as SAEs ( Appendix 2 for reporting details).  
Participants who meet criteria for DILI should have relevant laboratory testing (eg, ALT, AST, 
and INR levels) repeated at least weekly until abnormalities have resolved. Tests should be 
repeated within 3 days; then, every 3 days until reversal is noted; and then, every week until 
normalization. The investigator should make every effort to determine if any  other cause for 
the liver test abnormalities is present.  
8.6.2.1.8  Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, ECG, X -ray 
filming, or any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a non serious or serious AEs, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdos e must 
be reported as SAEs ( Appendix 2 ). 
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should do the following:  
1. Contact the medical monito r immediately.  
2. Closely monitor the participant for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities until 
BMS-986263 can no longer be detected systemically.  
3. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 2 days from the date of the last dose of 
study treatment if requested by the medical monitor (determined on a case -by-case 
basis). 
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in 
the eCRF.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in 
consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.  
8.6.2.3  Physical Examinations  
Schedules for physical examinations are provided in Schedule of Activities (Section  1.2). 
Complete and/or abbreviated physical examinations may be performed by a Doctor of 
Medicine (MD) or equivalent, or someone who is authorized to perform the examinations by 
training and has been delegate d this task by the principal investigator.  
Full physical examinations will be performed at screening and Days  85 and 253 in Part  1 and

appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, chest/lungs,  heart, abdomen, 
lymph nodes, extremities, height, and body weight.  
Abbreviated physical examinations will be performed at the other time points (Schedule of 
Activities; Section  1.2), which will include an abdominal exam, assessments of ascites and 
hepatic encephalopathy, and symptom -focused assessments. An abbreviated examination may 
note any changes in the participant’s condition (body systems) since the last asse ssment and 
does not preclude examination of any of the other body systems as clinically indicated. Every 
effort should be made to ensure the same evaluator will complete the examination for each 
participant at all visits throughout the study. Documentation  of who performed the examination 
is to be recorded in source notes.

9.1 Sample Size Determination  
This study will enroll a total of 60 participants in Part  1 of the study, randomized v ia IRT in a 
1:2:1 ratio to receive 45 mg BMS -986263 QW, 90 mg BMS -986263 QW, and placebo QW. 
The sample size for Part1 is not based on formal statistical justification. Part  1 of the study is 
designed for estimation purposes; no statistical testing will be  performed. A 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the primary endpoint of proportion of participants with ≥ 1 stage improvement 
in fibrosis on biopsy after 12  weeks of treatment and odds -ratios between treatment groups 
will be utilized for this purpose.  
In Part 2, approximately 120 participants will be randomized via IRT in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
receive 45  mg BMS-986263 Q2W, 90 mg BMS -986263 Q2W, 90 mg BMS -986263 Q4W, or 
placebo Q2W in a double -blind manner. The primary endpoint for Part  2 is the proportion of 
participants with ≥  1 stage improvement in fibrosis on biopsy after 24 weeks of treatment. For 
this portion (Part  2) of the study, it is anticipated that approximately 10% of the participants 
will discontinue (dropout) early from study treatment. Participant s who discontinue early or 
otherwise have the result from the liver biopsy missing will be considered a “nonresponder” 
for the evaluation of the primary endpoint and other binary endpoints based on liver biopsy.  
The response rates for the primary liver bio psy endpoint for the 4 treatment groups in Part  2 
are assumed to be as follows: placebo Q2W – 20%, 90 mg BMS -986263 Q4W – 30%, 45 mg 
BMS-986263 Q2W – 35%, and 90  mg BMS-986263 Q2W  – 50%. With these assumptions, 
using a 1-sided 0.05 level of significance, t here will be 80% power to detect a trend using a 
Cochran Armitage trend test in the primary endpoint among the 4  treatment groups with n  = 30 
in each group.

The following populations are defined for analysis purposes:  
Population  Description  
Enrolled  All participants who sign informed consent.  
Randomized  All participants  who are randomized to a treatment, analyzed as 
per randomized treatment.  
Modified intent -to-treat 
(mITT) All participants who are randomized to a treatment and receive 
at least 1 dose of study medication analyzed as per randomized 
treatment. All primary efficacy analyses will be conducted 
using this population.  
Pharmacokinetic  All participants who receive at least 1 dose of BMS -986263 and 
have any available concentration -time data.  
Safety (A s-treated)  All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of study 
treatment, analyzed according to the treatment actually 
received. All safety analyses will be conducted using this 
population.  
9.3 Statistical Analyses  
The statistical analysis plan  (SAP) will be developed and finalized before database lock for the 
primary efficacy analysis and will provide detailed specifications of the analysis of all efficacy 
endpoints and safety and will also describe the selection of participants to be included in the 
analyses and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data.  
This section provides a summary of planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary 
endpoints.   
9.3.1 Efficacy  
9.3.1.1  Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants who achieve ≥  1 stage 
improvement in liver fibrosis (METAVIR score) as determined by liver biopsy after 12 weeks 
of treatment in Part  1 and after 24 weeks in Part  2.  
Secondary efficacy endpoi nts are as follows:  
• Change in CPA, as compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in Part 1 and after

Efficacy analyses will be performed using the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population. The 
handling of missing values will be defined in the SAP.  
Primary Endpoint Part  1: To evaluate the effect of BMS -986263 (90 mg QW) on METAVIR  
Fibrosis Stage  at Week 12, a 95.0% CI of response rate for treatment vs placebo will be used 
to estimate the difference between the proportion of participants with ≥ 1 stage improvement 
in fibrosis on liver biopsy. Additionally, the odds ratio of each treatment will be used to 
estimate improvement of treatment as compared to placebo for the proportion of participants 
with > 1 stage improvement in fibrosis on biopsy at Week 12.  
Primary Endpoint Part  2: To evaluate the effect of BMS -986263 (45 mg Q2W, 90  mg Q2W, 
90 mg Q4W)  on METAVIR  Fibrosis Stage vs placebo, a stratified Cochran Armitage Trend 
Test controlling for hepatic fibrosis stage (Stage 3 or Stage 4) will be used to analyze the 
proportion of participants with ≥ 1 stage improvement in fibrosis on biopsy at Week  24. After 
the assessment of trend, comparisons of each treatment group with placebo will be performed 
utilizing a stratified (fibrosis stage) Cochran Mantel -Haenszel test (CMH). All of these 
analyses will be performed at 1 -sided 0.05 level of significance. In addition, 95% CI for the 
response rates and odds -ratios will be calculated.  
A sensitivity analysis using an extended CMH correlation test will be used to assess the trend 
among the proportions for treatment groups with an adjustment to strata (fibrosis st age).31 
Two-sided 0.10 level of significance will be used.  
Secondary  Endpoints: No adjustment will be made for multiplicity for  
secondary  endpoints. Secondary  endpoints will be analyzed in 
a similar method as the primary endpoint unless otherwise specified in the SAP.  
Continuous endpoints may be analyzed by analysis of covariance methods.  
Categorical endpoints will be summarized using counts and percentages and  when appropriate 
may be analyzed using categorical analysis methods.  
Subgroup analyses will be performed including hepatic fibrosis stage.

The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review an d documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/EC (and 
if applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) to study participants.  
If a deviation or change to a protocol is impleme nted to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) 
prior to obtaining relevant approval/favorable opinion(s) the deviation or change will be 
submitted, as soon as possible to:  
• IRB/IEC or  
• Regulatory Authority(ies), if applicable by local regulations (per national 
requirements)  
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority must be sent to BMS.  
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for 
review and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent 
from participants currently enrolled in the study if t hey are affected by the amendment; and 
(3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new participants prior to enrollment.  
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investigators must inform their 
IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
Financial Disclosure  
Investigators and subinvestigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the sponsor to submit complete and 
accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the approp riate health authorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.  
Informed Consent Process  
Investigators must ensure that participants are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to 
participate.  
In situations where consent cannot be given to part icipants, their legally acceptable 
representatives (as per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant 
volunteers to participate.  
Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, global or local)

the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Investigators must:  
• Provide a copy of the ICF and written information about the study in the 
language in which the participant is most proficient prior to clinical study 
participation. The language must be nontechnical and easily understood.  
• Allow time necessary for particip ant or participant’s legally acceptable 
representative to inquire about the details of the study.  
• Obtain an ICF signed and personally dated by the participant or the 
participant’s legally acceptable representative and by the person who 
conducted the inform ed consent discussion.  
• Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written ICF 
and any other information to be provided to the participants, prior to the 
beginning of the study, and after any revisions are completed for new 
information.  
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or 
legal guardian, and the participant subsequently becomes capable of making and 
communicating his or her informed consent during the study, consent must addition ally be 
obtained from the participant.  
Revise the ICF whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the 
participant’s consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, should 
fully inform the participant or t he participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant’s willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should 
be documented.   
The confidentiality of records that could identify participants must be protected, respecting 
the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the participants’ 
signed ICF and, in the US, the participants’ signed Health Insura nce Portability and 
Accountability Act Authorization.  
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have 
direct access to participant records.  
Participants unable to give their written consent (eg, those with stroke or  severe dementia) 
may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable representative. The 
participant must also be informed about the nature of the study to the extent compatible with 
his or her understanding, and should this partici pant become capable, he or she should 
personally sign and date the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a 
participant who is unable to give his or her written consent, but who is capable of forming an 
opinion and assessing information to refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the 
clinical study at any time should be considered by the investigator.

Case Report Forms  
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations  and other data pertinent to the investigation on each 
individual treated or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from 
source documents and reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the source documents or 
the discrepancies m ust be explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and 
analyzed in an effort to enhance understanding of product safety. Electronic case report 
forms may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported or 
identified d uring the course of the study.  
For sites using the sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, eCRFs will be prepared 
for all data collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will be 
reported on the electronic SAE form a nd Pregnancy Surveillance Form, respectively. If an 
electronic SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left 
blank only in those circumstances permitted by study -specific eCRF completion guidelines 
provided by sponsor or desig nee.

Monitoring  
BMS  representatives will review data on -site to identify potential 
issues to determine a schedule of on -site visits for review of study records.  
Representatives of BMS  must be allowed to visit all study site 
locations periodically to assess the data quality and study integrity. On site, they will review 
study records and directly compare them with source documents, discuss the cond uct of the 
study with the investigator, and verify that the facilities remain acceptable. Certain eCRF 
pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source documents.  
In addition, the study may be evaluated by BMS  internal auditors 
and government inspectors who must be allowed access to eCRFs, source documents, other 
study files, and study facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.  
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections scheduled by regula tory 
authorities, and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to sponsor or designee.

DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse Event Definition:  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening 
of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study 
drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treat ment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, 
whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
Events Meeting the AE D efinition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinical ly 
significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator. Note that 
abnormal lab tests or other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the 
final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported 
term should be updated to be the diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administra tion even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a con comitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as 
reported by the investigator), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such 
overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae and should specify “intentional 
overdose” as the verbatim term.  
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).

21-Feb-2019, Final Approved v7.0  BMS CONFIDENTIAL  139 DEFINITION OF SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
Serious A dverse Event Definition: Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
Results in death  
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetical ly might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see 
note below)  
Note: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does 
not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening 
event) 
• elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)  
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to 
entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
• admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on 
health status and requi res no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, 
economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative 
reason) 
• admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other 
SAEs (applies to oncology protoco ls) 
Results in persistent or significant disability or permanent damage  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [eg, 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above). Examples of such e vents include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization. Potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is also 
considered an im portant medical event (see Section 8.4.6.1 for the definition of potential 
DILI).  
 
Pregnancy and potential DILI must follow the same transmission timing and proce sses to 
BMS as used for SAEs (see Section 8.6.2.1.5 for reporting pregnancies).

21-Feb-2019, Final Approved v7.0  BMS CONFIDENTIAL  141 EVALUATING AES AND S AES 
Assessment of Intensity  
The intensity of AEs is determi ned by a physician and will use the following levels:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant , causing minimal 
discomfort, and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for 
rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reasonable possibility of a relationship” 
conveys that there are facts,  evidences, and/or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.   
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marke ted products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investig ator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. However, it is very 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.  
• The investigato r may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality 
assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.

21-Feb-2019, Final Approved v7.0  BMS CONFIDENTIAL  142 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Note: 
Follow-up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relat ionship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 
24 hours to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial 
SAE report.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to 
PRA Drug Safety within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form. For studies capturing SAEs through 
electronic data capture, electronic submission is the required method for reporting. In the 
event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission, paper forms must be used and 
submitted immediately. When paper  forms are used, the original paper forms are to 
remain on site.

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
o A postmenopausal st ate is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman 
over age 45  years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In 
addition, females must have a serum FSH level >  40 mIU/mL to confirm 
menopause.  
 
Note: Females treated with hormone replac ement therapy (HRT) are likely to have 
artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a 
physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT 
used. The duration of the washout per iods below are suggested guidelines and the 
investigators should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels.  
• 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)  
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8 week minimum for oral products  
 
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum 
FSH level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be 
considered postmenopausal.  
 
Contraception Guidance for Female Participants of Child Be aring Potential  
One of the contraception methods listed below as “ Highly Effective ” is required to be used 
during this study and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 days after the 
end of study treatment, plus 30 days. Hormonal contrac eption and methods listed as not 
highly effective or ineffective below are not permitted.

21-Feb-2019, Final Approved v7.0  BMS CONFIDENTIAL  144 Contraceptive Methods Classified as Highly Effective  
User Independent  Methods  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)c  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of con traception should be used.  
• Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence 
is elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have 
pregnancy tests.  
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in 
the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forgo complete abstinence  
 
Contrac eptive Methods Not Classified as Highly Effective  
User Dependent Methods  
Failure rate of > 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide. Male and female condoms cannot 
be used simultaneously  
• Diaphragm with spermicide  
• Cervical cap with spermicide  
• Vaginal Sponge with spermicide  
• Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action  
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception  
• Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods)  
• Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)  
• Spermicide only  
• Lactation amenorrhea method  
Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Guidance for collection of Pregnancy Information and outco me of pregnancy on the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form is provided in Section  8.6.2.1.5  and the Appendix for AEs

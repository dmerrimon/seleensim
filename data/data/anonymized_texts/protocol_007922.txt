Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 1.0 Background 
1.1  Multiple Myeloma:  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of the differentiated 
plasma cells that affect the older patient with a median age at onset of 65-70 years and a 
slight male predominance. Nearly 27,000 pa tients with myeloma are diagnosed in the 
United States each year (seer.cancer.gov), a nd despite considerable improvements in 
therapy remains incurable and uniformly fatal,  with a median overall survival of around 6 
years (Kumar SK et al. 2013). Recent improvements in therapies have significantly 
improved the survival outcomes (Kumar et al. 2013), but given the inevitable relapses seen in these patients, new approaches to therapy are clearly needed.  
1.2  Implications of salvage ASCT approach in multiple myeloma : The management of MM 
has witnessed a substantial change over the past  decade, primarily as a result of the use of 
effective novel agents. Previously, the conventional approach for SCT-eligible patients was induction therapy with dexamethasone  alone or combination regimens like 
Vincristine, Adriamycin, and Dexamethasone  (VAD) for 4–6 months, followed by high-
dose melphalan and peripheral autologous blood stem cell transplantation (SCT), as 
phase 3 trials had demonstrated a survival im provement with SCT approach compared to 
conventional chemotherapy, initiall y in patients younger than 65 (
Kyle RA, Rajkumar 
SV 2004, Attal M et al. 1996 . Child JA et al. 2003 ) and subsequently in SCT-
eligible older patients as well. (Kumar SK. et  al. 2008) Additionally, one randomized trial 
demonstrated comparable efficacy for SCT applied early in the course of the disease course or when used as salvage therapy follo wing failure of primary therapy (Fermand JP 
et al, 1998).  
With the use of well-tolerated novel agents in  combinations with dexamethasone, or with 
other conventional agents, response rates compar able to those witnessed in the context of 
SCT were noted (Rajkumar SV et al 2008., Harousseau JL et al. 2007. Cavo M, et al 
2009). Therefore, the advantages seen with ear ly SCT have somewhat diminished and 
many patients prefer to defer SCT until relapse. (Lacy et al 2007, Rajkumar et al. 2008) 
The preliminary data analysis of the IFM/DFCI DETERMINATION trial showed no 
improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients who were randomized to early SCT 
underscoring again that SCT may be deferred in the context of current regimens (Attal M. 
et al. , 2015) . The theories that patients relapsing after induction with a novel agent-based regimen will not be able to obtain a meaningful response from high-dose 
melphalan and that patients will be losing th e opportunity to benefit from an effective 
treatment modality such as SCT have largely been debunked. In fact comparisons of 
patients going to early SCT to those who d ecided to stay on initial therapy in recent 
clinical trials have suggested favorable su rvival outcomes for both groups (Kumar SK et 
al., 2012)  
Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASC T) is increasingly being used as salvage 
therapy in patients with relapsed and refr actory multiple myeloma. While utility of this 
approach has not been studied in a prospec tive fashion, sufficient evidence exists from 
retrospective studies to consider this therapy in patients with relapsed disease. It has been 
used as an effective salvage treatment, bot h for patients who have not had a prior 
transplant as well as those who have received a single ASCT as part of their initial 
treatment.  
The International Myeloma Working Group in collaboration with the Blood and Marrow 
Transplant Clinical Trials Network, the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, and the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation recently summarized current knowledge regarding the role of ASCT in MM patients progressing 
MC168A  6  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 after primary therapy and proposed guidelines fo r the use of salvage HCT in MM. (Giralt 
et al, 2015). The expert committee recommended that salvage ASCT should be 
considered standard in transplantation-e ligible patients relapsing after non SCT-based 
primary therapy and that the role of post salva ge ASCT maintenance needs to be explored 
in the context of well-designed prospective tr ials that should include new agents, such as 
monoclonal antibodies, immune-modulating ag ents, and oral proteasome inhibitors 
(Giralt et al, 2015).  Reinduction treatment with combination chemotherapy is the 
standard and most experts agree that hi gh-dose therapy consolidation should be 
considered the standard of care at this time for this patient population. The experts agreed 
that this patient population of relapsed/re fractory myeloma, although heterogeneous, is 
worthy of prospective trials designed to a ddress the issue of optimal reinduction therapy 
and consolidation to determine whether their natural history is different than that for 
patients relapsing after a prior autograft. (Giralt et al. 2015 ). 
The Mayo Clinic Group retrospectively studied 290 patients with untreated MM who received IMiD-based initial therapy (Kumar S et al., 2012) Patients who underwent a 
stem cell harvest attempt were considered transplantation-eligible and were included. 
SCT within 12 months of diagnosis and within  2 months of harvest were considered early 
SCT (n=173). SCT >12 months after diagnosis  was considered delayed SCT (n=112). In 
the delayed SCT group, 42 patients had underg one SCT, and the median estimated time 
to SCT was 5.3 months and 44.5 months in  the early SCT and delayed SCT groups, 
respectively. The 4-year overall survival rate from diagnosis was 73% in both groups. 
The time to progression after SCT was similar between the early and delayed SCT groups. These results indicated that, in transplantation-eligible patients who receive IMiDs as initial therapy followed by early stem  cell mobilization, delayed SCT results in 
similar overall survival compared with early SCT (Kumar S et al., 2012).  
Although, the introduction of newer, more effective therapies such as IMiDs and the 
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has led to high response rates and deeper responses and 
has raised questions regarding the continued role of SCT in this disease, MM remains the 
most common indication for ASCT in North America according to data reported to the 
CIBMTR. The results of the S9321 trial suggested  that the survival advantage of upfront 
SCT might not persist once the complete response rates of conventional therapy 
improved (Barlogie et al., 2006). As a result of the high response rates seen at the end of the induction therapy, and low toxicity profile of current regimens, patients are increasingly opting to delay SCT and continue  with initial therapy. (Rajkumar et al., 
2008, Lacy et al, 2007)  
The Mayo Clinic study showed that the paradi gm of comparable survival with early or 
delayed-SCT holds true in the context of newer therapies as it did with the alkylator 
based regimens of the past. The results were true irrespective of the specific IMiD used, 
whether thalidomide or lenalidomide, furthe r confirming that the equivalence of SCT 
used in an early or deferred fashion is ther apy independent. The differences in proportion 
of patients on the two drugs in the two groups likely reflects the better tolerability of 
lenalidomide and the increasing comfort on the part  of physicians to defer transplant with 
the availability of more long term data with lenalidomide. (Kumar S, 2012). The 
comparable time to progression after early or delayed-SCT was in stark contrast to the results from the previous randomized trials that examined early versus delayed-SCT. In the MAG90 trial, a delayed-SCT was associated with a shorter TTP after SCT even though the overall survival was comparable w ith the two approaches (Fermand JP et al, 
1998). 
MC168A  7  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 An aspect of the early transplant approach th at was traditionally used to favor an early 
transplant had been the reduced time with symptoms and side effects of therapy. 
However, this paradigm has been changed w ith the newer agents, which are much better 
tolerated and can often be continued for pr olonged duration with minimal toxicity and 
impact on quality of life. Hence it is not surprising that there is increased acceptance of the delayed-SCT approach. This will have to be explored in the context of prospective 
trials comparing an early-SCT to delayed-SCT. The decision to go ahead with an early SCT or to defer transplant till relapse can be based on several factors including response to induction therapy, toxicity from treatment, physician bias, and patient perception 
among others. The Mayo study addressed the use of SCT primarily as the second line of 
therapy, as was the common practice in the pe riod that was studied, and the results cannot 
be necessarily extrapolated to patients r eceiving an SCT after failing multiple lines of 
therapy with different newer drugs (Kumar S, 2012). 
In another study, the Mayo Clinic Group examined the outcomes in 98 patients 
undergoing salvage ASCT for relapsed MM af ter receiving an initial transplant. 
(Gonsalves W. et al., 2013). The median age at second ASCT was 60 years and the 
median time between the two ASCTs was 46 months. The median PFS from ASCT was 10.3 months and the median OS was 33 months. In a multivariable analysis, a shorter time-to-progression (TTP) after initial ASCT, not achieving a CR after salvage ASCT, 
higher number of treatment regimens be fore second ASCT and a higher plasma cell 
labeling index at ASCT, predicted for shor ter PFS. However, only a shorter TTP after 
first ASCT predicted for a shorter OS. From this study as well as the prior studies in the 
literature, it is clear that salvage ASCT is an  effective and feasible therapeutic option for 
MM patients relapsing after other treatments. 
Investigators at the University of Arkan sas, reported on 94 patie nts who had relapsed 
following ASCT, 31 of whom received a second ASCT  at relapse. (Tricot G. et al., 1995) 
In this study, patients receiving a second autologous or allogeneic tr ansplant had a better 
survival compared to those who received standa rd therapy, which may also reflect patient 
selection. Patients with low beta-2-microgl obulin or a response lasting more than 12 
months from the first ASCT had better survival with salvage therapy.  
A group of investigators from the UK studied 172 patients who relapsed after one ASCT 
that was performed at maximal response from induction therapy with CVAMP regimen. 
(Alvares et al., 2006)  Among these, 118 pa tients received CVAMP at relapse and 54 
received alternative chemotherapy followe d by a second ASCT in 83 of them, based on 
availability of stem cells and performance  status. No difference was seen in EFS for 
patients receiving a second ASCT or alternative therapy at first relapse though there was 
a trend towards improved OS with repeat ASCT. In this study, there was no benefit to a 
second ASCT in those patients whose response from the initial transplant lasted less than 
18 months with a median survival of less than six months compared to nearly 3 years for those with longer response duration from the first transplant.  
Another study reported on patients who ha d up-front ASCT followed by a second ASCT 
in case of relapse or progression (Elice et al., 2006). Among the 70 patients who relapsed, 
26 went on to have a second ASCT at a median time of 20.4 months from first ASCT. Median OS and EFS after the second ASCT were 38.1 and 14.8 months. 
Studies have not systematically studied the im pact of induction therapy prior to salvage 
ASCT or the role of post-transplant conso lidation and maintenance. While the responses 
to the salvage transplant is overall encour aging, it still remains rather short and 
approaches such as consolidation and mainte nance that have improved outcomes in the 
MC168A  8  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 setting of initial transplant should be evaluate d in the context of salvage transplant. The 
combination of a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD is one of the most effective treatment 
regimens in MM( Richardson PG et al., 2010, Richardson PG, 2009). The drug 
combinations currently used are beset with a degree of toxicity that precludes long-term 
therapy and also can affect the quality of life metrics. Some of these regimens require IV 
or subcutaneous administration, which can re quire frequent clinic, visits for patients.  
Ixazomib is the first oral proteasome inhibitor to enter the clinic and has efficacy similar 
to bortezomib, with excellent activity seen in combination with lenalidomide in the 
setting of newly diagnosed disease. Pomalidomid e is a new IMiD with activity seen in 
nearly a third of the patients who are refractor y to lenalidomide. The combination offers a 
convenient oral regimen that is also a poten tially effective combination in patients with 
relapsed disease who would have been exposed  to prior IMiDs and proteasome inhibitors. 
The oral proteasome inhibitor also offers  the opportunity to study a convenient 
maintenance therapy in the setting of relapsed disease. The current study proposes to examine the outcome following a salvage stem cell transplant, done following an 
effective induction therapy, and followed by consolidation and maintenance.  
1.3 Ixazomib : MLN9708, which has been formulated for both intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) 
administration, is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor. It is the citrate ester of the 
biologically active boronic acid form, MLN2238. In water or aqueous systems, MLN9708 rapidly hydrolyzes to MLN2238, therefore all doses and concentrations are 
expressed as MLN2238. Nonclinical studies were conducted with a solution of either 
MLN2238 or MLN2238 in equilibrium with MLN9708. Similar to bortezomib, MLN2238 potently, reversibly, and selectively inhibits the 20S proteasome. However in contrast to bortezomib, it has a shorter dissociation half-life (t1/2) that may contribute to increased tissue distribution. Bortezomib has a slowly reversible dissociation rate from 
the red blood cell proteasome, while MLN2238 demonstrates a more rapidly reversible 
dissociation rate from the blood but sustained effects on bone marrow and tumor proteasomes suggesting better tissue distribution. The pharmacologic implications of this difference in binding kinetics and tissue distribution may in turn result in differences in safety and efficacy profiles in a broader range of tumors. In xenograft-bearing mice, the 
more rapid dissociation rate correlates with an increased ratio of tumor proteasome 
inhibition to blood proteasome inhibition, and ixazomib shows greater antitumor activity 
in several xenograft models, both solid tumor and bortezomib-resistant xenografts, than bortezomib. 
Nonclinical Pharmacology : MLN2238 refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form 
of the drug substance, ixazomib citrate (MLN 9708). Ixazomib refers to the citrate ester of 
MLN2238. In water or aqueous systems, the equilibrium shifts from ixazomib to the 
biologically active boronic acid form MLN2238. All doses and concentrations are 
expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238. 
In Vitro Pharmacology: MLN2238 preferentially binds the β5 site of the 20S proteasome; 
at higher concentrations, it also inhibits the activity of the β 1 and β2 sites. MLN2238 
inhibits ß5 site 20S proteasome activity in  vitro, with a half-maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) of 3.4 nM. Potency is  reduced roughly 10-fold versus ß1 (IC50=31 
nM) and 1,000-fold versus ß2 (IC50 =3500 nM ). MLN2238 was also tested for inhibition 
against a panel of 103 kinases, 18 receptors (n eurotransmitter, ion channel, brain and gut 
receptors), and 9 serine proteases. In all cases, the IC50 values were >10 μM. MLN2238 
and bortezomib have different β5 proteasome dissociation half-lives (t1/2), reflecting 
differences in their on-off binding kinetics (the β5 proteasome dissociation t1/2 for 
MLN2238 and bortezomib are 18 and 110 minutes, respectively). Based on these 
MC168A  9  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 favorable characteristics, ixazomib is antic ipated to be effective against multiple 
myeloma. (Ixazomib Investigator’s Brochure (IB). Proteasome inhibition results in the 
accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated substrates within the cell and leads to cell cycle 
disruption, with concomitant activation of a poptotic pathways and cell death. Consistent 
with inhibition of ß5 20S activity, MLN2238 demonstrated potent activity against 
cultured MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells in the WST cell viability assay. In 
nonclinical models MLN2238 has activity ag ainst both solid tumor and bortezomib-
resistant xenografts. 
In Vivo Pharmacology : To determine the activity of MLN2238 in vivo, 
pharmacodynamic studies were performed in immunocompromised mice bearing either 
CWR22 human prostate or WSU-DLCL2 (human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]) tumors. Pharmacodynamic responses in xenograft tumors were analyzed by assessing 20S proteasome inhibition and by evaluating levels of accumulated protein markers such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)  damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) 
and activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3) as well as measuring growth arrest. Increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3 is  indicative of a downstream biological 
response to proteasome inhibition. After a single dose of MLN2238, a clear dose response was observed in CWR22 xenografts  as seen in both tumor 20S proteasome 
inhibition and in changes in GADD34 and ATF-3 expression. In WSU-DLCL2 
xenografts, greater tumor proteasome inhibition was observed with MLN2238 compared 
to bortezomib and resulted in increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3. MLN2238 efficacy experiments demonstrated str ong antitumor activity in 4 xenograft models: 
CWR22 (a human prostate cancer cell line) and 3 human lymphoma cell lines (WSU-DLCL2, OCI-Ly7-7D1-luc, and PHTX-22L). In the case of the CWR22 xenograft model, significant antitumor activity was seen with bot h IV and PO dosing, demonstrating that 
this molecule has antitumor activity when administered via different dosing routes. In all 3 lymphoma lines, MLN2238 demonstrated stronger antitumor activity than did bortezomib. In summary, MLN2238, similar to bortezomib, is a dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor that potently, reversib ly, and selectively inhibits the proteasome. 
There are several features, such as sustained pharmacodynamic effects and activity in a 
bortezomib-refractory lymphoma xenograft model,  that suggest that it may have activity 
that extends beyond that seen with bortezomib. 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics : Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics: 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MLN2238 were studied in severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing hum an CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-
Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus m onkeys. Because of the extensive red blood 
cell (RBC) partitioning of MLN2238, both blood and plasma PK parameters were determined in these studies. MLN2238 had a very low blood clearance (CLb) and a moderate blood volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss,b) after IV administration. The concentration-versus-time curve of ML N2238 displayed a distinct bi-exponential 
profile with a steep initial distribution phase and a long terminal t
1/2 (>24 hr) in all species 
tested. MLN2238 had higher plasma clearance (CLp) and a larger plasma volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss,p) than in blood, largely because of the extensive RBC partitioning. The PK properties of MLN2238 after oral administration were studied in rats and dogs. The plasma oral bioavailability (F) was 41% in rats and nearly 100% in 
dogs. A clinical prototype formulation of the ixazomib capsule demonstrated that MLN2238 had excellent oral F and an excellent absorption profile in dogs. In addition, 
interindividual variability, as measu red by %CV, in Cmax and AUC
0-24hr after oral 
administration was low to moderate, similar to that after IV administration. The terminal 
t1/2 after oral administration was also similar to that after IV administration. Comparison 
MC168A  10  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 of the PK profiles after IV or PO administra tion in the dog is reported in further detail in 
the IB. MLN2238 is predicted to have very  low CLb (0.0045 L/hr/kg) and a moderate 
Vss,b (0.79 L/kg) with a long terminal t 1/2 (>24 hours) in humans. The human efficacious 
IV dose of MLN2238 is predicted to be 2.0 mg/m2 (0.054 mg/kg) twice weekly. The 
human efficacious oral dose is pred icted to be between 2 and 5 mg/m2 twice weekly, 
based on a predicted oral F of between 41% (as seen in rats) and 100% (as seen in dogs). 
The efficacious dose projection for once weekly oral would be higher than twice weekly 
oral (data not provided). 
Metabolism appears to be a major route of elimination for MLN2238 and urinary 
excretion of the parent drug was negligible (<5% of dose). In vitro in liver microsomes, 
the metabolism of MLN2238 was high in mice and low to moderate in all other species 
studied. MLN2238 is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes and non-CYP enzymes and proteins. The rank order of relative biotransformation activity of each of the 5 major human CYP isozymes in the in vivo studies was 3A4 (34.2%) >1A2 
(30.7%) >2D6 (14.7%) >2C9 (12.1%) >2C19 (negligible). 
MLN2238 is neither an inhibitor of CYP is ozymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 (IC50 
>30μM, with an estimated inhibition dissociation constant [Ki] >15 μM), nor a time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (up to 30 μM). The potential for ixazomib treatment to 
produce DDIs via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low. 
In a Caco-2 cell assay, MLN2238 showed medium permeability with a B-to-A/A-to-B 
permeability ratio of 2.9. MLN2238 may be a lo w-affinity substrate of para-glycoprotein 
(P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) efflux pump transporters. MLN2238 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, and 
MRP2 (IC50 >100 μM). Consequently, the potential for MLN2238 to cause DDIs with 
substrates or inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is low. 
Ixazomib Safety Pharmacology : In exploratory safety pharmacology studies, MLN2238 
was a weak inhibitor of the cloned cardiac potassium (K+) human ether à-go-g o related 
gene (hERG) channel, with an IC50 of 59.6 μM, which exceeds, by approximately 200-
fold, the plasma Cmax (111 ng/mL [0.3 μM]) predicted to occur in humans at the optimally efficacious dose after IV administration. 
In the GLP-compliant, 1-cycle, repeat-dose, PO toxicology study in beagle dogs, an 
increase in QTc was seen in male dogs at non- tolerated doses, and a potential increase in 
QTc was seen in male dogs at tolerated do ses. However, increased QTc was not seen in 
female dogs at any dose, despite the fact that female dogs had plasma Cmax values 
similar to those of male dogs. Additionally, in a GLP-compliant, 2-cycle, repeat-dose, IV toxicology study in beagle dogs, no increase in QTc was seen in either male or female 
dogs at any dose, even though dogs in the IV study had higher MLN2238 plasma Cmax values than did the male dogs in the PO study. These data suggest that MLN2238 has a low potential for prolonging the QT interval in vivo . 
Toxicology : All studies discussed in this section were  conducted with a solution of either 
MLN2238 or MLN2238 in equilibrium with ixazomib. Because ixazomib was shown to 
dissociate immediately to MLN2238 upon exposure to plasma in vitro and therefore 
could not be detected in plasma samples in vitro all doses, concentrations, and PK parameters noted, here and in the IB, are expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238. 
The toxicology studies of MLN2238 were studied in SCID mice bearing human CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-Dawley rats, beag le dogs, and cynomolgus  monkeys. Details 
of these studies are included in the IB. 
MC168A  11  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 In Vitro  Toxicology: MLN2238 was not mutagenic in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-
compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay).  
In Vivo  Toxicology: Details of the in vivo  toxicology IV dosing and oral dosing studies 
are provided in the IB. To summarize, the toxicologic effects seen in the IV and PO 
studies are qualitatively similar to what was pr eviously observed in rodents dosed with 
bortezomib. MLN2238 did not cause significant toxicities that have not been previously observed after dosing with bortezomib. Therefore, on the basis of the similarity in the toxicity profile in rats between MLN22338 and bortezomib, MLN2238 is not known to present any additional safety risks beyond th ose that occur after treatment with 
bortezomib. In addition, there were no signifi cant findings at tolera ted exposures in dogs 
observed after PO administration that were not  seen after IV administration, and similar 
exposures were tolerated regardless of the route of administration. 
The potential risks identified from nonclinical studies in dogs and rats include: 
• GI toxicity that could result in nausea, vo miting, diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte 
imbalance, bleeding, bowel obstruction (i ncluding ileus and intussusception), and 
sepsis. 
• Reduced blood counts manifest as throm bocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. 
Reticulocytopenia was described in animals and may be associated with anemia. 
Reductions in blood counts may predispose to an increased susceptibility to infection, 
bleeding, and anemia. 
• Peripheral nerve ganglia effects that may be associated with peripheral neuropathy that includes pain, burning sensation, and numbness. Autonomic and motor 
neuropathy may be observed, as both have been reported for bortezomib. 
• Lymphoid cell depletion that may be associa ted with increased risk of infection, 
including re-activation of herpes zoster. 
• Acute phase response that may result in fever and metabolic changes. 
All of the effects seen in the GLP-compliant PO toxicology studies in both dogs and rats 
at tolerated doses were reversible/reversing and can be monitored in the clinic with 
routine clinical observations (GI disturbances and infections secondary to lymphoid compromise), clinical pathology assessments (inhibition of erythropoiesis, 
thrombocytopenia, and inflammatory leukogr am), and neurologic assessment, as are 
commonly done for patients treated with bortezomib. The neurologic lesions in these studies are similar to what has been described after treatment with bortezomib and are believed to be the cause of the peripheral ne uropathy observed in patients treated with 
bortezomib.Further details are presented in the IB. 
Clinical Experience with Ixazomib : Ixazomib is a small molecule peptide boronic acid 
analog. Ixazomib is the first investigational proteasome inhibitor with substantial oral 
bioavailability in patients with multiple my eloma. Similar to bortezomib, MLN2238 
potently, reversibly, and selec tively inhibits the 20S proteasome. However in contrast to 
bortezomib, it has a shorter dissociation half-life (t1/2) that may contribute to increased 
tissue distribution. Bortezomib has a slowly reversible dissociation rate from the red 
blood cell proteasome, while MLN2238 dem onstrates a more rapidly reversible 
dissociation rate from the blood but sustained effects on bone marrow and tumor proteasomes suggesting better tissue distribution. The pharmacologic implications of this difference in binding kinetics and tissue distribution may in turn result in differences in 
safety and efficacy profiles in a broader range of tumors. In xenograft-bearing mice, the 
more rapid dissociation rate correlates with an increased ratio of tumor proteasome 
inhibition to blood proteasome inhibition, and ixazomib shows greater antitumor activity 
MC168A  12  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 in several xenograft models, both solid tumor and bortezomib-resistant xenografts, than 
bortezomib. 
Ixazomib has been evaluated as an oral single agent in phase 1 studies that have included 
patients with advanced solid tumors, lym phoma, relapse/refractory MM (RRMM), and 
relapsed or refractory light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and demonstrated early signs of 
activity. Ongoing studies continue to i nvestigate both single-agent ixazomib and 
ixazomib in combination with standard tr eatments. Based on encouraging preliminary 
data observed in patients with  MM requiring systemic treatment, two phase 3 trials in 
newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) (C16014) and RRMM (C16010) patient populations are 
currently evaluating ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and dexamethasone (RevDex) versus placebo/RevDex . Both trials are combining ixazomib at 
a weekly dose of 4.0 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle to a standard dose of lenalidomide with a weekly dexamethasone dose of 40 mg. In addition, clinical 
pharmacology studies have evaluated drug-dr ug interactions with ketoconazole, 
clarithromycin, and rifampin, as well as the eff ect of food, renal impairment, and hepatic 
impairment on the PK of ixazomib. Studies evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ixazomib alone (in Japanese patients) and in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in Asian adult patients (incl uding Japanese patients) with a diagnosis of 
RRMM are ongoing. 
As of 27 March 2013, preliminary clinical data  are available for a total of 653 patients 
across 13 studies. The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well 
tolerated. The adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the class-based effects of proteasome inhibition and are similar to what has been previously reported with bortezomib though the severity of some, for example peripheral neuropathy, is less. 
While some of these potential toxicities may be severe, they can be managed by clinical 
monitoring and standard medical intervention, or, as needed, dose modification or 
discontinuation. 
Fatigue was the most common AE reported among 384 patients treated in the oral (PO) 
studies (47%). Other common AEs reported in the pooled intravenous (IV) and PO safety 
populations include nausea, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and vomiting. Rash is also a 
commonly reported treatment-emergent event; however, there is some variety in its characterization and causality resulting in different preferred terms to describe it. A high-level term outline of rash events includes r ashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC; pruritus 
NEC; erythemas; papulosquamous conditions; and exfoliative conditions. The dose escalation phases of most trials reported in th e IB have now completed enrollment, and 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were the common dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when 
the use of prophylactic anti-emetics was not permitted per protocol. In the expansion cohorts or phase 2 cohorts ( per each study), the incidence and severity of GI symptoms was mitigated by the use of the lower maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D) ( per each study) and standard clinical usage of anti-emetics and/or antidiarrheal medications as deemed appropriate. 
 
The most frequent (at least 20%) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported with the PO formulation pooled from single-agent studies (n=201) irrespective of causality to ixazomib, include nausea ( 53%), fatigue (51%), diarrhea (44%), 
thrombocytopenia (34%), vomiting (38%), d ecreased appetite (32%), fever (21%), and 
anemia (21%). The most frequent (at least 20%) TEAEs reported with the PO 
formulation pooled from combination trials (i rrespective of the combination) (n=173), 
irrespective of causality to ixazomib, incl ude diarrhea (47%), fatigue (44%), nausea 
(38%), peripheral edema (35%), constipati on (33%), insomnia (29%), thrombocytopenia 
MC168A  13  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 (28%), anemia (26%), vomiting (26%), neutropenia (25%), back pain (24%), pyrexia 
(23%), peripheral edema (21%, each), feve r (20%), cough (20%), hypokalemia (20%), 
neutropenia (20%), and upper respiratory tract infection (20%). Overall rash of all grades 
is reported in approximately 50% of patien ts and is more common when ixazomib is 
given in combination with lenalidomide, where rash is an overlapping toxicity. 
Additional detailed informati on regarding the clinical experience of ixazomib may be 
found in the IB, including information on the IV formulation .  
Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism : After oral dosing, absorption of ixazomib is 
rapid with a median first time to maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) of 
approximately 1 hour postdose. The plasma exposure (AUC) of ixazomib increases in a dose-proportional manner over a dose range of 0.2 to 10.6 mg based on population PK 
analysis. The absolute oral bioavailability (F ) of ixazomib is estimated to be 58% based 
on population PK analysis. A high-fat meal reduced ixazomib Cmax by 69% and 
AUC0-216 by 28%. This indicates that a high-fat meal decreases both the rate and extent 
of absorption of ixazomib. Therefore, ixazomib should be dosed at least 2 hours after 
food or 1 hour before food. 
The steady-state volume of distribution of ixazomib is large and is estimated to be 543 L 
based on a population PK model. Based on in vitro plasma protein binding measurements 
on samples from clinical studies (Studies C16015 and C16018), ixazomib is highly bound 
to plasma proteins (99%). Ixazomib concentrations are higher in whole blood than in 
plasma, indicating extensive partitioning of  ixazomib into red blood cells, which are 
known to contain high concentrations of the 20S proteasome. 
Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for ixazomib. In vitro studies 
indicate that ixazomib is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) and non-CYP proteins. At concentrations exceeding those observed clinically (10 µM), ixazomib was metabolized by multiple CYP isoforms with estimated relative contributions of 3A4 
(42.3%), 1A2 (26.1%), 2B6 (16.0%), 2C8 (6.0%), 2D6 (4.8%), 2C19 (4.8%), and 2C9 
(<1%). At 0.1 and 0.5 µM substrate concen trations, which are closer to clinical 
concentrations of ixazomib following oral administration of 4 mg ixazomib, non-CYP mediated clearance was observed and seemed to  play a major role in ixazomib clearance 
in vitro. These data indicate that at clinica lly relevant concentra tions of ixazomib, non-
CYP proteins contribute to the clearance of ixazomib and no specific CYP isozyme predominantly contributes to the clearance of ix azomib. Therefore, at clinically relevant 
concentrations of ixazomib, minimal CYP-mediated DDIs with a selective CYP inhibitor would be expected. 
Ixazomib is neither a time-dependent inhibito r nor a reversible inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5. Ix azomib did not induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, and 
3A4/5 activity or corresponding immunoreactive protein levels. Thus, the potential for 
ixazomib to produce DDIs via CYP isozyme induction or inhibition is low. 
Ixazomib is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP2 and OATPs. Ixazomib is not an inhibitor of 
P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. Ixazomib is unlikely to cause or be susceptible to clinical DDIs with 
substrates or inhibitors of clini cally relevant drug transporters. 
The geometric mean terminal half-life (t
1/2) of ixazomib is 9.5 days based on population 
PK analysis. For both IV and oral dosing, there is an approximately average 3-fold 
accumulation (based on AUC) following the Day 11 dose for the twice-weekly schedule 
MC168A  14  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 and a 2-fold accumulation (based on AUC ) following the Day 15 dose for the 
once-weekly schedule. 
Mean plasma clearance (CL) of ixazomib is 1.86 L/hr based on the results of a population 
PK analysis. Taken together with the blood-to-plasma AUC ratio of approximately 10, it 
can be inferred that ixazomib is a low clearance drug. Using the absolute oral 
bioavailability (F) estimate of 58% (also from a population PK model), this translates to 
an apparent oral plasma clearance (CL/F) of 3.21 L/hr. The geometric mean renal clearance for ixazomib is 0.119 L/hr, which is 3.7% of CL/F and 6.4% of CL estimated in a population PK analysis. Therefore, renal clearance does not meaningfully contribute to 
ixazomib clearance in humans. Approximately 62% of the administered radioactivity in 
the ADME study (Study C16016) was recovered in the urine and 22% of the total 
radioactivity was recovered in the feces afte r oral administration. Only 3.2% of the 
administered ixazomib dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged ixazomib up to 168 hours after oral dosing, suggesting that most of the total radioactivity in urine was 
attributable to metabolites.  
The PK of ixazomib was similar with and with out co-administration of clarithromycin, a 
strong CYP3A inhibitor, and hence no dose adjustment is necessary when ixazomib is 
administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Consistently, in a population PK analysis, 
co-administration of strong CYP1A2 inhi bitors did not affect ixazomib clearance. 
Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for patients receiving strong inhibitors of 
CYP1A2. Based on information from the clin ical rifampin DDI study, ixazomib C
max and 
AUC 0-last were reduced in the presence of rifampin by approximately 54% and 74%, 
respectively. Therefore, the co-administra tion of strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib 
is not recommended.  
Mild or moderate renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 30 mL/min) did not alter the PK of ixazomib 
based on the results from a population PK anal ysis. As a result, no dose adjustment is 
required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. In a dedicated renal 
impairment study (C16015), unbound AUC0-last  was 38% higher in patients with severe 
renal impairment or ESRD patients requiring  dialysis as compared to patients with 
normal renal function. Accordingly, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib is appropriate in 
patients with severe renal impairment or ESR D requiring dialysis. Pre- and post-dialyzer 
concentrations of ixazomib measured during the hemodialysis session were similar, suggesting that ixazomib is not readily dialy zable, consistent with its high plasma protein 
binding (99%). 
The PK of ixazomib is similar in patients w ith normal hepatic func tion and in patients 
with mild hepatic impairment, as defined by the National Cancer Institute Organ 
Dysfunction Working Group (total bilirubin <1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]), 
based on the results from a population PK analysis. Consequently, no dose adjustment is 
required for patients with mild hepatic impair ment. In a dedicated PK study in patients 
with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 tim es the ULN) or severe (total bilirubin >3 times 
the ULN) hepatic impairment (Study C16018), unbound dose-normalized AUC
0-last was 
27% higher in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as compared to 
patients with normal hepatic function. Therefor e, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib is 
appropriate in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
There was no statistically significant effect of age (23-91 years), sex, body surface area 
(1.2-2.7 m2), or race on the clearance of ixazomib based on the results from a population 
PK analysis. 
Further details on these studies are provided in the IB.

1.4 Potential Risks of Ixazomib :  
The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well tolerated. The 
adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the class-based effects of proteasome inhibition and are similar to what has been previously  reported with bortezomib, though the severity 
of some, for example peripheral neuropathy,  is less. While some of these potential 
toxicities may be severe, they can be mana ged by clinical monitoring and standard 
medical intervention, or, as needed, dose modification or discontinuation. In the four 
ongoing studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) investigating single-agent oral 
ixazomib in patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, non-hematologic cancers, and lymphoma), a total of 201 patients have been treated as of 27 March 2013. These patients have been treat ed with different doses of ixazomib, as 
they are all phase 1 trials. An overview of the most frequent (at least 10%) AEs occurring 
in the pooled safety population from single-agent oral ixazomib studies (C16003, 
C16004, C16007, and C16009) are shown in Table 1-2.

The clinical experience with ixazomib also shows early signs of antitumor activity as 
evidenced by at least a 50% reduction in disease burden in some patients and prolonged 
disease stabilization in others across all ongoing  trials. The antitumor activity has been 
MC168A  21  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 seen with single-agent ixazomib, when combined with established therapies, and across 
the malignancies studied (advanced solid  tumors, non-Hodgkin’s disease, Hodgkin’s 
disease, relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, relapsed or refractory systemic 
light chain amyloidosis, and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma) to date.(Kumar et al. 
2014, Kumar et al. 2014, Kumar et al. 2014, Richardson et al. 2014) 
Though additional data are needed to characterize the clinical benefit of this drug, the 
emerging data support the ongoing development of ixazomib.

1.5 Pomalidomide : Pomalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent 
that displays similar anti-angiogenic activity, but far greater anti-proliferative and 
immunomodulatory activity compared to the parent drug. Pomalidomide has also been shown to stimulate antibody-dependent cytotoxic T-cell activity (ADCC). 
The efficacy of pomalidomide in relapsed myeloma has been shown in multiple 
trials.(Streetly et al. 2008, Lacy et al. 2009, Lacy et al. 2010, Lacy et al. 2011, San Miguel et al. 2013, Leleu et al. 2015) At  tolerated doses (MTD=2 mg QD and 5 mg 
QOD), pomalidomide has been shown to be activ e in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma (MM) (study CC-4047-00-001). In 45 subjects who received doses of 
pomalidomide ranging, by cohort, up to 10 mg daily, the most commonly occurring dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) was reversible neutrope nia. As with other IMiDs administered to 
subjects receiving concomitant systemic steroids, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was seen (in 1subject each in this study and in its  subsequent named patient supply rollover 
program). 
Preliminary efficacy and safety data from a phase II study, led by Martha Lacy, et al, at 
Mayo Clinic, were published. Sixty patient s with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma were enrolled. Pomalidomide (CC-4047) was given orally at a dose of 2 mg 
daily on days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle and dexa methasone was given orally at a dose of 40 
mg daily on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of each cycle. Patient also received aspirin 325 mg once daily for thromboprophylaxis. The study endpo ints were the response rate in patients 
taking pomalidomide plus dexamethasone including patients with lenalidomide resistant refractory multiple myeloma, and safety of pomalidomide plus dexamethasone. 
Responses were recorded using the criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group. 
Thirty eight patients achieved objective response (63%) including CR in 3 patients (5%), VGPR in 17 patients (28%), and PR in 18 patients (30%). The CR + VGPR rate was 33%. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 23 patients (38%); and consisted of 
anemia in three patients (5%), thrombocytopeni a in two patients (3%) and neutropenia in 
21 (35%). Among those that developed grade 3/ 4 neutropenia, all first experienced the 
neutropenia in cycle 1-3; no new patients experienced grade 3/4 neutropenia in cycle 4 or 
later. The most common non-hematological grade 3/4 toxicities were fatigue (17%) and pneumonia (8%). Other grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicities that occurred in less than 
5% included diarrhea, constipation, hyperglycemia, and neuropathy. One patient (1.6%) 
had a thromboembolic event of deep vein thro mbosis. Lacy et al. have also demonstrated 
promising clinical activity of pomalidomide in myeloma patients with persistent disease 
following lenalidomide treatment. 
CC-4047-MM-002 is a Celgene sponsored phase 1b/2 multi-center, randomized, open-
label, dose escalation study that is evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral 
MC168A  22  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 pomalidomide alone and in combination with  low-dose dexamethasone in patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Eligib le patients must have received at least 2 
prior regimens and all patients must have received prior treatment that includes 
lenalidomide and bortezomib. This study cons ists of a phase 1 single agent pomalidomide 
(maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) segment and phase 2 randomized (pomalidomide plus 
low-dose dexamethasone versus pomalidomide alone) segment. The MTD was 4 mg 
21/28 days (there were 4 drug -related DLTs [Grade 4 neutrope nia] at 5 mg). Neutropenia 
and anemia were the most common grade 3/4 toxicities; there was a dose-dependent increase in grade 4 neutropenia. Based on the preliminary safety and response data, 4 mg 
21/28 days is the dose for the phase 2 segment. 
Pre-clinical data and the prior experience with thalidomide and lenalidomide in the 
treatment of patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) provide the 
rationale for the use of pomalidomide in pa tients with MMM. This is further supported 
by the results of a Celgene sponsored trial (MMM-001) which indicated that 
pomalidomide therapy at 0.5 mg or 2 mg/day +/- an abbreviated course of prednisone is 
well tolerated in patients with myelofibrosis and active in the treatment of anemia. 
1.6 Rationale for the current trial : Clearly patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma need 
newer therapies. The combination of poma lidomide and ixazomib provides a potentially 
powerful combination due to several reasons. St udies have not systematically studied the 
impact of induction therapy prior to salvage ASCT or the role of post-transplant 
consolidation and maintenance. While the r esponses to the salvage transplant is overall 
encouraging, it still remains rather short and approaches such as consolidation and maintenance that have improved outcomes in the setting of initial transplant should be evaluated in the context of salvage transplant. The combination of a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD is one of the most effective treatment regimens in MM as has been seen 
with bortezomib or carfilzomib combina tions with thalidomide or lenalidomide.
6-8  A 
recently described mechanism of action of lenalidomide includes increased protein 
ubiquitination and brings into question m echanism of synergy between IMiDs and 
proteasome inhibitors. Despite this paradoxi cal preclinical data, clinical experience 
supports their synergistic activity.  
Ixazomib is the first oral proteasome inhibitor to enter the clinic and has efficacy similar 
to bortezomib, with excellent activity seen in combination with lenalidomide in the 
setting of relapsed refractory MM in a recently reported phase 3 trial (TOURMALINE- 
MM1 study) (reference ASH abstract 2015 Moreau) . Pomalidomide is new IMiD with 
activity seen in nearly a third of the patient s refractory to lenalidomide. The combination 
offers a convenient oral regimen that is also a potentially effective combination in 
patients with relapsed disease who would have been exposed to prior IMiDs and proteasome inhibitors. The oral proteasome inhibitor also offers the opportunity to study a convenient maintenance therapy in the setting of relapsed disease.  
The current study proposes to examine the outcome following a salvage stem cell 
transplant, done following an effective induc tion therapy, and followed by consolidation 
and maintenance.  
1.7 Potential Risks and Benefits of ixazomib 
Please refer to the current ixazomib IB. 
The clinical benefit of ixazomib continues to be studied in a comprehensive and global 
development plan that involves studies sponsor ed by Takeda. Ixazomib appears to show 
early signs of anti-tumor activity as evidenced by at least 50% reduction in disease 
MC168A  23  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 burden in some patients, including patients that have been heavily pretreated as well as 
those with newly diagnosed MM, and prolongs stabilization of the underlying disease in 
other patients across all ongoing trials. The preliminary findings are favorable when 
considering historical and currently availa ble therapies for the patient populations 
evaluated. Though additional data are needed to  characterize the clinical benefit of this 
drug, the emerging data support expanded deve lopment of ixazomib for the treatment of 
patients with advanced malignancy. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice 
(GCP), applicable regulatory requireme nts, and International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines.

*Performed per institutional guidelines. Mel phalan conditioning followed by stem cell in fusion is being considered as ‘cycle 5’  in the 
protocol for logistical reasons only. No additional toxicity da ta will be collected in the immediate post ASCT period until day  60-100 
when the patient returns for routine post-ASCT reevaluation.  
1) All scheduled visits are while patient is receiving therapy will have a window of ±7 days unless otherwise stated. 
2) Affected immunoglobulin refers to the baseline M-protein type, that is, IgG, IgA, or IgD. Not applicable if patient “non-sec retory” or if patient 
has no heavy chain, i.e. light chain myeloma. Affected imm unoglobulin is required after baseline only if it used for disease mo nitoring instead 
of SPEP (e.g. IgA myeloma). 
3)  Urine Electrophoresis required only if used to assess disease response. 4) Immunofixation (IF) needed only in the absence of M-protein to document sCR or CR. 
5) Serial light chain required if it is used for disease monitoring (measurable disease at baseline) 
6) Every 365 days (12 months) or more often if clinically indicated. 7) Does not need to be repeated at Cycle 1 Da y 1. Baseline values can be used for cycle 1. 
8) This test is not mandatory. CT or MRI or the CT portion of the PET/CT, same modality should be used at baseline and for seri al evaluation. 
PET/CT scans are required at baseline for all patients with suspected extra-medullary disease (EMD). Assessment of EMD lesions should be 
performed at end of induction, post ASCT (range:day 60-120), post  consolidation (if persistent EMD noted previously) and every year on 
maintenance or more frequently if clinically indicated. For patients with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measure d with a ruler 
with images maintained in the medical record. 
9) Number of circulating cells may be meas ured using flow cytometry or peripheral sm ear as is the standard practice for the ins titution, but same 
methodology should be used at every time point. This should be re peated after Cycle 1 and every 2 cycles after that or more often if clinically 
indicated. 
10) At the end of 4 cycles and only required to document CR af ter that and assess MRD. If a bone marrow was done to confirm CR prior to end of 
4 cycles, no further bone marrow examination until the end of the phase (induction/~ day 100 post –ASCT, consolidation and annually while 
on maintenance if CR suspected). 
11) For persons of childbearing potential only. Must be done ≤7 days prior to registration.

MC168A  33  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 7.3 Dosing of ixazomib 
The doses of ixazomib used in this study are based on data from Takeda’s ongoing phase 
I and II trials, specifically the phase I/II trial of ixazomib (C16005) in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone , estimated 4 mg weekly of ixazomib as the RP2D in 
combination with weekly full dose of lenali domide (25 mg) and dexamethasone (40 mg).  
7.4 How to take ixazomib 
Patients should be instructed to swallow ixazo mib capsules whole, with water, and not to 
break, chew, or open the capsules The ixazomib should be taken on an empty stomach 
(no food or drink apart from 240 mL of water), at least 1 hour before or no sooner than 2 
hours after food. Each capsule should be swa llowed separately with a sip of water. A 
total of approximately 240 mL (about 1 cup/ 8 oz) of water should be taken with the 
capsules. 
Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient  remembers as long as the next scheduled 
dose is 72 hours or more away. Patients who vomit a dose after ingestion will not receive 
an additional dose, but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose. 
Drug will be administered only to eligib le patients under the supervision of the 
investigator or identified sub-investigat or(s). The drug will be prepared under the 
supervision of a pharmacist, or appropriately qualified and trained personnel. 
 
7.5 Pomalidomide supply - POMALYST REMS™ program 
All patients will be registered to the Celgene POMALYST REMS™ program to obtain 
pomalidomide, as required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Patients will receive pomalidomide every 28 days. All unused study drug must be returned to Mayo Clinic to be recorded. Study drug is to be  handed back to the patient to return per 
POMALYST REMS™ policy. Only enough pomalidomide for one cycle of therapy 
will be supplied to the patient each cycle . See Appendix IV  for pomalidomide 
information. 
 
7.6 Treatment at enrolling institution 
For this protocol, the patient must return to the consenting institution for evaluation at 
least every 28 days. Treatment by a local  medical doctor (LMD) is not allowed. 
 
 
8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events  
Strictly follow the modifications in this table for the first two cycles, until individual treatment 
tolerance can be ascertained. Individual drugs can be dose reduced as per the table below 
depending on the adverse event attribution. Thereafter, these modifications should be regarded as guidelines to produce mild-to-moderate, but not debi litating, side effects. If multiple adverse 
events are seen, administer dose based on greatest reduction required for any single adverse event observed. Reductions apply to tr eatment given in the preceding cycle and are based on adverse 
events observed since the prior dose.  
NOTE: If either of pomalidomide or ixazomib is discontinued, the patient can continue on the other drugs, unless specified otherwise in the dose modification tables. If both are discontinued, the patient will go to event monitoring (Section 18.0). 
ALERT: ADR reporting may be required for some adverse events (See Section 10) 8.1

8.11  Instruction for initiation of a new cycle of therapy  
A new cycle of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if: 
• The ANC is ≥1.0x10
9/L (=1000/microliter) 
• The platelet count is ≥ 75x109/L unless the participant has ≥50% bone 
marrow infiltration in which case a platelet count of ≥50x109/L is allowed 
• Any other non-hematologic treatment -re lated adverse event that may have 
occurred has resolved to ≤Grade 1 or baseline severity. 
If these conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cycle, the subject will be 
evaluated weekly and a new cycle of therapy will be held until the toxicity 
has resolved as described below 
If any drug dosing was halted during the previous cycle and was restarted 
with a one-level dose reduction without requiring an interruption for the remainder of the cycle, then that re duced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 
of the new cycle.  
If any drug dosing was omitted for the remainder of the previous cycle or if 
the new cycle is held due to known hematologic toxicity newly encountered on the scheduled Day 1, then the new cycle will be started with a one-level dose reduction. If a new cycle of therapy cannot be restarted within 4 weeks of the scheduled Day 1 due to non-reso lution of drug related toxicities, the 
patient will be removed from protocol therapy and will go to event monitoring.

MC168A  43  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 9.0 Ancillary Treatment/Supportive Care 
9.1 Full supportive care 
Patients should receive full supportive car e while on this study. This includes 
blood product support, antibiotic treatme nt, and treatment of other newly 
diagnosed or concurrent medical cond itions. All blood products and concomitant 
medications such as antidiarrheals, analge sics, and/or antiemetics received from 
the first day of study treatment administra tion until 30 days after the final dose 
will be recorded in the medical records. 
9.2 Steroid use 
Patients may continue on low level/stable steroid doses for replacement or inhalation 
therapy. 
9.3 Disallowed concurrent treatment 
The following treatments are not permitted during the trial: 
• Any other investigational treatment  
• Any other systemic anti-neoplastic th erapy including, but not limited to, 
immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or  monoclonal antibody therapy. 
• Any external beam radiotherapy 
9.4 Nausea and/or vomiting:  
Standard anti-emetics including 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 serotonin receptor antagonists are 
recommended for emesis if it occurs once treat ment is initiated; prophylactic anti-emetics 
may also be considered at the physician’ s discretion. Dexamethasone should not be 
administered as an anti-emetic. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study 
drug and during treatment. 
9.5 Blood products and growth factors  
Blood products and growth factors should be  utilized as clinically warranted and 
following institutional policies and recommendations. The use of growth factors should follow published guidelines of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 24, No 18 (June 
20), 2006: pp. 2932-2947. 
NOTE: Platelet transfusions to help patien ts meet eligibility criteria are not allowed 
within 3 days prior to study registratio n or drug dosing for any dosing day. 
9.6 Diarrhea 
Prophylactic antidiarrheals will not be used in this protocol. However, diarrhea should be 
managed according to clinical practice, in cluding the administration of antidiarrheals 
such as loperamide once infectious causes are excluded. Fluid intake should be 
maintained to avoid dehydration. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of treatment and during treatment. The recommende d dose of loperamide is 4 mg at first 
onset, followed by 2 mg every 2-4 hours until diarrhea free (maximum 16 mg/day). 
In the event of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed: 
hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals. 
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydr ation) and/or associated with fever or 
severe neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4), broad-spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed. 
MC168A  44  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting 
should be hospitalized  for intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte 
imbalances. 
9.7 Renal failure and ixazomib 
Two cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients treated at or above the MTD for intravenous ixazomib (see Section 1. 4.3). Volume depletion should be corrected 
before initiation of study drug. Until further information is available, intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs immediately prior to the administration of ixazomib should be discouraged and requires consultation with the principal investigator. All 
necessary supportive care consistent with optimal patient care shall be available to 
patients as necessary. 
9.8 Herpes Zoster prophylaxis 
Patients may be at an increased risk of infection including reactivation of herpes zoster and herpes simplex viruses. Prophylaxis with  acyclovir 400 mg PO BID is recommended 
while on study therapy and for 1 month beyond the end of therapy 
9.9a Prohibited medications  
The following medications, medicinal products and procedures are prohibited during the study. 
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inducers should be 
avoided, unless there is no appropriate a lternative medication for the patient’s use 
(If there were to be a drug-drug interaction with an inducer, MLN2238 exposure would 
be decreased):  
• Strong CYP3A inducers: rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital 
Extra caution should be exercised when using these medications concomitantly and incidence of any side effects should be carefully monitored.  
Excluded foods and dietary supplements incl ude St. John’s wort and Ginkgo biloba. 
9.9a Erythematous Rash with or without Pruritus:  
As with bortezomib, rash with or without pruritus has been reported with ixazomib, 
primarily at the higher doses tested and when  given with agents where rash is an 
overlapping toxicity. The rash may range from limited erythematous areas, macular 
and/or small papular bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body, 
to a more generalized eruption that is predominately on the trunk or extremities. Rash has 
been most commonly characterized as maculopa pular or macular. To date, when it does 
occur, rash is most commonly reported within the first 3 cycles of therapy. The rash is often transient, self-limiting, and is typically Grade 1 to 2 in severity.  
Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or  corticosteroids (oral or topical) have 
been successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylac tically in subsequent 
cycles. The use of a topical, IV, or oral steroid (e.g., prednisone ≤10 mg per day or 
equivalent) is permitted. Ma nagement of a Grade 3 rash may require intravenous 
antihistamines or corticosteroids. Admini stration of ixazomib (and/or other causative 
agent if given in combination) should be modified per protocol and re-initiated at a 
reduced level from where rash w as noted (also, per protocol). 
MC168A  45  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or 
any SAE involving rash is recommended. Prophylactic measures should also be considered if a patient has previously devel oped a rash (e.g., using a thick, alcohol-free 
emollient cream on dry areas of the body or oral or topical antihistamines). A rare risk is 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a severe and potentially life-threatening rash with skin peeling and mouth sores, which should be  managed symptomatically according to 
standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological analysis are encouraged 
at the discretion of the investigator. 
9.9b Thrombocytopenia 
Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia may be severe but has been manageable with platelet tr ansfusions according to standard clinical 
practice. Ixazomib administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in the protocol when thrombocytopenia occurs (see Table 8.2 ). 
Therapy can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon recovery of platelet counts. A rare risk 
is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) , a rare blood disorder where blood clots 
form in small blood vessels throughout the body characterized by thrombocytopenia, petechiae, fever, or possibly more serious  signs and symptoms. TTP should be managed 
symptomatically according to standard medical practice. 
9.9c Neutropenia 
Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Neutropenia may be severe but has been manageable. Growth factor support is not required but may be considered according to standard clinical practice. Ixazomib administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in the protocol when neutropenia occurs 
(see Table 8.2 ). Therapy can be reinitiated at a re duced level upon recovery of ANCs. 
9.9d Fluid Deficit 
Dehydration should be avoided since ixazomib may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and 
dehydration. Acute renal failure has been reported in patients treated with ixazomib, 
commonly in the setting of the previously  noted gastrointestinal toxicities and 
dehydration. Fluid deficit should be corr ected before initiation of study drug and as 
needed during treatment to avoid dehydration. 
9.9e Hypotension 
Symptomatic hypotension and orthostatic hypoten sion with or without syncope have been 
reported with ixazomib. Blood pressure should be  closely monitored while the patient is 
on study treatment and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the 
setting of concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either 
hypo- or hypertension) should be managed according to standard clinical practice, including considerations for dose adjustment s of their concomitant medications during 
the course of the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study drug and 
as needed during treatment to avoid dehydration. 
  
MC168A  46  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019  
9.9f Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome 
One case of posterior reversible encephal opathy syndrome, which ultimately resolved, 
has been reported with ixazomib. This cond ition is characterized by headache, seizures 
and visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in  blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed 
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If the syndrome is diagnosed or suspected, 
symptom-directed treatment should be mainta ined until the condition is reversed by 
control of hypertension or other instigating factors. 
9.9g Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PJP (PCP)] prophylaxis 
Since   ixazomib  is immunosuppressive and associated  with an increased risk of PJP, all    
may receive prophylaxis during   treatment.     The choice of prophylactic medications 
will be left to the discretion of the treating physician.   The decision to continue PJP prophylaxis beyond the time points noted is left to the discretion of the treating physician. Subjects who continue to demonstrate lymphopenia after the   dosing of ixazomib has 
been discontinued should be considered for ongoing prophylaxis.  
9.9g Transverse Myelitis 
Transverse myelitis has also been reported with ixazomib. It is not known if ixazomib 
causes transverse myelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving ixazomib, the possibility that ixazomib may have contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be 
excluded. 
9.9h Thromboprophylaxis 
All patients should receive ASA 325 mg daily for thromboprophylaxis. For patients 
considered high risk for thrombosis, therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin or low molecular weight heparin should be used.

Routine Reporting 
Events reported to sponsor via case report forms 
 Events of Interest 
Events that would not typically be considered  to meet the criteria for expedited reporting, 
but that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to 
facilitate the review of safety data (may be  requested by the FDA or the sponsor).  
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or de gree of incidence in the investigational plan 
or application (including a supplementary plan  or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects  
 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic applications/ctc.htm )   
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0.  
b. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2).  
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to  the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechan ism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is  required (see Section 10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mech anisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.6 and 
18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a seri ous AE, which is defined in Section 10.4.

the investigator brochure (or are not listed at  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not re quired or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
 
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/inte rvention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated 
with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) 
occurs with a higher degree of severity  or specificity, expedited reporting is 
required.  
 
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure 
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is  related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
 10.31  AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on 
the SAME (Combination) Arm 
 
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are ) used on the same treatment arm as 
the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire 
combination (arm) is then considered an investigational intervention for 
reporting. 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with the 
guidelines for investigational agents/interventions.  
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational agent/intervention must be assessed as specified in the prot ocol. In general, only Grade 4 and 5 AEs 
that are unexpected with at least possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report, unless hospitalization is required. Refer to Section 10.4 for 
specific AE reporting requ irements or exceptions. 
An investigational agent/inte rvention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated 
with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) 
occurs with a higher degree of severity  or specificity, expedited reporting is 
required.  
• An increased incidence of an expected  adverse event (AE) is based on the 
patients treated for this study at thei r site. A list of known/expected AEs is 
reported in the package insert or the literature, including AEs resulting from a 
drug overdose. 
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch

Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 10.52 Death 
Note: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting 
regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or 
other cause must be provided. 
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the 
first 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that canno t be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5. 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserve d cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term  associated with Grade 5. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and 
polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class 
(SOC) of the same name. Evidence that  the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) 
should be submitted. 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with inves tigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial neoplasm. 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE will be reported. Three options are available to describe the event: 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML]) 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting 
mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting unless otherwise specified. 
MC168A  55  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 10.552 Fetal Death 
Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by death 
in utero; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of 
respiration, heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation.” 
Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy loss)” under the Pregnancy, pue rperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC. 
10.553 Death Neonatal 
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
cessation of life occurring during the first 28 days of life” that is felt by the investigator to be at least possibly due to the investigational 
agent/intervention, should be  reported expeditiously.  
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 
“General disorders and administration - Other (neonatal loss)”  
under the General disorders and administration SOC.

treatment or procedure regard less of attribution to the 
study treatment or procedure. 
10.6232 Any death more than 30 days after the patient’s last 
study treatment or procedure th at is felt to be at least 
possibly treatment related must also be submitted as a 
Grade 5 AE, with a CTCAE type and attribution assigned. 
 
10.7 Late Occurring Adverse Events 
Refer to the instructions in the Forms Pack et (or electronic data entry screens, as 
applicable) regarding the submission of late occurring AEs following completion 
of the Active Monitoring Phase (i.e., co mpliance with Test Schedule in Section 
4.0). 
 
10.8 Additional instructions Special reporting requirements for Millennium 
AEs may be spontaneously reported by the patie nt and/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures. Any clin ically relevant deteriorati on in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating 
a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. For serious AEs, the investigator must determ ine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
AEs which are serious must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) 
from the first dose of study drug through 30 days after administration of the last dose of ixazomib. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of ixazomib treatment or 
after the designated follow-up period that the sponsor-investigator and/or sub-investigator 
considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance (or designee). In addition, new primary malignancies that occur during the follow-up periods must be reported,  regardless of causality to study regimen, 
for a minimum of three years after the last dose of the investigational product, starting 
from the first dose of study drug. All new cas es of primary malignancy must be reported 
to Millennium Pharmacovi gilance (or designee). 
MC168A  57  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 Planned hospital admissions or surgical pr ocedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the tria l are not to be considered AEs unless the 
condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was 
performed earlier or later than planned). All SAEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illness(es). 
Since this is an investigator-initiated stud y, the principal investigator, Prashant Kapoor, 
MD, also referred to as the sponsor-investig ator, is responsible for reporting serious 
adverse events (SAEs) to any regulatory agency  and to the sponsor- investigator’s EC or 
IRB. Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SA Es (including serious pretreatment events) 
must also be reported in English to M illennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee): 
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours of the sponsor-investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event 
All other serious (non-fatal/non-life-threatening) events within 4 calendar days of the 
sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event 
See below for contact information for the reporting of SAEs to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance. 
The sponsor-investigator must fax or ema il the SAE Form per the timelines above. A 
sample of an SAE Form will be provided. 
 
The SAE report must include at minimum: 
• Event term(s) 
• Serious criteria  
• Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investigator’s 
determination. Intensity for each SAE,  including any lab abnormalities, will 
be determined by using the NCI CTCAE version specified in the protocol, as a guideline, whenever possible. Th e criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
• Causality of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investigator’s 
determination of the relationship of the event(s) to study drug administration.  
 
Follow-up information on the SAE may be requested by Millennium. 
 Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be determined by 
using the NCI CTCAE version used at your institution, as a guideline, whenever possible. The criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
In the event that this is a multisite stud y, the sponsor-investigator is responsible 
to ensure that the SAE reports are sen t to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee) from all sites participating in the study. Sub-investigators must report 
all SAEs to the sponsor-investigator so that the sponsor-investigator can meet 
his/her foregoing reporting obligations to  the required regulatory agencies and to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless ot herwise agreed between the sponsor-
investigator and sub-investigator(s). 
MC168A  59  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 11.0 Treatment Evaluation 
The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria (Kumar et al, 
2016) will be used to assess response to therapy. 
 
11.1  Terms and definitions 
• M-protein: synonyms include M-spike, monoclonal protein and myeloma protein, 
paraprotein, M-component. 
Serum M-protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases 
where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable.  
• M-proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M-proteins)  
• Cases in which the M-protein is so large and narrow on agarose (some specimens >4 
g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by greater than 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the agarose gel. 
• Cases in which there are multiple peaks of  same M-protein (aggregates or dimers) 
If SPEP is not available or felt to be unrelia ble (above examples) for routine M-protein 
quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin  levels derived from nephelometry or 
turbidometry can be accepted, with the ex ception that quantitative IgG may not be used. 
However, this must be explicitly reported at  baseline, and only nephelometry can be used 
for that patient to assess response. SPEP derived M-protein values and quantitative nephelometric immunoglobulin values cannot be used interchangeably.  
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only. Random or 24 h urine 
tests measuring kappa and lambda light ch ain levels are not reliable and are not 
recommended. 
 
FLC estimation is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, The 
Binding Site Limited, UK). Patients with ka ppa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are defined as 
having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having a monoclonal 
kappa FLC. The monoclonal light chain isotype  is considered the involved FLC isotype, 
and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC type.  
• Response terms:  The following response terms will be used: stringent Complete 
Response (sCR), complete response (CR), ve ry good partial response (VGPR), partial 
response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease 
(PD).  
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response 
category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making 
and test ordering. These designations will app lied at the time of the first measurement 
at which the quantitative aspect of the response category has been satisfied without the confirmation step having been satis fied. The designation “u” will precede the 
standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD.  
 
• Measurable disease: Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-protein.  
o Serum M-protein ≥1 g/dl  
 
NOTE: Quantitative IgG may not be us ed for defining measurable disease 
o Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h 
MC168A  60  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dl provided 
serum FLC ratio is abnormal 
o Bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 30% 
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to 
therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and should be used 
in assessing response only if the baseline serum and/or urine M proteins are not “measurable” as above, and the baseline le vel of the involved FLC is “measurable.” 
When using this assay, it is important to note th at the FLC levels vary considerably with 
changes in renal function and in patients with renal insufficiency, the levels of both the 
kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of 
CR. Thus, both the level of the involved and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-uninvol ved difference) should be considered in 
assessing response. Patients included on the study on the basis of FLC alone (i.e., no 
measurable serum/urine M-protein) should be the only ones who are evaluated using 
FLC response criteria. The others should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results with the exception of defining stringent complete response. 
• Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M-protein, 
serum free light chain, or urine M-protein. 
• Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had 
“measurable” serum M-protein or urine M-protein, but has had a detectable M-
protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum free light chain.  
• Non-secretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had a 
detectable M-protein in his/her serum and/or urine. 
 
11.2 Clarification of test indications 
Listed below are the minimal required t ests required to assess response based on the 
characteristics of their disease at on study.

1  SPEP, UPEP, Immunofixation studies of both  serum and urine, and Bone marrow biopsy  
are required to document CR regardless of  registration values, and in addition FLC  
measurement and bone marrow immunophenotyping  is required to document sCR. SPEP 
and UPEP are required to document VGPR  regardless of registration values. 
MC168A  61  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 2  For serum measurable patients, 24 hour urine does not need to be confirmed (i.e. repeated after 
documented response) for any response category 
3  At a minimum, a bone marrow biopsy should be repeated every 3 months until documented 
response. Bone marrow biopsy results do not need  to be repeated after documented response. 
4 If serum M-protein is being followed by qua ntitative immunoglobulin levels derived from 
nephelometry or turbidometry, quantitativ e immunoglobulins are required. SPEP is only 
required to document CR or VGPR.  
 
11.3 Confirmed response  
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum M- protein, 
serum immunoglobulin free light chain (whe n primary determinant of response) and 
urine M- protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be made by verification on two consecutive determinations.  
• Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are only required to document CR or sCR, except 
for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required to 
document all response categories including progression. However, a second 
confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response in any case. 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; however, if radiographic studies were perfo rmed there should be no evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions. 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 11.2 
 
11.4 Bone progression  
Caution must be exercised to avoid rating progression on the basis of variation of 
radiologic technique alone. Compression fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression. When progression is based on skeletal disease alone, it should be discussed with the Study Chair befo re removing the patient from the study.  
 
11.5 Response and Progression 
Criteria for response and progression are listed in Table 11.5. Progressive disease for all 
patients as defined in Table 11.5.

6.  Hyperviscosity 
a All response categories require two consecutive assessments (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, 
PD) made at any time before the institution of any new therapy. MRD tests should be initiated only at the time of suspected complete response. sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR and SD categories and MRD require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions 
or extramedullary plasmacytomas if radiographic studies were performed. However, 
radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements except for the requirement of FDG PET if imaging MRD-nega tive status is reported. Bone marrow 
assessments need not be confirmed. Each category, except for stable disease, will have a working subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u ”] to designate first time point at which 
response category MAY have been achieved if confirmed. The date of the initial test is 
considered as the date of response for ev aluation of time dependent outcomes such as 
duration of response. 
MC168A  64  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 b CR patient will need to progress at the same level as VGPR and PR patients to be 
considered a PD. A positive immunofix ation alone is not sufficient. 
c If more than one M protein spike meets the criteria for measurable disease at baseline, 
then both need to be followed for respon se. Otherwise, only follow the measurable M 
protein spike for response.  
d In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC levels: CR in such 
patients indicates a normal FLC ratio of 0.26-1.65 in addition to the CR criteria listed 
above. 
e Bone marrow criteria for PD are only to be used in patients without measurable disease by 
M protein and by FLC 
f A "25% increase" refers to M protein, FLC and bone marrow results and does not refer to 
bone lesions, soft tissue plasmacytoma or hype rcalcemia. The lowest value does not need 
to be a confirmed value. If the lowest serum M-protein is ≥5 g/dL, an increase in serum 
M-protein of ≥1 g/dL is sufficient to define disease progression. 
g In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for 
example, a possible lab error), that value w ill not be considered when determining the 
lowest value. 
h Progressive disease should be confirmed on two consecutive evaluations, where the 
timing of confirmation is per the treating ph ysician and can be done immediately within 
the same cycle or on the next cycle. However, treatment may be discontinued for progressive disease that is unconfirmed per phys ician discretion. In this case, an objective 
status of PD should be entered on the measu rement form and progressive disease should 
be reported on the event monitoring form. 
i Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/l ratio. An abnormal k/l ratio by 
immunohistochemistry requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An 
abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is k/l of 4:1 or 1:2.  
j Plasmacytoma measurements should be take n from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI 
scans, or dedicated CT scans where applicable . For patients with only skin involvement, 
skin lesions should be measured with a ruler. Measurement of tumor size will be 
determined by the sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of 
measured lesions (SPD). 
k Requires a complete response as defined in table 11.5.  MRD tests should be initiated only 
at the time of suspected complete response. MRD requires no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. However, radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements except for the requirement of FDG PET if imaging MRD-negative status is reported.

MC168A  66  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 • Poor enrollment 
• Non-compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidance or other 
regulatory requirements by the Investigator(s) 
• Request to discontinue the trial by a re gulatory or health authority or an IRB 
• Manufacturing difficulties/concerns 
All Investigators and the requisite regulatory authorities will be notified if the study is 
suspended or terminated for safety reasons. In the case of such termination, the 
Investigator will notify the IRB. 
 
13.6 Ineligible 
A patient is deemed ineligible  if after registration, it is determined that at the time of 
registration, the patient did not satisfy each a nd every eligibility criteria for study entry. 
The patient may continue treatment off-protocol at the discretion of the physician as long 
as there are no safety concerns, and the patient  was properly registered. The patient will 
go directly to the event-monitoring phase of the study (or off study, if applicable).  
• If the patient received treatment, all data  up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted. Event mon itoring will be required per Section 18.0 of 
the protocol.  
• If the patient never received treatment, on- study material and the End of Active 
Treatment/Cancel Notification Form must be submitted. No further data submission 
is necessary. 
 
13.7 Major violation 
A patient is deemed a major violation , if protocol requirements regarding treatment in 
Cycle 1 of the initial therapy are severely viol ated that evaluability for primary end point 
is questionable. All data up until the point of  confirmation of a major violation must be 
submitted. The patient will go directly to the event-monitoring phase of the study. The 
patient may continue treatment off-protocol at the discretion of the physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the patien t was properly registered. Event monitoring 
will be required per Section 18.0 of the protocol. 
13.8 Cancel

14.3 Background and Methodology 
14.3 1 Minimal residual disease evaluation: Currently 30-40% of patients achieve a CR with initial therapy. In most cases, 
patients classified as CR in reality have minimal residual di sease (MRD) since (i) many such patients relapse, and (ii) 
residual clonal disease is detectable in most by more sensitiv e techniques such as multiparameter flow cytometry and PCR 
based techniques.(Sarasquete, Garcia-Sanz et al. 2005; Mateo, Montalban et al. 2008; Paiva, Vidriales et al. 2009). We will determine minimal residual disease positivity at various stages of treatment, among patients achieving a conventional 
complete response. Bone marrow aspirates will be evaluated for presence of clonal plasma cells a well as the ratio of clonal to non-clonal plasma cells after 4 cycles and whenever a CR is suspected and a marrow is done.  
MRD detection will be done on BM samples as previously described32. Plasma cells are identified by their characteristic 
CD45/CD38/CD138 staining pattern with light chain restriction and CD19/CD56 phenotype on each case. One ml (milliliter) of BM (bone marrow) is subjected to flow cytome try on a Cantos Flow Cytometer. Samples are collected 
ungated, up to one million events per tube.  
 
MC168A  68  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 15.0 Drug Information 
15.1 Ixazomib (MLN9708, Ninlaro®)  
15.11 Background: Ixazomib (MLN9708) is a second-generation small molecule 
inhibitor of the 20S proteasome that is under development for the treatment of 
non-hematologic malignancies, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.  
Ixazomib (MLN2238) refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form of the 
drug substance, ixazomib citrate (MLN9 708). The transition to MLN2238 occurs 
in any aqueous system. 
 
15.12 Formulation: The ixazomib (MLN9708) capsule drug product formulation consists of drug substance, microcry stalline cellulose, talc, and magnesium 
stearate. Seven different capsule strengths are manufactured: 0.2, 0.5, 2.0, 2.3, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.5 mg; each capsule streng th has a unique color. Dosage strength is 
stated as ixazomib (the active boronic  acid). Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules are 
individually packaged in blisters. 
 15.13 Preparation and storage : Ixazomib capsules (0.2 mg, 0.5 mg,  
2.0 mg), individually packaged in blisters, can be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC  or “Do not store above 25°C. Do not freeze." Ixazomib capsules (2.3 mg, 3.0 mg, 
4.0 mg, and 5.5 mg), individually packaged in blisters can be stored at “2°C - 
8°C” or “Do not store above 30°C. Do not freeze." 
Ixazomib that is dispensed to the patient  for take-home dosing should remain in 
the blister packaging until the point of use.  The investigative site is responsible 
for providing the medication to the patient in units that comprise the correct daily 
dose configurations. Capsules should remain in the blisters until the point of use. 
Ixazomib capsules must be administered as intact capsules and must not be 
opened or manipulated in any way. Comprehensive instructions should be provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance with dosing procedures. Patients will be instructed to store the medication in the refrigerator until the time 
of use. Reconciliation will occur accordingl y when the patient returns for their 
next cycle of therapy. Any extremes in temperature should be reported as an excursion and will be managed on a case by  case basis. Returned unused capsules 
should be discarded in a proper biohazard container. 
Ixazomib is an anticancer drug. As with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised when handling ixazomib. It is recommended to wear gloves and protective garments during pr eparation when dispensed in clinic. 
Please refer to published guidelines regardi ng the proper handling and disposal of 
anticancer agents. 
 15.14 Administration:  Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules must  be administered as intact 
capsules and are not intended to be open ed or manipulated in any way. Capsules 
should be taken on an empty stomach with a pproximately 8 oz (1 cup) of water at 
least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after food. 
Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient  has had a serious allergic reaction to 
boron or boron containing products. 
 
15.15 Pharmacokinetic (PK) information :  
MC168A  69  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 a) Absorption: After oral dosing, ixazomi b is rapidly absorbed with a median 
Tmax of 1 hour. The lack of a discernible relationship between BSA and ixazomib 
clearance over a relatively wide BSA range (1.4-2.6 m2) indicates that total 
systemic exposure (AUC) following fixed dosing should be independent of the 
individual patient’s BSA. A high-fat meal decreased both the rate and extent of 
absorption. Therefore, ixazomib should be  administered on an empty stomach.  
b) Distribution: The steady state volume of distribution is large and is estimated to be 543 L. Ixazomib is 88-94% protein bound. c) Metabolism: Metabolism is the primary route for elimination of ixazomib by 
both CYP and non-CYP enzymes. CYP3A4 and 1A2 comprise the major CYP 
isozymes that contribute to ixazomib metabolism. d) Excretion: The mean terminal half- life is 9.5 days. Renal elimination is a 
minor clearance pathway for ixazomib. Dosing adjustment is not required in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment in studies. However, in a 
dedicated renal impairment study (C1 6015), unbound AUC0-last was 38% higher 
in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis as compared to patients with normal renal function. Accordingly, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD requiring 
dialysis. Unbound systemic exposures of  ixazomib are 27% higher in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairme nt as compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function. A reduced starting dose of ixazomib is recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic  impairment. 
 15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :  
The PK of ixazomib was similar with and without coadministration of clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, and therefore no dose adjustment is necessary when ixazomib is administered with CYP3A inhibitors. In the population PK analysis, coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors did not affect ixazomib clearance. Thus, no dose adjustment is required 
for patients receiving strong CYP1A2 inhi bitors. In a clinical rifampin DDI 
study, ixazomib C
max and AUC 0-last were reduced in the presence of rifampin by 
approximately 54% and 74%, respectively. As a result, the coadministration of 
strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib should be avoided. Ixazomib is neither a time-dependent nor reversible inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, or 3A4/5, therefore the potential for ixazomib to produce DDIs via CYP 
isozyme inhibition is low. Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and 
CYP3A4/5 activity. The potential for ix azomib to cause DDIs with substrates or 
inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, MATE-1, MATE2-K, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, and OATPs is low. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for ixazomib coadministered with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (LenDe x) are similar to those observed 
when ixazomib is administered as a sing le agent. This suggests that there 
is no readily apparent effect of coad ministration of LenDex on the clinical 
PK of ixazomib. 
Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient has had a serious allergic 
reaction to boron or boron containing products.

Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 15.17 Known potential toxicities : See the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure for more complete informati on including potential risks, as well as 
recommendations for clinical monitoring and medical management of toxicity. 
 
Very common ( ≥10%): anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,  fatigue,     decreased appetite,   
peripheral neuropathy    Common ( ≥1% to <10%):  Herpes zoster,   peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, erythema, rash, erythemat ous rash, pruritic rash, macular rash, 
peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, maculo-papular rash, papular rash Uncommon ( ≥0.1% to <1%): generalized pruritis, generalized rash,   
Herpes zoster – antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients being treated with ixazomib to d ecrease the risk of herpes zoster 
reactivation. Rare but serious risks – intestinal obstruction, pneumonia,  life-
threatening severe skin rash (Steven Johnson syndrome, TEN, DRESS syndrome), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, tumor lysis syndrome, renal failure, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, transverse 
myelitis, progressive multifo cal leukoencephalopathy. 
Overdose –  There is no known specific antidote for ixazomib overdose. In 
the event of an overdose in blinded studies, study medication assignment should be unblinded immediately. Th e clinician should consider admitting 
the patient to the hospital for IV hydration, monitoring for adverse drug reactions, monitoring of vital signs , and appropriate supportive care. 
Gavage may be considered, but it s hould be kept in mind that ixazomib 
absorption is rapid. Ixazomib is not readily dialyzable. 
 15.18 Drug procurement:  Investigational product will be  supplied free of charge to 
trial participants by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
  
 15.19 Nursing guidelines

15.2 Pomalidomide (Pomalyst®) 
15.21 Background: Pomalidomide is a novel drug in the class of immunomodulatory agents known as IMiDs compounds. Pomalidomide binds to its molecular target cereblon (CRBN), a protein that is part of  an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which 
is responsible for the polyubiquitination of  substrate proteins, targeting them for 
subcellular redistribution and destruction by the proteasome. The pharmacologic properties of pomalidomide are of potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of various hematologic neoplasms (such as multiple myeloma and myeloproliferative neoplasm-associa ted myelofibrosis), non-neoplastic 
hematologic disorders (such as β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease) and non-
hematologic disorders such as systemic sclerosis, as well as solid tumor 
neoplasms. 
 
15.22 Formulation : Pomalidomide capsules can be 0.5-mg gelatin capsules (size 4 
reddish brown), 1-mg hard gelatin capsul es (size 4 reddish brown), 2-mg (size 2 
reddish-brown), 3-mg and 4-mg hard gela tin capsules (size 2 reddish-brown), and 
5-mg hard gelatin capsules (size 1 reddish-brown), containing pomalidomide, mannitol, pregelatinized starch, and sodium stearyl fumarate.  
Pomalidomide capsules are supplied in high density polyethylene (HDPE) 
containers fitted with induction seals and child-resistant plastic closures or PVC/PCTFE blister with push-through foil. 
 
15.23 Preparation and storage : Store drug at controlled room temperature, 
between 68-77 ºF (20-25ºC) or as indicated on the manufacturer’s label. 
The expiration date is indicated on the label. 
Only enough study drug for one month of therapy may be dispensed. 
 
15.24 Administration: Pomalidomide is administered by mouth at approximately the 
same time each day.  Pomalidomide should be taken without food (at least 2 hours 
before or 2 hours after a meal). Capsules  should be swallowed whole, and should 
not be broken, chewed or opened. If a dose of pomalidomide is missed, it should 
be taken as soon as possible on the same day. If it is missed for the entire day, it 
MC168A  72  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 should not be made up. Patients should be in structed never to give this medicinal 
product to another person and to return any unused capsules to the study doctor at 
the end of treatment. Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of 
pomalidomide should be instructed to seek emergency medical care if needed 
and contact study staff immediately. 
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information : 
a) Absorption – oral absorption has been  moderately rapid with first dose C max 
occurring in 1.5 to 4 hrs. More than 70% of the pomalidomide dose is absorbed in humans. A high fat meal decreased th e rate of absorption but had minimal 
effect on overall extent of absorption; therefore drug may be administered without regard to food intake. 
b) Distribution – Apparent volume of distribution in healthy subjects 
ranged from 74-138 L across a dose range of 1 to 10 mg daily. Pomalidomide protein binding in human plasma is low to moderate 
(15.8% for R-enantiomer, 42.2% for S-enantiomer) and the binding is 
concentration independent in the concentration range of 30 and 1000 ng/mL. Drug distributes into semen. 
c) Metabolism – Eight metabolites were detected in plasma, each at 
exposures < 10% of the plasma pomalidomide. CYP-dependent 
metabolites accounted for approximately 43% of the excreted 
radioactivity, while non-CYP dependent  hydrolytic metabolites accounted 
for 25%, and excretion of unchanged pomalidomide accounted for 10%. 
d) Excretion – In healthy patients, 72.8% of the dose was recovered in 
urine and 15.5% was recovered in f eces. Less than 3% of the dose is 
excreted as unchanged pomalidomide in  the urine. The geometric mean 
terminal elimination half-life (t
1/2) of pomalidomide was approximately 7.5 
hours. 
In pomalidomide renal studies, no dose adju stment was required for subjects with 
renal impairment. On hemodialysis days , subjects were instructed to take 
pomalidomide following hemodialysis.  No dose adjustment of pomalidomide is 
required for patients with hepatic impa irment as defined by the Child-Pugh 
criteria. 
15.26 Potential Drug Interactions : Pomalidomide is partially metabolized by 
CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5. Pomalidomide is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp). Coadministration of pomalidomide with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp 
inhibitor ketoconazole, or the strong CYP3A4/5 inducer carbamazepine, had no 
clinically relevant effect on exposure to  pomalidomide. Coadministration of the 
strong CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine with pomalidomide increased mean 
exposure to pomalidomide by 125% compared to pomalidomide alone. If strong 
inhibitors of CYP1A2 are coadministered with pomalidomide, the pomalidomide dose by should be reduced 50%. 
Smoking: Administration of pomalidomide in smokers, with smoking tobacco 
known to induce the CYP1A2 isoform, ha d no clinically relevant effect on 
exposure to pomalidomide relative to that exposure to pomalidomide observed in 
non-smokers. Dexamethasone: Co-administration of multiple doses of 4 mg pomalidomide 
with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone (a w eak inducer of CYP3A) to patients with 
multiple myeloma had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide compared with pomalidomide administered alone.

15.29 Nursing Guidelines 
15.291 Agent is known to be teratogenic in rabbits. Therefore all 
women who are pregnant or who could become pregnant, should 
not handle the agent outside of the original packaging. 
Chemotherapy gloves should be worn if contact is necessary. 
15.292 Because of the similarity of this agent to thalidomide certain 
precautions MUST be employed by all subjects on protocol and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of agent. Instruct patients the following must be adhered to: No donation of tissue/blood/semen/sperm; sexually active males/ females must use protocol-specific contraception (regardless of fertility status-
i.e. history of vasectomy). 
15.293 Cytopenias are common (neutropenia most common). Monitor 
CBC closely and instruct patient to report any signs/symptoms 
of infection or unusual bruising or bleeding to the study team. 
15.294 Thrombotic events have been reported. Anticoagulation 
prophylaxis may be recommended. Instruct patients to report any problems with bleeding, extremity pain or swelling, or shortness of breath to the study team immediately.  
15.295 Patients may experience cough, URI, pneumonia, or sinusitis. 
Instruct patients to report respiratory symptoms to the study team. 
15.296 Gastrointestinal side effects consisting of diarrhea, constipation,

Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 15.3 Dexamethasone for Oral Administration (DXM) 
15.31 Background: Dexamethasone is an adrena l corticosteroid compound. 
Dexamethasone decreases inflammation by suppression of neutrophil migration, 
decreased production of inflammatory me diators, and reversal of increased 
capillary permeability; suppresses normal immune response. Dexamethasone’s 
mechanism of antiemetic activity is unknown. 
15.32 Formulation: Commercially available for oral administration as:  Tablets [scored]: 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, and 6 mg Solution, oral: 0.5 mg/mL (500 mL) 
Solution, oral concentrate: Dexamethasone Intensol: 1 mg/mL (30 mL) 
15.33 Preparation, storage, and stability : Refer to package insert for complete 
preparation and dispensing instructions. Store oral tablets at room 
temperature between 20ºC to 25ºC (60ºF to 77ºF). Protect from moisture. Dispense in a well-closed, light-resistant container as defined in the 
USP/NF. Store oral liquid at room temperature, do not freeze. Do not use 
if solution contains a precipitate. Refer to commercial package for drug expiration date. 
15.34 Administration:  Refer to the treatment section for specific administration 
instructions. May be taken with meals to decrease GI upset.  
15.35 Pharmacokinetic information : 
Onset of action: Prompt Duration of metabolic effect: 72 hours 
Metabolism:  Hepatic 
Half-life elimination: Normal renal function: 1.8-3.5 hours; Biological 
half-life:  36-54 hours 
Time to peak, serum:  Oral: 1-2 hours 
Excretion: Urine and feces 
15.36 Potential Drug Interactions : 
Cytochrome P450 Effect: Substrate of CYP3A4 (major); Induces 
CYP2A6 (weak), 2B6 (weak), 2C8 (weak), 2C9 (weak), 3A4 (strong) 
Increased Effect/Toxicity: Aprepitant, azole antifungals, calcium channel 
blockers, cyclosporine, estrogens, and macrolides may increase the serum 
levels of corticosteroids. Corticos teroids may increase the hypokalemic 
effects of amphotericin B or potassium-wasting diuretics (loop or thiazide); monitor. Refer to the pack age insert for a listing of other drugs. 
Decreased Effect: Antacids and bile acid sequestrants may reduce the 
absorption of corticosteroids; may reduce the absorption of corticosteroids; 
separate administration by 2 hours. Aminoglutethimide, barbiturates, and CYP3A4 inducers may reduce the serum levels/effects of dexamethasone and dexamethasone may decrease the levels/effects of other CYP3A4 
substrates. Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased by 
corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may l ead to a reduction in warfarin effect. 
Corticosteroids may suppress the response to vaccinations. 
Ethanol/Nutrition/Herb Interactions :  
Ethanol: Avoid ethanol (may enhance gastric mucosal irritation). Food: Dexamethasone interferes with calcium absorption. Limit caffeine. 
Herb/Nutraceutical: Avoid cat’s claw ( Uncaria tomentosa) , echinacea 
(have immunostimulant properties)

MC168A  77  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Overview 
This is a phase II study of a novel regimen of ixazomib in combination with 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone for treatment of patients who are being considered for 
single ASCT for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The study is designed to assess 
the progression-free survival at 18 months (PFS18) using a one-stage binomial study 
design.  
16.11 Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of this trial is th e proportion of patients alive and free from 
disease progression at 18 months from study entry. All patients meeting the 
eligibility criteria, who have signed a c onsent form and have begun treatment, 
will be evaluable for progression-free survival at 18 months (PFS18), unless they are determined to be a major violation. 
16.2 Statistical Design:  
16.21 Decision Rule 
In a previous study including 112 patients who received a delayed autologous transplant after IMiD-based initial ther apy, median progression-free survival 
from the time of transplant was 15.9 mont hs (Kumar S 2012).  In two additional 
studies with 64 patients and 65 patients who received novel agents during the 
pre-ASCT induction, the median progression-free survival from time of 
transplant was 22.2 months and 18 months , respectively, in patients who received 
a delayed transplant (Dunavin NC, 2013; Remenyi P, 2016). 
Patients on the proposed study will also  be undergoing delayed autologous 
transplantation; however, progression-free survival will be measured from study 
entry. Based on previous studies, a PFS18 rate from time of study entry of 50% 
would not be of interest. 
The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be 
considered ineffective in this popul ation is 50%, and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in 
this patient population is 75%. The following one-stage binomial design uses 21 
evaluable patients to test the null hypoth esis that the true success proportion in a 
given patient population is at most 50%.  
16.212  Final Decision Rule: If 13 or fe wer successes are observed in the first 21 
evaluable patients, we will consider this regimen ineffective in this 
patient population and terminate this study. Otherwise, if the number of 
successes is at least 14, this will be considered evidence of promising 
activity and the treatment may be recommended for further testing in 
subsequent studies in this population.  
16.213 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the stopping rule or used 
in any decision making process. Analyses involving over accrued 
patients are discussed in Section 16.313. 
 
 
MC168A  78  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 16.22 Sample Size 
The one stage study design to be used is fully described above. A maximum of 
21 evaluable patients will be accrued onto this phase II study unless undue 
toxicity is encountered. We anticipate accruing an additional 4 patients to 
account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons. Therefore, the total sample size will be 25 patients.  
16.23 Accrual Rate and Study Duration 
We anticipate accruing 2 patients per m onth to this study, and hence the 
enrollment period will be approximately 2 years. An individual patient is 
expected to complete induction, ASCT and consolidation phases within 15 
months of enrollment, after which ixazomib maintenance phase will start in which the drug is given until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The minimum duration before results may be reported is expected to be approximately 3.5 years, or until the last patient accrued has been observed for at least 18 months.  
16.24 Power and Significance Level 
Assuming that the number of successes is binomially distributed, the significance level is 0.095. The probability of declar ing that this regimen warrants further 
studies (i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true success proportion as shown in the following table. 
If the true success proportion is...
 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further study is…
 0.095  0.197  0.350  0.537  0.723  0.870  
16.25 Other considerations 
Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns of treatment failure 
observed in this study, as well as scientif ic discoveries or changes in standard 
care will be taken into account in an y decision to terminate the study 
16.3 Analysis Plan 
The analysis for this trial will commence at planned time points (see 16.2) and at the time 
the patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. The Statistician and Study 
Chair will make the decision, in accord w ith CCS Standard Operating Procedures, 
availability of data for secondary endpoints (e.g., laboratory correlates), and the level of data maturity. It is anticipated that the ear liest date in which the results will be made 
available via manuscript, abstract, or presentation format is when last patient has been followed for at least 18 months. 
16.31 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
16.311 Definition: The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients 
alive and free from disease progression at 18 months from study entry. 
All patients meeting the eligibility cr iteria, who have signed a consent 
form and have begun treatment, will be evaluable for progression-free survival at 18 months unless they are determined to be a major violation. 
Definition of Success : An evaluable patient will be classified as a 
MC168A  79  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 treatment success for the primary endpoint if they are alive and free from 
disease progression at 18 months from registration. 
16.312 Estimation: The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number 
of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals fo r the true success proportion will be 
calculated.  If patients are censored prior to 18 months post registration (which is unlikely given our data fro m past trials in a similar patient 
population), a Kaplan Meier (Kaplan, E. and Meier, P., 1958) estimate 
for PFS18 along with the 95% confiden ce intervals will be reported. We 
recognize that applying this appro ach will, however, reduce the stated 
statistical power of our primary analysis.   
16.313 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the stopping rule or used 
in any decision making processes; however, they will be included in final 
point estimates and confidence intervals. 
16.32 Secondary Outcome Analyses 
16.321 The overall response rate will be estimated by the number of patients 
who achieve a sCR, CR,VGPR, or PR  divided by the total number of 
evaluable patients. All evaluable patie nts will be used for this analysis. 
Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall response 
rate will be calculated. 
16.322 The ≥VGPR response rate will be estimated by the number of patients 
who achieve a sCR, CR, or VGPR divided by the total number of evaluable patients.  All evaluable patients will be used for this analysis. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall ≥VGPR 
response rate will be calculated. 
16.323 Overall survival is defined as the ti me from registration to the last date 
of documentation of follow-up or death due to any cause. The distribution of overall survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier (Kaplan, E. and Meier, P., 1958)
  
16.322 Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will 
be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The maximum grade for each type of adve rse event will be recorded for each 
patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. 
16.33 Correlative Analyses 
16.331 Minimal residual disease will be asse ssed on bone marrow aspirate in all 
patients in CR at various stages of treatment: after induction, day # 100 after SCT, after consolidation and during maintenance at one year from 
initiation of maintenance therapy. The proportion of patients who 
achieve MRD negative status will be estimated by the number of patients 
who are MRD negative divided by the total number of evaluable patients who achieve an sCR or CR. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true MRD negative rate will be calculated. 
MC168A  80  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 16.324  Engraftment kinetics (WBC and platelet) following single salvage 
ASCT for relapsed disease will be measured by assessing the timing of 
recovery of bone marrow function.  Neutrophil engraftment will be 
defined as the first of the three days of neutrophil count above 
500/microliter and platelet engraftm ent as the first day of >20,000 
platelets/microliter, untransfused.. Th e median time to engraftment of 
neutrophil count and platelet count from the day of infusion of autologous stem cells (day 0) will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
16.4 Dat a & Safety Monitoring 
16.41 Reviews 
The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developing. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC 
Statistical Office. 
16.42 Adverse Event Stopping Rules 
The stopping rules specified below are b ased on the knowledge available at study 
development. We note that the Adverse Ev ent Stopping Rule may be adjusted in 
the event of either (1) the study re-ope ning to accrual or (2) at any time during 
the conduct of the trial and in consid eration of newly acquired information 
regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The 
study team may choose to suspend accrua l because of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below. 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly rela ted to study treatment (i.e. an adverse 
event with attribute specified as “possible, ” “probable,” or “definite”) that satisfy 
one of the following: 
• if 3 or more patients in the first 10 treated patients experience a grade 4 or 
higher non-hematologic adverse event at  least possibly related to treatment. 
• if after the first 10 patients have been treated, 30% of all patients experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event at least possibly related to treatment.  
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment-related adverse event. 
16.5  Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov 
At study activation, this study will have been  registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” 
website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints along with other required information for this study will be reported on www.ClinicalTrials.gov . For purposes of timing of the 
Results Reporting, the initial estimated comp letion date for the Primary Endpoint of this 
study is 3.5 years after the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint 
MC168A  81  
Protocol version date:  December 12, 2019 Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last patient registered has been 
followed for at least 18 months. 
16.6 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
16.61 This study will be available to all eligib le patients, regardless of race, gender, or 
ethnic origin. 
16.62 There is no information currently availa ble regarding differential effects of this 
regimen in subsets defined by race, gender , or ethnicity, and there is no reason to 
expect such differences to exist. Theref ore, although the planned analysis will, as 
always, look for differences in treatment effect based on racial and gender 
groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power 
for subset analyses. 
16.63 The geographical region served by MCCC has a population which includes 
approximately 3% minorities. Based on prior MCCC studies involving similar 
disease sites, we expect about 3-5% of patients will be classified as minorities by 
race and about 33% of patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial by 
gender subsets are shown in the following table:

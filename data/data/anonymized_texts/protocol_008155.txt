2/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 4: 
RATIONALE 
The following changes have been made in this amendment:  
• Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea has been changed to 
Grade ≥  2 diarrhea  
• Grade ≥ 1 diarrhea that persists for more than 2 weeks despite antidiarrheals (e.g., 
loperamide) has been added as an AESI  
• Recommendation to Management of Gastrointestinal Toxicities that patients 
experiencing Grades ≥ 1 diarrhea be contacted at least weekly (e.g., by telephone) 
has been added 
• Adverse Event assessments at Weeks 7 and 11 by telephone have been added for 
a general assessment of adverse events 
 
Rationale :  The above changes were prompted by the number of suboptimally managed 
cases of diarrhea, one of which resulted in colitis.  These changes, including the addition 
of adverse event assessments at W eeks 7 and 11, have been made to increase 
monitoring of diarrhea.  
Other changes are as follows:  
• Added collection of additional blood sample at 4-week Post-Surgical Follow-Up visit 
for ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers analysis. 
Rationale :  This is aimed to enable correlation of response with biomarkers and 
potential identification of high-risk population(s)  
• Requirement added for Target Lesion #2, if selected, to be ≥ 10 mm.  
Rationale :  No minimum size was previously defined; therefore, this change 
was made to improve clarity.  
• Added additional restriction to the following ex clusion criterion: “History of prior or 
currently active small or large intestine inflammation (such as Crohn’s disease or 
ulcerative colitis).  Any patient with a baseline medical condition involving the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract or who may have a predisposition for GI toxicity requires 
prior approval from the Medical Monitor .”  
Rationale :  This was added with the intention that it may further prevent patients 
with potential predispositions to GI side effects from being enrolled.  
• Included “Investigational Agents” amongst prohibited Concomitant Therapies.    
Rationale :  This was not previously specified; therefore, this change was made 
to improve clarity.  
• Added specification that there is a 4-week “wash-out” period for any other 
Investigational Agents prior to initiation of treatment with GDC-0032.    
Rationale :  This was not previously specified; therefore, this change was made 
to improve clarity

SECTION 1.3:  BACKGROUND ON TH E PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in breast cancer, especially in the ER+ subtype (Cancer Genome Atlas Network [CGAN] 2012).  Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway include the following: (1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the alpha catalytic subunit 
of PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005); (2) Alterations in the tumor 
suppressor gene PTEN, either by loss of protein expression (PTEN null), inactivation 
mutations and/or epigenetic deregulation through promoter hypermethylation (García et al. 2004); (3) PDKP1 amplification and/or overexpression (Brugge et al. 2007); 
(4) AKT1 somatic gain-of-function mutations (Stemke-Hale et al. 2008) and AKT2 
amplifications (Bellacosa et al. 1995).  Overall, it is estimated that up to 70% of breast 
cancers can have some form of molecular aberration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (CGAN 2012).   
SECTION 1.4:  BACKGROUND ON RE VERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE 
BY INHIBITING THE PI3K/MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, the PI3K signaling pathway seems to play an 
important role in mediating hormonal resi stance and is a viable therapeutic target.  
Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway was proved to promote both de novo  (primary) 
and acquired (secondary) resistance to hormone therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines 
and xenograft models (Sabnis et al. 2007), and . simultaneous   Simultaneous blocking of 
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with everolimus , an mTOR inhibitor,  and the ER pathway 
with letrozole enhances antitumor activity of either agent alone (Boulay et al. 2005).  Importantly, a baseline protein signature of PI3K activation was found to be predictive of a poor prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy (Miller et al. 2010). 

 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
5/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 In the clinical setting, impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor,  were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial 
(Baselga et al. 2009). … 
SECTION 1.5:  BACKGROUND ON NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN BREAST 
CANCER 
…In September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated 
approval of pertuzumab ( Perjeta®) as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients 
with HER2-positive, locally advanced, infla mmatory, or early stage breast cancer in the 
neoadjuvant setting. 
SECTION 1.6:  BACKGROUND ON GDC-0032 
GDC-0032 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of PIK3CA -mutant breast 
tumors in vivo as a single agent and in combination with standard of care (e.g., paclitaxel 
or docetaxel) or endocrine therapies (e.g., letrozole or fulvestrant). … 
SECTION 3:  STUDY DESIGN  
In addition to the safety assessments conducted at the scheduled follow-up visits, patients will be contacted by telephone for a general assessment of adverse events at Weeks 7 and 11. 
Blood samples  for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to 
dosing, at Week 9, and 
prior to surgery  (Week 16 visit,) and at the 4-weeks postsurgical 
follow-up visit . 
SECTION 3.3.1:  Rationale for Conduc ting the Study in the Neoadjuvant 
Setting  
…Known as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, these groups of tumors have 
revealed critical differences in incidence, survival, and response to treatment 
(Sotiriou et al. 2003) .  As genomic studies evolve, further sub-classifications of breast 
tumors are expected to emerge.  Thus, a major challenge in breast cancer management 
is how to prospectively select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen and minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
SECTION 3.3.3:  Rationale for Control Group  
The Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined With Tamoxifen (IMPACT ) trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER + operable or locally 
advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery. … 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
6/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group ( ACOSOG ) Z1031 trial compared 
three AIs in a randomized, Phase II, neoadjuvant trial designed to select agents for 
Phase III investigations. … 
SECTION 3.3.4.1:  Rationale for E fficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is an unlikely event.  For instance, in the 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole  plus placebo , pCR 
rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively (Baselga et al. 2009). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of pertuzumab (Perjeta®), 
an HER2 dimerization inhibitor, as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients 
with HER2-positive, locally advanced, infla mmatory or early stage breast cancer in the 
neoadjuvant setting.   
SECTION 3.3.7:  Rationale for GDC-0032 Dosage  
As of 5 July 2013, 34 patients have been enrolled into the dose-escalation stage of 
Study PMT4979g, and 56 patients have been enrolled into the single-agent expansion cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  All patients received GDC-0032 in capsules.  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested (see Section 1.7.1).  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability, the recommended single-agent dose and schedule for the 
single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage is 
was 9-mg capsules daily. 
Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole, one patient at 6 mg capsule had a cPR.  The PIK3CA  mutation status of this 
patient is unknown.  Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg  capsules , and the 
long-term safety suggests that 6 mg capsule is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study 
will utilize 6-mg GDC-0032 capsules in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg  capsules  and 
1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg  capsules . 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time 
(from the first dose of study treatment) to onset of colitis ranged from approximately 82−248 days as either a single agent or in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant.  
Most of the colitis cases have been observed at the 9-mg capsule dose level or higher. 
To mitigate the 
late-onset adverse events, such as colitis, an intermittent dosing 
schedule will be applied. With the 40-hour half-life, a limited impact on efficacy is anticipated. … 
SECTION 3.3.8:  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep genome sequencing, may offer a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
7/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the tuberous sclerosis 1 ( TSC1 ) gene 
was found in a patient with metastatic bladder cancer with a prolonged response 
(> 2 years) to everolimus as single agent (Iyer et al. 2012).  Among 13 additional patients 
with bladder cancer treated with everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant 
tumors remained on therapy longer than those with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p
 = 0.004), suggesting that mTORC-1 directed therapies may be most effective in 
patients with cancer whose tumors harbor TSC1 somatic mutations.  Furthermore, 
interesting data was recently reported from an autopsy case study from a patient with metastatic breast cancer that received an  alpha-isoform PI3K blocking agent and 
succumbed to her disease after a lasting clinical response (Juric et al. 2015).  Extensive metastatic sampling was performed post-mortem, with the main finding being the emergence of molecular aberrations leading to loss of PTEN; thus, indicating a new mechanism of secondary resistance to PI3K blockade.  Similar approaches could be of 
great value when analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
SECTION 4.1.2:  Exclusion Criteria  
Patients who meet any of the following cr iteria will be excluded from study entry: 
• History of prior or currently active small or large intestine inflammation (such as 
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) .  Any patient with a baseline medical 
condition involving the gastrointestin al (GI) tract or who may have a 
predisposition for GI toxicity requires prior approval from the Medical Monitor.   
SECTION 4.5.10:  Laboratory Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [RBC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells,  if applicable ]), and 
platelet count.   
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Tumor tissue should be from the primary tumor (not lymph nodes) and  of good 
quality based on total and viable tumor content.  Evaluation of the patient’s tumor 
sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a central laboratory must occur prior to 
initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten unstained slides from a prior 
diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for enrollment eligibility purposes. 
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection (Weeks 17 −18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various 
reasons (e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site 
should discuss with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, 
unstained slides (a minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
8/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 surgical specimen are required at surgery (Weeks 17 −18).  Except in the case 
of pCR, every effort should be made to obtain a fresh-frozen tumor tissue 
sample at surgery.  
 
SECTION 4.5.11.1:  Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA   
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35% −40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 (helical and 
kinase domain, respectively) in the codons encoding amino acids E542, E545, and 
H1047 (Saal et al. 2005). … 
SECTION 5.1.1.3:  Management of Rash 
Rash and other dermatological events should be closely monitored, and patients with 
severe rash should be monitored for associated signs and symptoms such as fever and hypotension that may be suggestive of a system ic hypersensitivity reaction.  For severe 
rash, dosing of GDC-0032/placebo  should be interrupted, and patients should be treated 
with supportive therapy per standard of care.  Use of antihistamines, as well as topical or systemic corticosteroids, may be considered (see Table 4).   
SECTION 5.1.1.4.1:  Manageme nt of Diarrhea and Colitis 
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the 
investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Weekly patient contact (e.g., 
telephone call) for all events of diarrhea Grades ≥1 is recommended to closely follow 
until resolution of symptoms.   Gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed per 
protocol guidelines and institutional standard of  care.  For example, prompt management 
of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the 
approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold 
GDC-0032 /placebo  for Grade ≥
 2 diarrhea.     
Perforated duodenal ulcer has been observed in 2 patients (one patient at 6 mg  capsule  
in combination with letrozole; another patient at 6 mg capsule in combination with 
fulvestrant).  Appropriate caution should be taken with the administration of medications 
such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids that can increase the risk of gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal perforation. 
SECTION 5.2.3:  Non Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest 
(Immediately Reportable to ABCSG) 
Non serious  aAdverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the 
investigator to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Grade ≥ 3 
2 diarrhea  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
9/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 • Grade ≥ 1 diarrhea for > 2 weeks after following medical management guidelines in 
Section 5.1.1.4  
 
SECTION 5.4.1:  Emer gency Medical Contacts  
Genentech’s Medical Monitor Contact Information: 
Medical Monitor: , M.D., Ph.D. 
Telephone No.  
 
SECTION 5.5.1:  Investigator Follow-Up 
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.   With regard to the adverse event of 
special interest of diarrhea, it is recommend ed that investigators follow every adverse 
event of 
≥ Grade 1 diarrhea with weekly patient contacts (e.g., telephone calls) and 
follow up until resolution.  Cases that do not resolve within 1 −2 weeks should be 
aggressively managed per protocol recommend ations for gastrointestinal toxicities.  
SECTION 5.6:  POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
The investigator should report these events by completing and faxing a paper Serious 
Adverse Event Reporting Form and fax cover sheet to Safety Risk Management using 
the fax numbers provided to investigators  directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either 
by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of 
Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of 
Investigators”). 
SECTION 6.1:  DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20% for each analysis 
population , we use a two-sided significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary 
endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
SECTION 6.4.1:  Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint  
…The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR.  The two alpha values account for a 
family-wise type I error rate of 20%  for each analysis population .  Patients with early 
study termination and hence missing efficacy outcome will be considered as 
non-responders.

Objectives  
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus 
letrozole plus placebo in women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2-negative (ER  +/HER2  −) early stage breast cancer, as measured by the following 
co-primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by centrally assessed breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  mutant (MT) patients 
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in  breast and axilla (ypT 0/Tis ypN0) by local 
evaluation in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  MT patients 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor objective response rate (ORR), asse ssed by centrally assessed breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (total pC R ypT0/Tis ypN0) by local evaluation in PIK3CA  
wildtype (WT) patients  
The following secondary objectives will be perfo rmed in all enrolled patients and separated by 
PIK3CA  mutation status: 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-0032 with letrozole plus placebo in terms of locally assessed 
ORR as measured by modified RECIST criteria (Appendix 3) using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) 
• Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery; and Week 3 to surgery.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
22/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 • Compare the centrally derived,  preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score upon 
treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by 
breast MRI via central assessment. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following: a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) ypT0/is, 
ypNX (breast pCR). 
Safety Objective 
The safety objective for this study is as follows: 
• Evaluate the safety of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo 
Patient-Reported Outcome Objectives   
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-re lated symptoms, patient functioning, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) betwee n treatment arms as measured by the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cancer Module (QLQ-BR23) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular comp osition as assessed by diffusion-weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited to 
somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN ex pression, pro-survival pathways (such as 
PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are 
predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with  GDC-0032 results in changes in downstream 
markers in tumor tissue and to examine t he relationship to anti-tumor activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline biopsy 
and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, enhancement, 
diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possibl e drug interaction between letrozole and 
GDC-0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032  drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or letrozole 
on pharmacokinetics and response (eithe r efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in letrozole 
plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
Study Design  
Description of Study 
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate the 
effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER
 +/HER2  − untreated, Stage I-III operable breast cancer whose primary tumors 
are ≥ 2 cm.  Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors are not eligible.  Standard of care 
assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tiss ue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal cutting 
temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffi n-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two pretreatment 
FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to 
beginning study drug treatment.  Prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for 
enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), 
and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment.  ER, PR, HER2, and 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
23/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 the percentage of Ki67-positive cells will also be  centrally assessed, but the results do not have 
to be available prior to enrollment in the study.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future 
translational studies.  Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed. 
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization ratio.  
Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 4 mg (two 2-mg tablets) or 
placebo on a 5 −days-on/ 2 −days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A 
maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be adminis tered.  Letrozole can be continued up to 
surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
After confirmation of all the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of the treatment 
arms.  A second biopsy will be performed on Day 15 (Week 3) for biomarker analyses.  Biopsies 
should be performed at least 2 hours after GDC-0032 dose administration. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed according to 2 factors: 
1. Tumor size (T1-T2 vs. T3) 
2. Nodal status (cytologically positive vs . radiologically or cytologically negative) 
The study will enroll approximately 330 pati ents at approximately 110 global sites. 
At Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, and 16 the primar y breast tumor and axillary lymph nodes will be 
assessed by clinical breast ex amination (palpation and caliper measurement).  Suspicion of 
progression based on clinical exam at any time should be further evaluated (Figure 6).  
In addition to the safety assessments conducted at  the scheduled follow-up visits, patients will 
be contacted by telephone for a general assessment of adverse events at Weeks 7 and 11.  
At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive disease 
and for the purpose of surgery planning.  Suspic ion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound 
should be confirmed by investigator-assessed br east MRI.  Patients with primary disease not 
evaluable by ultrasound at baseline should be assessed by MRI at Week 9.  Suspected 
progression in nodes should also be confirmed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) if these nodes 
had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patients with progressive 
disease (as defined by modified RECIST, Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or 
be taken off of the study, according to the investigator’s decision.  If the patient goes off-study  
every reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy sample prior to beginning 
another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surg eon.  The purpose of th is visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. 
mastectomy) and scheduling the dat e for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis.  Clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample s for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to dosing, at 
Week 9, prior to surgery  (Week 16 visit,) and at the 4-w eeks postsurgical follow-up visit . 
Surgery 
Surgery will take place after at leas t 16 weeks of treatment, during Weeks 17 −18.  Surgery 
should be performed within 4 days after the last dose of GDC-0032, if possible, to best observe 
pharmacodynamic knockdown with GDC-0032 in the surgical specimen.  Surgery may be 
delayed due to toxicity or other safety issues, upon discussion with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section 5.4.1) or recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; 
see below).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.   
Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice.  However, pre-surgical SLNB is not allowed. 
Information on the type of surgery will be colle cted and recorded.  Sur gery specimens will be 
collected for histological examination to as sess for pCR and for other endpoint analyses. 
Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local st andards of care.  Adjuvant 
endo cri
ne therapy and/or chemotherapy will be de livered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, 
radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
24/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks ( + 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the end of 
the study.  Assessment of  adverse events and general safety will be collected at this visit and 
the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning the 
surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and bot h the planned and actual surgical treatment 
should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pathological complete response (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be 
established via a local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and directions 
for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be us ed to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  IRF 
procedures are detailed in the IRF charter. 
Number of Patients 
The study will enroll approximately 330 pati ents at approximately 110 global sites.

Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g ., prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplement s) used by a patient from 7 days prior to 
screening to the study completion/discontinuati on visit.  All concomitant medications should be 
reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. 
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data 
from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate t hat 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in 
patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be adminis tered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates 
without the risk of a pharmacokineti c drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Prohibited Therapy 
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents such 
as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted t herapy, biological response modifiers, or 
endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topical estrogens (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is receiving 
these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to 
randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast and/or 
regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.

27/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 • Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment includi ng bisphosphonates and receptor activator 
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the management of 
osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate 
medication with no or minimal potential to inhi bit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
• Potent CYP3A4 inducers:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an 
alternate medication with no or minimal potent ial to induce CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 
inducer is co-administered with GDC-0032,  patients should be closely monitored for 
adverse reactions. 
Length of Study 
The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months for enrollment, plus 5.5 months after last patient in. 
End of Study 
The end of the study is defined as the date when the last patient has her postsurgery visit.

Non-Investigational Medicinal Products  
Letrozole 
Letrozole is a marketed product  that is approved in the Euro pean Union and the United States 
for the treatment of hormone receptor-positiv e breast cancer.  Based upon the different 
mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-esta blished safety profile of letrozole, there 
are no expected overlapping, significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.   
Patients will receive an oral, daily dose of 2.5 mg letrozole for 16 weeks (o r until time of surgery 
at the investigator’s discretion).   
Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis 
This study is designed for testing the effect of  GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all 
enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 patients in total. 
Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) for appr oximately 10% of 
the patients and t he prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, there will be approximately 
120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, there 
might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT cohort, which 
may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical 
power even when the treatment assignment is  imbalanced, the sample size was calculated 
based on a conservative scenario by assuming that the treatment assignment imbalance in 
PIK3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was calculated based on a chi²-test using 
continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20%  for each analysis population, 
we use a two-sided significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, 
and pCR, respectively. Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable fo r the MRI ORR, approximately 300 enrolled 
patients and 108 patients in the PIK3CA  MT cohort will be evaluable for analyses. This sample 
size allows us to detect an absolute percenta ge increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the 
GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; 
Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power and 16% two-sided significance 
level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 
120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an absolute 
percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GD C-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the 
letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the 
4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is 
approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more substantial 
treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or there is an 
increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased 
to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  
MT.   
Secondary Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatmen t, assessed by modified RECIST criteria by 
breast MRI (centrally assessed) in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total  pCR) after completion of study drug in PIK3CA  WT 
patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be analyzed analogue 
to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
30/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by PIK3CA  mutation status (centrally assessed): 
• ORR using modified RECIST criteria by t he following methods: by clinical breast 
examination, mammography and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) 
• Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to surgery 
(centrally assessed) 
• PEPI score (centrally derived) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by breast MRI 
• Evaluation of different definitions of pCR in cluding the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) 
ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR). 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be compared between 
the two treatment arms within each population based on appropriate statistical analyses: ORR 
will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal 
status; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by regression analyses, 
adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All se condary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided 
type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Determination of Sample Size   
Please refer to the primary analysis in the Statistical Methods section.  
 Interim Analyses 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will monitor accumulating patient safety 
data at a minimum of once every 6 months until the last patient has completed study treatment.  
Additional details (e.g., DMC members, communica tion, affiliations) will be provided in the iDMC 
charter.   
The iDMC will conduct interim analyses to re view the unblinded safety data after the first 
20 patients have either 1) finished the 30-day follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on 
study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (f or those who do not receive the surgery).  The 
iDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK 
summaries (all interim analyses).  While this revi ew is being conducted, patient accrual into the 
study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may 
call for additional meetings of the iDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The iDMC will share results from interim safety  analyses with the study team.  The study team 
will share interim safety results with study inve stigators as needed for the conduct of the study 
and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues antici pated in this trial, as well as 
measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following 
sections.  All available information of all enroll ed patients with all available assessments at the 
respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.

35/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON THE PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-KINASE 
PATHWAY 
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase involved in tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and migration upon activation by growth factor receptors and integrins.  PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) ( Cantley 2002 ), 
a second messenger involved in the phosphorylation of AKT and associated proteins  in 
the AKT-ma 
mmalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway ( Guertin and Sabatini 2007 ).  
Activating and transforming mutati ons, as well 
as amplification, in the p110 α subunit of 
PI3K are commonly found in solid and hematological tumors ( Li et al. 1997 ).  In addition, 
the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numer ous types of cancer by receptor tyrosine 
kinase signa ling, the lo
ss of the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) and Inositol 
Polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B), or RAS mutations (Shayesteh et al. 1999; Cantley 2002 ; Massion et al. 2004 ; Wu et al. 2005). 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-POSITIVE, 
HER2-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of total cancer deaths ( Jemal et al. 2011 ).  As a large proportion of breast cancer cases, 
especially in developed countries, ar e now diagnosed in early stages, th
ey are amenable 
to cure with a stage-appropriate combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy), and radiotherapy. 
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER
 +)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative 
(HER2  −) breast cancer accounts for about 60% −70% of all breast cancers.  However, 
not all ER+ breast cancers respond optimally to endocrine therapy ( Davies et al. 2011 ).  
There are several mechanisms that can lead to primary and/
or secondary hormonal 
resistance in ER+ breast cancer:  decrease of ER expression, loss of ER expression, or 
upregulation of growth factor signaling pathways, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways ( Johnston 2009 ). 
In the setting of ER+
 /HER2-negative breast cancer, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays 
an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and is a viable therapeutic target to explore ( Miller et al. 2010 ). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
36/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 1.3 BACKGROUND ON THE PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in 
breast cancer, especially in the ER+ subtype ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network [CGAN] 
2012 ).  Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTO R pathwa
y include the following: 
(1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the alpha catalytic subunit 
of PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005 ; Wu et al. 2005 ); (2) Alterations in the tumor 
suppressor gene PTEN,  either by loss of protein
 expression (PTEN null), inactivation 
mutations and/or epigenetic deregulation through promoter hypermethylation (García et al. 2004); (3) PDKP1 amp lificat
 ion and/or overexpression ( Brugge et al. 2007); 
(4) AKT1 somatic gain-of-function mutations ( Stemke-Hale et al. 2008 ) and AKT2 
amplification
s (Bellacosa
 et al. 1995 ).  Overall, it is estimated that up to 70 % of breast 
cancers can
 have some form of molecular aberration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
(CGAN 2012).   
1.4 BACKGROUND ON REVERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE BY 
INHIBITING THE PI3K /MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, the PI3K signaling pathway seems to play an 
important role in mediating hormonal resi stance and is a viable therapeutic target.  
Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway was proved to promote both de novo  (primary) 
and acquired (secondary) resistance to hormone therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines 
and xenograft models ( Sabnis et al. 2007 ).  Simultaneo us bl ocking of the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with everolimus , an mTOR inhibitor, and the ER pathway 
with letrozole enhances antitumor activity of either agent alone (Boulay et al. 2005 ).  
Importantly, a baseline pr otein signat
ure of PI3K activation was found to be predictive of 
a poor prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy ( Miller et al. 2010 ). 
In the clinical  setting, 
impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus  were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial ( Baselga et al. 2009 ).  This trial 
compared everolimus and exemest ane with plac ebo and exemestane in 
724 postmenopausal pa
tients with ER  + advanced breast cancer who had experienced 
recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting and/or in advanced disease.  Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the evero limus group was 6.9 months, as compared to 
2.8 months in the placebo group.  Hazard ratio (HR) for progression or death was 0.43, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.35 −0.54 (<
 0.001), as per the investigator’s 
assessment, and the magnitude of the effect was even greater as per central assessment (HR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27− 0.47; p<
 0.001).  In the open-label Phase II 
TAMRAD trial, patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI) resistant metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen plus everolimus or tamoxifen alone ( Bachelot et al. 2012 ).  The 
6-month clinical benefit rate was 61% (95% CI, 47% −74%) with tamoxif en plus 
everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29% −56%) with tamoxifen alone.  Time to progressio
n 
increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
37/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination 
(HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 −0.81).  Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 −0.81). 
In the neoadjuvant setting, combination of letrozole and everolimus also resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009 ).  In this study, 270 postmenopausal pa tients with o
 perable ER  + 
breast cancer were randomly assigned to re ceive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment 
with letrozole and either everolimus or placebo.  The primary endpoint of the trial, clinical response by palpation, was higher in the everolimus arm than in the control arm (68.1% vs. 59.1%, p
 = 0.062), a statistically significant result (one-sided, α  = 0.1 level). 
An important finding in trials with mTOR-tar geting drugs like everolimus is that they 
produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT), resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation ( Tabernero et al. 2009 ).  This finding suggests th at 
alternative pharmacologic strategie
s to effectively shut down the pathway upstream of 
AKT should be pursued.  One of these strategies is inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the level of PI3K. 
1.5 BACKGROUND ON NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN BREAST 
CANCER 
The use of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer has been studied in several large randomized trials that have compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy with standard adjuvant treatment (Mauriac and Smith 2003 ; Scholl et al. 1994 ; Semiglazov et al. 2004 ; 
Fisher et al. 2012 ; Wolff and Davidson 2000 ).  The randomized studies evaluating 
neoadjuvant therapy as well as meta-analyses of these studies have shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve bre ast cons erv
ation rates, decreasing the number of 
women obligated to undergo mastectomy ( Mieog et al. 2007; Fisher et al. 2012 ).  A 
meta-analysis of nine randomized st udies comp
aring adjuvant with neoadjuvant 
systemic therapy for breast cancer showed no difference in rates of death, disease progression, or distant disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy (Mauri et al. 2005 ).  The concept of neoa djuvant therapy is now well established 
and a stand
ard treatment option for patients with early breast cancer.  The Collaborative 
Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2014 ).  The results of this meta-analysis con firmed an 
associat
ion of pCR with favorable long-term outcomes in high-risk populations (i.e., 
HER2-positive, high-grade hormone receptor positive and triple negative subtypes), although the magnitude of pCR improvement pred ictive of the long-term survival benefits 
could not be determined.  In September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
granted accelerated approval of pertuzumab ( Perjeta
®) as part of a complete treatment

breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. 
1.6 BACKGROUND ON GDC-0032 
GDC-0032 (also known as taselisib) is a potent selective inhibitor of Class I PI3K alpha, 
delta, and gamma isoforms, with 30-fold less potent inhibition of the beta isoform that is being developed as a therapy for human cancers.   Nonclinical studies with GDC-0032 
demonstrate that GDC-0032 inhibits proliferation of p110 α-mutant breast cell lines, 
inhibits tumor growth in human breast xenograft models harboring PIK3CA  mutations, 
and results in a substantial reduction of PI3K pathway markers, including pAkt, pPRAS40, and pS6.   
GDC-0032 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of PIK3CA -mutant breast 
tumors in vivo as a single agent and in combination with standard of care (e.g., paclitaxel 
or docetaxel) or endocrine therapies (e.g., letrozole or fulvestrant).  GDC-0032 has a favorable in vitro and nonclinical in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination profile that has characterist ics consistent with a compound that can be 
delivered orally to achieve clinical exposure similar to the nonclinical efficacy findings 
described herein.  Additional studies, including 16-week toxicity studies in rats and dogs, phototoxicity studies, and an embryo-fetal development study, support the Phase II neoadjuvant trial with GDC-0032 in combination with endocrine therapy.   
In vitro, single-agent GDC-0032 potency is also observed in cell lines that do not harbor 
PIK3CA  mutations (see Figure 1).  In in vitro combination studies, the 
aromatase-expressing breast cancer cell line (MCF7X2.3.ARO) showed positive combination effects between GDC-0032 and endocrine therapies (see Figure 2).  In this cell line, GDC-0032 alone caused growth inhibition (50% effective concentration [EC
50] = 95 nM).  Effects on growth were also observed with letrozole and  fulvestrant.  
Combined treatment of cells with GDC-0032 and letrozole caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability at lower concentrations of either GDC-0032 or letrozole resulting in enhanced activity for the combination.  In addition, combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  wild-type (WT) cell line ZR75-1 when GDC-0032 was 
added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapies (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).  However, in vivo data in a PIK3CA  WT model are not 
available because these cell lines do not grow as xenografts.

41/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 1.7 SUMMARY OF CLINICAL DATA FOR GDC-0032  
1.7.1 Clinical Safety Data with GDC-0032  
As of 5 July 2013, a total of 144 patients have been treated with GDC-0032 capsules, in 
the Phase I/II PMT4979g study, either as single agent (n  = 90, 63%) or in combination 
with endocrine therapy (n  = 54, 37%). 
As of 5 July 2013, enrollment into the dose-escalation stage of Study PMT4979g had been completed with 34 patients enrolled at GDC-0032 doses ranging from 3− 16 mg 
daily.  GDC-0032 was well tolerated in the first three cohorts (3, 5, and 8 mg), with no patients experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).  At the 16-mg dose level, 2 of the 11 safety-evaluable patients experienced a DLT (Grade 4 hyperglycemia and Grade 3 
fatigue).  At the 12-mg dose level, 1 of the 10 safety-evaluable patients experienced a DLT of Grade 3 acute renal failure.  Although the single-agent GDC-0032 maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not exceeded at the 16-mg dose level, the recommended GDC-0032 dose and schedule for the single-agent expansion cohorts is 9 mg daily on the basis of long-term safety data through multiple treatment cycles.  As of the cutoff date, a total of 53 patients had been enrolled in the 9-mg daily dosing expansion cohorts. 
As of 5 July 2013, adverse events of any grade that occurred in ≥
 10% of the 87 patients 
treated with daily single-agent GDC-0032 capsules and were investigator-assessed as 
related to GDC-0032 were as follows:  diarrhea (47%), hyperglycemia (38%), nausea (36%), fatigue (35%), decreased appetite (31%), rash (25%), stomatitis (13%), vomiting (13%), and mucosal inflammation (12%).  Grade 3 and 4 adverse events assessed by the investigator as GDC-0032 related included hyperglycemia (12%), colitis (6%), rash (5%), diarrhea (3%), fatigue (3%), pneumonitis (3%), pruritus (2%), stomatitis (2%), increased alanine aminotransferase levels (1%), anemia (1%), increase in blood creatinine (1%), exfoliative rash (1%), hypokalemia (1%), hypophosphatemia (1%), lung infection (1%), pneumonia (1%), erythematous rash (1%), generalized rash (1%), maculopapular rash (1%) and skin exfoliation (1%), and acute renal failure (1%).

GDC-0032 at dose levels of 6 and 9 mg daily (19 patients at 6 mg, and 8 patients at 9 mg) daily in combination with letrozole (Cohort E).  No DLTs were observed at either dose level.  Adverse events of any grade and assessed by the investigator as drug related that occurred in ≥ 10% of the 27 safety-evaluable patients assessed as related to 
GDC-0032 were diarrhea (67%), fatigue (30%), nausea (30%), rash (30%), decreased appetite (26%), hyperglycemia (26%), stomatitis (26%), dysgeusia (22%), mucosal inflammation (19%), asthenia (15%), pruritis (15%), vomiting (15%), and dry mouth (11%).  Grade 3 and 4 adverse events assessed by the investigator as GDC-0032 related include diarrhea (11%), mucosal inflammation (7%), increased amylase (4%), hyperglycemia (4%), increased AST (4%), stomatitis (3.7%), increased blood alkaline phosphate (4%), fatigue (4%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase in the blood (4%), hypokalemia (4%), increased lipase in the blood, (4%), and papilloedema (4%). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
42/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 As of 5 July 2013, a total of 27 patients have been enrolled in the expansion cohort of 
GDC-0032 at dose levels of 6 and 9 mg daily (21 patients at 6 mg and 6 patients at 9 mg) in combination with fulvestrant (Cohort F).  No  DLTs were observed at either dose level.  
One patient has been enrolled in the Phase II part of the study with 6 mg GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant.  Adverse events assessed by the investigator as GDC-0032 related and of any grade that occurred in ≥ 10% of the 27 patients and were

Please refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure for additional information. 
1.7.1.1 Preliminary Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 34 patients treated with GDC-0032 at 3, 5, 
8, 12, and 16 mg in the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial (Study PMT4979g).  The cohort mean apparent clearance and the terminal half-life (t
1/2) following a single, oral dose of 
GDC-0032 had a range of 4.77 −9.17 L/hour and 36.7 −43.8 hours, respectively.  
Following daily oral dosing for 8 days, there was a 2- to 4-fold accumulation of GDC-0032.  The pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 appears to be dose linear and time-independent.  Preliminary PK data from Cohort E suggest there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between letrozole plus GDC-0032.  Mean plasma exposure of letrozole when given in combination with GDC-0032 (maximum concentration observed [C
max] = 0.407 μM and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24  ] = 8.01 μ M*hr) was comparable with the historical single-agent exposure 
(Cmax  = 0.495 μM and AUC 0-24  = 10.1 μM*hr) (Awada et al. 2008 ).  Similarly, plasma 
concentrations of GDC-0032, when given in combination with letrozole, w
ere within the 
range predicted by the population PK model.  Therefore, letrozole plus GDC-0032 can be co-administered without the risk of a DDI.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3 A4 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
and appeared to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro 
induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low to moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I/II study (PMT4979g) 
indicate that 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a PK DDI.  
Preliminary data from a healthy volunteer study showed that the 3-mg GDC-0032 tablet 
produces an estimated geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 196% (177.1 −217.0) for C
max 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
43/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 and 152.2% (141.9 −163.2) for AUC time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-inf) when compared with the 
3-mg Phase I capsule.  For this reason, a new 2-mg tablet has been formulated to 
deliver GDC-0032 exposure similar to the 3-mg capsule formulation.   
The drug exposure (AUC) for GDC-0032 in a healthy volunteer study was minimally 
affected by the consumption of a high-fat meal.  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be taken without regard to the timing of the administration of food.   
For additional details, refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure.   
1.7.1.2 Preliminary Pharmacodynamics 
Paired tumor biopsies were obtained from both PIK3CA MT and PIK3CA  WT non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at either the 3-mg or 16-mg GDC-0032 dose 
level, respectively, at screening (pretreatment biopsy) and during Cycle 1 in Study PMT4979g (on-treatment biopsy).  Inhibi tion of PI3K pathway markers, including 
decreases of >
 60% in pAKT and pS6 (compared with baseline), were demonstrated in 
these patients’ paired tumor biopsies (see Figure 4).

As of 5 July 2013, metabolic partial responses via FDG-PET ( ≥ 20% decrease in 
maximum standardized uptake value) were observed in 23 out of 38 patients assessed 
(61%) and included patients from the lowest dose tested (3 mg).  Thirteen of these 23 were patients with breast cancer.  Of the 13 response-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 plus letrozole, 10 patients (77%) had a partial metabolic response.  Of the 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
44/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 15 response-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 plus fulvestrant, 11 (73%) had a 
partial metabolic response.

1.8 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with solid tumors accounting for 
the majority of these deaths.  An estimated 1.38 million women across the world were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, accounting for 23% of all cancers diagnosed in women.  Breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, estimated to be responsible for almost 460,000 deaths in 2008 (Ferlay et al. 2010 ). 
A neoadjuvant study in a similar patient populat ion with the combination of letrozole and 
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has already been completed ( Baselga et
 al. 2009 ).  
Please refer to Sections 1.4, 1.5 , and
 3.3 for further rationale supporting the proposed 
trial design of combinin g GDC-003
2 with letrozole in the neoadjuvant setting for this 
patient population.  In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, it is hypothesized that the combination of decreasing estrogen levels with letrozole and inhibition of the PI3K pathway with GDC-0032 may have improved anti-tumor activity as compared to endocrine therapy alone.  This is supported by the nonclinical and clinical data outlined below. 
GDC-0032 is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of Class 1 PI3K that is being 
developed by Roche/Genentech as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent.  Activating and transforming mutations in the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K are commonly found in tumors.  GDC-0032 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of growth in various human cancer cell lines, and especially in nonclinical models of PIK3CA  MT tumors.  In addition, 
combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  WT cell line ZR75-1 when 
GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapies (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).   
GDC-0032 has also shown additive efficacy in combination with endocrine therapy in a 
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer xenograft model as outlined in Section 1.6.  
Nonclinical data support
 the investigation of GDC-0032 as a single-agent in solid tumors 
and in combination with endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  
Available clinical data with single-agent GDC-0032 suggest that GDC-0032 has 
dose-linear pharmacokinetics with a half-life of approximately 37 −44 hours.  
Pharmacodynamic markers of PI3K pathway inhibition upon treatment with GDC-0032 have been observed.  These include decreases in phospho-S6 in platelet-rich plasma and decreases in F-flurodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography uptake.  Available clinical data also include multiple confirmed partial responses in patients treated with 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
45/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 GDC-0032.  These include a patient with PIK3CA  MT lung adenocarcinoma treated at 
the 3-mg daily dose and another patient with PIK3CA  MT, hormone receptor-positive, 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated at the 5-mg daily dose.  In addition, a 
patient with PIK3CA  WT lung cancer treated at the 3-mg daily dose has had prolonged 
stable disease and remained on study for over 11 months.  These data show that single-agent GDC-0032 doses below 6 mg have been shown to have anti-tumor activity.  These aggregate data support the use of 6 mg in combination with letrozole.   
Letrozole is a marketed product that is approved in the European Union (E.U.) and the 
United States (U.S.) for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  Based upon the different mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-established safety profile of letrozole, there are no expected overlapping, significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.  
As of 5 July 2013, efficacy data are available for 24 patients treated with GDC-0032 
capsules in combination with letrozole; 3 patients (12.5%) had a partial response as best overall response, 2 of which were confirmed partial responses (cPRs) (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 cPR at 9 mg).  Of the 25 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 7 patients (28%) had a partial response as best overall response, of which 3 were cPRs (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 partial response at 9 mg).  cPRs have been observed in both PIK3CA  mutant and PIK3CA  WT patients with breast 
cancer.  Maintenance of cPR has been observed in a patient who had a dose reduction from 6 mg to 3 mg for an adverse event.  In addition, no additional safety concerns have been observed with GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole in the ongoing Phase I study compared to GDC-0032 given as single agent. 
A number of clinically appropriate strategies to minimize risk to patients have been built 
into the protocol through the means of inclus ion/exclusion criteria, monitoring strategies, 
protocol design, and management guidelines.  These will also be clearly highlighted and discussed in detail at investigator meetings and site visits.  In addition, please refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure for details regarding potential risks, associated precautions, and other relevant nonclinical and clinical safety information. 
Due to the need to develop improved therapies to reverse or delay resistance to current 
endocrine therapy in HER2-negative, hor mone receptor-positive breast cancer  and on 
the basis of the clinical and nonclinical data available for GDC-0032, Genentech/Roche 
feels that the risk-benefit profile of GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole in 
postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive early stage 
breast cancer is favorable for proceeding with the proposed randomized Phase II clinical 
trial.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate 
the effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated, Stage I −III operable breast cancer 
whose primary tumors are ≥ 2 cm.  Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors are not eligible.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
48/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Standard of care assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed 
within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumo r tissue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal 
cutting temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two 
pretreatment FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to beginning study drug treatment.  Tumor tissue from prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future translational studies.  Presurgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed.   
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio.  Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 4 mg (two 2-mg tablets) or placebo on a 5 −days-on/2− days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks 
(see Figure 5).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole 
can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
50/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Suspicion of progression based on clinical ex am at any time should be further evaluated 
(see Figure 6).   
In addition to the s a
fety assessments conducted at the scheduled follow-up visits, 
patients will be contacted by telephone for a general assessment of adverse events at 
Weeks 7 and 11. 
At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive 
disease and for the purpose of surgery planning.  Suspicion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound should be confirmed by investigator-assessed breast MRI.  Patients with primary disease not evaluable by ultrasound at baseline should be assessed by MRI at Week 9.  Suspected progression in nodes should also be confirmed by fine 
needle aspiration (FNA) if these nodes had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patient s with progressive disease (as defined by 
modified RECIST, Appendix 3) can either proceed directly to surgery or be taken off of 
the study, according to the investigator’s decision.  If the patient goes off-
study, every 
reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy sample prior to beginning another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surgeon.  The purpose of this visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and scheduling the date for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis.  
Clinical breast examination, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be 
conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood samples  for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to 
dosing, at Week 9, prior to surgery  (Week 16 visit,) and at the 4-weeks postsurgical 
follow-up visit . 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
52/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local standards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be deliv ered as per the investigator’s choice.  
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks ( +
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the 
end of the study.  Assessment of adverse ev ents and general safety will be collected at 
this visit and the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both the planned and actual surgical treatment should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pCR (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be established via a 
local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and 
directions for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be used to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  
IRF procedures are detailed in the IRF charter. 
3.1.2 Independent Data  Monitoring Committee  
An iDMC will monitor accumulating patient safety data at a minimum of once every 6 months until the last patient has completed study treatment.  Additional details (e.g., iDMC members, communication, affiliation s) will be provided in the iDMC charter.   
The iDMC will review the unblinded safety data after the first 20 patients have either 1) finished the 30-day follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been in the study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the surgery), whichever occurs first.  While this review is being conducted, patient accrual into the study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the iDMC to review ongoing safety data.   
3.2 END OF STUDY  
The end of the study is defined as the date when the last patient has her postsurgery visit.  The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months for enrollment,
 plus 5.5 months after last patient in.

53/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.3.1 Rationale for Conducting the Study in the Neoadjuvant Setting  
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and not every breast tumor responds equally 
to a specific agent.  Studies based on global gene expression analyses have provided 
additional insights into this complex scenario.  Over the past 10 years, four major classes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Lum inal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like) have 
been identified and intensively studied ( Perou et al. 2000 ; Sørlie et al. 2001 ).  Known as 
the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, t hese groups of tumors have revealed critical 
differences in incidence,
 survival, and response to treatment ( Sotiriou et al. 2003 ).  As 
genomic studies evolve, further sub-classificat i
ons of breast tumors are expected to 
emerge.  Thus, a major challenge in breast c ancer management is how to prospectively 
select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen and minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
Neoadjuvant therapy, a systemic therapy administered prior to breast cancer surgery, is 
now widely used in the treatment of patients with early breast cancer.  Outcomes of 
patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy ( Mauri et al. 2005), and the former offers clear advantages to patients, 
especially those with lar ger tumors.  The tumor may shrink prior to surg
ery, thus 
increasing the rate of BCS ( Coudert et al. 2006 ), and since the response  to therapy can 
be monitored, the patien
t might be also spared further treatment with inactive 
medications.  
The neoadjuvant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents.  Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, usually from the diagnostic specimens.  On-treatment biopsies may also be prespecified in order to monitor treatment response at a biological level.  Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well.  The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes of breast cancer ( von Minckwitz and 
Fontanella 2013 ; Cortazar et al. 2012 ). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
Postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, ER+, early stage breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.  This patient population is usually treated with a combination of surgery, anti-hormonal therapy, and/or chemotherapy, according to staging and biological features.  
Recently, everolimus was approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency in 
combination with exemestane for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer in patients after recurrence or progression following treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs).  In the neoadjuvant setting, a combination of letrozole and 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
54/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 everolimus resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ 
breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009 ). 
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, confirm a 
previously identified pharmacodyna mic paradox: 
 while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an 
upregulation of the pAKT, resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation through an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mediated feedback loop (Tabernero et al. 2009 ).  This finding suggests th at alternative pharmacologic strateg
 ies 
to shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued.  One of these strategies is to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the PI3K level.  PI3K-inhibitors are central regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, and nonclinical findings show that PI3K-inhibitors and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors induce a greater amount of apoptosis than everolimus in estrogen-deprived in vitro models ( Sanchez et al. 2011 ); therefore, it 
is hypothesized that PI3K-inhibitors may be active and demonstrate gre
ater anti-tumor 
activity as compared to AIs alone in the neoadjuvant setting. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group  
AIs have been found to be more effective than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. 
Several trials have assessed the efficacy  and safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
using AIs in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer ( Eiermann et al. 2001 ; 
Smith et al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011 ). 
The P024 trial was a worldwide, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that 
randomized 337 postmenopausal patients with ER + breast cancer to receive either 
4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen ( Eiermann et al. 2001 ).  
The primary 
endpoint of P024 was the percentag e of patients in each trea
tment arm with objective 
response as determined by clinical palpation.  Secondary endpoints included ORR determined by mammogram and ultrasound and included the percentage of patients in each arm who had become eligible for BCS.  The trial demonstrated a significantly higher clinical response rate for letrozole when compared with tamoxifen (55% vs. 36%; p
 < 0.001) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.  An improved ORR for letrozole was also 
observed with ultrasound (35% vs. 25%; p  < 0.042) and mammogram (34% vs. 16%; 
p < 0.001).  The higher response rate assessed by clinical palpation translated into a 
significantly higher rate of women undergoing BCS in tumors that had initially been considered unsuitable for this procedure (45% vs. 35%; p
 = 0.022).  Median 
time-to-response was 66 days in the letrozole group and 70 days in the tamoxifen group, and both treatments were well tolerated. 
The Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined With Tamoxifen 
(IMPACT ) trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER + operable or locally 
advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
55/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or 
a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery.  The tumor ORR was assessed by both caliper and ultrasound.  No significant differences in ORR in the ITT population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination were seen.  However, in a predefined analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more patients requiring mastectomy at baseline actually receiving BCS with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (44% vs.  31%, respectively; 
p
 = 0.23); this difference became significant for patients deemed by their surgeon to be 
eligible for BCS after treatment (46% vs.  22%, respectively; p  = 0.03).  All treatments 
were well tolerated. 
The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group ( ACOSOG ) Z1031 trial compared 
three AIs in a randomized, Phase II, neoadjuvant trial designed to select agents for 
Phase III investigations.  Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical Stage II −III ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant 
exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole.  The primary endpoint was clinical response.  No 
formal comparison between arms was prespecified in the statistical plan.  ORR was 62.9%, 74.8%, and 69.1% for the exemestane, letrozole, and anastrozole arms, respectively.  On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI score, or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. 
Results from these trials suggest that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be beneficial 
in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer and that it offers an alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.3.4 Rationale for the Efficacy Ou tcome Measure of Response Rate 
Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
ORR is based on criteria related to changes in tumor size (e.g., RECIST) and is generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple, non-registrational, neoadjuvant trials in combination with endocrine therapy (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007 ; Baselga et al. 2009 ).  
Guidelines for RECIST v1.1 state that MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast  
lesions 
in a neoadjuvant setting, and it has  advantages over computed tomography (CT) 
and mammography ( Eisenhauer et al. 2009 ).  In addition, MRI has been shown to be 
more accurate than clinical palpation, ultrasound, 
and mammography for measuring 
residual tumor size after neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Akazawa et al. 2006 ; Balu-Maestro et al. 2002; Yeh et al. 2005), including the I-SPY 
trial ( Hylton et al. 2012).  For these reasons, ORR as assessed by breast MRI has been 
chosen as a  co-primary 
endpoint for this trial.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
56/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 3.3.4.1 Rationale for Efficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
pCR is a recognized efficacy endpoint of neoadjuvant trials, especially those with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it has been correlated with long-term outcomes, such as 
event-free survival ( von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013 ).  
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is  an unlikely event.  For instance, in t
he 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole  plus placebo , pCR 
rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively ( Baselga et al. 2009 ). 
In the ongoing Phase I/II trial that combines letrozole with GDC-0032, tumor shrinkage has been observed, and some patients presented
 sustained partial responses.  As pCR 
is a recognized indicator of activity to a given regimen, it would be useful to assess it as a co-primary efficacy endpoint of this trial.  Furthermore, for the same trial size, this would represent a minimal increase in the minimum detected difference (MDD) of the 
co-primary endpoint for pCR ORR (from MDD of 12% to MDD of 13%). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of pertuzumab (Perjeta
®), 
an HER2 dimerization inhibitor, as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients 
with HER2-positive, locally advanced, infla mmatory or early stage breast cancer in the 
neoadjuvant setting.   
3.3.4.2 Rationale for Ki67 Measurements 
Ki67 is a well-established proliferation biomarker with prognostic value in ER + breast 
cancer ( Dowsett et al. 2011 ).  Efficacy of endocrine therapy relies on induction of 
cell-cycle arrest, and du ring neoadju
vant treatment, Ki67 levels reflect the ability of 
endocrine agents to suppress proliferation ( Smith et al. 2005 ; Ellis et al. 2011 ).  In the 
neoadjuvant trial of letroz ole with everolimus, by using the d
efinition that patients with 
natural log (Ki67)  < 1 at Day 15 have an antiproliferative response, 57% of 
everolimus-treated patients were responders versus 30% in the placebo arm, with a 
significant p  value of <  0.01 (Baselga et al. 2009 ).  Furthermore, the mean reduction in 
the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells at Day 15 relative to baseline 
was greater in 
the everolimus-treated patients (90.7%  ± 3.2%) than in the placebo group (74.8%  ± 6.8%; 
p = 0.0002).  In the IMPACT trial, Ki67 was assessed at baseline, on Day 15, and at 
surgery ( Smith et al. 2005).  For each treatment arm, the reduction in geometric mean 
Ki67 levels was significantly higher for anastrozole than for t
amoxifen at both timepoints 
(p = 0.004, p  = 0.001, respectively), but no differences were found between tamoxifen and 
the combination.  In the ASCOSOG Z1031 trial ( Ellis et al. 2011 ), although no data on 
Ki67 at Day 15 were ava
ilable, no differences were found between treatments at 
baseline and at surgery (after 16 −18 weeks of therapy).  The geometric mean 
percentage change in Ki67 for each treatment was similar between the arms (anastrozole 78%, exemestane 81.2%, and letrozole 87.1%). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
57/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 The issue of whether Ki67 decrease at surgery or at any timepoint during treatment 
correlates with long-term efficacy outcomes has been addressed in the P024 trial (Eiermann et al. 2001).  Treatment with letrozole led to higher , treatment-induced 
reduction of 
Ki67 levels in the tumor at surgery (87% reduction in the letrozole arm vs. 
75% in the tamoxifen arm; analysis of covariance p  = 0.0009) based on the 
185 specimens with available data on Ki67 ( Ellis et al. 2003 ).  With a median follow-up of 
61.2 months, low levels of Ki67 in the biopsy at the end of tr eatment were significantly 
associat
ed with better relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.4 per natural log increase in the 
Ki67 value, 95% CI 1.2 −1.6, p  < 0.001), and breast cancer specific survival (HR 1.4, 95% 
CI 1.1− 1.7, p  =  0.009).  Finally, in the IMPACT trial, higher Ki67 expression after 
2 weeks of endocrine therapy was statistically significantly associated with lower RFS (p
 = 0.004), whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not (Smith et al. 2005). 
Importantly, the Ki67 suppression in t
hese hormonal neoadjuvant trials mirrored efficacy 
outcomes in large adjuvant trials: adjuvant BIG1-98 trial (n  = 8,010) showed the superior 
efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen ( Regan et al. 2011 ), similar to the neoadjuvant P024 
trial (n  = 185); the adjuvant ATAC trial (n  = 9,366) showed that anastrozole was better 
than tamoxifen and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen ( Cuzick et al. 2010 ), 
similar to neoadjuvant IMPACT (n  = 259); and the adjuvant MA27 trial (n  = 7,576) showed 
similar efficacy of anastrozole and exemestane ( Goss et al. 2013 ), mirroring neoadjuvant 
ACOSOG Z 1031 (n  = 266).  These results suggest that a biological superiority 
hypothesis generated by a neoadjuvant study may help the design of future adjuvant hormonal therapy trials. 
In summary, reduction in Ki67 after neoadjuvant treatment with AIs is a good marker of 
suppression of cellular proliferation, correlates with long term efficacy outcomes, and mirrors results of large adjuvant endocrine trials, which make it an attractive endpoint to assess in the present trial. 
3.3.4.3 Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic 
Index Score 
In addition to Ki67, pathologic tumor size (T1 or T2 versus T3 or T4), node status (positive or negative), and the ER status (positive Allred score 3 −8 versus negative 
Allred score 0 −2) of the surgery specimen were also determined to have independent 
prognostic value for relapse and death after relapse in the P024 trial ( Ellis et al. 2008 ).  
A PEPI score, prognostic for RFS, which weighs each of these factors according to their associated hazard ratio 
s, was developed and subsequently validated in an independent 
data set from the IMPACT trial (Ellis et al. 2008 ).  No relapses were recorded in either 
trial in patients with tumors classified as T1N0 and with a PEPI score of 0 (residual tumor with a Ki67 level ≤
 2.7%, and with maintained ER expression) or in the rare patient 
with a pCR. 
In this trial, the PEPI score will be derived centrally.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
58/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 3.3.4.4 Rationale for Assessing O RR by Clinical Breast Exam 
(Palpation), Mammography, and Breast Ultrasound 
Objective overall response rate will also be assessed by clinical breast exam, 
mammography, and breast ultrasound during screening and prior to surgery.  These data will allow for more direct comparison of results to other neoadjuvant trials with endocrine therapy as described in Section 3.3.3.  The concurrent acquisition of ORR 
data with these techniques, in additi on to MRI-based measures, will al
so provide 
valuable comparative information on these methods, which will be important for both future neoadjuvant studies and GDC-0032 clinical development.  
3.3.4.5 Rationale for Assessing Enha ncing Tumor Volume by Breast 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
As shown in the I-SPY trial, tumor volume measurements based on the percent of tumor with enhancing signal after contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures (Hylton et al. 2012).  However, there are no established resp onse criteria
  for volumetric 
data, and the extrapolation of current one- and two-dimensional criteria to volumetric data based on a spherical model may not be appropriate given the range of tumor morphologies expected in this population of patients ( Loo et al. 2011 ).  Additionally, 
there are only very limited data on the clinical relevance of any particular range in change in tumor volu me 
during the course of neoadjuvant treatment.  For these reasons, 
changes in enhancing tumor volume as measured by breast MRI will be a secondary endpoint in the trial.     
3.3.5 Rationale for Inde pendent Review Facility  
Due to the relatively novel nature of using MRI as an imaging endpoint, a central assessment by an IRF for the co-primary endpoint of response rate via MRI will be performed to ensure consistency across all sites participating in the study.  
3.3.6 Rationale for Interim Safety Review  
The first 20 patients will be assessed for safety following surgery and 30 days beyond.  This will allow the iDMC to review all safety data during the treatment period and to evaluate any surgery complications that may be attributed to GDC-0032. 
3.3.7 Rationale for GDC-0032 Dosage  
As of 5 July 2013, 34 patients have been enrolled into the dose-escalation stage of Study PMT4979g, and 56 patients have been enrolled into the single-agent expansion cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  All patients received GDC-0032 in capsules.  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested (see Section 1.7.1).  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety 
data on long-term tolerability, the recommended  single-agen
t dose and schedule for the 
single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage was 9-mg capsules daily. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
59/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
letrozole, one patient at 6 mg capsule had a cPR.  The PIK3CA  mutation status of this 
patient is unknown.  Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg  capsules , and the 
long-term safety suggests that 6 mg capsule is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study 
will utilize 6-mg GDC-0032 capsules in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg  capsules  and 
1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg  capsules . 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time 
(from the first dose of study treatment) to onset of colitis ranged from approximately 82−248 days as either a single agent or in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant.  
Most of the colitis cases have been observed at the 9-mg capsule dose level or higher. 
To mitigate late-onset adverse events, such as colitis, an intermittent dosing schedule will be applied. With the 40-hour half-life, a limited impact on efficacy is anticipated.  PK modeling has shown that a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off will maintain GDC-0032 drug exposure levels within an efficacious range as assessed by various breast cancer cell lines.  There has also been data presented for another PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, with a similar half-life in combination with letrozole in a Phase Ib study that demonstrated improved tolerability with similar efficacy  for a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off as 
compared with daily continuous dosing of the PI3K inhibitor ( Mayer et al. 2012). 
3.3.8 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments   
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and PIK3CA  mutations have been shown to 
vary among patients ( CGAN 2012 ).  Therefore, all patients may not equ ally likely benefit 
from treatment with GDC-0032.  Predictive biomarker samples collected prior to dosing will be assessed in an effort to identify those patients with PIK3CA -driven pathogenesis 
who are most likely to respond to GDC-0032.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be evaluated to assess the biologic activity of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole.  
It has been suggested that not all molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway result in pathway activation.  In a comprehensive analysis of tumors from 850 patients with breast cancer, protein markers of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (pAKT, pS6, and p4EBP1) correlated strongly with INPP4B and PTEN  loss, to a degree with PIK3CA 
amplification but were not elevated in PIK3CA- MT luminal A cancers ( CGAN 2012 ).  
This apparent disconnect between the presence  of PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of 
pathway activation had been previously noted ( Loi et al. 201
0) and stress the need to 
find innovative and robust predictive biomarke rs to PI3K/AKT /mTOR pathway inhibiting 
agents ( Saini et al. 201
3). 
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep gen
ome sequencing, may offer 
a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole 
genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the tuberous sclerosis 1 ( TSC1 ) gene 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
60/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 was found in a patient with metastatic bladder cancer with a prolonged response 
(> 2 years) to everolimus as single agent ( Iyer et al. 2012).  Among 13 additional patients 
with bladder cancer treat
ed with everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant 
tumors remained on therapy longer than those with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p
 = 0.004), suggesting that mTORC-1 directed therapies may be most effective in 
patients with cancer whose tumors harbor TSC1 somatic mutations.  Furthermore, 
interesting data was recently reported from an autopsy case study from a patient with metastatic breast cancer that received an  alpha-isoform PI3K blocking agent and 
succumbed to her disease after a lasting clinical response ( Juric et al. 2015 ).  Extensive 
meta s 
tatic sampling was performed post-mortem, with the main finding being the 
emergence of molecular aberrations leading to loss of PTEN; thus, indicating a new mechanism of secondary resistance to PI3K blockade.  Similar approaches could be of 
great value when analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
In addition to mutational activation of proteins, levels of RNA and DNA can also activate 
the PI3K pathway.  For example, increases in DNA copy number in receptor tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1/2 and IGF-1R, which occur at some frequency in breast cancer, can activate downstream PI3K pathway.  Hormone receptor positive breast cancer can be divided into luminal A and luminal B subtype, with the luminal B subtype displaying a higher proliferative index.  Therefore, profiling the RNA and DNA expression of tumors will allow intrinsic subtyping of patients enrolled onto study.  In addition, PI3K transcription activation signatures may identify additional patients who could respond to PI3K inhibitors outside of PIK3CA  mutations.  
The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor response to treatment is an area of great interest.  It could allow for an early, non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates for specific therapies and monitoring of disease mutation status over time ( Higgins et al. 2012 ).  The neoadjuvant setting is ideal 
to prospectively test these approaches. 
3.3.9 Rationale for Day 15 Biopsy  
On-study biopsies can provide valuable information regarding target engagement and downstream pathway suppression.  Assessing how GDC-0032 interacts with letrozole in this previously untreated patient population provides a unique opportunity to understand the interaction between two anti-cancer molecules.  When available, FFPE tumor samples will be assessed for pathway m odulation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methodologies, and fresh frozen OCT samples will be assessed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technologies, or equivalent.  Measurement of Ki67 after 2 weeks of continuous letrozole and GDC-0032 combination treatment versus letrozole and placebo will give a good benchmark to prior neoadjuvant studies that demonstrated a larger decrease in Ki67 at this 2-week timepoint for a combination of letrozole and everolimus as compared with letrozole and placebo ( Baselga et al. 2009 ).  This Day 15 biopsy will 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
61/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 also be useful in identifying potential biomarkers that may help predict a tumor response 
for patients treated with GDC-0032.   
3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for the Detection 
of Plasma Protein Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases  in levels of systemic cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate response to drugs, particularly targeted agents such as GDC-0032 ( Wilson et al. 2012 ).  Assays 
to assess th e expressio 
n of soluble, sy stemic cytokines and chemokines from the 
plasma of patients will be carried out using ELISA-based mass spectrometry or equivalent methodologies.   
3.3.11 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for DNA Sequencing 
to Identify Mutations in Plasma  
There is increasing evidence that circulating DNA obtained from blood specimens of patients with cancer is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells (Diehl et al. 2008 ; Maheswaran et al. 2008 ).  Assays are available that can detect the 
major PI3K mutations (and other cancer-related 
genes) in plasma, and results from this 
analysis will be correlated with tumor specimens. 
3.3.12 Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample for Next Generation 
Sequencing  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate a large quantity of sequencing data.  Tumor DNA can contain both reported and unreported chromosomal alterations due to tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing calls in previously unreported genomic alterations, a normal blood sample will be taken during prescreening to determine whether the alteration is somatic or germline.  
3.3.13 Rationale for Pharmacokine tic Sample Collection Schedule  
PK samples will be collected from patients with early breast cancer in this study to assess the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 and possible DDI between letrozole and GDC-0032 in this population.  Considering the lack of DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole upon concomitant administration in the 24 patients with metastatic breast cancer in the Phase I study (preliminary data), this drug interaction in patients with early breast cancer is unlikely.  Hence, extensive PK sample collection is not needed; sparse PK sampling from patients enrolled in this study is adequate.  The proposed PK sample collection schedule will also enable assessment of a concentration and response relationship to better understand the following:  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (efficacy), PK/safety correlation, and population pharmacokinetics.  Additional PK samples may be collected for safety concerns (e.g., severe adverse event) in order to better characterize drug levels in these patients at the time of the adverse event.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
62/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 3.3.14 Rationale for the Coll ection of DNA for Exploratory 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
One sample (approximately 3 mL of whole bl ood) will be collected from all patients using 
K3-EDTA collection tubes.  Samples will be used for the evaluation of genetic 
polymorphisms of drug metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, and UGT1A1, and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1) and for genetic variants, which could contribute to potentially drug-related rash and/or colitis safety assessments (including but not limited to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]).  For sample handling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual.  Only in circumstances where there is concern for collection of this genetic material for above evaluations, can this assessment be c onsidered not mandatory as part of study 
assessments in this study.  Results of any analyses from these samples will be reported outside the clinical study report. 
It is established that genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN 38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan ( O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006 ).  Preliminary 
results from in vitro metabolism studies with GDC-0032 suggest that they  are partially 
metabolized by multiple Phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes, including C
YP3A4.  
Although in vitro studies can help elucidate the roles of enzymes in the metabolism of the drug, these results are not always predictive of in vivo metabolism for a number of reasons, such as differences in drug concentrations that the enzymes encounter in vitro and in vivo.  For this reason, a blood sample for DNA isolation is proposed to be collected from all patients in this study for potential pharmacogenetic analysis of genes or biomarkers that may affect the pharmacokinetics or response to GDC-0032.  The decision to analyze the samples will be based on a review of the pharmacokinetics and response data.  Most recently, the role of HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of drug-induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepine, abacavir, and allopurinol).  Therefore, evaluation of genetic variants of genes that may regulate the immune response (including but not limited to HLA) may also be investigated to characterize unusual safety responses that are not predicted by GDC-0032 pharmacokinetics. 
The analysis will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, because it is necessary to 
link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis would be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination and/or response of patients who develop severe adverse reactions such as colitis or rash.  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 15 years after the completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
63/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 3.3.15 Rationale for Patient- Reported Outcome Assessments  
A PRO is “any report on the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly 
from the patient, without any interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else” ( FDA Guidance for Industry 2007 ).  PRO measures are able to 
contextualize a patient’s experience on trial,  eluc idating symptom and treatment burden.  
Since early breast cancer is often a
symptomatic, the PRO objective is to evaluate and 
compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and the health-related quality of life between treatment arms ( Lemieux et al. 2011 ).  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and associated breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23 , were selected 
because the
y were specifically developed to assess the most salient constructs and 
experiences with breast cancer and its treatment.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely and frequently used PRO measure in oncology trials that contains a global health status scale, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptom scales/items with a recall period of ‘the past week.’  
The second measure, the QLQ-BR23, is a breast cancer specific modular supplement to 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 and includes additional functioning scales and symptom scales/items relating to breast cancer.  
These instruments demonstrate strong psychometric properties, of both reliability and 
validity, and meet the requirements for this study (EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 1999; see Appendix 4).  Therefore, PRO data will be collected from patients using the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and modified QLQ-BR23 ( Qu
inten et al. 2009 ).

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING  
4.2.1 Patient Randomization  
After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility has been established, 
the study site will obtain a patient’s identification number and treatment assignment using a permuted block randomization algorithm via an interactive voice or Web-based response system (IxRS).  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
69/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 4.2.2 Stratification  
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio based on 
the following stratification factors: 
• Tumor size (T1 −2 vs. T3) 
• Nodal status (cytologically positive vs. r adiologically or cytologically negative).  If on 
ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes at the 
baseline examination, then fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy is required to confirm nodal status. 
 
4.2.3 Blinding  
Investigators and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment of GDC-0032 or 
placebo. 
For emergency situations, the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by 
contacting the IxRS.  The responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the investigator.  For non-emergency situations, the investigator needs to obtain approval from the Medical Monitor to break the treatment code.  Unblinding during the study will result in the withdrawal of a patient from the study.  For regulatory reporting purposes, and if required by local health authorities, the Sponsor will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected, suspected adverse 
reactions that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to study drug. 
While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to 
maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK assay results for these patients are generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this trial.  The PK assay group will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignments to identify appropriate 
PK samples to be analyzed and bioanalytical methodology to employ.  However, the PK 
scientist does not have access to the PK assay results and therefore stays blinded until 
the PK assay results need to be interpreted and reported.  Samples from patients 
assigned to the comparator arm will be analyzed for letrozole.  However, GDC-0032 assay will be analyzed by request (i.e., to evaluate a possible error in dosing). 
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT  
4.3.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Handling  
4.3.1.1 GDC-0032 and Placebo

authority regulations.  The investigational site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs, using the IxRS to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.  
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s institutional 
standard operating procedure (SOP) or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation.  The site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by the Sponsor.  The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form. 
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of 
by the study site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log. 
4.3.4 Post-Trial Access to GDC-0032

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate that 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
Letrozole is mainly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite by 
CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 in vivo. GDC-0032, which has the potential to induce CYP3A4 based on in vitro induction studies, was administered in combination with letrozole in the expansion phase of Study PMT4979g to assess their DDI potential.  Preliminary data from 10 patients in this cohort indicated that steady state plasma concentrations of both letrozole and GDC-0032, following once daily administration of the combination (2.5 mg letrozole plus 6 or 9 mg GDC-0032), were similar to historical, single-agent data suggesting lack of DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole.  These preliminary results suggest that GDC-0032 and letrozole combination may be administered without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
In vitro CYP inhibition studies in HLMs and induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested a low to moderate potential of GDC-0032 to perpetrate DDIs.  A clinical DDI study with rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) and itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), to 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
73/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 understand the effect of CYP inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of 
GDC-0032, is currently ongoing (Study GP28617). 
4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy  
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer 
agents such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological 
response modifiers, or endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this 
protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topical estrogens (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent :  If a patient is 
receiving these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast 
and/or regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an 
alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
• Potent CYP3A4 inducers:  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital) with GDC-0032 should be 
avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to induce 
CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inducer is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
Please see Appendix 1 for the schedule of assessments to be performed during the 
study. 
4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study-specific screening tests or  evaluations.  ICFs for enrolled patients 
and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before randomization.  The investigator will maintain a screening log 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
74/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable. 
4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases that are currently active or that were active within the previous 5 years, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to the screening visit.   
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
4.5.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination should incl ude an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems as well as weight and height (height is measured at the screening visit only).  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Vital Signs eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom-directed physical 
examination may be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature.  Oxygen saturation is obtained by pulse oximetry after the patient has been in a seated position for ≥
 5 minutes.  Obtain vital signs predose. 
4.5.5 Electrocardiograms  
Triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor Assessment  
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization.   
As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
75/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or 
abnormal physical examination; ches t CT if pulmonary symptoms.   
• For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC:  bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
should be conducted for all patients. 
 
In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease.   
4.5.7 Tumor and Response Evaluations  
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at subsequent timepoints as outlined in Appendix 1.  Responses based on clinical breast 
examination, breast ultras ound, and 
mammography will be investigator-assessed.  
Whenever possible, assessments should be perfo rmed by the same evaluator to ensure 
internal consistency across visits.  Response via breast MRI will be centrally assessed, and all assessments will be based on modified RECIST criteria (see Appendix 3).  
Clinical Breast Examination:  Assessment of primary breast  tumor and regional lymph 
nodes must be done by physical examination (palpation) during baseline 
evaluation, 
Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13 and 16 during the treatment phase and prior to surgery.  Breast tumor measurement by caliper (preferred) or rule will be performed and recorded in the eCRF. 
Axillary lymph node status (and other regional lymph nodes if clinically indicated) will 
also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Mammogram:  Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within 28 days 
prior to enrollment and again prior to surgery.  Mammographic tumor measurements are 
to be recorded in the eCRF.  
Breast Ultrasound:   Bilateral breast ultrasounds must be obtained at baseline within 
28 days prior to enrollment.  Investigator decision whether to perform unilateral or bilateral ultrasounds performed at Week 9 and prior to surgery (Week 16) may be unilateral or bilateral and per investigator discretion.  If on ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes  at the baseline examination, then FNA or 
core biopsy is required.  Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded in the eCRF.  The tumor site may be marked with a radiopaque clip or marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  
Breast MRI:  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans will be mandatory for all study 
patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to enrollment) and prior to surgery (Week 16).  
MRI is optional at Week 9 but will be mandatory if a primary breast lesion is not 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
76/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 evaluable by ultrasound or if there are signs of disease progression on the Week 9 
ultrasound (see Figure 6 ).   
Breast MRI scans should not be acquired within 48 hours aft
er biopsy, and the timing 
and location of any clip or marker plac ement during study biopsies should be recorded 
for reference when MRI scans are read.  If the screening breast MRI scan is not evaluable for RECIST measurement due to technical limitations of the scan itself as assessed by the central reading facility, the scan may be repeated, at least 48 hours after the first scan before the start of study treatment.  Other MRI acquisition sequences, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, may be acquired during this study during the MRI scan visits for each patient.  Additional MRI-derived metrics such as ADC value may provide additional insight into changes in tumor cellular composition.  
For information about patient preparation, scanner requirements and settings, and image 
acquisition, refer to the Study Imaging Manual.  Standard site practice may be followed regarding the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolytics for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI. 
4.5.8 Surgical Treatment Plan  
The planned and actual surgical treatment (BCS or mastectomy) performed should be documented and reported in the eCRF.  Patients should be reassessed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and prior to surgery.  
4.5.9 Surgical Specimen–Pathology  
The co-primary endpoint of the study (pCR) will be as identified by local pathology review.  Guidelines regarding pathology s pecimen preparation, labeling, and review are 
outlined in the pathology manual. 
4.5.10 Laborator y Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [ R
BC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells,  if applicable ), and 
platelet count.   
• Coagulation (INR and aPTT/PTT) 
• Fasting serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, serum 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, AST, ALT), performed following ≥ 10-hour 
fast 
• Fasting lipid profile and amylase (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed following 
a ≥  10-hour fast 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
77/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 • Fasting insulin and glucose  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
• Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue 
• FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor 
biopsies and surgical resection.  All patients must consent to the collection of newly 
collected tumor biopsies (frozen and FFPE) for PIK3CA  mutation testing as well as 
for other protocol-mandated exploratory assessments at baseline, Day 15, and at 
surgery. 
• Tumor tissue should be from the primary tumor (not lymph nodes) and  of good 
quality based on total and viable tumor content.  Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten unstained slides from a prior 
diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for enrollment eligibility purposes. 
Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies and one freshly frozen OCT core needle biopsy are required at baseline and Day 15 (Week 3).   
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection 
(Weeks 17 −18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various 
reasons (e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site 
should discuss with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, 
unstained slides (a minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a 
surgical specimen are required at surgery (Weeks 17 −18).  Except in the case 
of pCR, every effort should be made to obtain a fresh-frozen tumor tissue 
sample at surgery.  
The specimens will be used for confirmatory central laboratory assessment of PIK3CA  mutation status, Ki67, PTEN, ER/PgR and HER2 expression.  In 
addition, other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, PI3K 
signaling pathways may be evaluated, including protein expression and 
molecular profiling studies such as NGS and gene-expression. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers include but are 
not limited to the following:  ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers 
• Blood for NGS (if approved by local regulatory authorities) 
• Blood for pharmacogenomics (if approved by local regulatory authorities) 
• PK assessment  
Plasma samples will be collected to measure letrozole and GDC-0032 
concentrations (see Appendix 2).  Any remaining samples collected for PK and 
biomarker assays may be used for ex ploratory bi
omarker profiling, metabolite 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
78/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes 
as appropriate. 
 
4.5.11 Assay Methods  
4.5.11.1 Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA  
The PIK3CA mutation assay will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35% −40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 (helical and 
kinase domain, respectively) in the codons encoding amino acids E542, E545, and 
H1047 ( Saal et al. 2005 ).  Real-time polymerase chain react i on (RT-PCR) assays that 
amplify exons that are commonly mutated in PIK3CA  offer a sensitive and quantitative 
method to detect mutations from a tumor specimen.  DNA will be extracted from tumor 
samples and subjected to allele-specific PCR assays that detect the WT allele, as well as to assays for nucleotide substitutions that include but are not limited to the following amino acid changes:  R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545K/A/G/D, E546K/E/R/L, M1043I, H1047R/L/Y, H1049R.  Following histopathological review, samples with <
 10% 
tumor content may not be evaluable for the PIK3CA  assay.  Samples will be run on  
cobas z480 analyzer, and PIK3CA  mutation status (mutant or WT) will be made using 
appropriate cutoffs and automated software.   
A designation of PIK3CA  status unknown will be assigned to a sample wherein any one 
of the predefined mutations was not conclusively assessed. 
4.5.11.2 Pharmacodynamic Biomar ker Assays in Tumor Tissues 
Ki67 antigen is an important cell cycle-related nuclear protein that is expressed by 
proliferating cells in all phases of the active cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M phase).  As such, it is a useful marker of the proliferative state of a tumor.  Ki67 protein levels will be determined by IHC through the use of standard techniques.   
PI3K pathway, and other pro-survival, biomarkers will be tested in the fresh tumor 
biopsies by IHC including but not limited to phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4EBP1, and phospho-ERK.  If tissue quantity permits, change in expression of pathway biomarkers will be measured by the RPPA us ing OCT fixed tissue.  The basis of the 
technology is to immobilize small amounts of lysate from a tumor biopsy sample in serial dilution on a microarray slide.  Multiple samples are thus arrayed on a slide and can be probed with antibodies that detect a particular phospho-epitope.  Using this technology, we will profile approximately 80 key signaling nodes representing a number of pathways known to be dysregulated in cancer, including receptors in the HER family, multiple components of PI3K/mTor signaling, as well as key members of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
79/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 4.5.11.3 Analysis of Phosphatase Tensin Homolog Expression 
PTEN status will be examined by IHC using a protocol that has been validated for 
specificity using several available cell line controls at a central laboratory.  Tumor specimen will be scored only if appropriate staining is observed in internal control stromal or normal (non-tumor) tissue elements.  
4.5.11.4 Confirmation of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, 
and HER2 Status 
ER, PR, and HER2 status will be determined at a central laboratory according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. 
4.5.11.5 Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis 
ctDNA will be extracted from plasma samples collected from patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations using appropriate technologies.  The prevalence of 
the mutations measured at baseline and post-treatment may provide information on response or resistance to therapy. 
4.5.11.6 Messenger RNA Expression Profiling 
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression will be performed using gene expression assays conducted on the NanoString platform or equivalent.  Analysis may include but is not limited to a panel of genes important for intrinsic subtyping, breast cancer biology, and PI3K signaling.  The goal will be to generate a database of expression status to examine whether there are gene expression patterns that are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
4.5.11.7 Next Generation Sequencing 
In cases where there is sufficient material to isolate DNA, NGS will be performed using NGS platforms, such as Illumina or equivalent.  The goal will be to determine whether the percentages of genetic mutations are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
4.5.11.8 Copy Number Analysis  
The level of copy number alterations in cancer-related genes may be determined using DNA-based technologies, either cytogenetically using chromosomal in situ hybridization (ISH), using next-generation sequencing platforms or by RT-PCR-based or equivalent technologies.  For cytogenetic assays, detection may be either fluorescence-based (fluorescence in situ hybridization assa y) or chromogenic-based (chromogenic in situ 
hybridization).  Increased copy number of PI3K pathways activating genes may provide information on response or resistance to therapy.  
4.5.11.9 Plasma Biomarker Analyses 
Assays to assess the expression of soluble,  systemic cytokines, and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using appropriate methodologies, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based or mass spectrometry-based or equivalent technologies.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
80/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 4.5.11.10 Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Plasma GDC-0032 and letrozole samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
After the plasma samples are analyzed, any remaining samples may be used for 
exploratory metabolite profiling and identification, ex vivo protein binding, and PK, or pharmacodynamic assay development purposes. 
4.5.11.11 Pharmacogeneti c Polymorphism Assay 
If approved by the local regulatory authority, gene mutations will be assayed using multiplex PCR, allele-specific PCR, direct sequencing, or other acceptable methods.  Results may be correlated to population PK parameters or other clinical measures in order to better understand the impact of genetic variants on drug metabolism, exposure, adverse events, and/or response.   
A sample will also be utilized as a source of normal DNA to determine whether sequence 
variants in the PIK3CA  gene and in other relevant oncogenes in the tumor DNA are 
somatic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
4.5.11.12 Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.11.13 DL CO Testing 
A diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL CO) test will be required at 
baseline and at the end of study-drug treatment (prior to surgery) for all patients.  The DL
CO test should be repeated if there is clinical suspicion of pneumonitis.  Further 
guidance regarding DL CO testing is contained in Appendix 7 and in the management 
guidelines for pneumonitis (Section 5.1.1.2).   
4.5.11.14 Osteoporosis Asses sment and Monitoring 
Treatment with aromatase inhibitors results in bone loss due to estrogen deficiency (Gaillard and Stearns 2011 ).  For patients who have a history of osteoporosis and/or  
fractures, or
 who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, a bone mineral density 
assessment will be required at baseline prior to initiating study treatment.  Baseline bone mineral density will be measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  DXA measurement of both the hip and lumbar spine is suggested.  When either the hip or lumbar spine is not a valid skeletal site for a bone mineral density measurement, then the 33% (one-third) radius should be measured.   In some patients, measurement of the 
hip alone could be sufficient. 
Appropriate monitoring in these patients will occur per institutional guidelines.  
Assessment for fractures is already included as part of the scheduled physical examinations.  Determination of patients w ho are at increased risk for osteoporosis will 
be per institutional guidelines.  Clinical risk factors for fracture include advancing age, 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
81/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, parental history of hip fracture, low body weight, 
current cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis, and conditions predisposing to secondary osteoporosis (e.g., hypogonadism or premature menopause, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease) (Kanis et al. 2005).   
4.5.12 Patient-Reported Outcomes   
PRO data will be elicited from the patients in this study to more fully characterize the clinical profile of GDC-0032.  The PRO questionnaires, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient.  To ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, PRO questionnaires should be self-administered at the investigational site prior to the completion of other study assessments and the administration of study treatment.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and the Modified Breast Cancer module QLQ-BR23 
questionnaires will be used to assess HRQoL, including side-effects of systemic therapy (e.g., sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, skin problems) and patient functioning during the neoadjuvant period (refer to schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 1 for a detailed description of timepoints) and post-surgery follow-up.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used HRQoL measure in oncology trials with excellent 
psychometric properties demonstrating both relia bility and validity.  The measure 
consist
s of “five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three 
symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale” with a recall period of “the past week” ( Aaronson et al. 1993 ).  Scale 
scores can be obtained for each of t 
he multi-item scales, global health status/QoL scale, 
and six single items by using a liner transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score.   
The EORTC QLQ-BR23 breast cancer module was first validated for use in 1995, uses a 
recall period of “the past week,” and is intended for use across multiple treatment modalities (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment).  As this trial will include patients in the neo-adjuvant setting, the last seven items of the original BR23 questionnaire, items numbered 47− 53 that deal with symptoms and side effects 
not relevant to the population under study, will be removed.  These seven items addressed symptoms experienced by patients with metastatic breast cancer and those undergoing radiation.  Therefore, in consultation with the EORTC, these items were deleted, as the validity of the measure would not be compromised by their removal.  In addition, as “oral mucositis” and “skin problem s” are key symptoms of this therapy not 
assessed by currently available tools, validated items from the EORTC item bank were added to assess the presence and bothersomeness of oral mucositis (2 items:  sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing) and skin problems (2 items).  Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the final data analysis to 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
82/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along 
with the clinical trial results.  Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item and single-item scales by using a linear transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score. 
The PRO instruments, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by 
the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient.  Patients must 
complete these instruments in the clinic (cannot be taken home) prior to any healthcare provider interactions (i.e., prior to administration of study drug and prior to any other study assessment) to ensure that the validity of the instruments are not compromised and to ensure that data quality meet regulatory requirements. 
Refer to Appendix 4 for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified QLQ-BR23. 
4.5.13 Samples for Clinical Repository  
All residual samples (or leftover biologic samples after protocol-defined studies are 
completed) obtained during the study (FFPE, fresh-frozen, plasma, etc.) will be stored in an academic central repository.  The specim ens in the study repository will be made 
available for future biomarker research towards further understanding of treatment with GDC-0032, of breast cancer, related diseases, and adverse events, and for the development of potential, associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation of study repository specimens is governed by the Study Steering Committee, with guidance from a dedicated Translational Research Committee to ensure the appropriate use of the study specimens. 
All biomarker specimens will be retained for new  research related to this study and/or 
disease in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Study Steering 
Committee.  Samples will be only destroyed if required by local laws relating to the collection, storage, and destruction of biological specimens. 
Specimens will be stored up to 15 years or unt il they are exhausted.  The storage period 
will be in accordance with the institutional review board/ethics committee 
(IRB/EC)-approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as describ
ed below.   
4.5.13.1 Confidentiality 
Patient medical information associated with biologic specimens is confidential and may only be disclosed to third parties as permitted by the ICF (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by law. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
83/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Data derived from biologic specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The 
aggregate results of any research conducted using biologic specimens will be available in accordance with the effective Translational Reseach Committee policy on study data publication. 
4.6 PATIENT, TREATMENT, STUD Y, AND SITE DISCONTINUATION 
4.6.1 Patient Discontinuation  
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include but are not limited to the following: 
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study 
• Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient 
• Patient non-compliance 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain inform ation on patients who withdraw from the 
study.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
4.6.2 Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients must discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following: 
• Pregnancy 
• Disease progression 
• Unacceptable toxicity 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced. 
4.6.3 Conditions for Terminating the Study  
Both the Sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate their participation in the study under the circumstances agreed upon in the site agreement.  Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual basis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, the Sponsor and investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interest. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
84/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
GDC-0032 is not approved and is currently in early clinical development.  Thus, the 
entire safety profile is not known at this ti me.  Human experience is currently limited.  
The following information is based on results from ongoing clinical studies .  The safety 
plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below.  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities (see Section 5.3.5.3), defined 
and graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0.  General safety assessment s will in
clude 
serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistry and blood counts.  All serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be reported in an expedited fashion, via fax to Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) safety department and also captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  In addition, the Sponsor and the investigators will review and evaluate observed adverse events on a regular basis. 
All adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose of 
study treatment or until the end of study visit, whichever occurs later.  Patients who have an ongoing study treatment-related adverse event upon study completion or at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline 
grade, the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be attributed by the investigator to study drug or to another 
clearly identified etiology by the investigator (see Table 9).  
Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, a
s well as measures intended to 
avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.  
5.1.1 Management of Specifi c Adverse Events of GDC-0032  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.  
Additional guidelines are provided in the subsec
tions below.  
Due to the approximately 40-hour half-life for GDC-0032, investigators should consider holding GDC-0032 for certain Grade 2 toxicities until the adverse event resolves to Grade ≤
 1 as discussed below (e.g., stomatitis/mucositis, colitis, rash, diarrhea, 
pneumonitis).  Certain toxicities can occur within 1 −2 weeks of holding or discontinuing 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
85/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 GDC-0032 drug (e.g., pneumonitis, colitis, rash).  In these cases, the adverse event 
eventually resolves.  Investigators should follow management guidelines and dose 
modifications for toxicities as described below, including administration of topical or systemic corticosteroids as appropriate.   
Table 1 Overall Dose Modification Guideline for GDC-0032-Related 
Adverse Events 
 GDC-0032 
Starting dose 4 mg at 5 days on/2 days off 
First reduction 2 mg at 5 days on/2 days off  
Second reduction  2 mg at 3 days on/4 days off a 
 a If the patient continues to experience specified drug-related adverse 
events after the second dose redu ction, the treatment should be 
discontinued. 
 
5.1.1.1 Management of Hyperglycemia 
Metformin is the first antihyperglycemic medica tion of choice because of the lower risk of 
hypoglycemia with this agent.  Because metformin in some patients may also cause 
diarrhea and not be well tolerated, other antihyperglycemic medications such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride, glipizide) can be used.  Extra caution should be used with other drugs such as sulfonylureas because of the increased risk for hypoglycemia with these agents.  Consultation with an endocrinologist can be helpful in managing hyperglycemia.   
Specific dose modification and management gui delines for hyperglycemia are provided 
in Table 2.

60 mg daily followed by a taper (e.g., 60 mg  × 2 days, 40 mg  × 2 days, 20 mg  × 2 days, 
etc.). 
 
5.1.1.4 Management of G astrointestinal Toxicity 
5.1.1.4.1 Management of Diarrhea and Colitis 
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the 
investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Weekly patient contact (e.g., 
telephone call) for all events of diarrhea Grades 
≥ 1 is recommended to closely follow 
until resolution of symptoms.   Gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed per 
protocol guidelines and institutional standard of  care.  For example, prompt management 
of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the 
approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold 
GDC-0032 /placebo  for Grade ≥ 2 diarrhea.     
Steroid-responsive diarrhea and colitis have been difficult to distinguish in patients 
treated with GDC-0032.  All cases of colitis have been reversible with corticosteroid treatment.  Prompt initiation of corticosteroids for persistent diarrhea despite antidiarrheal treatment can decrease the severity of the diarrhea and prevent the need 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
89/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 for hospitalizations.  Patients who develop severe steroid-responsive diarrhea usually 
have been on GDC-0032 treatment for at least 2 months, with an average onset between 4 and 6 months of treatment.  A stool culture is helpful in identifying concurrent infections, and patients have been successfully treated with concurrent steroids and appropriate antibiotics if needed.  
If a patient is being treated with corticosteroids, total parenteral nutrition is discouraged 
as this increases the risk for severe hyperglycemia.  Discontinuation of nonsteroidal inflammatory medications or other medica tions that exacerbate colitis are also 
recommended during colitis episodes.   
Perforated duodenal ulcer has been observed in 2 patients (one patient at 6 mg  capsule  
in combination with letrozole; another patient at 6 mg capsule in combination with 
fulvestrant).  Appropriate caution should be taken with the administration of medications 
such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids that can increase the risk of gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal perforation. 
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea and colitis are 
provided in Table 5.  
Table 5 GDC-0032 Dose Modificati on and Management Guidelines 
for Diarrhea and Colitis 
Grade of Diarrhea Dose Modification and Management Guidelines  
Grade 1 • Manage per institutional standa rd of care that includes 
antidiarrheals.a 
• For persistent Grade 1 diarrhea occurring after Cycle 2, 
recommend evaluation for infectious causes via stool culture.b  
For noninfectious diarrhea, consider colonoscopy to evaluate for 
colitis. 
• For any grade of diarrhea ( ≥1), contact patient at least weekly 
to monitor until resolution of symptoms.   If symptoms persist 
beyond 2 weeks despite antidiarrheal treatment (e.g., loperamide), escalate to Grade 2 management. 
Grade 2 • Hold GDC-0032 /placebo  and initially manage with antidiarrheals.a 
• Obtain stool culture for infectious workup. b  Infections (e.g., 
Clostridium difficile, enteric bacteria, CMV) should be treated with the appropriate antibiotic. 
• For persistent Grade 2 non-infectious diarrhea lasting longer 
than 48 hours despite treatment with antidiarrheals, treat with 
oral corticosteroids (20 −40 mg prednisone QD starting dose with 
taper) or budesonide 9 mg PO QD. 
• If Grade 2 diarrhea occurred after Cycle 2, was a recurrent 
episode, or improved with corticosteroid treatment, resume GDC-0032 /placebo  treatment at one dose level lower upon 
improvement to Grade ≤ 1 and after completion of corticosteroid 
treatment.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
90/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Grade of Diarrhea Dose Modification and Management Guidelines  
• If Grade 2 diarrhea occurred before Cycle 2, did not require 
corticosteroid treatment, and was an initial episode, resume 
GDC-0032 /placebo  treatment at the same dose upon 
improvement to Grade ≤ 1.  
• For Grade 2 colitis, resume GDC-0032 /placebo  treatment at one 
dose level lower upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1 and after 
completion of corticosteroid treatment. 
• If Grade 2 diarrhea does not improve after 48 hours of 
corticosteroid treatment, a colonoscopy is recommended to 
evaluate for other causes of diarrhea (e.g., CMV colitis). 
Grade 3 (first 
episode)  • Hold GDC-0032 /placebo  and initially treat  with antidiarrheals. a   
• Obtain stool culture for infectious workup. b 
• For G3 diarrhea or colitis, treat with systemic corticosteroids 
(prednisone 60  − 80 mg QD equivalent or solumedrol 16 −20 mg 
IV q8hr to start).  Can increase steroid dosage if diarrhea does 
not improve. 
• Concurrent infections (e.g., Clos tridium difficile, enteric bacteria, 
CMV) should be treated with the appropriate antibiotic. 
• For patients who do not improve upon 48 hours of corticosteroid 
treatment, a colonoscopy is recommended to evaluate for other causes of diarrhea (e.g., CMV colitis).  
• If diarrhea or colitis improves to Grade ≤ 1 and upon completion 
of any steroid taper or antibiotic treatment, resume GDC-0032 /placebo  treatment at one dose level lower. 
Grade 3 (recurrent) 
or Grade 4 • Permanently discontinue GDC-0032 /placebo .   
• Workup and treatment algorithm as for Grade 3 (first episode). 
• If patient receiving endocrine therapy, upon recovery to 
Grade  ≤  1, can resume endocrine therapy alone.   
CMV  = cytomegalovirus; IV  = intravenous;  PO  = oral; QD  = once daily; q8hr  = every 8 hours; 
SOC  = standard of care. 
a Suggested antidiarrheals include the followin g: loperamide (initial: 4 mg, followed by 
2 mg after each loose stool, up to 16 mg/day); diphenoxylate and atropine (Diphenoxylate 5 mg 4 times/day until cont rol achieved [maximum:  20 mg/day], then 
reduce dose as needed; some patients may be controlled on doses of 5 mg/day; tincture 
of opium (6 mg of undiluted opium tincture [10 mg/mL]) 4 times daily. 
b Non-infectious diarrhea can be diagnosed by st ool culture with workup for various enteric 
bacteria and C. difficile. Fecal calprotectin is  a possible marker for bowel inflammation.  
Blood-based CMV PCR test can also be used to detect CMV infection. 
 
5.1.1.4.2 Management of Stom atitis and Oral Mucositis 
Aggressive mouth care for oral mucositis and stomatitis with mouthwash formulations 
(e.g., combinations of local anesthetic, antihistamine, corticosteroid, antacid, antifungal and/or antibiotics) may also be helpful in managing symptoms, and it is recommended that these are implemented with early signs of dry mouth, Grade 1 mucositis, or Grade 1 stomatitis (see Table 6).  Avoidance of spicy foods may also be helpful.

Stomatitis/Mucositis GDC-0032 /placebo  
All grades • Aggressive mouth care that includes mouthwash 
formulations (e.g., combinations of local anesthetic, antihistamine, corticosteroid, antacid, antifungal and/or 
antibiotics)  
• Diet management (e.g., avoidance of spicy foods) 
Grade 1 • Monitor symptoms and initiate management (see above). 
Re-evaluate within 48  − 72 hours.   
Grade 2 • Hold GDC-0032 /placebo  and manage until Grade  ≤ 1.   
• Restart GDC-0032 /placebo  at the same dose.   
• If Grade 2 stomatitis/oral mucositis recurs, hold 
GDC-0032 /placebo  until Grade  ≤ 1.  Restart 
GDC-0032 /placebo  at the next lower dose. 
Grade 3 • Hold GDC-0032 /placebo  and manage until Grade  ≤ 1.  
Restart GDC-0032/placebo at the next lower dose.  
For Grade 3 event that was not adequately managed upon 
initial presentation, consider restarting at same dose upon 
discussion with Medical Monitor.   
Grade 4 • Permanently discontinue GDC-0032/placebo . 
 
5.1.2 Management of Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
Some patients have experienced elevations of liver function tests (e.g., AST or ALT). 
Patients will be monitored throughout the study treatment for changes in liver function 
tests.  Given the potential for hepatic toxicity, all patients must have adequate liver 
function as manifested by measurements of serum bilirubin, hepatic transaminases, and 
alkaline phosphatase for initial and continued dosing.  Separate criteria for eligibility, 
continued dosing, and DLT are given for patients with hepatic metastases and Grade 2 
hepatic transaminase and/or alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline to allow safety 
testing to be adequately assessed in this patient group.   
For new abnormal liver function tests (e.g., elevated AST or ALT), a standard clinical 
work-up to understand the etiology of the abnormality should take place per local 
guidelines.  In many cases, elevated liver function tests may be a result of liver 
metastases, concomitant medications, or biliary obstruction.  Dose modifications for 
elevated liver function tests are described in Table 7.  
5.1.3 Management of Asymptomatic Lipase and/or Amylase 
Elevations  
Some patients treated with GDC-0032 have experienced asymptomatic lipase and/or 
amylase elevations in blood tests without any clinical or radiographic symptoms of 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
92/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 pancreatitis or another clear etiology for the abnormal laboratory values.  Upon 
discussion with the Medical Monitor and after a risk-benefit assessment, investigators 
can consider continuing GDC-0032 therapy in such patients at the same dose or one 
dose level lower.  Investigators should have a low threshold for interrupting GDC-0032 
for any concerning clinical gastrointestinal toxicities. 
5.1.4 Management of Other Clin ically Significant Adverse Events  
See Table 7 for the dose modifications for other clinically significant adverse events. 
Table 7 GDC-0032 Dose Delay and Mo dification Guidelines for Other 
Clinically Significant Adverse Events 
Grade GDC-0032 /placebo  
Grade 3:  first event • Hold GDC-0032 /placebo until Grade ≤ 1.  
• Consider restarting at next lower dose. 
Grade 3:  recurrent • Hold GDC-0032 /placebo until Grade ≤ 1. 
Grade 4:  non-life-threatening • Restart at next lower dose. 
Grade 4:  life-threatening • Permanently discontinue GDC-0032 /placebo .  
 
5.1.5 General Guidance for Dose Modifications and Delays for 
Letrozole  
The letrozole dose level cannot be modified.  In general, the investigator can consider 
continuing letrozole if it is not thought to be letrozole-related.   
All dose modifications should be based on the adverse event requiring the greatest 
modification and should be properly documented in the source documents. 
5.1.6 Management of Increases in QT Interval  
Study drug should be discontinued in patients who develop any of the following, unless there is a clear alternative cause for the changes: 
1. Sustained (at least two ECG measurements >
 30 minutes apart) QTcF that is 
> 500 msec and > 60 msec longer than the baseline value 
2. Sustained absolute QTcF that is > 515 msec  
3. An episode of torsades de pointes or a new ECG finding of clinical concern 
 
Of note, if there is a new intraventricular conduction block, the increase in QRS complex 
duration should be subtracted from the QTcF change, as this represents an increase in QTcF unrelated to alterations in repolarization.  Also of note, it is not uncommon to record arrhythmias such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, pauses, or atrial fibrillation in healthy volunteers receiving placebo during 
periods of extended ECG monitoring.  Therefore, it is critical that expert electrophysiologic advice be sought to conf irm any ECG changes and to ascertain the 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
93/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 likelihood of a drug-induced arrhythmia versus the background occurrence of this 
arrhythmia.  In such a situation, saving all available ECG data is highly suggested. 
Management of patients with sustained QTcF prolongation should include close 
monitoring, with ECGs repeated at least hourly until two successive ECGs show resolution of the findings, correction of any electrolyte abnormalities, and possible discontinuation of other concomitant medications that are known to prolong the QT interval.  Consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is recommended, to help in the management of such patients. 
In rare circumstances, it may be acceptable to resume study drug, at a lower dose, 
provided that any ECG abnormalities have resolved and the patient is appropriately monitored.  Clinical judgment should be applied. 
5.1.7 Safety Monitoring for Letrozole  
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal AI indicated for first line treatment of hormone receptor positive, locally advanced, or metastatic  breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  
Letrozole is also indicated for adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal hormone-receptor positive patients and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following anti-estrogen therapy. 
The most frequently reported adverse events in a first line, breast cancer clinical trial 
with letrozole were bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, arthralgia, and dyspnea.  Clinically significant adverse events also include bone effects (osteoporosis and bone fractures) and hypercholesterolemia.  Discontinuations for adverse events other than progression of tumor occurred in 2% of patients on letrozole.  Refer to the U.S. letrozole Package Insert or SmPC for additional information.   
There are no expected significant overlapping toxicities between letrozole and 
GDC-0032. Routine safety monitoring and periodic laboratory tests for the letrozole and GDC-0032 combination will occur throughout the study. 
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS 
Safety assessments will consist of monito ring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest; measurement of protocol-specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
94/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 5.2.1 Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical  investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.9  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to ABCSG)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
95/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to ABCSG safety 
department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special In terest (Immediately Reportable to 
ABCSG)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to 
ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest 
for this study include the following: 
• 
Grade 4 hyperglycemia 
• Grade ≥ 3 symptomatic hyperglycemia 
• Grade ≥ 2 colitis or enterocolitis  
• Grade ≥ 2 diarrhea  
• Grade ≥ 1 diarrhea for > 2 weeks after following medical management guidelines in 
Section 5.1.1.4  
• Grade ≥ 3 rash 
• Grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis  
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver inju ry that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s 
law (see Section 5.3.5.5) 
• Suspected tr ansmission
 of an infectious agent by the study drug   
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and additionally reported to ABCSG 
safety department in case they fulfill t
he criteria for expedited reported in accordance 
with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4− Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event CRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriou
sness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3), and causality (se
e Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study 
drug, will be reported until 30 days  after the last dose of study drug or until the end of 
study visit, whichever occurs later.  After this period, investigators should report any 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
96/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 deaths, serious adverse events, or other adv erse events of concern deemed related to 
prior study drug treatment or study procedures (Section 5.6). 
5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE, v4.0 will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 8 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE. 
Table 8 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale 
Grade Severity 
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 
3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization indicated; disabling; or 
limiting self-care activities of daily living b,c

NCI CTCAE  = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v 4.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b Examples of self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dr essing and undressing, 
feeding one's self, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who 
are not bedridden. 
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medi cal event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions),  per the definition of serious 
adverse even t in Section 5.2.2
. 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions
), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
97/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 9): 
• Temporal relationship of  event onset to the initiat
ion of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study • Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
Table 9 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO Adverse events will be consid ered related, unless they fulf ill the criteria as specified 
below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
98/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently establishe d, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by one adverse event 
report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
5.3.5.1 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
5.3.5.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  The progression (increase and decrease) of an adverse event must be documented in the Adverse Event eCRF.   
The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated 
to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens.  If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
99/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 5.3.5.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in  deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 times the ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
5.3.5.4 Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
100/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
5.3.5.5 Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests as Hy’s Law 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) 
and reported to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learnin g of the event), either as se
rious adverse event or an adverse event of 
special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
5.3.5.6 Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to ABCSG safety department (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This includes de 
ath attributed to progression of breast cancer. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
101/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be 
replaced by the established cause of death. 
5.3.5.7 Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only  if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”). 
5.3.5.8 Hospitalization or  Prolonged Hospitalization 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalizat ion (i.e., in-patient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2), except as outlined 
below.   
The following hospitalization scenar ios are not
 considered to be adverse events: 
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study 
• Hospitalization for respite care • Planned hospitalization required by the protocol for breast cancer surgery  
• Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
• The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during 
the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the 
expected normal progression of the disease 
• The patient has not suffered an adverse event 
• Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer 
• Hospitalization for outpatient care outside of normal clinic operating hours that is 
required per protocol or per local standard of care 
• Hospitalization for protocol mandated biopsies 
 
5.3.5.9 Adverse Events Asso ciated with an Overdose 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
102/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 5.3.5.10 Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any patient 
responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO questionnaires, site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the patient's medical record per site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an adverse event, it will be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO ABCSG 
Certain events require immediate reporting to  allow ABCSG safety department to take 
appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report such events to ABCSG safety department immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to ABCSG safety department within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events 
• Adverse events of special interest  (see Section 5.2.3)  
• Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report new significant follo w-up information for the
se events to 
ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming 
aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results • Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery 
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For reports of serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, 
investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fax. In addition the serious adverse event and adverse event of special interest information will be captured in the EDC system.   
Worldwide Sites: ABCSG safety department  
Fax No.: +43 1 409 09 90 
Relevant follow-up information should be s ubmitted to ABCSG safety department as 
soon as it becomes available and/or upon request. 
5.5 FOLLOW-UP OF PATIEN TS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.5.1 Investigator Follow-Up  
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.   With regard to the adverse event of 
special interest of diarrhea, it is recommend ed that investigators follow every adverse 
event of 
≥ Grade 1 diarrhea with weekly patient contacts (e.g., telephone calls) and 
follow up until resolution.  Cases that do not resolve within 1 −2 weeks should be 
aggressively managed per protocol recommend ations for gastrointestinal toxicities.  
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification (SDV).  For follow-up reports of  serious adverse events and adverse events 
of special interest, investigators should record all follow up information immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fax. In addition the serious adverse event and adverse event of special interest follow-up information will be captured in the EDC system.  If, after follow-up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and paper Serious Adverse Event form, if applicable.   
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome, 
and they should be reported according to the instructions provided in Section 5.4. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
104/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 5.5.2 Sponsor Follow-Up  
For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor and/or ABCSG safety department or a designee may follow up by telephone, 
fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 
5.6 POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
At the time of study completion or study discontinuation, the investigator should instruct each patient to report to the investigator any subsequent adverse events that the patient’s personal physician believes could be related to prior study drug treatment or study procedures.   
The investigator is not required to actively monitor patients for adverse events after the 
end of the adverse event reporting period (30 days after the last dose of study drug).  However, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any death, other serious adverse event, or adv erse event of special interest occurring 
after the end of the adverse event reporting period, regardless of causality.  The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.
 
The investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, 
either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators  (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of 
Investigators”). 
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events us ing the following reference documents: 
• GDC-0032 Investigator's Brochure
  
• Local prescribing information for letrozole SmPC 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
105/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. 
An iDMC will monitor the incidence of the above-listed anticipated events during the 
study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities. 
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization.  Final analysis will be performed after last patient, last visit (LPLV) and subsequent data cleaning, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated by randomization. 
Safety analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization and 
received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
This study is designed for testing the effect of GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 
330 patients in total.  Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available 
(unknown) for approximately 10% of the patients and the prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant 
is 40%, there will be approximately 120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, 
there might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT 
cohort, which may reduce the statistical pow er in this cohort.  To ensure the study 
provides sufficient statistical power even when the treatment assignment is imbalanced, 
the sample size was calculated based on a conservative scenario by assuming that the treatment assignment imbalance in PIK3CA  MT is 40% versus 60%.  The sample size 
was calculated based on a chi²-test using continuity correction ( Ury and Fleiss 1980 ). 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20% for ea ch a 
nalysis 
population , we use a two-sided significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary 
endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable for the MRI ORR, approximately 
300 enrolled patients and 108 patients in the PIK3CA  MT cohort will be evaluable for 
analyses.  This sample size allows us to detect an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
106/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005 ; Ellis and Ma 2007 ) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power 
and 16% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is 
approximatel
y 15%. 
Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to 
detect an absolute percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005 ; Ellis and Ma 2007 ) in 
the PIK3CA MT cohort at the 4% two-sided significance level.  The minima
l detectable 
difference for pCR rate is approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more 
substantial treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or 
there is an increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size 
may be increased to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  MT.   
6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY 
Enrollment, study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be summarized overall and by treatment arm.  The incidence of study treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression will be tabulated. 
6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPARABILITY 
Demographic variables, stratification factors, and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment arm. 
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the ITT population; that is, all randomized patients will be included in the analyses, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are (1) tumor ORR, assessed by modified RECIST criteria by breast MRI (centrally assessed) and (2) the rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug. 
The tumor ORR will be calculated by treatment arm in all enrolled population and in 
PIK3CA MT population .  Within each population, the ORR for the two treatment arms will 
be compared at a two-sided alpha of 16% using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status.  The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR.  
The two alpha values account for a family-wise type I error rate of 20%  for each analysis 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
107/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 population .  Patients with early study termi nation and hence missing efficacy outcome 
will be considered as non-responders. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatment, assessed by modified RECIST 
criteria by breast MRI (centrally assessed) in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug in 
PIK3CA  WT patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be 
analyzed analogue to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by PIK3CA  mutation status (centrally assessed): 
• ORR using modified RECIST criteria by the following methods:  clinical breast 
examination, mammography, and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) 
• Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to 
surgery (centrally assessed) 
• PEPI score (centrally derived) • Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by breast 
MRI 
• Evaluation of different definitions of pCR including the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and 
b) ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR) 
 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be compared 
between the two treatment arms within each population based on appropriate statistical analyses:  ORR will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by regression analyses, adjusted for tumor size and nodal status.  All secondary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES 
Safety analyses will include all patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory 
test results, changes in vital signs, and letrozole and GDC-0032 exposure. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
108/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Verbatim descriptions of adverse events will be mapped to thesaurus terms.  Adverse 
event data will be listed by study site, tr eatment arm, patient number, and study day, 
severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, and action taken with the study treatments.  Events occurring on or after treatment on Day 1 of Week 1 will be summarized by thesaurus term, appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE, v4.0 grade.  Serious adverse events, including deaths, will be listed separately and will be summarized.  
Relevant laboratory and vital sign (heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) data will 
be displayed by time, with NCI CTCAE, v4.0 Grade 3 and 4 values identified, where appropriate.  Additionally, all laboratory data will be summarized in tables by NCI CTCAE, v4.0 grade. 
6.6 PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSES   
Ki67 biomarker analyses will include patients with at least one predose and one postdose biomarker assessment, with patients grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
6.7 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES   
Individual C max and trough plasma concentrations (C min) of GDC-0032 and letrozole from 
all patients enrolled will be reported.  Mean of trough plasma concentrations of GDC-0032 and letrozole will be tabulated.  The population pharmacokinetics of letrozole and GDC-0032 in this study will be compared with historical single-agent pharmacokinetics to assess the potential DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole in this population.   
Additional PK analyses on metabolites of GDC-0032, letrozole, and/or other concomitant 
medications may be conducted as appropriate. 
6.8 PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME ANALYSES  
Patient-reported outcomes of breast cancer symptoms, patient functioning, and HRQoL will be assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified Breast Cancer module 
(QLQ-BR23)  
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median and range) of linear transformed scores will be reported for all the items and subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, and the modified QLQ-BR23 according to the EORTC scoring manual guidelines for each assessment time point.  The mean change of the linear transformed scores from baseline (and 95% CI using the normal approximation) will also be assessed.  Line charts depicting the mean changes (and standard errors) of items and subscales over time will be provided for each treatment arm from the baseline assessment. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
109/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the 
final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  
Completion and compliance rates will be summarized at each timepoint by treatment 
arm with reasons for missing data.  Only patients with a baseline assessment and at least one post-treatment assessment will be included in the analyses.  The number and proportion of patients who improved, worsened, or remained stable for all of the symptom and functional domains, global QoL, and single items of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 will be summarized. 
6.9 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES   
Additional details on analyses will be specified in the SAP. 
6.10 INTERIM ANALYSES   
The iDMC will conduct interim analyses to review the unblinded safety data after the first 20 patients have either 1) finished the 30-day follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been in the study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the surgery), whichever occurs first.  All available information of all enrolled patients with all available assessments at the respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.  In addition, the iDMC or the Medical Monitor may request additional ad hoc meetings of the iDMC at any time during the study to review safety data. 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ABCSG will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, ABCSG and/or all involved clinical research associat es (CRAs) will request data clarification from 
the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
ABCSG will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data.  The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including review of the ABC SG’s data management plan and corresponding 
specifications.  Data will be transferred electronically from ABCSG to the Sponsor at the end of the study and whenever otherwise contractually agreed, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at ABCSG and  records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the ABCSG’s standard procedures. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
110/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Data from paper PRO questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by site staff. 
Original PRO questionnaires will be kept in the patient’s medical record as source documentation. 
7.2 DATA(BASE) MANAGEMENT 
ABCSG Clinical Data Management will check all e-forms for plausibility and consistency by automatic edit checks and manual data review according to study-specific data management plan (DMP).  If necessary, web-based data queries (data clarification requests [DCRs]) will be generated and subsequently visible for the investigators, dedicated site staff, responsible CRAs, and responsible ABCSG staff.  For those eCRFs which pass all verification procedures and are regarded as correct and complete, they will be frozen subsequently by ABCSG c linical data management.  Consequently, no 
further data entries or changes on frozen eCRFs are possible.  The status of frozen eCRFs is flagged by the specific icon. 
Clinical Data Management ensures that the database is corrected for the following eCRF 
issues without immediate notification to site staff (self-evident corrections).  Notification of site staff is provided via a specific report after final data cleaning procedures and before final data confirmation by the investigator or a designee: 
• misspellings/typing errors that do not change the meaning of the word 
• location of data recorded at an incorrect variable field or eForm (e.g., moving lab 
data from general comments to the appropriate lab table) 
• standard time to 24-hour clock 
• correction of date format, if required (dd/mm/yyyy) 
• if equivalent units of terms are recorded instead of the acceptable ABCSG standard • data changes due to plausibility checks and eCRF content (e.g., combination of 
several variables and/or eCRFs) 
 
All data management workflows are described in detail in the relevant SOPs and 
working instructions of ABCSG. 
7.3 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed using the Clinical Data Management System “MACRO,” a Web-interface DATAPORT.  Sites will receive training by the responsible CRAs and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion (web data entry).   
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff in a timely manner, 
usually within 2 weeks after the patient visit.  Electronic CRFs should be reviewed and respective data confirmation eCRF should be electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee at the end of the study.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
111/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a storage medium (compact disc [CD], digital video disk [DVD] etc.) 
that must be kept with the study records.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the storage medium is required. 
7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors (CRAs) will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigators a nd institut
ions must provide the Sponsor/CRAs 
direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
112/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 7.6 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of 
IMP, including eCRFs, PRO data (if applicable), ICFs, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer.  After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location. 
8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
This study will be conducted in full conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for GCP and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual.  The study will comply with the requirements of the ICH E2A guideline (Clinical Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). Studies conducted in the United States or under a U.S. Investigational New Drug (IND) application will comply with U.S. FDA regulations and applicable local, state, and federal laws.  Studies conducted in the European Union/European Economic Area will comply with the E.U. Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC). 
8.2 INFORMED CONSENT 
The Sponsor’s sample ICF (and ancillary sample ICFs) will be provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample ICFs or any alternate cons ent forms proposed by the site (collectively, 
the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC submission.  The final IRB/EC-approved consent forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements. 
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the consent for optional donation 
of remaining samples for the clinical repository.  Samples stored in the clinical repository 
may be used for future exploratory research.  Patients will be told that they are free to 
refuse to donate their remaining samples to the clinical repository.  If patients choose to 
donate remaining samples, they may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any 
reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be stored in the clinical repository. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
113/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 The ICFs must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative before participation in the study.  The case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  
The eCRF contains a section to document whether the patient has signed the ICF or not. 
The ICFs should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures or when 
new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate.  The final revised IRB/EC-approved consent forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes. 
Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of the consent forms (or to a 
significant new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study.  For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised consent forms for continued participation in the study. 
For patients not qualified or incapable of giving legal consent, written consent must be 
obtained from the legally acceptable representat ive. In the case where both the patient 
and his/her legally acceptable representativ e are unable to read, an impartial witness 
should be present during the entire informed consent discussion.  After the patient and representative have orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature on the form will attest that the information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood.  The investigator or designee must also explain that the patients are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason. 
A copy of each signed ICF must be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative.  All signed and dated ICFs must remain in each patient’s study file or in the site file and must be ava ilable for verification by study monitors at any 
time. 
For sites in the United States, each ICF may also include patient authorization to allow 
use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  If the site utilizes a separate authorization form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies. 
8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR ETHICS COMMITTEE 
This protocol, the ICFs, any information to be given to the patient, and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the sponsor, the affiliated 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
114/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 groups, or contract research organizations (CROs) according to the applicable local laws 
and regulations, if applicable by the Principal Investigator, and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.  
The Sponsor, affiliated groups, or CROs are responsible for providing written summaries 
of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the local IRB/EC.  The Sponsor, affiliated groups, or CROs are also  responsible for promptly informing the 
IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see Section 9.6). 
In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse eve
nts to the Sponsor, 
investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with local health authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and archived in the site’s study file.  
8.4 DATA PRIVACY 
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the study through assignment of a unique identif ication number.  This means that patient 
names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location. 
Patient medical information obtained by th is study is confidential and may only be 
disclosed to third parties as permitted by the ICF (or separate authorization for use and 
disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by local law. 
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare, for treatment purposes, provided the patient has given consent. 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of the U.S. FDA and other national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate.  The patient will have to consent to such access by signing the informed consent form. 
8.5 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
115/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study (i.e., LPLV). 
9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, MONITORING, AND 
ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented, including but  not limited to the protocol, protocol 
amendments, ICFs, and documentation of IRB/ EC and governmental (health authorities) 
approval.  In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive the patient data, which includes an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data. 
9.2 ON SITE QUALITY CONTROL (MONITORING) 
During the study, CRAs will visit their respective sites on a regular basis as outlined in the study specific monitoring plan (MP) and all other relevant specifications, in order to guarantee adherence to the protocol and to the principles of GCP and to check for the progress of enrolment, adequate storage conditions of IMP and adequate drug dispensing and accounting records.  
CRAs will review documented data in the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy 
according to the study-specific MP, subsequently flag all reviewed pages with a specific mark (“SDV done”) within the EDC system “MACRO,” Web-interface DATAPORT, developed by   The CRAs will raise data queries (“DCRs”) in cases of 
missing source data or incorrect data entries.  Immediately after electronic issue of the queries, they become visible to the investigator, the clinical data managers, and the ABCSG clinical safety officers (“raised  DCRs”).  CRAs and/or clinical data managers 
and/or ABCSG clinical safety officers will follow up with trial site personnel until final data query resolution. 
9.3 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
The investigator should document and expl ain any deviations from the approved 
protocol.  The investigator should prompt ly report any deviations that might impact 
patient safety and data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC policies and procedures. 
9.4 SITE INSPECTIONS 
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for inspection of study data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will permit international and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 

 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
116/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 9.5 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE 
This trial will be sponsored by Genent ech and will be managed by Genentech in 
collaboration with the Breast International Group (BIG), ABCSG, and  the SOLTI Breast 
Cancer Research Group.  Genentech in collaboration with BIG, ABCSG, and SOLTI will 
provide clinical operations management, data management, and medical monitoring.  
Approximately 110 U.S. and international site s will participate to enroll approximately 
330 patients. 
An iDMC will be in place throughout the study  and will provide oversight of safety and 
efficacy analyses (see Section 3.1.2). 
After written informed consent has been obtained, the study site will obtai n the patien
t’s 
screening number from the IxRS system.  Once eligibility has been established, the 
patient will be enrolled, and the study site will obtain the patient’s identification number from the IxRS.  Once results of the tissue analysis are made available, the patient will be randomized, and the site will obtain the bli nded treatment assignment from the IxRS.  
The IxRS will manage GDC-0032/placebo drug inventory at all sites and letrozole drug inventory at all study sites outside the United States.  IxRS will be required to randomize patients, to monitor enrollment and patient status, and to manage study treatment requests and shipments.  
Patient data will be recorded via an electronic data capture (EDC) system from  
( , United Kingdom), which will be managed by ABCSG using eCRFs (see Section 7.2).   
Central laboratories, including Genentech and Genentech collaborators, will be used for 
PIK3CA  
mutation detection, Ki67, and PTEN status and/or will provide kits for PK, 
pharmacogenomic, tissue, whole blood, and plasma sample analyses to be conducted at central laboratories, Genentech, or Genentech collaborators. 
An independent radiologic review facility will be used for the purpose of collecting and 
assessing the quality of patient scans throughout the trial.  The review facility will retain 
copies of scans for centralized assessments of MRI-related endpoints .   
9.6 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
Any protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor.  Protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. 
Approval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authorities (as locally 
required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients or changes that involve logistical or administrative aspects only (e.g., change in Medical Monitor or contact information).

Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer 
Conventional response criteria may not be ideal for the assessment of response in the 
setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.  Therefore, RECIST 1.1 criteria have been modified to specifically address assessment of primary breast lesions along with axillary lymph node disease, using a range of breast imaging modalities.  Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1
1 
are presented below, with modifications and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity.  For detailed information on the read methodology including how imaging data should be processed prior to reads, please refer to the Study Imaging Charter.  
 RECIST v1.1 Modified RECIST Early Breast 
Cancer Neoadjuvant Therapy 
Modalities CT as primary modality, 
ultrasound not 
recommended No CT; primary assessments by MRI; 
also assessments by ultrasound, 
mammography, and clinical exam  
Lymph nodes May be considered 
target lesions based on 
size criteria ( ≥ 15 mm in 
SAD) Only axillary lym ph nodes assessed; 
nodes that are considered abnormal on imaging (based on morphological factors including, but not limited to SAD) to be followed as non-target 
lesions 
Possibility of having only 
non-target disease Allowed Not allowed; primary breast lesions 
must be measurable by MRI 
CT  = computed tomography; MRI  = magnetic resonance imaging; SAD  = short axis dimension. 
 
BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  All baseline evaluations s hould be performed as close as possible to 
the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Method of Measurement  
According to RECIST 1.1 guidelines, MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting.  CT is currently the preferred modality for assessing metastatic disease, but should not be used in this focused setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.  Ultrasound, mammography, and clinical exam are all

130/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 common and useful modalities for assessing breast lesions, and will also be used to 
assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  Up to 
2 lesions in the breast may be identified as target lesions.   Per this protocol, target 
lesion #1 must be ≥ 2 cm and, if selected, target lesion #2 must be ≥ 10 mm.  A sum of 
the diameters of all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, 
and lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see 
below for more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment.  The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality.  If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment timepoint, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by imaging even if not in volved by tumor.  Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on 
imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as 
non-target lesions at baseline.   Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in 
the assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions

Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
131/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 should be followed qualitatively, as descr ibed below at each response assessment 
timepoint.   
Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged • Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum • Irregular margins or spiculations 
• Rim enhancement 
• Decreased echogenicity of cortex • Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.  While on study, all lesions 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.  
Appendix 3  
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
132/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is abl e to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.  
Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment.   When non-nodal lesions fragment, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
• All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) • PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension  
 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor.  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an 
Appendix 3

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
133/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.  A lesion identified during the 
study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

Table 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each protocol-specified timepoint for which a response assessment occurs.

PD Any Yes or no PD 
Any PD Yes or no PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR  = complete response; NE  = not evaluable; PD  = progressive disease; 
PR  = partial response; SD  = stable disease. 
 
Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response.  Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.

134/Protocol GO28888, Version 4 Special Notes on Response Assessment  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease as shown in Table 1.

Note: The T classification of the primary tumor is the same regar dless of whether it is based on clinical or pathologic criteri a, or both.  Size should 
be measured to the nearest millimeter.  If the tumor size is slig htly less than or greater than a cut-off for a given T classification, it is recommended 
that the size be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cut-o ff.  For example, a reported size of 1.1 mm is r eported as 1 mm, or a 
size of 2.01 cm is reported as 2 cm.  Designation should be made wi th the subscript "c" or "p" modi fier to indicate whether the  T classification was 
determined by clinical (physical examination or radiologic) or pathologic measurements, respectively.  In general, pathologic d etermination should 
take precedence over clinical determination of T size.

Correction of Predicted DL CO for Hemoglobin and Alveolar 
Volume 
All DL CO measurements will be obtained as per the American Thoracic Society and 
European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines ( MacIntyre et al. 2005).  
The predicted DL CO value should be corrected for both hemoglobin (H b) and alveolar 
volume (v a).   
Pulmonary function test laboratories that follow the ATS/ERS guidelines should be able 
to provide the value for DL CO, corrected for v a.  A single breath v a may be used to obtain 
DLCO, corrected for va.  Use the following equation to determine the predicted DL CO, 
corrected for H b and v a: 
Predicted DL CO, corrected for H b and v a = [DL CO, corrected for v a] × [1.7 ×  Hb / 
(9.38 +  Hb)] 
Use the formula below to determine the percentage of predicted DL CO value (now 
corrected both for H b and v a):  
% of predicted DL CO (corrected for H b and v a) = [actual DL CO / (predicted DL CO 
corrected for H b and v a)] × 100

Protocol GO28888, Version 3 2 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 3: 
RATIONALE 
Protocol GO28888 has been amended to include the following major changes: 
• GDC-0032 two-mg tablet formulation information has been added.  
• Information regarding the relative bioavailability of GDC-0032 capsules and tablets 
has been included.  In summary, the GDC-0032 tablet had a 1.5-fold higher drug 
exposure (area under the curve; AUC) in healthy volunteers as compared to the GDC-0032 capsule.  In this trial, 2-mg tablets instead of the 3-mg tablets originally 
proposed, will be provided and are expected to  have very similar drug exposure as 
the 3-mg capsules used in previous clinical trials with GDC-0032.     
• The requirement for taking GDC-0032 on an empty stomach has been removed.  
The drug exposure (AUC) for GDC-0032 in a healthy volunteer study was not 
affected by the consumption of a high-fat meal.   
• Management guidelines for adverse events of special interest have been updated. 
More detailed information on the dosage of recommended corticosteroids for 
diarrhea and colitis has been included.  In addition, extra language regarding 
caution with using steroids has been added.   
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.   This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITION OF TERMS 
The list of abbreviations has been updated to reflect changes to the protocol. 
PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where 
applicable. 
SECTION 1.1:  BACKGROUND ON THE PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-
KINASE PATHWAY 
In addition, the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numerous types of cancer by receptor 
tyrosine kinase signaling… and Inositol Polyphosphate 4- phosphatase type II (INPP4B), 
or RAS mutations…. 
SECTION 1.4:  BACKGROUND ON RE VERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE 
BY INHIBITING THE PI3K/MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, PI3K seems to play an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and may be
 is a viable therapeutic target. 
SECTION 1.5:  BACKGROUND ON NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN BREAST 
CANCER 
A meta-analysis of nine randomized studies… showed no difference in … distant 
disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy (Mauri et al. 2005). 
…meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 201 42). 
SECTION 1.6:  BACKGROUND ON GDC-0032 
Enhanced efficacy was demonstrated in combination with tamoxifen, another endocrine 
therapy used in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive advanced  breast cancer.   
SECTION 1.7.1:  Clinical Safety Data with GDC-0032  
As of 5 July 2013, a total of 144 patients have been treated with GDC-0032 capsules, in 
the Phase I/II PMT4979g study, either as single agent ( n = 90, 63%) or in combination 
with endocrine therapy ( n = 54, 37%). 
GDC 0032 is currently in Phase  I (Study  PMT4979g).  Study  PMT4979g is an open label, 
dose escalation trial using a 3  + 3 design to assess the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of GDC 0032 administered orally daily for 28  days to patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic solid t umors and in combination with endocrine therapy in 
ER+ breast cancers.   As of 5 July 2013, enrollment into the dose-escalation stage of 
Study PMT4979g had been completed with 34 patients enrolled at GDC-0032 doses 
with a range of  ranging from  3  to 16 mg daily…. As of the cutoff date, a total of 
53 patients have  had been enrolled in the 9-mg daily dosing expansion cohorts.

4%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase in the blood (3.7%), hyperglycemia (3.7  4%), 
hypokalemia (3.7  4%), increased lipase in the blood (3.7  4%), and papilloedema (3.7%) 
and stom atitis (3.7  4%). 
…Adverse events  assessed by the investigator as GDC-0032 related and of any grade 
that occurred in ≥  10% of the 27 patients and were assessed as related to GDC-0032 
were diarrhea (46  48%), hyperglycemia (32  33%), nausea (32  33%), decreased appetite 
(25 26%), fatigue (25  26%), rash (21  26%), stomatitis (21  22%), asthenia (18  19%), 
muscle spasms (14  15%), vomiting (14  15%), dysgeusia (11%), gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (11%) and mucosal inflammation (11%).  Study− drug related  Grade 3 and 4 
adverse events assessed by the investigator as related to GDC-0032 included 
hyperglycemia (14  15%)... 
SECTION 1.7.1.1:  Pre liminary Pharmacokinetics 
Preliminary data f rom a healthy volunteer study showed that the 3-mg GDC-0032 
tablet produces an estimated geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 196% (177.1  − 217.0) for 
Cmax and 152.2% (141.9  − 163.2) for AUC time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-inf) when compared 
with the 3-mg Phase I capsule.   For this reason, a new 2-mg tablet has been formulated 
to deliver GDC-0032 exposure  similar to the 3-mg ca psule formulation.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 5 The drug exposure (AUC) for GDC-0032 in a healthy volunteer study was minimally 
affected by the consumption of a high-fat meal.  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be taken 
without regard to the timing of the administration of food.  
SECTION 1.8:  STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
Nonclinical data support… endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive, 
advanced  breast cancer. 
As of 5 July 2013, efficacy data are available for 24 patients treated with GDC-0032 
capsules in combination with letrozole… 
SECTION 2.1:  EFFICACY OBJECTIVES 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-0032 with letr ozole plus placebo in terms of locally 
assessed ORR as measured by modified RE CIST criteria (Appendix 3 ) using the 
following methods… 
• Compare the centrally assessed  derived , preoperative endocrine prognostic index 
(PEPI) score upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus 
placebo. 
SECTION 3.1:  DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 6  4 mg (two 2-mg 
tablets)  or placebo on a 5  − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see 
Figure 5). 
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to 
dosing, at screening,  at Week 3  9, and prior to surgery. 
FIGURE 5:  Study Schema 
Figure 5 has been revised to reflect changes to the protocol.  
SECTION 3.1.1:  Surgery  
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both physician recommendation and 
final patient decision  the planned and actual surgical treatment  and final patient 
decision  should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
SECTION 3.1.2:  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
The IDMC will convene for an interim  review the unblinded  safety analysis to evaluate 
safety and pharmacokinetics  data after the first 20 patients have completed surgery and 
have had  either 1) finished the 30- days   of follow-up  visit after the surgery, or 2) been 
on study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the surgery), whichever occurs first .  The IDMC will create and review unblinded, 
pooled  summaries of the safety and available PK summaries (all interim analyses) …. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 6 The IDMC will share results from interim safe ty analyses with the study team.  The study 
team will share interim safety results with study investigators as needed for the conduct 
of the study and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issue s anticipated in 
this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, 
are outlined in the following sections.  
SECTION 3.3.1:  Rationale for Conduc ting the Study in the Neoadjuvant 
Setting  
Over the past 10 years, four major classes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, 
HER2-enriched, and basal-like) and a Normal Breast like group  have been identified and 
intensively studied… 
SECTION 3.3.2:  Rationale  for Patient Population  
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, produce  confirm 
a previously identified  pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to 
an upregulation of the pAKT, resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation 
through an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mediated feedback loop 
(Tabernero et al. 2009). 
SECTION 3.3.4.3:  Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine 
Prognostic Index Score  
In this trial, the PEPI score will be assessed  derived centrally. 
SECTION 3.3.7:  Rationale for GDC-0032 Dosage  
All patients received GDC-0032 in capsules. Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 
12, and 16 mg daily) were tested (see Section 1.7.1). 
In Study  PMT4979g, as of the 5  July 2013 data cutoff date, there were 87  safety 
evaluable patients treated w ith single agent GDC 0032 capsules  (3  − 16 mg daily).  A 
total of 97% of patients experienced at least one  adverse event per the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version  4 (NCI  CTCAE  v4.0).  
The most frequently repo rted adverse events  of any grade , occurring in ≥ 10% safety
evaluable patients regardless of causality, were diarrhea  (55%), fatigue  (49%), 
nausea  (47%), decreased  appetite (39%), hyperglycemia (38%), vomiting  (28%), 
dizziness (22%), rash  (22%), dyspnea (1 8%), hypokalemia (18%), pyrexia  (17%), cough 
(16%), anemia (13%), dehydration  (13%), headache (13%), stomatitis  (13%), AST 
increased (12%), mucosal inflammation (12%) and pruritis (10%).   
As of 5 July 2013, 54 patients have been treated with GDC 0032 caps ules in 
combination with endocrine therapy with either letrozole (Cohort E) or fulvestrant 
(Cohort  F) at either  6 mg or 9 mg dose levels.  No DLTs were observed during dose 
escalation in either Cohorts E or F.  Expansion cohorts at the 6 mg dose level were  
enrolled to obtain more safety data on long term tolerability.  Fifty (93%) of the 54 safety
evaluable patients experienced at least one adverse event that was assessed as related 
to GDC 0032.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 7 Of the 54 patients, 17 patients were treated with GDC 0032 capsules  plus letrozole. 
Adverse events of any grade  that occurred in ≥ 10% of patients that were assessed as 
related to GDC 0032 (6mg and 9mg) were diarrhea (67%), nausea (33%), fatigue (30%), 
rash (30%), hyperglycemia (26%), decreased appetite (26%), stoma titis (26%), 
dysgeusia (22%), mucosal inflammation (19%), asthenia (15%), vomiting (15%), pruritis 
(15%), muscle spasms (11%), dry skin (11%), and dry mouth (11%).  
SECTION 3.3.8:  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments  
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be asses sed evaluated to assess the biologic activity 
of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole. 
SECTION 3.4.1.2:  Secondary  Efficacy Outcome Measures 
• Compare the centrally assessed  derived PEPI score upon treatment with letrozole 
plus GDC-0032 with letrozole plus placebo 
SECTION 4.1.2:  Exclusion Criteria  
• Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease, like  uncontrolled 
hypertension… 
SECTION 4.3.1.1:  GDC-0032 and Placebo 
GDC-0032 is provided for use in clinical studies as a white, film-coated, 
immediate-release tablet formulation of 3  2 mg strength.  The tablet formulation consists 
of GDC 0032 active, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose 
sodium, magnesium stearate, and Opadry 2 white film coating.  All excipients used in the  
formulation are compendial (USP/NF/Ph. Eur/JP) grade with the exception of the film
coating.  The film coating consists of polyvinyl alcohol part hydrolyzed, titanium dioxide, 
polyethylene glycol 3350, and talc, and these ingredients are compendial.  
Placebo tablets will be identical in shape and color to the 3  2-mg tablets of GDC-0032 
and will be indistinguishable from the 3  2-mg tablets of GDC-0032.  The ingredients in 
the placebo tablets are identical to those in the 3  2-mg tablets of GDC-0032, except for 
the absence of GDC-0032 active. 
SECTION 4.3.2.1:  GDC-0032 and Placebo 
Patients will receive an oral, daily dose of 4 6 mg (two 2-mg tablets) GDC-0032 or 
placebo on a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off for a maximum of 16 weeks.  Patients will take GDC-0032 or placebo at the same time of day
 ± 2 hours… 
Unless otherwise instructed, GDC 0032 or placebo should be taken on an empty 
stomach (i.e., approximately 1 hour before or 2  hours after a meal).  
SECTION 4.3.2.2:  Letrozole 
Both GDC-0032 or placebo and le trozole should be taken together (in no particular 
order) at the same time each day ±  2 hours, unless otherwise instructed.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 8 SECTION 4.5.2:  Medical Hi story and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases…and all medications… used by 
the patient within 15  7 days prior to the screening visit. 
SECTION 4.5.3:  Physical Examination

SECTION 5.1.1.1:  Management of Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients who received GDC 0032 in the single
agent Phase  I study.   
Patients with diabetes requiring daily anti hyperglycemic medication or who have a 
fasting blood glucose level > 125 mg/dL will be excluded from the study.  HbA 1c and 
fasting glucose levels will be monitored at baseline, and additional monitoring  of fasting 
glucose levels during the study will be implemented, as  outlined in the schedule of 
assessments.   Patients should be instructed to report symptoms associated with 
hyperglycemia such as thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision.

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 9 SECTION 5.1.1.4.1  Management of Diarrhea  and Colitis 
Because of the approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold 
GDC-0032 for Grade ≥  2 diarrhea until it improves to Grade  ≤ 1.    
Steroid-responsive diarrhea and colitis have been difficult to distinguish in patients treated with GDC-0032.  All cases of colitis have been reversible with corticosteroid 
treatment.  Prompt initiation of corticosteroids for persistent diarrhea despite antidiarrheal treatment can decrease the severity of the diarrhea and prevent the need for hospitalizations.  Patients who develop severe steroid-responsive diarrhea usually 
have been on GDC-0032 treatment for at least 2 months, with an average onset between 4
 − 6 months of treatment.  A stool cultur e is helpful in identifying concurrent 
infections, and patients have been successfully treated with concurrent steroids and appropriate antibiotics if needed.  
If a patient is being treated with corticosteroids, total parenteral nutrition is 
discouraged as this increases the risk for severe hyperglycemia.  Discontinuation of nonsteroidal inflammatory medications or other medications that exacerbate colitis are also recommended during colitis episodes.   
Perforated duodenal ulcer has been observed in 2 patients (one patient at 6 mg in 
combination with letrozole; another patient at 6mg in combination with fulvestrant).  Appropriate caution should be taken with the administration of medications such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids, which can increase the risk of gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal perforation. 
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea and colitis are 
provided in Table 5. 
TABLE 6:  GDC-0032 Do se Modification and Management Guidelines 
for Diarrhea  and Colitis 
Table 6 has been revised to reflect changes to the protocol. 
SECTION  5.1.1.4.2:  Mana gement of Colitis  
Data as of October 2013 show an incidence rate for colitis of 6.2% (10/160) (1 at 16 mg; 
8 at 9 mg; 1 at 6 mg  + fulvestrant) with onset at approximately 100 days or longer after 
initiation of treatment with daily GDC 0032 dosing.  Some patients have developed 
Grade 2 or Grade 3 diarrhea, which is non responsive to anti diarrheal medication.  In 
some of these patients, a CT scan or colonoscopy has revealed colitis, which has 
resolved upon treatment with systemic corticosteroids.  
For persistent Grade  2 diarrhea that does not resolve or for Grade  ≥ 3 diarrhea, further 
evaluation should include colitis in the differential diagnosis with the appropriate work up 
(e.g.,  abdominal/ p elvis CT  scan, endoscopy with biopsy, stool cultures for 
cytomegalovirus, Clostridium difficile, and parasites).  Grade  ≥ 2 colitis should be 
managed by interruption of study treatment.  In addition, discontinuation of nonsteroidal 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 10 antiinflammatory medica tions or any other medications known to exacerbate colitis 
symptoms should be considered.  If noninfectious colitis is suspected, treatment with 
corticosteroids per institutional standard of care should be considered.  It is suggested 
that prednisone (for oral administration) or solumedrol  (for IV administration) are the 
corticosteroids of choice in the treatment of colitis.  For severe symptoms, prednisone 
60 mg or equivalent may be required to control initial symptoms, and the dose should  be 
gradually tap ered.  Lower doses of prednisone, oral budesonide, or mesalamine 
(or other 5 aminosalicyclic acid derivatives) may be considered for less severe cases of 
colitis.  
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for colitis are provided in Table 7.

TABLE 8:  GDC-0032 Dose Delay and Modi fication Guidelines for Stomatitis 
and Oral Mucositis 
Table 8 has been revised to reflect changes to the protocol. 
SECTION 5.1.2:  Management of Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
Some patients have experienced elevations of liver function tests (e.g., AST or ALT). 
Patients will be monitored throughout the st udy treatment for changes in liver function 
tests.  Given the potential for hepatic toxicity, all patients must have adequate liver 
function as manifested by measurements of  serum bilirubin, hepatic transaminases, and 
alkaline phosphatase for initial and continued dosing.  Separate crit eria for eligibility, 
continued dosing, and DLT are given for pati ents with hepatic metastases and Grade 2 
hepatic transaminase and/or alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline to allow safety 
testing to be adequately assessed in this patient group.   
For new abnormal liver function tests (e.g., elevated AST or ALT), a standard clinical 
work-up to understand the etiology of the abnormality should take place per local 
guidelines.  In many cases, elevated liver function tests may be a result of liver 
metastases, concomitant medications, or biliary obstruction.  Dose modifications for 
elevated liver function tests are described in Table 7. 
SECTION 5.1.3:  Management of Asymptomatic Lipase and/or Amylase 
Elevations  
Some patients treated with  GDC-0032 have experienced asymptomatic lipase and/or 
amylase elevations in blood tests without any clinical or radiographic symptoms of 
pancreatitis or another clear etiology for the abnormal laboratory values.  Upon 
discussion with the Medical Monitor and after a risk-benefit assessment, investigators 
can consider continuing GDC- 0032 therapy in such patients  at the same dose or one 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 11 dose level lower.  Investigators should have a low threshold for interrupting GDC-0032 
for any concerning clinical gastrointestinal toxicities.  
SECTION 5.3.5.5:  Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests  as Hy’s 
Law 
SECTION 5.3.5.7:  Preexi sting Medical Conditions 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions  eCRF. 
SECTION 5.6:  POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
The investigator is not required to actively monitor patients for adverse events after the 
end of the adverse event reporting period (30 days after the last dose of study drug).  However, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any death, other serious adverse event, or non-serious adverse event of special interest occurring after the end of the adverse event reporting period, regardless of causality.  The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.
 
The investigator should report these events by completing and faxing a paper Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form and fax cover sheet to Safety Risk Management using 
the fax numbers provided to investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of Investigators”).  
The investigator should report these events directly to Genentech Safety Risk 
Management via telephone at 1 8888352555.

of remaining samples for the clinical repository. use of remaining mandatory samples 
for optional exploratory research.   Samples stored in the clinical repository may be used 
for future exploratory research. The investigator or au thorized designee will explain to 
each patient the objectives of the exploratory research.  Patients will be told that they are 
free to refuse to donate their remaining samples to the clinical repository.   If patients 
choose to donate remaining samples, they  participate and  may withdraw their specimens 
at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agreement to allow any remaining specimens to 
be stored in the clinical repository. used for exploratory research. Patients who decline 
to participate will not provide a separate signature.

Objectives  
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus 
letrozole plus placebo in women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) early stage breast  cancer, as measured by the following co-
primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by centrally assessed breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  mutant (MT) patients 
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in  breast and axilla (ypT 0/Tis ypN0) by local 
evaluation in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  MT patients 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor objective response rate (ORR), asse ssed by centrally assessed breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (total pC R ypT0/Tis ypN0) by local evaluation in PIK3CA  
wildtype (WT) patients  
The following secondary objectives will be perfo rmed in all enrolled patients and separated by 
PIK3CA  mutation status: 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-0032 with letrozole plus placebo in terms of locally assessed 
ORR as measured by modified RECIST criteria (Appendix 3 ) using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) 
• Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery; and Week 3 to surgery.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 24 • Compare the centrally derived,  preoperative endocri ne prognostic index  (PEPI) score upon 
treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by 
breast MRI via central assessment. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following: a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) ypT0/is, 
ypNX (breast pCR). 
Safety Objective 
The safety objective for this study is as follows: 
• Evaluate the safety of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo 
Patient-Reported Outcome Objectives   
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-re lated symptoms, patient functioning, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) betwee n treatment arms as measured by the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cancer Module (QLQ-BR23) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular comp osition as assessed by diffusion-weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited to 
somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN ex pression, pro-survival pathways (such as 
PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are 
predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with  GDC-0032 results in changes in downstream 
markers in tumor tissue and to examine t he relationship to anti-tumor activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline biopsy 
and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, enhancement, 
diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possibl e drug interaction between letrozole and 
GDC-0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032  drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or letrozole 
on pharmacokinetics and response (eithe r efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in letrozole 
plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
Study Design  
Description of Study 
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate the 
effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated,  Stage I-III operable breast ca ncer whose primary tumors 
are
 ≥ 2 cm.  Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors  are not eligible.  Standard of care 
assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tiss ue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal cutting 
temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffi n-embedded cores [FFPE]). Two pretreatment 
FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to 
beginning study drug treatment.  Prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for 
enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), 
and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. ER, PR, HER2, and 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 25 the percentage of Ki67-positive cells will also be  centrally assessed, but the results do not have 
to be available prior to enrollment in the study.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future 
translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed. 
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization ratio.  
Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once  daily plus either GDC-0032 at 4 mg (two 2-mg tablets)  
placebo on a 5  − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A 
maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be adminis tered.  Letrozole can be continued up to 
surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
After confirmation of all the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of the treatment 
arms.  A second biopsy will be performed on Day 15 (Week 3) for biomarker analyses. Biopsies 
should be performed at least 2 hours after GDC-0032 dose administration. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed according to 2 factors: 
1. Tumor size (T1-T2 vs. T3) 
2. Nodal status (cytologically positive vs . radiologically or cytologically negative) 
The study will enroll approximately 330 pati ents at approximately 110 global sites. 
At Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, and 16 the primar y breast tumor and axillary lymph nodes will be 
assessed by clinical breast ex amination (palpation and caliper measurement).  Suspicion of 
progression based on clinical exam at any time should be further evaluated (Figure 6).  
At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive disease 
and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspic ion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound 
should be confirmed by investigator-assessed br east MRI.  Patients with primary disease not 
evaluable by ultrasound at baseline should be assessed by MRI at Week 9.  Suspected 
progression in nodes should also be confirmed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) if these nodes 
had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patients with progressive 
disease (as defined by modified RECIST, Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or 
be taken off of the study, according to the invest igator’s decision. If the patient goes off-study, 
every reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another 
systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surg eon.  The purpose of th is visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. 
mastectomy) and scheduling the dat e for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. Clinical 
breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to dosing,  at 
Week 9, and prior to surgery. 
Surgery 
Surgery will take place after at leas t 16 weeks of treatment, during Weeks 17
 − 18.  Surgery 
should be performed within 4 days after the last dose of GDC-0032, if possible, to best observe 
pharmacodynamic knockdown with GDC-0032 in the surgical specimen.  Surgery may be 
delayed due to toxicity or other safety issues, upon discussion with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section 5.4.1) or recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; 
see below).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.   
Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice . However, pre-surgical SLNB is not allowed. 
Information on the type of surgery will be co llected and recorded. Su rgery specimens will be 
collected for histological examination to as sess for pCR and for other endpoint analyses. 
Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local st andards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be de livered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, 
radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the end of 
the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at this visit and 
the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 26 The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning the 
surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both the planned and actual surgical treatment  
should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pathological complete response (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be 
established via a local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and directions 
for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be us ed to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  IRF 
procedures are detailed in the IRF charter. 
Number of Patients 
The study will enroll approximately 330 pati ents at approximately 110 global sites.

Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g ., prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplement s) used by a patient from 7 days prior to 
screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.   
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4  in HLM and appeared to be a weak time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data 
from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate t hat 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in 
patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacoki netics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate).  Therefore, GDC 0032 may be adminis tered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates 
without the risk of a pharmacokineti c drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Prohibited Therapy 
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents such 
as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted t herapy, biological response modifiers, or 
endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topical estrogens (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is receiving 
these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast and/or 
regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment includi ng bisphosphonates and receptor activator 
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the management of 
osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomita n
t use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhi bit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.

carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an 
alternate medication with no or minimal potent ial to induce CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 
inducer is co-administered with GDC-0032,  patients should be closely monitored for 
adverse reactions.

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 31 Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis 
This study is designed for testing the effect of  GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all 
enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 patients in total. 
Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) for appr oximately 10% of 
the patients and t he prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, there will be approximately 
120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, there 
might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT cohort, which 
may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical 
power even when the treatment assignment is  imbalanced, the sample size was calculated 
based on a conservative scenario by assuming that the treatment assignment imbalance in 
PIK3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was calculated based on a chi²-test using 
continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall two-sided, family-wis e error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable fo r the MRI ORR, approximately 300 enrolled 
patients and 108 patients in the PIK3CA  MT cohort will be evaluable for analyses. This sample 
size allows us to detect an absolute percenta ge increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the 
GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; 
Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power and 16% two-sided significance 
level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 
120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an absolute 
percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GD C-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the 
letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the 
4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is 
approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more substantial 
treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or there is an 
increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased 
to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  
MT.   
Secondary Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatmen t, assessed by modified RECIST criteria by 
breast MRI (centrally assessed) in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total  pCR) after completion of study drug in PIK3CA  WT 
patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be analyzed analogue 
to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by PIK3CA  mutation status (centrally assessed): 
• ORR using modified RECIST criteria  by the follow
 ing methods: by clinical breast 
examination, mammography and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) 
• Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to surgery 
(centrally assessed) 
• PEPI score (centrally derived ) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by breast MRI 
• Evaluation of different definitions of pCR in cluding the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) 
ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 32 These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be compared between 
the two treatment arms within each population based on appropriate statistical analyses: ORR 
will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal 
status; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by regression analyses, adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All se condary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided 
type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Determination of Sample Size   
 Please refer to the primary analysis in the Statistical Methods section.  
 Interim Analyses 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will monitor accumulating patient safety 
data at a minimum of once every 6 months until the last patient has completed study treatment.  
Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, comm unication, affiliations) will be provided in the 
IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to re view the unblinded safety data after the first 
20 patients have either 1) finished the 30-day follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on 
study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (f or those who do not receive the surgery).  The 
IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK summaries (all interim analyses).  While this revi ew is being conducted, patient accrual into the 
study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may 
call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safety  analyses with the study team.  The study team 
will share interim safety results with study inve stigators as needed for the conduct of the study 
and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues antici pated in this trial, as well as 
measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following 
sections.  All available information of all enroll ed patients with all available assessments at the 
respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.

Protocol GO28888, Version 3 37 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON THE PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-KINASE 
PATHWAY 
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase involved in tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and migration upon activation by growth factor receptors and integrins.  PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Cantley 2002), a second messenger involved in the phosphorylation of AKT and associated proteins in the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Guertin and Sabatini 2007).  Activating and transforming mutations, as well as amplification, in the p110 α subunit of 
PI3K are commonly found in solid and hematological tumors (Li et al. 1997).  In addition, the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numer ous types of cancer by receptor tyrosine 
kinase signaling, the loss of the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) and Inositol 
Polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) , or RAS mutations 
(Shayesteh et al. 1999; Cantley 2002; Massion et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005). 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-POSITIVE, 
HER2-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of total cancer deaths (Jemal et al. 2011).  As a large proportion of breast cancer cases, especially in developed countries, are now diagnosed in early stages, they are amenable to cure with a stage-appropriate combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy), and radiotherapy. 
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative 
(HER2-) breast cancer accounts for about 60%
 − 70% of all breast cancers.  However, 
not all ER+ breast cancers respond optimally to endocrine therapy (Davies et al. 2011).  There are several mechanisms that can lead to primary and/or secondary hormonal resistance in ER+ breast cancer:  decrease of ER expression, loss of ER expression, or upregulation of growth factor signaling pathways, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (Johnston 2009). 
In the setting of ER
 + /HER2-negative breast cancer, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays 
an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and is a viable therapeutic target to 
explore (Miller et al. 2010). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 38 1.3 BACKGROUND ON THE PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in 
breast cancer, especially in the ER+ subtype (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012).  Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway include the following: (1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the alpha catalytic subunit 
of PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005); (2) Alterations in the tumor 
suppressor gene PTEN, either by loss of protein expression (PTEN null), inactivation mutations and/or epigenetic deregulation through promoter hypermethylation (García et al. 2004); (3) PDKP1 amplification and/or overexpression (Brugge et al. 2007); (4) AKT1 somatic gain of function mutations (Stemke-Hale et al. 2008) and AKT2 amplifications (Bellacosa et al. 1995). Overall, it is estimated that up to 70% of breast cancers can have some form of molecular aberration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (CGAN 2012).   
1.4 BACKGROUND ON REVERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE BY 
INHIBITING THE PI3K /MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, PI3K seems to play an important role in mediating 
hormonal resistance and is  a viable therapeutic target. Hyperactivation of this signaling 
pathway was proved to promote both de novo and acquired resistance to hormone 
therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models (Sabnis et al. 2007), and 
simultaneous blocking of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with everolimus and the ER pathway with letrozole enhances antitumor activity of either agent alone (Boulay et al. 2005). Importantly, a baseline protein signature of PI3K activation was found to be predictive of a poor prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy (Miller et al. 2010). 
In the clinical setting, impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial (Baselga et al. 2009). This trial compared everolimus and exemestane with placebo and exemestane in 724 postmenopausal patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer who had experienced recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting and/or in advanced disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the evero limus group was 6.9 months, as compared to 
2.8 months in the placebo group.  Hazard ratio (HR) for progression or death was 0.43, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.35
 − 0.54 (p  < 0.001), as per the investigator’s 
assessment, and the magnitude of the effect was even greater as per central assessment (HR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27
 − 0.47; p  < 0.001).  In the open-label Phase II 
TAMRAD trial, patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI) resistant metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen plus everolimus or tamoxifen alone (Bachelot et al. 2012). The 6-month clinical benefit rate was 61% (95% CI, 47%
 − 74%) with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29%  − 56%) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression 
increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 39 (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36  − 0.81).  Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24  − 0.81). 
In the neoadjuvant setting, combination of letrozole and everolimus also resulted in 
improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009).  In this study, 270 postmenopausal patients with operable ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to re ceive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment 
with letrozole and either everolimus or plac ebo. The primary endpoint of the trial, clinical 
response by palpation, was higher in the everolimus arm than in the control arm (68.1% vs. 59.1%, p
 = 0.062), a statistically significant result (one-sided, α  = 0.1 level). 
An important finding in trials with mTOR-tar geting drugs like everolimus is that they 
produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT), resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies to effectively shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued.  One of these strategies is inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the level of PI3K. 
1.5 BACKGROUND ON NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN BREAST 
CANCER 
The use of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer has been studied in several large randomized trials that have compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy with standard adjuvant treatment (Mauriac and Smith 2003; Scholl et al. 1994; Semiglazov et al. 2004; Fisher et al. 2012; Wolff and Davidson 2000).  The randomized studies evaluating neoadjuvant therapy as well as meta-analyses of these studies have shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve breast cons ervation rates, decreasing the number of 
women obligated to undergo mastectomy (Mieog et al. 2007; Fisher et al. 2012).  A meta-analysis of nine randomized studies comparing adjuvant with neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer showed no difference in rates of death, disease 
progression, or distant disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic 
therapy (Mauri et al. 2005).  The concept of  neoadjuvant therapy is now well established 
and a standard treatment option for patients with early breast cancer.  The Collaborative 
Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of 
clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2014 ).  The results of this meta-analysis confirmed an 
association of pathologic complete response [pCR] with favorable long-term outcomes in 
high-risk populations (i.e., HER2-positive, high-grade hormone receptor positive and triple negative subtypes), although the magnit ude of pCR improvement predictive of the 
long-term survival benefits could not be determined.  In September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 40 1.6 BACKGROUND ON GDC-0032 
GDC-0032 is a potent selective inhibitor of Class I PI3K alpha, delta, and gamma 
isoforms, with 30-fold less potent inhibition of the beta isoform that is being developed as a therapy for human cancers.  Nonclinica l studies with GDC-0032 demonstrate that 
GDC-0032 inhibits proliferation of p110 α-mutant breast cell lines, inhibits tumor growth 
in human breast xenograft models harboring PIK3CA  mutations, and results in a 
substantial reduction of PI3K pathway markers, including pAkt, pPRAS40, and pS6.   
GDC-0032 has demonstrated activity in nonclinical models of PIK3CA -mutant breast 
tumors in vivo as a single agent and in combination with standard of care (e.g., paclitaxel 
or docetaxel) or endocrine therapies (e.g., letrozole or fulvestrant).  GDC-0032 has a favorable in vitro and nonclinical in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination profile that has characterist ics consistent with a compound that can be 
delivered orally to achieve clinical exposure similar to the nonclinical efficacy findings 
described herein.  Additional studies, including 16-week toxicity studies in rats and dogs, phototoxicity studies, and an embryo-fetal development study, support the Phase II neoadjuvant trial with GDC-0032 in combination with endocrine therapy.   
In vitro, single-agent GDC-0032 potency is also observed in cell lines that do not harbor 
PIK3CA  mutations ( Figure 1).  In in vitro combination studies, the aromatase-expressing 
breast cancer cell line (MCF7 X
2.3.ARO) showed positive combination effects between 
GDC-0032 and endocrine therapies (see Figure 2).  In this cell line, GDC-0032 alone 
caused growth inhibitio n (50% effective concen
tration [EC 50]  = 95 nM). Effects on growth 
were also observed with letrozole and fulvestrant.  Combined treatment of cells with GDC-0032 and letrozole caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability at lower concentrations of either GDC-0032 or letrozole resulting in enhanced activity for the combination. In addition, combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  wild-type 
(WT) cell line ZR75-1 when GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapies (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).  However, in vivo data in a PIK3CA WT model are not available, because these cell lines do not 
grow as xenografts.

Protocol GO28888, Version 3 43 1.7 SUMMARY OF CLINICAL DATA FOR GDC-0032  
1.7.1 Clinical Safety Data with GDC-0032  
As of 5 July 2013, a total of 144 patients have been treated with GDC-0032 capsules, in 
the Phase I/II PMT4979g study, either as single agent ( n = 90, 63%) or in combination 
with endocrine therapy ( n = 54, 37%). 
As of 5 July 2013, enrollment into the dose-escalation stage of Study PMT4979g had 
been completed with 34 patients enrolled at GDC-0032 doses ranging from  3  to 16 mg 
daily.  GDC-0032 was well tolerated in the first three cohorts (3, 5, and 8 mg), with no 
patients experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).  At the 16-mg dose level, 2 of the 11 safety-evaluable patients experienced a DLT (Grade 4 hyperglycemia and Grade 3 
fatigue).  At the 12-mg dose level, 1 of the 10 safety-evaluable patients experienced a DLT of Grade 3 acute renal failure.  Although the single-agent GDC-0032 maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not exceeded at the 16-mg dose level, the recommended GDC-0032 dose and schedule for the single-agent expansion cohorts is 9 mg daily on the basis of long-term safety data through multiple treatment cycles.  As of the cutoff 
date, a total of 53 patients had been enrolled in the 9-mg daily dosing expansion cohorts. 
As of 5 July 2013, adverse events of any grade that occurred in ≥
 10% of the 87 patients

1.7.1.1 Preliminary Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 34 patients treated with GDC-0032 at 3, 5, 
8, 12, and 16 mg in the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial (Study PMT4979g).  The cohort mean apparent clearance and the terminal half-life (t
1/2) following a single, oral dose of 
GDC-0032 had a range of 4.77 −9.17 L/hour and 36.7− 43.8 hours, respectively.  
Following daily oral dosing for 8 days, there was a 2- to 4-fold accumulation of GDC-0032.  The pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 appears to be dose linear and time-independent.  Preliminary PK data from Cohort E suggest there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between letrozole plus GDC-0032.  Mean plasma exposure of letrozole when given in combination with GDC-0032 (maximum concentration observed [C
max] = 0.407 μM and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24  ] = 8.01 μ M*hr) was comparable with the historical single-agent exposure 
(Cmax  = 0.495 μM and AUC 0-24   = 10.1 μM*hr) (Awada et al. 2008). Similarly, plasma 
concentrations of GDC-0032, when given in combination with letrozole, were within the range predicted by the population PK model. Therefore, letrozole plus GDC-0032 can be co-administered without the risk of a DDI.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3 A4 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
and appeared to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro 
induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low to moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I/II study (PMT4979g) 
indicate that 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a PK DDI.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 45 Preliminary data f rom a healthy volunteer study showed that the 3-mg GDC-0032 
tablet produces an estimated geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of 196% (177.1  − 217.0) for 
Cmax and 152.2% (141.9  − 163.2) for AUC time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-inf) when compared 
with the 3-mg Phase I capsule.   For this reason, a new 2-mg tablet has been formulated 
to deliver GDC-0032 exposure  similar to the 3-mg ca psule formulation.   
The drug exposure (AUC) for GDC-0032 in a healthy volunteer study was minimally 
affected by the consumption of a high-fat meal.  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be taken 
without regard to the timing of the administration of food.     
For additional details, refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure.   
1.7.1.2 Preliminary Pharmacodynamics 
Paired tumor biopsies were obtained from both PIK3CA MT and PIK3CA WT non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at either the 3-mg or 16-mg GDC-0032 dose 
level, respectively, at screening (pretreatment biopsy) and during Cycle 1 in Study PMT4979g (on-treatment biopsy).  Inhibi tion of PI3K pathway markers, including 
decreases of >
 60% in pAKT and pS6 (compared with baseline), were demonstrated in 
these patients’ paired tumor biopsies (see Figure 4).

As of 5 July 2013, metabolic partial responses via FDG-PET (  ≥ 20% decrease in 
maximum standardized uptake value) were observed in 23 out of 38 patients assessed 
(61%) and included patients from the lowest dose tested (3 mg).  Thirteen of these 23 were breast-cancer patients.  Of the 13 response-evaluable patients treated with 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 46 GDC-0032 plus letrozole, 10 patients (77%) had a partial metabolic response.  Of the 
15 response-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 plus fulvestrant, 11 (73%) had a partial metabolic response.  
For additional details, refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure.   
1.8 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with solid tumors accounting for 
the majority of these deaths.  An estimated 1.38 million women across the world were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, accounting for 23% of all cancers diagnosed in women.  Breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, estimated to be responsible for almost 460,000 deaths in 2008 (Ferlay et al. 2010). 
A neoadjuvant study in a similar patient populat ion with the combination of letrozole and 
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has already been completed (Baselga et al. 2009).  
Please refer to Sections 1.4, 1.5, and 3.3 for further rationale supporting the proposed 
trial design of combinin g GDC-003
2 with letrozole in the neoadjuvant setting for this 
patient population.  In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, it is hypothesized that the combination of decreasing estrogen levels with letrozole and inhibition of the PI3K pathway with GDC-0032 may have improved anti-tumor activity as compared to endocrine therapy alone.  This is supported by the nonclinical and clinical data outlined below. 
GDC-0032 is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of Class 1 PI3K that is being 
developed by Roche/Genentech as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent.  Activating and transforming mutations in the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K are commonly found in tumors.  GDC-0032 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of growth in various human cancer cell lines, and especially in nonclinical models of PIK3CA  MT tumors.  In addition, 
combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  WT cell line ZR75-1 when 
GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapies (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).   
GDC-0032 has also shown additive efficacy in combination with endocrine therapy in a 
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer xenograft model as outlined in Section 1.6. 
Nonclinical data support
 the investigation of GDC-0032 as a single-agent in solid tumors 
and in combination with endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  
Available clinical data with single-agent GDC-0032 suggest that GDC-0032 has 
dose-linear pharmacokinetics with a half-life of approximately 37 −
 44 hours.  
Pharmacodynamic markers of PI3K pathway inhibition upon treatment with GDC-0032 have been observed.  These include decreases in phospho-S6 in platelet-rich plasma and decreases in F- flurodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography uptake.  Available 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 47 clinical data also include multiple confirmed partial responses in patients treated with 
GDC-0032.  These include a patient with PIK3CA  MT lung adenocarcinoma treated at 
the 3 mg daily dose and another patient with PIK3CA  MT, hormone receptor-positive, 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated at the 5 mg daily dose.  In addition, a patient with PIK3CA  WT lung cancer treated at the 3 mg daily dose has had prolonged 
stable disease and remained on study for over 11 months.  These data show that single-agent GDC-0032 doses below 6 mg have been shown to have anti-tumor activity.  These aggregate data support the use of 6 mg in combination with letrozole.   
Letrozole is a marketed product that is approved in the European Union (E.U.) and the 
United States (U.S.) for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  Based upon the different mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-established safety profile of letrozole, there are no expected overlapping, significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.  
As of 5 July 2013, efficacy data are available for 24 patients treated with GDC-0032 
capsules in combination with letrozole; 3 patients (12.5%) had a partial response as best 
overall response, 2 of which were confirmed partial responses (cPRs) (1 cPR at 6 mg; 
1 cPR at 9 mg).  Of the 25 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 7 patients (28%) had a partial response as best overall response, of which 3 were cPRs (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 partial response at 9 mg).  cPRs have been observed in both PIK3CA  mutant and PIK3CA  WT breast cancer patients.  
Maintenance of cPR has been observed in a patient who had a dose reduction from 6 mg to 3 mg for an adverse event.  In addition, no additional safety concerns have been observed with GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole in the ongoing Phase I study compared to GDC-0032 given as single agent. 
A number of clinically appropriate strategies to minimize risk to patients have been built 
into the protocol through the means of inclus ion/exclusion criteria, monitoring strategies, 
protocol design, and management guidelines.  These will also be clearly highlighted and discussed in detail at investigator meetings and site visits.  In addition, please refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure for details regarding potential risks, associated precautions, and other relevant nonclinical and clinical safety information. 
Due to the need to develop improved therapies to reverse or delay resistance to current 
endocrine therapy in HER2-negative, hor mone receptor-positive breast cancer  and on 
the basis of the clinical and nonclinical data available for GDC-0032, Genentech/Roche 
feels that the risk-benefit profile of GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole in 
postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive early stage 
breast cancer is favorable for proceeding with the proposed randomized Phase II clinical 
trial.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate 
the effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated, Stage I-III operable breast cancer 
whose primary tumors are ≥ 2 cm.  Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors are not eligible.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 50 Standard of care assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed 
within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumo r tissue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal 
cutting temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two 
pretreatment FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to beginning study drug treatment.  Tumor tissue from prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for enrollment eligibility purposes. For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. Remaining tissue will be retained for future translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed.   
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio.  Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 4 mg (two 
2-mg tablets)  or placebo on a 5
 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks 
(see Figure 5).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole 
can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 52 At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive 
disease and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspicion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound should be confirmed by investigator-assessed breast MRI.  Patients with primary disease not evaluable by ultrasound at baseline should be assessed by MRI at Week 9.  Suspected progression in nodes should also be confirmed by fine 
needle aspiration (FNA) if these nodes had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patient s with progressive disease (as defined by 
modified RECIST, Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or be taken off of 
the study, according to the investigator’s decisio n. If the patient goes off-
study, every 
reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surgeon.  The purpose of this visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and scheduling the date for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. 
Clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected on Day 1 prior to 
dosing, at Week 9, and prior to surgery. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 54 Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local standards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be deliv ered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the 
end of the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at 
this visit and the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both the planned and actual surgical 
treatment  should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pCR (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be established via a 
local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and 
directions for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be used to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  
IRF procedures are detailed in the IRF charter. 
3.1.2 Independent Data  Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC will monitor accumulating patient safety data at a minimum of once every 6 months until the last patient has completed study treatment.  Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, communication, affiliation s) will be provided in the IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will review the unblinded  safety data  after the first 20 patients have either 1) 
finished the  30-day follow-up  visit after the surgery, or 2) been on study for 20 weeks 
after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the surgery), whichever occurs first .  While this review is being conducted, patient accrual into the study will 
continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.   
3.2 END OF STUDY  
The end of the study is defined as the date when the last patient has her postsurgery visit. The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months for enrollment,
 plus 5.5 months after last patient in.

Protocol GO28888, Version 3 55 3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.3.1 Rationale for Conducting the Study in the Neoadjuvant Setting  
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and not every breast tumor responds equally 
to a specific agent.  Studies based on global gene expression analyses have provided 
additional insights into this complex scenario.  Over the past 10 years, four major classes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Lum inal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like) have 
been identified and intensively studied (Perou et al. 2000; Sørlie et al. 2001). Known as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, t hese groups of tumors have revealed critical 
differences in incidence, survival, and response to treatment. As genomic studies evolve, further sub-classifications of breast tumors are expected to emerge. Thus, a major challenge in breast cancer management is how to prospectively select patients who will 
derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen, minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
Neoadjuvant therapy, a systemic therapy administered prior to breast cancer surgery, is 
now widely used in the treatment of early breast cancer patients. Outcomes of patients 
receiving neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy (Mauri et al. 2005), and the form er offers clear advantages to patients, 
especially those with larger tumors. The tumor may shrink prior to surgery, thus increasing the rate of BCS (Coudert et al. 2006), and since the response to therapy can be monitored, the patient might be also spared further treatment with inactive medications.  
The neoadjuvant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents. Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, usually from the diagnostic specimens. On-treatment biopsies may also be pre-specified in order to monitor treatment response at a biological level. Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well. The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes  of breast cancer (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 
2013; Cortazar et al. 2012). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
Postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, ER+, early stage breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.  This patient population is usually treated with a combination of surgery, anti-hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy, according to staging and biological features.  
Recently, everolimus was approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency in 
combination with exemestane for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer in patients after recurrence or progression following treatment with nonsteroidal AIs.  In 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 56 the neoadjuvant setting, a combination of letrozole and everolimus resulted in improved 
responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009). 
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, confirm a 
previously identified  pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an 
upregulation of the pAKT, resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation 
through an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mediated feedback loop 
(Tabernero et al. 2009). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies 
to shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued. One of these strategies is to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the PI3K level. PI3K-inhibitors are central regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, and nonclinical findings show that PI3K-inhibitors and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors induce a greater amount of apoptosis than everolimus in estrogen-deprived in vitro models (Sanchez et al. 2011); therefore, it 
is hypothesized that PI3K-inhibitors may be active and demonstrate greater anti-tumor activity as compared to AIs alone in the neoadjuvant setting. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group   
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been found to be more effective than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. 
Several trials have assessed the efficacy  and safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
using AIs in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer (Eiermann et al. 2001; Smith 
et al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011). 
The P024 trial was a worldwide, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that 
randomized 337 postmenopausal patients with ER
 +  breast cancer to receive either 
4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen (Eiermann et al. 2001). The primary endpoint of P024 was the percentage of patients in each treatment arm with objective response as determined by clinical palpation. Secondary endpoints included ORR determined by mammogram and ultrasound, and included the percentage of patients in each arm who had become eligible for BCS. The trial demonstrated a significantly higher clinical response rate for letrozole when compared to tamoxifen (55% vs. 36%; p
 < 0.001) 
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. An improved ORR for letrozole was also observed with ultrasound (35% vs. 25%; p
 < 0.042) and mammogram (34% vs. 16%; p  < 0.001). 
The higher response rate assessed by clinical palpation translated into a significantly higher rate of women undergoing BCS in tumors that had initially been considered unsuitable for this procedure (45% vs. 35%; p
 = 0.022). Median time-to-response was 
66 days in the letrozole group and 70 days in the tamoxifen group, and both treatments were well tolerated. 
The IMPACT trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER+ operable or locally advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 57 a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery. 
The tumor ORR was assessed by both caliper and ultrasound. No significant differences in ORR in the ITT population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination were seen. However, in a predefined analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more patients requiring mastectomy at baseline actually receiving BCS with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (44% vs.  31%, respectively; p
 = 0.23); this 
difference became significant for patients deemed by their surgeon to be eligible for BCS after treatment (46% vs. 22%, respectively; p
 = 0.03). All treatments were well tolerated. 
The ACOSOG Z1031 trial compared three AIs in a randomized, Phase I I, neoadjuvant 
trial designed to select agents for Phase III investigations. Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical Stage II to III ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole. The primary endpoint was clinical response. No formal comparison between arms was pre-specified in the statistical plan. ORR was 62.9%, 74.8%, and 69.1% for the exemestane, letrozole and anastrozole arms, respectively. On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI score, or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. 
Results from these trials suggest that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be beneficial 
in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer, and that it offers an alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.3.4 Rationale for the Efficacy Ou tcome Measure of Response Rate 
Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
ORR is based on criteria related to changes in tumor size (e.g., RECIST) and is generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple, non-registrational, neoadjuvant trials in combination with endocrine therapy (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007; Baselga et al. 2009).  
Guidelines for RECIST 1.1 state that MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast 
lesions in a neoadjuvant setting, and it has  advantages over computed tomography (CT) 
and mammography (Eisenhauer et al. 2009). In addition, MRI has been shown to be more accurate than clinical palpation, ultrasound, and mammography for measuring residual tumor size after neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Akazawa et al. 2006; Balu-Maestro et al. 2002; Yeh et al. 2005), including the I-SPY trial (Hylton et al. 2012).  For these reasons, ORR as assessed by breast MRI has been chosen as a co-primary endpoint for this trial.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 58 3.3.4.1 Rationale for Efficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
pCR is a recognized efficacy endpoint of neoadjuvant trials, especially those with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it has been correlated with long-term outcomes, such as 
event-free survival (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013).  
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is an unlikely event.  For instance, in the 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole, pCR rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively (Baselga et al. 2009). 
In the ongoing Phase I/II trial that combines letrozole with GDC-0032, tumor shrinkage 
has been observed, and some patients presented sustained partial responses. As pCR is a recognized indicator of activity to a given regimen, it would be useful to assess it as a co-primary efficacy endpoint of this trial. Furthermore, for the same trial size, this would represent a minimal increase in the minimum detected difference (MDD) of the 
co-primary endpoint for pCR ORR (from MDD of 12% to MDD of 13%). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a 
complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, 
inflammatory or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.   
3.3.4.2 Rationale for Ki67 Measurements 
Ki67 is a well-established proliferation biomarker with prognostic value in ER+ breast cancer (Dowsett et al. 2011). Efficacy of endocrine therapy relies on induction of cell-cycle arrest, and during neoadjuvant treatment, Ki67 levels reflect the ability of endocrine agents to suppress proliferation (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011).  In the neoadjuvant trial of letrozole with everolimus, by using the definition that patients with natural log (Ki67)
 < 1 at Day 15 have an antiproliferative response, 57% of 
everolimus-treated patients were responders vs. 30% in the placebo arm, with a significant p  value of <
 0.01 (Baselga et al. 2009). Furthermore, the mean reduction in 
the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells at Day 15 relative to baseline was greater in the everolimus-treated patients (90.7%
 ± 3.2%) than in the placebo group (74.8%  ± 6.8%; 
p = 0.0002). In the IMPACT trial, Ki67 was assessed at baseline, on Day 15, and at 
surgery (Smith et al. 2005). For each treatment arm, the reduction in geometric mean Ki67 levels was significantly higher for anastrozole than for tamoxifen at both time points (p
 = 0.004, p  = 0.001, respectively), but no differences were found between tamoxifen and 
the combination. In the ASCOSOG Z1031 trial (Ellis et al. 2011), although no data on Ki67 at Day 15 were available, no differences were found between treatments at baseline and at surgery (after 16
 − 18 weeks of therapy). The geometric mean 
percentage change in Ki67 for each treatment was similar between the arms (anastrozole 78%, exemestane 81.2%, and letrozole 87.1%). 
The issue of whether Ki67 decrease at surgery or at any timepoint during treatment 
correlates with long-term efficacy outcomes has been addressed in the P024 trial 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 59 (Eiermann et al. 2001). Treatment with letrozole led to higher, treatment-induced 
reduction of Ki67 levels in the tumor at surgery (87% reduction in the letrozole arm vs. 75% in the tamoxifen arm; analysis of covariance p
 = 0.0009) based on the 185 
specimens with available data on Ki67 (Ellis et al. 2003). With a median follow-up of 61.2 months, low levels of Ki67 in the biopsy at the end of treatment were significantly associated with better relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.4 per natural log increase in the Ki67 value, 95% CI 1.2
 − 1.6, p  < 0.001), and breast cancer specific survival (HR 1.4, 
95% CI 1.1  − 1.7, p  =  0.009).  Finally, in the IMPACT trial, higher Ki67 expression after 
2 weeks of endocrine therapy was statistically significantly associated with lower RFS (p
 = 0.004), whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not (Smith et al. 2005). 
Importantly, the Ki67 suppression in these hormonal neoadjuvant trials mirrored efficacy outcomes in large adjuvant trials: adjuvant BIG1-98 trial (n
 = 8,010) showed the superior 
efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen (Regan et al. 2011), similar to the neoadjuvant P024 trial (n
 = 185); the adjuvant ATAC trial (n  = 9,366) showed that anastrozole was better 
than tamoxifen and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen (Cuzick et al. 2010), similar to neoadjuvant IMPACT (n
 = 259); and the adjuvant MA27 trial (n  = 7,576) showed 
similar efficacy of anastrozole and exemestane (Goss et al. 2013), mirroring neoadjuvant ACOSOG Z1031 (n
 = 266). These results suggest that a biological superiority hypothesis 
generated by a neoadjuvant study may help the design of future adjuvant hormonal therapy trials. 
In summary, reduction in Ki67 after neoadjuvant treatment with AIs is a good marker of 
suppression of cellular proliferation, correlates with long term efficacy outcomes, and mirrors results of large adjuvant endocrine trials, which make it an attractive endpoint to assess in the present trial. 
3.3.4.3 Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic 
Index Score 
In addition to Ki67, pathologic tumor size (T1 or T2 versus T3 or T4), node status (positive or negative), and the ER status (positive Allred score 3–8 versus negative 
Allred score 0–2) of the surgery specimen were also determined to have independent prognostic value for relapse and death after relapse in the P024 trial (Ellis et al. 2008).  A PEPI score, prognostic for RFS, which weighs each of these factors according to their associated hazard ratios, was developed and subsequently validated in an independent data set from the IMPACT trial (Ellis et al. 2008). No relapses were recorded in either trial in patients with tumors classified as T1N0 and with a PEPI score of 0 (residual tumor with a Ki67 level 
 ≤ 2.7%, and with maintained ER expression) or in the rare patient 
with a pCR. 
In this trial, the PEPI score will be derived centrally.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 60 3.3.4.4 Rationale for Assessing O RR by Clinical Breast Exam 
(Palpation), Mammography, and Breast Ultrasound 
Objective overall response rate will also be assessed by clinical breast exam, 
mammography, and breast ultrasound during screening and prior to surgery. These data will allow for more direct comparison of results to other neoadjuvant trials with endocrine therapy as described in Section 3.3.3. The concurrent acquisition of ORR data with 
these techniques, in addition to MRI-based measures, will al so provide va
luable 
comparative information on these methods, which will be important for both future neoadjuvant studies and GDC-0032 clinical development.  
3.3.4.5 Rationale for Assessing Enha ncing Tumor Volume by Breast 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
As shown in the I-SPY trial, tumor volume measurements based on the percent of tumor with enhancing signal after contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures (Hylton et al. 2012). However, there are no established response criteria for volumetric data, and the extrapolation of current one- and two-dimensional criteria to volumetric data based on a spherical model may not be appropriate given the range of tumor morphologies expected in this population of patients (Loo et al. 2011).  Additionally, there are only very limited data on the clinical relevance of any particular range in change in tumor volume during the course of neoadjuvant treatment. For these reasons, changes in enhancing tumor volume as measured by breast MRI will be a secondary endpoint in the trial.     
3.3.5 Rationale for Inde pendent Review Facility  
Due to the relatively novel nature of using MRI as an imaging endpoint, a central assessment by an IRF for the co-primary endpoint of response rate via MRI will be performed to ensure consistency across all sites participating in the study.  
3.3.6 Rationale for Interim Safety Review  
The first 20 patients will be assessed for safety following surgery and 30 days beyond. This will allow the IDMC to review all safety data during the treatment period and to evaluate any surgery complications that may be attributed to GDC-0032. 
3.3.7 Rationale for GDC-0032 Dosage  
As of 5 July 2013, 34 patients have been enrolled into the dose-escalation stage of Study PMT4979g, and 56 patients have been enrolled into the single-agent expansion 
cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  All patients received GDC-0032 in 
capsules.  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested 
(see Section 1.7.1).  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety 
data on long 
-term tolerability, the recommended single-agent dose and schedule for the 
single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage is 9 mg daily. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 61 Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
letrozole, one patient at 6 mg had a cPR. The PIK3CA  mutation status of this patient is 
unknown. Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg, and the long-term safety suggests that 6 mg is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study will utilize 6 mg GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg and 1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg. 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time 
(from the first dose of study treatment) to onset of colitis ranged from approximately 82 − 248 days as either a single agent or in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant.  
Most of the colitis cases have been observed at the 9-mg dose level or higher.  Most of the colitis cases have been observed at the 9-mg dose level or higher.  To mitigate the late-onset adverse events, such as colitis, an intermittent dosing schedule will be applied. With the 40-hour half-life, a limited impact on efficacy is anticipated.  PK modeling has shown that a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off will maintain GDC-0032 drug exposure 
levels within an efficacious range as assessed by various breast cancer cell lines.  There has also been data presented for another PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with a similar half-life in combination with letrozole in a Phase Ib study that demonstrated improved tolerability with similar efficacy for a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off as compared to daily 
continuous dosing of the PI3K inhibitor (Mayer et al. 2012). 
3.3.8 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments   
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and PIK3CA  mutations have been shown to 
vary among patients (CGAN 2012).  Therefore, all patients may not equally likely benefit from treatment with GDC-0032.  Predictive biomarker samples collected prior to dosing will be assessed in an effort to identify those patients with PIK3CA -driven pathogenesis 
who are most likely to respond to GDC-0032.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be 
evaluated to assess the biologic activity of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole.  
It has been suggested that not all molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
result in pathway activation.  In a comprehensive analysis of tumors from 850 breast cancer patients, protein markers of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (pAKT, pS6, and p4EBP1) correlated strongly with INPP4B and PTEN  loss, to a degree with PIK3CA 
amplification, but were not elevated in PIK3CA- MT luminal A cancers (CGAN 2012).  
This apparent disconnect between the presence of PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of 
pathway activation had been previously noted (Loi et al. 2010), and stress the need to find innovative and robust predictive biomarke rs to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibiting 
agents (Saini et al. 2013). 
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep genome sequencing, may offer 
a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 62 genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the TSC1 gene was found in a 
metastatic bladder cancer patient with a prolonged response (>  2 years) to everolimus as 
single agent (Iyer et al. 2012).  Among 13 additional bladder cancer patients treated with 
everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant tumors remained on therapy longer 
than those with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p  = 0.004), suggesting that mTORC-1 
directed therapies may be most effective in cancer patients whose tumors harbor TSC1 
somatic mutations.  Similar approaches could be of great value when analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
In addition to mutational activation of proteins, levels of RNA and DNA can also activate 
the PI3K pathway.  For example, increases in DNA copy number in receptor tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1/2 and IGF-1R, which occur at some frequency in breast cancer, can activate downstream PI3K pathway.  Hormone receptor positive breast cancer can be divided into luminal A and luminal B subtype, with the luminal B subtype displaying a higher proliferative index.  Therefore, profiling the RNA and DNA expression of tumors will allow intrinsic subtyping of patients enrolled onto study.  In addition, PI3K transcription activation signatures may identify additional patients who could respond to PI3K inhibitors outside of PIK3CA  mutations.  
The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor response to treatment is an area of great interest.  It could allow for an early, non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates for specific therapies and monitoring of disease mutation status over time (Higgins et al. 2012).  The neoadjuvant setting is ideal to prospectively test these approaches. 
3.3.9 Rationale for Day 15 Biopsy  
On-study biopsies can provide valuable information regarding target engagement and downstream pathway suppression. Assessing ho w GDC-0032 interacts with letrozole in 
this previously untreated patient population provides a unique opportunity to understand the interaction between two anti-cancer molecules.  When available, FFPE tumor samples will be assessed for pathway m odulation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methodologies, and fresh frozen OCT samples will be assessed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technologies, or equivalent.  Measurement of Ki67 after 2 weeks of continuous letrozole and GDC-0032 combination treatment versus letrozole and placebo will give a good benchmark to prior neoadjuvant studies that demonstrated a larger decrease in Ki67 at this 2-week timepoint for a combination of letrozole and everolimus as compared to letrozole and placebo (Baselga et al. 2009).  This Day 15 biopsy will also be useful in identifying potential biomarkers that may help predict a tumor response for patients treated with GDC-0032.

Protocol GO28888, Version 3 63 3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for the Detection 
of Plasma Protein Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases  in levels of systemic cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate response 
to drugs, particularly targeted agents such as GDC-0032 (Wilson et al. 2012).  Assays to assess the expression of soluble, sy stemic cytokines and chemokines from the 
plasma of patients will be carried out using ELISA-based mass spectrometry or equivalent methodologies.   
3.3.11 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for DNA Sequencing 
to Identify Mutations in Plasma  
There is increasing evidence that circulating DNA obtained from blood specimens of cancer patients is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells (Diehl et al. 2008; Maheswaran et al. 2008).  Assays are available that can detect the major PI3K mutations (and other cancer-related genes) in plasma, and results from this analysis will be correlated with tumor specimens. 
3.3.12 Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample for Next Generation 
Sequencing  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate a large quantity of sequencing data.  Tumor DNA can contain both reported and unreported chromosomal alterations due to tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing calls in previously unreported genomic alterations, a normal blood sample will be taken during pre-screening to determine whether the alteration is somatic or germline.  
3.3.13 Rationale for Pharmacokine tic Sample Collection Schedule  
PK samples will be collected from early breast cancer patients in this study to assess the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 and possible DDI between letrozole and GDC-0032 in this population.  Considering the lack of DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole upon concomitant administration in the 24 metastatic breast cancer patients in the Phase I study (preliminary data), this drug interaction in early breast cancer patients is unlikely.  Hence, extensive PK sample collection is not needed; sparse PK sampling from patients enrolled in this study is adequate.  The proposed PK sample collection schedule will also enable assessment of a concentration and response relationship to better understand the following:  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (efficacy), PK/safety correlation, and population pharmacokinetics.  Additional PK samples may be collected for safety concerns (e.g., severe adverse event) in order to better characterize drug levels in these patients at the time of the adverse event.   
3.3.14 Rationale for the Coll ection of DNA for Exploratory 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
One sample (approximately 3 mL of whole bl ood) will be collected from all patients using 
K3-EDTA collection tubes. Samples will be used for the evaluation of genetic 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 64 polymorphisms of drug metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, CYP2C9, 
CYP3A4/5, and UGT1A1, and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1) and for genetic variants which could contribute to potentially drug-related rash and/or colitis safety assessments (including but not limited to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]).  For sample handling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Only in circumstances where there is concern for collection of this genetic material for above evaluations, can this assessment be c onsidered not mandatory as part of study 
assessments in this study.  Results of any analyses from these samples will be reported outside the clinical study report. 
It is established that genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN 38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan (O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006).  Preliminary results from in vitro metabolism studies with GDC-0032 suggest that they are partially metabolized by multiple Phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes, including C YP3A4.  
Although in vitro studies can help elucidate the roles of enzymes in the metabolism of the drug, these results are not always predictive of in vivo metabolism for a number of reasons, such as differences in drug concentrations that the enzymes encounter in vitro and in vivo.  For this reason, a blood sample for DNA isolation is proposed to be collected from all patients in this study for potential pharmacogenetic analysis of genes or biomarkers that may affect the pharmacokinetics or response to GDC-0032.  The decision to analyze the samples will be based on a review of the pharmacokinetics and response data.  Most recently, the role of HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of drug-induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepine, abacavir, and allopurinol).  Therefore, evaluation of genetic variants of ge nes that may 
regulate the immune response (including but not limited to HLA) may also be investigated to characterize unusual safety responses that are not predicted by GDC-0032 pharmacokinetics. 
The analysis will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, because it is necessary to 
link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis would be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination and/or response of patients who develop severe adverse reactions such as colitis or rash.  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 15 years after the completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
3.3.15 Rationale for Patient- Reported Outcome Assessments  
A PRO is “any report on the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without any interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 65 anyone else” (FDA Guidance for Industry 2007).  PRO measures are able to 
contextualize a patient’s experience on trial,  elucidating symptom and treatment burden.  
Since early breast cancer is often asymptomatic, the PRO objective is to evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and the health-related quality of life between treatment arms (Lemieux et al. 2011).  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and associated breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23, were selected 
because they were specifically developed to assess the most salient constructs and experiences with breast cancer and its treatment.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely and frequently used PRO measure in oncology trials that contains a global health status scale, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptom scales/items with a recall period of ‘the past week.’  
The second measure, the QLQ-BR23, is a breast cancer specific modular supplement to 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, and includes additional functioning scales and symptom scales/items relating to breast cancer.  
These instruments demonstrate strong psychometric properties, of both reliability and 
validity, and meet the requirements for this study (EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 1999).  Therefore, PRO data will be collected from patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and modified QLQ-BR23 (Quinten et al. 2009).

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING  
4.2.1 Patient Randomization  
After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility has been established, 
the study site will obtain a patient’s identification number and treatment assignment using a permuted block randomization algorithm via an interactive voice or web-based response system (IxRS).  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 71 4.2.2 Stratification  
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio based on 
the following stratification factors: 
• Tumor size (T1-2 vs. T3) 
• Nodal status (cytologically positive vs. r adiologically or cytologically negative). If on 
ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes at the 
baseline examination, then fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy is required to confirm nodal status. 
 
4.2.3 Blinding  
Investigators and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment of GDC-0032 or 
placebo. 
For emergency situations, the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by 
contacting the IxRS.  The responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the investigator.   For non-emergency situations, the investigator needs to obtain approval from the Medical Monitor to break the treatment code.  Unblinding during the study will result in the withdrawal of a patient from the study.  For regulatory reporting purposes, and if required by local health authorities, the Sponsor will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected, suspected adverse 
reactions that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to study drug. 
While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to 
maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK assay results for these patients are generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this trial.  The PK assay group will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignments to identify appropriate 
PK samples to be analyzed and bioanalytical methodology to employ.  However, the PK 
scientist does not have access to the PK assay results and therefore stays blinded until 
the PK assay results need to be interpreted and reported.  Samples from patients 
assigned to the comparator arm will be analyzed for letrozole.  However, GDC-0032 assay will be analyzed by request (i.e., to evaluate a possible error in dosing). 
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT  
4.3.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Handling  
4.3.1.1 GDC-0032 and Placebo  
GDC-0032 Drug Substance and Drug Product are manufactured according to current 
Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines for use in the clinical studies.  Each lot of 
GDC-0032 for clinical studies is subjected to a series of quality control tests to confirm its identity, purity, potency, and quality.

authority regulations.  The investigational site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs, using the IxRS to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.  
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s institutional 
standard operating procedure (SOP) or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation.  The site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by the Sponsor.  The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form. 
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of 
by the study site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log.

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate that 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
Letrozole is mainly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite by 
CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 in vivo. GDC-0032, which has the potential to induce CYP3A4 based on in vitro induction studies, was administered in combination with letrozole in the expansion phase of Study PMT4979g to assess their DDI potential. Preliminary data from 10 patients in this cohort indicated that steady state plasma concentrations of both letrozole and GDC-0032, following once daily administration of the combination (2.5 mg letrozole plus 6 or 9 mg GDC-0032), were similar to historical, single-agent data suggesting lack of DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole. These preliminary results suggest that GDC-0032 and letrozole combination may be administered without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
In vitro CYP inhibition studies in HLMs and induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested a low to moderate potential of GDC-0032 to perpetrate DDIs.  A clinical DDI study with rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) and itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), to understand the effect of CYP inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, is currently ongoing (Study GP28617). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 75 4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy  
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer 
agents such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological 
response modifiers, or endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this 
protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topical estrogens (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is 
receiving these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast 
and/or regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions. 
• Potent CYP3A4 inducers:  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to induce 
CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inducer is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients 
should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
Please see Appendix 1 for the schedule of assessments to be performed during the 
study. 
4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study-specific screening tests or  evaluations.  ICFs for enrolled patients 
and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before randomization.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 76 4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases that are currently active or that 
were active within the previous 5 years, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 
7 days prior to the screening visit.   
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
4.5.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination should incl ude an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems as well as weight and height (height is measured at the screening visit only).  Any abnormality identified at baseline 
should be recorded on the General Medical History and Vital Signs  eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom-directed physical 
examination may be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature.  Oxygen 
saturation is obtained by pulse oximetry after the patient has been in a seated position for 
 ≥ 5 minutes.  Obtain vital signs predose.  
4.5.5 Electrocardiograms  
Triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor Assessment  
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization.   
As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or abnormal physical examination; ches t CT if pulmonary symptoms.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 77 • For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC: bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
should be conducted for all patients. 
In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease.   
4.5.7 Tumor and Response Evaluations  
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at subsequent timepoints as outlined in Appendix 1. Responses based on clinical breast 
exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will be investiga tor-assesse 
d.  Whenever 
possible, assessments should be performed by the same evaluator to ensure internal consistency across visits. Response via breast MRI will be centrally assessed, and all assessments will be based on modified RECIST criteria (see Appendix 3).  
Clinical Breast Examination:  Assessment of primary breast  tumor and regional lymph 
nodes must be done by physical examination (palpation) during baseline 
evaluation, 
Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13 and 16 during the treatment phase, and prior to surgery. Breast tumor measurement by caliper (preferred) or rule will be performed and recorded in the eCRF. 
Axillary lymph node status (and other regional lymph nodes if clinically indicated) will 
also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Mammogram:  Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within 28 days 
prior to enrollment and again prior to surgery. Mammographic tumor measurements are 
to be recorded in the eCRF.  
Breast Ultrasound:   Bilateral breast ultrasounds must be obtained at baseline within 
28 days prior to enrollment.  Investigator decision whether to perform unilateral or bilateral ultrasounds performed at Week 9 and prior to surgery (Week 16) may be unilateral or bilateral and per investigator discretion.  If on ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes  at the baseline examination, then FNA or 
core biopsy is required.  Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded in the eCRF. The tumor site may be marked with a radiopaque clip or marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  
Breast MRI:  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans will be mandatory for all study 
patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to enrollment) and prior to surgery (Week 16).  
MRI is optional at Week 9, but will be mandatory if a primary breast lesion is not evaluable by ultrasound, or if there are signs of disease progression on the Week 9 ultrasound (see Figure 6 ).   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 78 Breast MRI scans should not be acquired within 48 hours after biopsy, and the timing 
and location of any clip or marker plac ement during study biopsies should be recorded 
for reference when MRI scans are read.  If the screening breast MRI scan is not evaluable for RECIST measurement due to technical limitations of the scan itself as assessed by the central reading facility, the scan may be repeated, at least 48 hours after the first scan before the start of study treatment. Other MRI acquisition sequences, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, may be acquired during this study during the MRI scan visits for each patient.  Additional MRI-derived metrics such as ADC value may provide additional insight into changes in tumor cellular composition.  
For information about patient preparation, scanner requirements and settings, and image 
acquisition, refer to the Study Imaging Manual. Standard site practice may be followed regarding the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolytics for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI. 
4.5.8 Surgical Treatment Plan  
The planned and actual surgical treatment (BCS or mastectomy) performed should be documented and reported in the eCRF.  Patients should be reassessed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and prior to surgery.  
4.5.9 Surgical Specimen – Pathology  
The co-primary endpoint of the study (pCR) will be as identified by local pathology review. Guidelines regarding pathology specimen preparation, labeling and review are outlined in the pathology manual. 
4.5.10 Laborator y Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [ R
BC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells]), and platelet 
count.   
• Coagulation (INR and aPTT/PTT) 
• Fasting serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, serum 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, AST, ALT), performed following  ≥ 10-hour 
fast 
• Fasting lipid profile and amylase (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed following 
a  ≥ 10 hour fast 
• Fasting insulin and glucose  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 79 • Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue 
• FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor 
biopsies and surgical resection.  All patients must consent to the collection of newly 
collected tumor biopsies (frozen and FFPE) for PIK3CA  mutation testing as well as 
for other protocol-mandated exploratory assessments at baseline, Day 15, and at surgery. 
• Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.  
Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten 
unstained slides from a prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for 
enrollment eligibility purposes. 
Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies and one freshly frozen 
OCT core needle biopsy are required at baseline and Day 15 (Week 3).    
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection 
(Weeks 17
 − 18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various reasons 
(e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site should discuss 
with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, unstained slides (a 
minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a surgical specimen are required at surgery (Weeks 17
 − 18). 
The specimens will be used for confirmatory central laboratory assessment of PIK3CA  mutation status, Ki67, PTEN, ER/PgR and HER2 expression.  In addition, 
other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, PI3K signaling pathways 
may be evaluated, including protein expression and molecular profiling studies such as NGS and gene-expression. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers include, but are 
not limited, to the following:  ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers 
• Blood for NGS (if approved by local regulatory authorities) 
• Blood for pharmacogenomics (if approved by local regulatory authorities) 
• PK assessment  
 
Plasma samples will be collected to measure letrozole and GDC-0032 
concentrations (see Appendix 2).  Any remaining samples collected for PK and 
biomarker assays may be used for ex ploratory bi
omarker profiling, metabolite 
profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes as appropriate. 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 80 4.5.11 Assay Methods  
4.5.11.1 Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA  
The PIK3CA mutation assay will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35%  − 40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 in the codons 
encoding amino acids E542, E545, and H1047 (Saal et al. 2005).  Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays that amplify exons that are commonly mutated in PIK3CA  offer a sensitive and quantitative method to detect mutations from a tumor 
specimen.  DNA will be extracted from tumor samples and subjected to allele-specific PCR assays that detect the WT allele, as well as to assays for nucleotide substitutions that include, but are not limited to, the following amino acid changes:  R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545K/A/G/D, E546K/E/R/L, M1043I, H1047R/L/Y, H1049R.  Following histopathological review, samples with 
 < 10% tumor content may not be evaluable for 
the PIK3CA assay. Samples will be run on  cobas z480 analyzer, and PIK3CA  mutation 
status (mutant or WT) will be made using appr opriate cutoffs and automated software.   
A designation of PIK3CA  status unknown will be assigned to a sample wherein any one 
of the predefined mutations was not conclusively assessed. 
4.5.11.2 Pharmacodynamic Biomar ker Assays in Tumor Tissues 
Ki67 antigen is an important cell cycle-related nuclear protein that is expressed by proliferating cells in all phases of the active cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M phase).  As such, it is a useful marker of the proliferative state of a tumor.  Ki67 protein levels will be determined by IHC through the use of standard techniques.   
PI3K pathway, and other pro-survival, biomarkers will be tested in the fresh tumor 
biopsies by IHC, including, but not limited to, phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4EBP1, and phospho-ERK.  If tissue quantity permits, change in expression of pathway biomarkers will be measured by t he RPPA using OCT fixed tissue.  The basis 
of the technology is to immobilize small amount s of lysate from a tumor biopsy sample in 
serial dilution on a microarray slide.  Multiple samples are thus arrayed on a slide and can be probed with antibodies that detect a particular phospho-epitope.  Using this technology, we will profile approximately 80 key signaling nodes representing a number of pathways known to be dysregulated in cancer, including receptors in the HER family, multiple components of PI3K/mTor signaling, as well as key members of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. 
4.5.11.3 Analysis of Phosphatase Tensin Homolog Expression 
PTEN status will be examined by IHC using a protocol that has been validated for specificity using several available cell line controls at a central laboratory.  Tumor specimen will be scored only if appropriate staining is observed in internal control stromal or normal (non-tumor) tissue elements.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 81 4.5.11.4 Confirmation of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, 
and HER2 Status 
ER, PR, and HER2 status will be determined at a central laboratory according to the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. 
4.5.11.5 Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis 
ctDNA will be extracted from plasma samples collected from patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations using appropriate technologies.  The prevalence of 
the mutations measured at baseline and post-treatment may provide information on response or resistance to therapy. 
4.5.11.6 Messenger RNA Expression Profiling 
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression will be performed using gene expression assays conducted on the NanoString platform or equivalent.  Analysis may include, but is not limited to, a panel of genes important for intrinsic subtyping, breast cancer biology and PI3K signaling.  The goal will be to generate a database of expression status to examine whether there are gene expression patterns that are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
4.5.11.7 Next Generation Sequencing 
In cases where there is sufficient material to isolate DNA, NGS will be performed using NGS platforms, such as Illumina or equivalent. The goal will be to deter mine whether the 
percentage of genetic mutations are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
4.5.11.8 Copy Number Analysis  
The level of copy number alterations in cancer-related genes may be determined using DNA-based technologies, either cytogenetically using chromosomal in situ hybridization (ISH), using next-generation sequencing platforms or by RT-PCR-based or equivalent technologies.  For cytogenetic assays, detection may be either fluorescence-based (fluorescence in situ hybridization assay) or chromogenic-based (chromogenic in situ hybridization).  Increased copy number of PI3K pathways activating genes may provide information on response or resistance to therapy.  
4.5.11.9 Plasma Biomarker Analyses 
Assays to assess the expression of soluble,  systemic cytokines, and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using appropriate methodologies, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based or mass spectrometry-based or equivalent technologies.   
4.5.11.10 Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Plasma GDC-0032 and letrozole samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 82 After the plasma samples are analyzed, any remaining samples may be used for 
exploratory metabolite profiling and identification, ex vivo protein binding, and PK, or pharmacodynamic assay development purposes. 
4.5.11.11 Pharmacogeneti c Polymorphism Assay 
If approved by the local regulatory authority, gene mutations will be assayed using multiplex PCR, allele-specific PCR, direct sequencing, or other acceptable methods.  Results may be correlated to population PK parameters or other clinical measures in order to better understand the impact of genetic variants on drug metabolism, exposure, adverse events, and/or response.   
A sample will also be utilized as a source of normal DNA to determine whether sequence 
variants in the PIK3CA gene and in other relevant oncogenes in the tumor DNA are somatic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
4.5.11.12 Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.11.13 DLCO Testing 
A diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test will be required at baseline and at the end of study-drug treatment (prior to surgery) for all patients.  The DLCO test should be repeated if there is clinical suspicion of pneumonitis.  Further guidance regarding DLCO testing is contained in Appendix 7 and in the management 
guidelines for pneumonitis (Section 5.1.1.2 ).   
4.5.11.14 Osteoporosis Asses sment and Monitoring 
Treatment with aromatase inhibitors results in bone loss due to estrogen deficiency  
(Gaillard and Stearns 2011) .  For patients who have a history of osteoporosis and/or 
fractures, or who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, a bone mineral density assessment will be required at baseline prior to initiating study treatment.  Baseline bone mineral density will be measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  DXA measurement of both the hip and lumbar spine is suggested.  When either the hip or lumbar spine is not a valid skeletal site for a bone mineral density measurement, then the 33% (one-third) radius should be measured.   In some patients, measurement of the 
hip alone could be sufficient. 
Appropriate monitoring in these patients will occur per institutional guidelines.  
Assessment for fractures is already included as part of the scheduled physical examinations.  Determination of patients w ho are at increased risk for osteoporosis will 
be per institutional guidelines.  Clinical risk factors for fracture include advancing age, previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, parental history of hip fracture, low body weight, current cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
conditions predisposing to  secondary osteoporosis (e.g., hypogonadism or premature 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 83 menopause, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease) 
(Kanis et al. 2005).   
4.5.12 Patient-Reported Outcomes   
PRO data will be elicited from the patients in this study to more fully characterize the clinical profile of GDC-0032.  The PRO questionnaires, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient.  To ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, PRO questionnaires should be self-administered at the investigational site prior to the completion of other study assessments and the administration of study treatment.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and the Modified Breast Cancer module QLQ-BR23 
questionnaires will be used to assess HRQoL, including side-effects of systemic therapy (e.g., sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, skin problems) and patient functioning during the neoadjuvant period (refer to schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 1 for a detailed description of timepoints) and post-surgery follow-up.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used HRQoL measure in oncology trials with excellent 
psychometric properties demonstrating both relia bility and validity. The measure consists 
of “five functional sca
les (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom 
scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale” with a recall period of “the past week” (Aaronson et al. 1993). Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item scales, global health status/QoL scale, and six single items by using a liner transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score.   
The EORTC QLQ-BR23 breast cancer module was first validated for use in 1995, uses a 
recall period of “the past week,” and is intended for use across multiple treatment modalities (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment).  As this trial will include patients in the neo-adjuvant setting, the last seven items of the original BR23 questionnaire, items numbered 47
 − 53 that deal with symptoms and side effects 
not relevant to the population under study, will be removed.  These seven items addressed symptoms experienced by metastatic breast cancer patients and those undergoing radiation.  Therefore, in consultation with the EORTC, these items were deleted, as the validity of the measure would not be compromised by their removal.  In addition, as “oral mucositis” and “skin problem s” are key symptoms of this therapy not 
assessed by currently available tools, validated items from the EORTC item bank were added to assess the presence and bothersomeness of oral mucositis (2 items:  sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing) and skin problems (2 items).  Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item and single-item scales by using a linear transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 84 The PRO instruments, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by 
the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient.  Patients must 
complete these instruments in the clinic (cannot be taken home) prior to any healthcare provider interactions (i.e., prior to administration of study drug and prior to any other study assessment) to ensure that the validity of the instruments are not compromised and to ensure that data quality meet regulatory requirements. 
Refer to Appendix 4 for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified QLQ-BR23. 
4.5.13 Samples for Clinical Repository  
All residual samples (or leftover biologic samples after protocol-defined studies are 
completed) obtained during the study (FFPE, fresh-frozen, plasma, etc.) will be stored in an academic central repository.  The specim ens in the study repository will be made 
available for future biomarker research towards further understanding of treatment with GDC-0032, of breast cancer, related diseases, and adverse events, and for the development of potential, associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation of study repository specimens is governed by the Study Steering Committee, with guidance from a dedicated Translational Research Committee to ensure the appropriate use of the study specimens. 
All biomarker specimens will be retained for new  research related to this study and/or 
disease in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Study Steering 
Committee.  Samples will be only destroyed if required by local laws relating to the collection, storage, and destruction of biological specimens. 
Specimens will be stored up to 15 years or unt il they are exhausted.  The storage period 
will be in accordance with the institutional review board/ethics committee 
(IRB/EC)-approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as describ
ed below.   
4.5.13.1 Confidentiality 
Patient medical information associated with biologic specimens is confidential and may only be disclosed to third parties as permitted by the ICF (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by law. 
Data derived from biologic specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The 
aggregate results of any research conducted using biologic specimens will be available in accordance with the effective Translational Reseach Committee policy on study data publication. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 85 4.6 PATIENT, TREATMENT, STUD Y, AND SITE DISCONTINUATION 
4.6.1 Patient Discontinuation  
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  
Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study 
• Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient 
• Patient non-compliance 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain inform ation on patients who withdraw from the 
study.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
4.6.2 Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients must discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following: 
• Pregnancy 
• Disease progression 
• Unacceptable toxicity 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced. 
4.6.3 Conditions for Terminating the Study  
Both the Sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate their participation in the study under the circumstances agreed upon in the site agreement.  Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual basis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, the Sponsor and investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interest. 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
GDC-0032 is not approved and is currently in early clinical development.  Thus, the entire safety profile is not known at this ti me.  Human experience is currently limited.  
The following information is based on results from ongoing clinical studies .  The safety 
plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 86 Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities (see Section 5.3.5.3), defined 
and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  General safety assessments will includ
e 
serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistry and blood counts.  All serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest will be reported in an expedited fashion, via fax to Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) safety department and also captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  In addition, the Sponsor and the investigators will review and evaluate obser ved adverse events on a regular basis. 
All adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until the end of study visit, whichever occurs later.  Patients who have an ongoing study treatment-related adverse event upon study completion or at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be attributed by the investigator to study drug or to another 
clearly identified etiology by the investigator (see Table 9).  
Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, a
s well as measures intended to 
avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.  
5.1.1 Management of Specifi c Adverse Events of GDC-0032  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.  
Additional guidelines are provided in the subsec
tions below.  
Due to the approximately 40-hour half-life for GDC-0032, investigators should consider holding GDC-0032 for certain Grade 2 toxicities until the adverse event resolves to Grade ≤  1 as discussed below (e.g., stomatitis/mucositis, colitis, rash, diarrhea, 
pneumonitis).  Certain toxicities can occur within 1 −2 weeks of holding or discontinuing 
GDC-0032 drug (e.g., pneumonitis, colitis, rash).  In these cases, the adverse event eventually resolves.  Investigators should follow management guidelines and dose 
modifications for toxicities as described below, including administration of topical or systemic corticosteroids as appropriate.

Adverse Events 
 GDC-0032 
Starting dose 4 mg at 5 days on / 2 days off 
First reduction 2 mg at 5 days on / 2 days off  
Second reduction  2 mg at 3 days on / 4 days off a 
 a If the patient continues to experience specified drug-related adverse 
events after the second dose redu ction, the treatment should be 
discontinued.   
5.1.1.1 Management of Hyperglycemia 
Metformin is the first antihyperglycemic medica tion of choice because of the lower risk of 
hypoglycemia with this agent.  Because metformin in some patients may also cause 
diarrhea and not be well tolerated, other antihyperglycemic medications such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride, glipizide) can be used.  Extra caution should be used with other drugs such as sulfonylureas because of the increased risk for hypoglycemia with these agents.  Consultation with an endocrinologist can be helpful in managing hyperglycemia.   
Specific dose modification and management gui delines for hyperglycemia are provided 
in Table 2. 
Table 2 Dose Modification and Management Guidelines for 
Hyperglycemia (Based on Fasting Blood Glucose) 
Grade Dose Modification and Management Guidelines for Hyperglycemia 
(based on fasting blood glucose) 
Grade 2 Initiation of an anti-hyperglycemic agent (e.g., metformin) and 
additional glucose monitoring will be implemented.   
Dosing with GDC-0032 may either be held or continued per 
investigator evaluation. 
Grade 3  
(asymptomatic) GDC-0032 dosing will be suspended and the patient will be 
managed as per standard of care, including implementation of additional glucose monitoring and initiation of, or an increase in, the 
dose of an anti-hyperglycemic therapy (e.g., metformin).

60 mg daily followed by a taper (e.g., 60 mg  × 2 days, 40 mg  × 2 days, 20 mg  × 2 days, 
etc.).   
5.1.1.4 Management of G astrointestinal Toxicity 
5.1.1.4.1 Management of Diarrhea  and Colitis  
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed per protocol guidelines and institut ional standard of care.  For example, 
prompt management of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold GDC-0032 for Grade ≥  2 diarrhea.     
Steroid-responsive diarrhea and colitis have been difficult to distinguish in patients treated with GDC-0032.  All cases of colitis have been reversible with corticosteroid 
treatment.  Prompt initiation of corticosteroids for persistent diarrhea despite antidiarrheal treatment can decrease the severity of the diarrhea and prevent the need for hospitalizations.  Patients who develop severe steroid-responsive diarrhea usually 
have been on GDC-0032 treatment for at least 2 months, with an average onset between 4
 − 6 months of treatment.  A stool cultur e is helpful in identifying concurrent 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 91 infections, and patients have been successfully treated with concurrent steroids and 
appropriate antibiotics if needed.  
If a patient is being treated with corticosteroids, total parenteral nutrition is 
discouraged as this increases the risk for severe hyperglycemia.  Discontinuation of nonsteroidal inflammatory medications or other medications that exacerbate colitis are also recommended during colitis episodes.   
Perforated duodenal ulcer has been observed in 2 patients (one patient at 6 mg in 
combination with letrozole; another patient at 6mg in combination with fulvestrant).  Appropriate caution should be taken with the administration of medications such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids, which can increase the risk of gastritis, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal perforation. 
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea and colitis are 
provided in Table 5.  
Table 5 GDC-0032 Dose Modificati on and Management Guidelines 
for Diarrhea  and Colitis 
Grade of Diarrhea Dose Modification and Management Guidelines  
Grade 1 • Manage per institutional standa rd of care that includes 
antidiarrheals.a 
• For persistent Grade 1 diarrhea occurring after Cycle 2, 
recommend evaluation for infectious causes via stool culture.b  
For noninfectious diarrhea, consider colonoscopy to evaluate for 
colitis.   
Grade 2 • Hold GDC-0032 and initially manage with antidiarrheals.a 
• Obtain stool culture for infectious workup. b  Infections (e.g., 
Clostridium difficile, enteric bacteria, CMV) should be treated with the appropriate antibiotic.  
• For persistent Grade 2 non-infectious diarrhea lasting longer 
than 48 hours despite treatment with antidiarrheals , treat with 
oral corticosteroids  (20
 − 40 mg prednisone QD starting dose 
with taper) or budesonide  9 mg PO QD.  
• If Grade 2 diarrhea occurred after Cycle 2, was a recurrent 
episode, or improved with corticosteroid treatment, resume 
GDC-0032 treatment at one dose level lower upon improvement 
to Grade ≤ 1 and after completion of  corticosteroid treatment.   
• If Grade 2 diarrhea occurred before Cycle 2, did not require 
corticosteroid treatment, and was an initial episode, resume 
GDC-0032 treatment  at the same dose upon improvement to 
Grade ≤ 1.  
• For Grade 2 colitis, resume GDC-0032 treatment at one dose level lower upon improvement to Grade 
≤ 1 and after 
completion of corticosteroid treatment. 
  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 92 Grade of Diarrhea Dose Modification and Management Guidelines  
• If Grade 2 diarrhea does not improve after 48 hours of 
corticosteroid treatment, a colonoscopy is recommended to 
evaluate for other causes of diarrhea (e.g., CMV colitis).  
Grade 3 (first episode)   • Hold GDC-0032 and initially with  antidiarrheals.
 a   
• Obtain stool culture for infectious workup. b 
• For G3 diarrhea or colitis, treat with systemic corticosteroids 
(prednisone 60  − 80 mg QD equivalent or solumedrol 16  − 20 
mg IV q8hr to start).  Can increase steroid dosage if diarrhea 
does not improve. 
• Concurrent infections (e.g., Clostridium difficile, enteric 
bacteria, CMV) should be treated with the appropriate 
antibiotic.  
• For patients who do not improve upon 48 hours of 
corticosteroid treatment, a colonoscopy is recommended to 
evaluate for other causes of diarrhea (e.g., CMV colitis).   
• If diarrhea or colitis improves to Grade ≤ 1 and upon 
completion of any steroid taper or antibiotic treatment, resume GDC-0032 treatment at one dose level lower.  
Grade 3 (recurrent) or Grade 4 • Permanently discontinue GDC-0032.   
• Workup and treatment algorithm as for Grade 3 (first episode). 
• If patient receiving endocrine therapy, upon recovery to Grade  
≤ 1, can resume endocrine therapy alone.   
CMV  = cytomegalovirus; IV  = intravenous;  PO  = oral; QD  = once daily; q8hr  = every eight 
hours; SOC  = standard of care. 
a Suggested antidiarrheals include the followin g: loperamide (initial: 4 mg, followed by 
2 mg after each loose stool, up to 16 mg/day); diphenoxylate and atropine 
(Diphenoxylate 5 mg 4 times/day until control achieved [maximum:  20 mg/day], then reduce dose as needed; some patients may be controlled on doses of 5 mg/day; tincture 
of opium (6 mg of undiluted opiu m tincture [10 mg/mL]) 4 times daily. 
b Non-infectious diarrhea can be diagnosed by stool culture with workup for various 
enteric bacteria and C. difficile. Fecal calprotectin is a possible marker for bowel inflammation.  Blood-based CMV PCR test can also be used to detect CMV infection. 
  
5.1.1.4.2 Management of Stom atitis and Oral Mucositis 
Aggressive mouth care for oral mucositis and stomatitis with mouthwash formulations 
(e.g., combinations of local anesthetic, antihistamine, corticosteroid, antacid, antifungal and/or antibiotics) may also be helpful in managing symptoms, and it is recommended that these are implemented with early signs of dry mouth, Grade 1 mucositis, or Grade 1 stomatitis (see Table 6).  Avoidance of spicy foods may also be helpful.

All grades • Aggressive mouth care that includes mouthwash 
formulations (e.g., combinations of local anesthetic, antihistamine, corticosteroid, antacid, antifungal and/or 
antibiotics)  
• Diet management (e.g., avoidance of spicy foods) 
Grade 1 • Monitor symptoms and initiate management (see above). 
Re-evaluate within 48  − 72 hours.   
Grade 2 • Hold GDC-0032 and manage until Grade  ≤ 1.   
• Restart GDC-0032 at the same dose.   
• If Grade 2 stomatitis/oral mucositis recurs, hold GDC-0032 
until Grade  ≤ 1.  Restart GDC-0032 at the next lower dose. 
Grade 3 • Hold GDC-0032 and manage until Grade  ≤ 1.  Restart 
GDC-0032 at the next lower dose.  
For Grade 3 event that was not adequately managed upon 
initial presentation, consider restarting at same dose upon 
discussion with Medical Monitor.   
Grade 4 • Permanently discontinue GDC-0032. 
  
5.1.2 Management of Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
Some patients have experienced elevations of liver function tests (e.g., AST or ALT). 
Patients will be monitored throughout the st udy treatment for changes in liver function 
tests.  Given the potential for hepatic toxicity, all patients must have adequate liver 
function as manifested by measurements of  serum bilirubin, hepatic transaminases, and 
alkaline phosphatase for initial and continued dosing.  Separate crit eria for eligibility, 
continued dosing, and DLT are given for pati ents with hepatic metastases and Grade 2 
hepatic transaminase and/or alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline to allow safety 
testing to be adequately assessed in this patient group.   
For new abnormal liver function tests (e.g., elevated AST or ALT), a standard clinical 
work-up to understand the etiology of the abnormality should take place per local 
guidelines.  In many cases, elevated liver function tests may be a result of liver 
metastases, concomitant medications, or biliary obstruction.  Dose modifications for 
elevated liver function tests are described in Table 7.   
5.1.3 Management of Asymptomatic Lipase and/or Amylase 
Elevations  
Some patients treated with  GDC-0032 have experienced asymptomatic lipase and/or 
amylase elevations in blood tests without any clinical or radiographic symptoms of 
pancreatitis or another clear etiology for the abnormal laboratory values.  Upon 
discussion with the Medical Monitor and after a risk-benefit assessment, investigators 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 94 can consider continuing GDC- 0032 therapy in such patients  at the same dose or one 
dose level lower.  Investigators should have a low threshold for interrupting GDC-0032 
for any concerning clinical gastrointestinal toxicities. 
5.1.4 Management of Other Clin ically Significant Adverse Events  
See Table 7 for the dose modifications for other clinically significant adverse events. 
Table 7 GDC-0032 Dose Delay and Mo dification Guidelines for Other 
Clinically Significant Adverse Events 
Grade GDC-0032  
Grade 3:  first event • Hold GDC-0032 until Grade ≤ 1.  
• Consider restarting at next lower dose. 
Grade 3:  recurrent 
Grade 4:  non-life-threatening • Hold GDC-0032 until Grade ≤ 1.  
• Restart at next lower dose. 
Grade 4:  life-threatening • Permanently discontinue GDC-0032.  
  
5.1.5 General Guidance for Dose Modifications and Delays for 
Letrozole  
The letrozole dose level cannot be modified.  In general, the investigator can consider 
continuing letrozole if it is not thought to be letrozole-related.   
All dose modifications should be based on the adverse event requiring the greatest 
modification and should be properly documented in the source documents. 
5.1.6 Management of Increases in QT Interval  
Study drug should be discontinued in patients who develop any of the following, unless there is a clear alternative cause for the changes: 
1. Sustained (at least two ECG measurements 
 > 30 minutes apart) QTcF that 
is  > 500 msec and  > 60 msec longer than the baseline value 
2. Sustained absolute QTcF that is  > 515 msec  
3. An episode of torsades de pointes or a new ECG finding of clinical concern 
 
Of note, if there is a new intraventricular conduction block, the increase in QRS complex 
duration should be subtracted from the QTcF change, as this represents an increase in QTcF unrelated to alterations in repolarization.  Also of note, it is not uncommon to record arrhythmias such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, pauses, or atrial fibrillation in healthy volunteers receiving placebo during 
periods of extended ECG monitoring.  Therefore, it is critical that expert electrophysiologic advice be sought to conf irm any ECG changes and to ascertain the 
likelihood of a drug-induced arrhythmia versus the background occurrence of this arrhythmia.  In such a situation, saving all available ECG data is highly suggested. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 95 Management of patients with sustained QTcF prolongation should include close 
monitoring, with ECGs repeated at least hourly until two successive ECGs show resolution of the findings, correction of any electrolyte abnormalities, and possible discontinuation of other concomitant medications that are known to prolong the QT interval.  Consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is recommended, to help in the management of such patients. 
In rare circumstances, it may be acceptable to resume study drug, at a lower dose, 
provided that any ECG abnormalities have resolved and the patient is appropriately monitored.  Clinical judgment should be applied. 
5.1.7 Safety Monitoring for Letrozole  
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal AI indicated for first line treatment of hormone receptor positive, locally advanced, or metastatic  breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  
Letrozole is also indicated for adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal hormone-receptor positive patients and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following anti-estrogen therapy. 
The most frequently reported adverse events in a first line, breast cancer clinical trial 
with letrozole were bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, arthralgia, and dyspnea.  Clinically significant adverse events also include bone effects (osteoporosis and bone fractures) and hypercholesterolemia.  Discontinuations for adverse events other than progression of tumor occurred in 2% of patients on letrozole.  Refer to the U.S. letrozole Package Insert or SmPC for additional information.   
There are no expected significant overlapping toxicities between letrozole and 
GDC-0032. Routine safety monitoring and periodic laboratory tests for the letrozole and GDC-0032 combination will occur throughout the study. 
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS 
Safety assessments will consist of monito ring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest; measurement of protocol-specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 96 5.2.1 Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical  investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.9  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to ABCSG)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 97 Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to ABCSG safety 
department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.3 Non-Serious Adverse Events of  Special Interest (Immediately 
Reportable to ABCSG)  
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by the 
investigator to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of 
special interest for this study include 
 the following: 
• Grade 4 hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  3 symptomatic hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  2 colitis or enterocolitis  
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
• Grade  ≥  3 rash 
• Grade  ≥  2 pneumonitis  
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s 
law (see Section 5.3.5.5) 
• Suspected tr ansmission
 of an infectious agent by the study drug   
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and additionally reported to ABCSG 
safety department in case they fulfill t
he criteria for expedited reported in accordance 
with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4 − Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event CRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriou
sness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3), and causality (se
e Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study 
drug, will be reported until 30 days  after the last dose of study drug or until the end of 
study visit, whichever occurs later.  After this period, investigators should report any deaths, serious adverse events, or other adv erse events of concern deemed related to 
prior study drug treatment or study procedures (Section 5.6). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 98 5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 8 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE. 
Table 8 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale 
Grade Severity 
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 
3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization indicated; disabling; or 
limiting self-care activities of daily living b,c 
4 Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated d

NCI CTCAE  = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v 4.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b Examples of self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dr essing and undressing, 
feeding one's self, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who 
are not bedridden. 
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medi cal event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions),  per the definition of seriou s 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instruction
s), per the definiti on of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 99 5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 9): 
• Temporal relationship of  event onset to the initiat
ion of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study • Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
Table 9 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO Adverse events will be consid ered related, unless they fulf ill the criteria as specified 
below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 100 If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by one adverse event 
report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
5.3.5.1 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
5.3.5.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  The progression (increase and decrease) of an adverse event must be documented in the Adverse Event eCRF.   
The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated 
to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens. If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 101 5.3.5.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 times the ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
5.3.5.4 Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 102 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
5.3.5.5 Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests  as Hy’s Law  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the 
following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) 
and reported to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learnin g of the event), either as se
rious adverse event or a non-serious adverse 
event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
5.3.5.6 Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to ABCSG safety department (see Section 5.4.2 ). This 
includes death attributed to progression of breast cancer. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 103 death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be 
replaced by the established cause of death. 
5.3.5.7 Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only  if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”). 
5.3.5.8 Hospitalization or  Prolonged Hospitalization 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalizat ion (i.e., in-patient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2), except as outlined 
below.   
The following hospitalization scenar ios are not
 considered to be adverse events: 
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study 
• Hospitalization for respite care • Planned hospitalization required by the protocol for breast cancer surgery  
• Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
• The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during 
the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the 
expected normal progression of the disease 
• The patient has not suffered an adverse event 
• Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer 
 
• Hospitalization for outpatient care outside of normal clinic operating hours that is 
required per protocol or per local standard of care 
• Hospitalization for protocol mandated biopsies 
 
5.3.5.9 Adverse Events Asso ciated with an Overdose 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 104 5.3.5.10 Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any patient 
responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO questionnaires, site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the patient's medical record per site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an adverse event, it will be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO ABCSG 
Certain events require immediate reporting to  allow ABCSG safety department to take 
appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report such events to ABCSG safety department immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to ABCSG safety department within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events 
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest 
• Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report new significant follow-up information for these events to 
ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results 
• Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery • Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, 
investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fax. In addition the serious adverse event and non-serious adverse event of special interest informat ion will be captured in the EDC system.   
Worldwide Sites: ABCSG safety department  
Fax No.: +43 1 409 09 90 
Relevant follow-up information should be s ubmitted to ABCSG safety department as 
soon as it becomes available and/or upon request. 
5.5 FOLLOW-UP OF PATIEN TS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.5.1 Investigator Follow-Up  
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. 
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilit ate source data 
verification (SDV).  For follow-up reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, investigators should record all follow up information immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fa x. In addition the serious adverse event 
and non-serious adverse event of special interest follow-up information will be captured in the EDC system. If, after follow-up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and paper Serious Adverse Event form, if applicable.   
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome, 
and they should be reported according to the instructions provided in Section 5.4. 
5.5.2 Sponsor Follow-Up  
For serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the Sponsor and/or ABCSG safety department or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 106 consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical 
assessment of the reported case. 
5.6 POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
At the time of study completion or study discontinuation, the investigator should instruct each patient to report to the investigator any subsequent adverse events that the patient’s personal physician believes could be related to prior study drug treatment or study procedures.   
The investigator is not required to actively monitor patients for adverse events after the 
end of the adverse event reporting period (30 days after the last dose of study drug).  However, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any death, other serious adverse event, or non-serious adverse event of special interest occurring after the end of the adverse event reporting period, regardless of causality.  The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.
 
The investigator should report these events by completing and faxing a paper Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form and fax cover sheet to Safety Risk Management using 
the fax numbers provided to investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of Investigators”).  
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all seri ous adverse events and non-serious adverse 
events of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events us ing the following reference documents: 
• GDC-0032 Investigator's Brochure   
• Local prescribing information for letrozole SmPC 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 107 An IDMC will monitor the incidence of t he above-listed anticipated events during the 
study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the 
test product will be submitted to health authorities. 
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization. Final analysis will be performed after last patient, last visit (LPLV) and subsequent data cleaning, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated by randomization. 
Safety analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization and 
received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
This study is designed for testing the effect of GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 
330 patients in total. Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available 
(unknown) for approximately 10% of the patients and the prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant 
is 40%, there will be approximately 120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, 
there might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT 
cohort, which may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical power even when the treatment assignment is imbalanced, 
the sample size was calculated based on a conservative scenario by assuming that the treatment assignment imbalance in PIK3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was 
calculated based on a chi²-test using continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable for the MRI ORR, approximately 
300 enrolled patients and 108 patients in the PIK3CA  MT cohort will be evaluable for 
analyses. This sample size allows us to detect an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-0032 plus letr ozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only 
arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power 
and 16% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. 
Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled 
patients and 120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 108 detect an absolute percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole 
arm (19%) versus the letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA MT cohort at the 4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more 
substantial treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA MT cohort than assumed, or 
there is an increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  MT.   
6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY 
Enrollment, study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be summarized overall and by treatment arm. The incidence of study treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression will be tabulated. 
6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPARABILITY 
Demographic variables, stratification factors, and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment arm. 
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the ITT population; that is, all randomized patients will be included in the analyses, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are (1) tumor ORR, assessed by modified RECIST 
criteria by breast MRI (centrally assessed) and (2) the rate of pCR in breast and axilla 
(total pCR) after completion of study drug. 
The tumor ORR will be calculated by treatment arm in all enrolled population and in 
PIK3CA MT population . Within each population, the ORR for the two treatment arms will 
be compared at a two-sided alpha of 16% using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status. The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR. The two alpha values account for a family-wise type I error rate of 20%. Patients with early study termination and hence missing efficacy outcome will be considered as non-responders. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatment, assessed by modified RECIST 
criteria by breast MRI (centrally assessed) in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 109 • Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug in 
PIK3CA  WT patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be 
analyzed analogue to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by PIK3CA  mutation status  (centrally assessed): 
• ORR using modified RECIST criteria  by the following methods:  clinical breast 
examination, mammography, and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) 
• Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to 
surgery (centrally assessed) 
• PEPI score (centrally derived ) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by breast 
MRI 
• Evaluation of different definitions of pCR including the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and 
b) ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR) 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be compared 
between the two treatment arms within each population based on appropriate statistical analyses:  ORR will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by regression analyses, adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All secondary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES 
Safety analyses will include all patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory 
test results, changes in vital signs, and letrozole and GDC-0032 exposure. 
Verbatim descriptions of adverse events will be mapped to thesaurus terms.  Adverse 
event data will be listed by study site, tr eatment arm, patient number, and study day, 
severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, and action taken with the study treatments.  Events occurring on or after treatment on Day 1 of Week 1 will be summarized by thesaurus term, appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade.  Serious adverse events, including deaths, will be listed separately and will be summarized.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 110 Relevant laboratory and vital sign (heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) data will 
be displayed by time, with NCI CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 and 4 values identified, where appropriate.  Additionally, all laboratory data will be summarized in tables by NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade. 
6.6 PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSES   
Ki67 biomarker analyses will include patients with at least one predose and one postdose biomarker assessment, with patients grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
6.7 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES   
Individual C max and trough plasma concentrations (C min) of GDC-0032 and letrozole from 
all patients enrolled will be reported. Mean of trough plasma concentrations of GDC-0032 and letrozole will be tabulated. The population pharmacokinetics of letrozole and GDC-0032 in this study will be compared with historical single-agent pharmacokinetics to assess the potential DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole in this population.   
Additional PK analyses on metabolites of GDC-0032, letrozole, and/or other concomitant 
medications may be conducted as appropriate. 
6.8 PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME ANALYSES  
Patient-reported outcomes of breast cancer symptoms, patient functioning, and HRQoL will be assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified Breast Cancer module 
(QLQ-BR23)  
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median and range) of linear transformed scores will be reported for all the items and subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, and the modified QLQ-BR23 according to the EORTC scoring manual guidelines for each assessment time point. The mean change of the linear transformed scores from baseline (and 95% CI using the normal approximation) will also be assessed. Line charts depicting the mean changes (and standard errors) of items and subscales over time will be provided for each treatment arm from the baseline assessment. 
Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the 
final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  
Completion and compliance rates will be summarized at each timepoint by treatment 
arm with reasons for missing data. Only patients with a baseline assessment and at least one post-treatment assessment will be included in the analyses. The number and proportion of patients who improved, worsened, or remained stable for all of the 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 111 symptom and functional domains, global QoL, and single items of the EORTC QLQ-C30 
and QLQ-BR23 will be summarized. 
6.9 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES   
Additional details on analyses will be specified in the SAP. 
6.10 INTERIM ANALYSES   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to review the unblinded safety data after the first 20 patients have either 1) finished the 30-day, follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the 
surgery) , whichever occurs first .  All available information of all enrolled patients with all 
available assessments at the respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.  In addition, the IDMC or the Medical Monitor may request additional ad hoc meetings of the IDMC at any time during the study to review safety data. 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ABCSG will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, ABCSG and/or all involved clinical research associat es (CRAs) will request data clarification from 
the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
ABCSG will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including review of the ABCSG’s data management plan and corresponding specifications.  Data will be transferred electronically from ABCSG to the Sponsor at the end of the study and whenever otherwise contractually agreed, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at ABCSG and  records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the ABCSG’s standard procedures. 
Data from paper PRO questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by site staff. 
Original PRO questionnaires will be kept in the patient’s medical record as source documentation. 
7.2 DATA(BASE) MANAGEMENT 
ABCSG Clinical Data Management will check all e-forms for plausibility and consistency by automatic edit checks and manual data review according to study-specific data management plan (DMP).  If necessary, web-based data queries (data clarification 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 112 requests [DCRs]) will be generated and subsequently visible for the investigators, 
dedicated site staff, responsible CRAs, and responsible ABCSG staff.  For those eCRFs which pass all verification procedures and are regarded as correct and complete, they will be frozen subsequently by ABCSG c linical data management.  Consequently, no 
further data entries or changes on frozen eCRFs are possible. The status of frozen eCRFs is flagged by the specific icon. 
Clinical Data Management ensures that the database is corrected for the following eCRF 
issues without immediate notification to site staff (self-evident corrections).  Notification of site staff is provided via a specific report after final data cleaning procedures and before final data confirmation by the investigator or a designee: 
• misspellings/typing errors that do not change the meaning of the word 
• location of data recorded at an incorrect variable field or eForm (e.g., moving lab 
data from general comments to the appropriate lab table) 
• standard time to 24-hour clock 
• correction of date format, if required (dd/mm/yyyy) • if equivalent units of terms are recorded instead of the acceptable ABCSG standard 
• data changes due to plausibility checks and eCRF content (e.g., combination of 
several variables and/or eCRFs) 
All data management workflows are described in detail in the relevant SOPs and 
working instructions of ABCSG. 
7.3 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed using the Clinical Data Management System “MACRO,” a web-interface DATAPORT.  Sites will receiv e training by the responsible CRAs and have 
access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion (web data entry).   
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff in a timely manner, 
usually within 2 weeks after the patient visit.  Electronic CRFs should be reviewed and respective data confirmation eCRF should be electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee at the end of the study.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a storage medium (compact disc [CD], digital video disk [DVD] etc.) 
that must be kept with the study records.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the storage medium is required. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 113 7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors (CRAs) will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that criti cal protocol data 
(i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, 
complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigators a nd institut
ions must provide the Sponsor/CRAs 
direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The investigational site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change. 
7.6 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, PRO data (if applicable), ICFs, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for the length of time 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 114 required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer. After that 
period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor. Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location. 
8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
This study will be conducted in full conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for GCP and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. The study will comply with the requirements of the ICH E2A guideline (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). Studies conducted in the United States or under a U.S. Investigational New Drug (IND) application will comply with U.S. FDA regulations and applicable local, state, and federal laws.  Studies conducted in the European Union/European Economic Area will comply with the E.U. Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC). 
8.2 INFORMED CONSENT 
The Sponsor’s sample ICF (and ancillary sample ICFs) will be provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample ICFs or any alternate cons ent forms proposed by the site (collectively, 
the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC submission.  The final IRB/EC-approved consent forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements. 
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the consent for optional donation 
of remaining samples for the clinical repository.   Samples stored in the clinical 
repository may be used for future exploratory research .  Patients will be told that they 
are free to refuse to donate their remaining samples to the clinical repository.   If 
patients choose to donate remaining samples, they  may withdraw their specimens at any 
time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be 
required to document a patient's agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be 
stored in the clinical repository.  
The ICFs must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative before participation in the study. The case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. 
The eCRF contains a section to document whether the patient has signed the ICF or not. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 115 The ICFs should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures or when 
new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate. The final revised IRB/EC-approved consent forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes. 
Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of the consent forms (or to a 
significant new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study. For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised consent forms for continued participation in the study. 
For patients not qualified or incapable of giving legal consent, written consent must be 
obtained from the legally acceptable representat ive. In the case where both the patient 
and his/her legally acceptable representativ e are unable to read, an impartial witness 
should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. After the patient and representative have orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature on the form will attest that the information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood. The investigator or designee must also explain that the patients are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason. 
A copy of each signed ICF must be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative. All signed and dated ICFs must remain in each patient’s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
For sites in the United States, each ICF may also include patient authorization to allow 
use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). If the site utilizes a separate authorization form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies. 
8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR ETHICS COMMITTEE 
This protocol, the ICFs, any information to be given to the patient, and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the sponsor, the affiliated groups, or contract research organizations (CROs) according to the applicable local laws and regulations, if applicable by the Principal Investigator, and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.  
The Sponsor, affiliated groups, or CROs are responsible for providing written summaries 
of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 116 the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the local IRB/EC. The 
Sponsor, affiliated groups, or CROs are also  responsible for promptly informing the 
IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see Section 9.6). 
In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse eve
nts to the Sponsor, 
investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the 
local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with local health authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and archived in the site’s study file.  
8.4 DATA PRIVACY 
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the study through assignment of a unique identif ication number. This means that patient 
names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location. 
Patient medical information obtained by th is study is confidential and may only be 
disclosed to third parties as permitted by the ICF (or separate authorization for use and 
disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by local law. 
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare, for treatment purposes, provided the patient has given consent. 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of the U.S. FDA and other national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate. The patient will have to consent to such access by signing the informed consent form. 
8.5 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study (i.e., LPLV). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 117 9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, MONITORING, AND 
ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of 
the study to be fully documented, including but  not limited to the protocol, protocol 
amendments, ICFs, and documentation of IRB/ EC and governmental (health authorities) 
approval. In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive the patient data, which includes an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data. 
9.2 ON SITE QUALITY CONTROL (MONITORING) 
During the study, CRAs will visit their respective sites on a regular basis as outlined in the study specific monitoring plan (MP) and all other relevant specifications, in order to guarantee adherence to the protocol and to the principles of GCP and to check for the progress of enrolment, adequate storage conditions of IMP and adequate drug dispensing and accounting records.  
CRAs will review documented data in the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy 
according to the study-specific MP, subsequently flag all reviewed pages with a specific mark (“SDV done”) within the EDC system “MACRO,” web-interface DATAPORT, developed by .  The CRAs will raise data queries (“DCRs”) in cases of 
missing source data or incorrect data entries. Immediately after electronic issue of the queries, they become visible to the investigator, the clinical data managers, and the ABCSG clinical safety officers (“raised  DCRs”).  CRAs and/or clinical data managers 
and/or ABCSG clinical safety officers will follow up with trial site personnel until final data query resolution. 
9.3 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
The investigator should document and expl ain any deviations from the approved 
protocol. The investigator should promptly  report any deviations that might impact 
patient safety and data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC policies and procedures. 
9.4 SITE INSPECTIONS 
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for inspection of study data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will permit international and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 
9.5 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE 
This trial will be sponsored by Genentech and will be managed by Genentech in 
collaboration with the Breast International Group (BIG), ABCSG, and  the SOLTI  Breast 
Cancer Research Group. Genentech in collaboration with BIG, ABCSG, and SOLTI will 

 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3 118 provide clinical operations management, data management, and medical monitoring.  
Approximately 110 U.S. and international site s will participate to enroll approximately 
330 patients. 
An IDMC will be in place throughout the study  and will provide oversight of safety and 
efficacy analyses (see Section 3.1.2). 
After written informed consent has been obtained, the study site will obtai n the patien
t’s 
screening number from the IxRS system. Once eligibility has been established, the 
patient will be enrolled, and the study site will obtain the patient’s identification number from the IxRS. Once results of the tissue anal ysis are made available, the patient will be 
randomized, and the site will obtain the bli nded treatment assignment from the IxRS.  
The IxRS will manage GDC-0032/placebo drug inventory at all sites and letrozole drug inventory at all study sites outside the United States.  IxRS will be required to randomize patients, to monitor enrollment and patient status, and to manage study treatment requests and shipments.  
Patient data will be recorded via an electronic data capture (EDC) system from  
( , United Kingdom), which will be managed by ABCSG using eCRFs (see Section 7.2).   
Central laboratories, including Genentech and Genentech collaborators, will be used for 
PIK3CA  
mutation detection, Ki67, and PTEN status and/or will provide kits for PK, 
pharmacogenomic, tissue, whole blood, and plasma sample analyses to be conducted at central laboratories, Genentech, or Genentech collaborators. 
An independent radiologic review facility will be used for the purpose of collecting and 
assessing the quality of patient scans throughout the trial. The review facility will retain 
copies of scans for centralized assessments of MRI-related endpoints .   
9.6 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
Any protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor.  Protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. 
Approval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authorities (as locally 
required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients or changes that involve logistical or administrative aspects only (e.g., change in Medical Monitor or contact information).

Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer 
Conventional response criteria may not be ideal for the assessment of response in the 
setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer. Therefore, RECIST 1.1 criteria have been modified to specifically address assessment of primary breast lesions along with axillary lymph node disease, using a range of breast imaging modalities.  Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1
1 
are presented below, with modifications and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity. For detailed information on the read methodology including how imaging data should be processed prior to reads, please refer to the Study Imaging Charter.  
 RECIST v1.1 Modified RECIST Early Breast 
Cancer Neoadjuvant Therapy 
Modalities CT as primary modality, 
ultrasound not 
recommended No CT; primary assessments by MRI; 
also assessments by ultrasound, 
mammography, and clinical exam  
Lymph nodes May be considered 
target lesions based on 
size criteria ( ≥ 15 mm in 
SAD) Only axillary lym ph nodes assessed; 
nodes that are considered abnormal on imaging (based on morphological factors including, but not limited to SAD) to be followed as non-target 
lesions 
Possibility of having only 
non-target disease Allowed Not allowed; primary breast lesions 
must be measurable by MRI 
CT = computed tomography; MRI  = magnetic resonance imaging; SAD  = short axis dimension. 
 
BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. All baseline evaluations shoul d be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Method of Measurement  
According to RECIST 1.1 guidelines, MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting.  CT is currently the preferred modality for assessing metastatic disease, but should not be used in this focused setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.  Ultrasound, mammography, and clinical exam are all

Protocol GO28888, Version 3   131 common and useful modalities for assessing breast lesions, and will also be used to 
assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Up to 2 
lesions in the breast may be identified as target lesions.  A sum of the diameters of all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, and 
lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see below for 
more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment. The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality. If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment time point, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as 
non-target lesions at baseline. Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in the 
assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions should 
be followed qualitatively, as described below at each response assessment timepoint.   
Appendix 3  
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3   132 Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged 
• Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum • Irregular margins or spiculations • Rim enhancement • Decreased echogenicity of cortex 
• Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.  While on study, all lesions 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.  
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is abl e to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.

Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3   133 Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment.   When non-nodal lesions fragment, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
• All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
• PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 3   134 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

Any Any Yes PD

PR  = partial response; SD  = stable disease.  
Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response. Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.

Protocol GO28888, Version 3   135 Special Notes on Response Assessment  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease as shown in Table 1.

Correction of Predicted DLCO for Hemoglobin and Alveolar 
Volume 
All DLCO measurements will be obtained as per the American Thoracic Society and 
European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines (MacIntyre et al. 2005).  The predicted DLCO value should be corrected for both hemoglobin (H
b) and alveolar 
volume (v a).   
Pulmonary function test laboratories that follow the ATS/ERS guidelines should be able to provide the value for DLCO, corrected for v
a.  A single breath v a may be used to obtain 
DLCO, corrected for va.  Use the following equation to determine the predicted DLCO, corrected for H
b and v a: 
Predicted DLCO, corrected for H b and v a = [DLCO, corrected for v a] × [1.7 ×  Hb / 
(9.38 +  Hb)] 
Use the formula below to determine the percentage of predicted DLCO value (now corrected both for H
b and v a):  
% of predicted DLCO  (corrected for H b and v a) = [actual DLCO / (predicted DLCO 
corrected for H b and v a)] × 100

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 2 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 2: 
RATIONALE 
Protocol GO28888 has been amended to include the following major changes: 
• Language has been amended to clarify that the investigator has the sole 
responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations.  These changes 
have been incorporated into Section 4.2.3 of the study protocol.  
• Because pneumonitis is a known GDC-0032 toxicity, additional screening and 
management of pulmonary function is an important safety consideration for this trial.  
Exclusion criteria have been updated to exclude patients with diffusion capacity of 
the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) values < 60% of predicted (Section 4.1.2).  
Calculations for DLCO have been included in Appendix 7.  Management guidelines 
for pneumonitis (Section 5.1.1.2) have been updated to repeat the DLCO test if 
there is clinical suspicion of pneumonitis.  The schedule of assessments has been updated to include DLCO testing at baseline and at the end of study treatment 
(Appendix 1, footnote n).  Additional language describing DLCO testing has been 
added to the study assessments in Section 4.5.11.13. 
• To ensure that the appropriate patients are enrolled into this study, exclusion criteria 
have been updated (Section 4.1.2) as follows:   
– Patients for whom upfront chemotherapy  is clinically judged appropriate as 
optimal neoadjuvant treatment will be excluded from this study.  
– Patients for whom immediate surgery is indicated will be excluded from this study. 
• Because letrozole is a potent estrogen-lowering agent, it can cause bone loss and 
may increase the risk of fractures.  Section 4.5.11.14 has been amended to include a baseline bone mineral density assessment and adequate monitoring of women 
with a history of osteoporosis and/or fractures, or who are at increased risk of 
osteoporosis.  The schedule of assessments (Appendix 1, footnote o) has been updated to reflect these changes.  In addition, protocol language has been added to 
ensure appropriate monitoring.   
• Section 4.4.2 has been amended to clarify that bisphosphonates can be used for the 
treatment of osteoporosis.   
• The list of prohibited therapies in Section 4.4.2 has been updated to include potent 
CYP3A4 inducers. 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.   This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

If unblinding is necessary for patient management (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse 
event for which patient management might be affected by knowledge of treatment 
assignment),  For emergency situations,  the investigator will be able to break the 
treatment code by contacting the IxRS following approval from .  The responsibility to

SECTION 4.4.2:  Prohibited Therapy  
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis in patients who have been receiving them at a stable 
dose for at l east 2 weeks prior to randomization.  Patients who develop osteopenia 
or osteoporosis in the follow up period may receive bone targeted therapy as per the 
clinician’s discretion.  Primary use of bisphosphonates as a prevention of bone 
metastasis or as a pr evention of bone loss is prohibited . … 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 4 • Potent CYP3A4 inducers:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital ) with GDC-0032 should be 
avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to induce 
CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inducer is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients 
should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
SECTION 4.5.11.13:  DLCO Testing 
A diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test will be required at 
baseline and at the end of study-drug treatment (prior to surgery) for all patients.  The DLCO test should be repeated if there is  clinical suspicion of pneumonitis.  Further 
guidance regarding DLCO testing is contained in Appendix 7 and in the management guidelines for pneumoni tis (Section 5.1.1.2). 
SECTION 4.5.11.14:  Osteoporosis Assessment and Monitoring 
Treatment with aromatase inhibitors results in  bone loss due to estrogen deficiency.  
For patients who have a history of osteoporosis and/or fractures, or who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, a bone mineral density assessment will be required at baseline prior to initiating study treatment.  Baseline bone mineral density wi ll be measured via 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  DXA measurement of both the hip and 
lumbar spine is suggested.  When either the hip or lumbar spine is not a valid skeletal 
site for a bone mineral density measurement, then the 33% (one-third) radius should be 
measured.  In some patients, measurement of the hip alone could be sufficient. 
Appropriate monitoring in these patients will occur per institutional guidelines.  Assessment for fractures is already included as part of the scheduled physical examinations.  Determination of  patients who are at increa sed risk for osteoporosis will 
be per institutional guidelines.  Clinical risk factors for fracture include advancing age, previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, parental history of hip fracture, low body weight, current cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and secondary osteoporosis (e.g., hypogonadism or premature menopause, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory  bowel disease) (Kanis et al., 2005).   
SECTION 5.1.1.2:  Management of Pneumonitis 
Patients who have DLCO values  < 60% will be excluded from the study.  … The DLCO 
test should be repeated if there is clinical suspicion of pneumonitis.  The DLCO test will also be repeated presurgery after completion of study treatment. 
TABLE 3:  Dose Modificat ion and Management Guid elines for Pneumonitis   
Table 3 has been revised to include diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) testing for managing pneumonitis.

Objectives  
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus 
letrozole plus placebo in women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) early stage breast  cancer, as measured by the following co-
primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by centrally assessed breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  mutant (MT) patients 
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in  breast and axilla (ypT 0/Tis ypN0) by local 
evaluation in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  MT patients 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor objective response rate (ORR), asse ssed by centrally assessed breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (total pC R ypT0/Tis ypN0) by local evaluation in PIK3CA  
wildtype (WT) patients  
The following secondary objectives will be perfo rmed in all enrolled patients and separated by 
PIK3CA  mutation status: 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-0032 with letrozole plus placebo in terms of locally assessed 
ORR using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) 
• Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery; and Week 3 to surgery.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 17 • Compare the centrally  assessed, preoperati ve endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score 
upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC- 0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by 
breast MRI via central assessment. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following: a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) ypT0/is, 
ypNX (breast pCR). 
Safety Objective 
The safety objective for this study is as follows: 
• Evaluate the safety of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo 
Patient-Reported Outcome Objectives   
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-re lated symptoms, patient functioning, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) betwee n treatment arms as measured by the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cancer Module (QLQ-BR23) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular comp osition as assessed by diffusion-weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited to 
somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN ex pression, pro-survival pathways (such as 
PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are 
predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with  GDC-0032 results in changes in downstream 
markers in tumor tissue and to examine t he relationship to anti-tumor activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline biopsy 
and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, enhancement, 
diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possible drug interaction between letrozole and GDC-
0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032  drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or letrozole 
on pharmacokinetics and response (eithe r efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in letrozole 
plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
Study Design  
Description of Study 
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate the 
effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated,  Stage I-III operable breast ca ncer whose primary tumors 
are
 ≥ 2 cm.  Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors  are not eligible.  Standard of care 
assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tiss ue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal cutting 
temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffi n-embedded cores [FFPE]). Two pretreatment 
FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to 
beginning study drug treatment.  Prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for 
enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), 
and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. ER, PR, HER2, and 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 18 the percentage of Ki67-positive cells will also be  centrally assessed, but the results do not have 
to be available prior to enrollment in the study.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future 
translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed. 
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization ratio.  
Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily pl us either GDC-0032 at 6 mg or placebo on a 
5 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A maximum of 
16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
After confirmation of all the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of the treatment 
arms.  A second biopsy will be performed on Day 15 (Week 3) for biomarker analyses. Biopsies 
should be performed at least 2 hours after GDC-0032 dose administration. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed according to 2 factors: 
1. Tumor size (T1-T2 vs. T3) 
2. Nodal status (cytologically positive vs . radiologically or cytologically negative) 
The study will enroll approximately 330 pati ents at approximately 110 global sites. 
At Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, and 16 the primar y breast tumor and axillary lymph nodes will be 
assessed by clinical breast ex amination (palpation and caliper measurement).  Suspicion of 
progression based on clinical exam at any time should be further evaluated (Figure 6).  
At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive disease 
and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspic ion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound 
should be confirmed by investigator-assessed br east MRI.  Patients with primary disease not 
evaluable by ultrasound at baseline should be assessed by MRI at Week 9.  Suspected 
progression in nodes should also be confirmed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) if these nodes 
had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patients with progressive 
disease (as defined by modified RECIST, Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or 
be taken off of the study, according to the invest igator’s decision. If the patient goes off-study, 
every reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another 
systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surg eon.  The purpose of th is visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. 
mastectomy) and scheduling the dat e for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. Clinical 
breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected at screening, at Week 3, and 
prior to surgery. 
Surgery 
Surgery will take place after at leas t 16 weeks of treatment, during Weeks 17
 − 18.  Surgery 
should be performed within 4 days after the last dose of GDC-0032, if possible, to best observe 
pharmacodynamic knockdown with GDC-0032 in the surgical specimen.  Surgery may be 
delayed due to toxicity or other safety issues, upon discussion with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section 5.4.1) or recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; 
see below).  A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.   
Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice . However, pre-surgical SLNB is not allowed. 
Information on the type of surgery will be co llected and recorded. Su rgery specimens will be 
collected for histological examination to as sess for pCR and for other endpoint analyses. 
Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local st andards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be de livered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, 
radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the end of 
the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at this visit and 
the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc.

Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g ., prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplement s) used by a patient from 7 days prior to 
screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.   
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4  in HLM and appeared to be a weak time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data 
from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate t hat 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in 
patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC 0032 may be adminis tered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates 
without the risk of a pharmacokineti c drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Prohibited Therapy 
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents such 
as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted t herapy, biological response modifiers, or 
endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topical estrogens (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is receiving 
these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast and/or 
regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment includi ng bisphosphonates and receptor activator 
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the management of 
osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomita n
t use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhi bit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 22 • Potent CYP3A4 inducers:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital ) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  
Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4.  If a 
strong CYP3A4 inducer is co-administered wi th GDC-0032, patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions.  
Length of Study 
The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months for enrollment, plus 
5.5 months after last patient in.

Investigational Medicinal Products  
Study treatment is neoadjuvant (pre-operative) therapy.   
Test Product 
The test product for this study is GDC-0032.  Pa tients will receive an oral, daily dose of 6 mg 
GDC-0032 or placebo on a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off for a maximum of 16 weeks.  
Patients will take GDC-0032 at the same time of day  ± 2 hours, unless otherw ise instructed.  
Patients will be instructed as to the number of tablets to take.  
Information on the formulation, packaging , handling, and administration of GDC-0032 are 
provided in the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure. 
Non-Investigational Medicinal Products  
Letrozole 
Letrozole is a marketed product  that is approved in the Euro pean Union and the United States 
for the treatment of hormone receptor-positiv e breast cancer.  Based upon the different 
mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-esta blished safety profile of letrozole, there 
are no expected overlapping, significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.   
Patients will receive an oral, daily dose of 2.5 mg letrozole for 16 weeks (o r until time of surgery 
at the investigator’s discretion).   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 24 Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis 
This study is designed for testing the effect of  GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all 
enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 patients in total. 
Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) for appr oximately 10% of 
the patients and t he prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, there will be approximately 120 
patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, there 
might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT cohort, which 
may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical 
power even when the treatment assignment is  imbalanced, the sample size was calculated 
based on a conservative scenario by assuming that the treatment assignment imbalance in 
PIK3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was calculated based on a chi²-test using 
continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall two-sided, family-wis e error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable fo r the MRI ORR, approximately 300 enrolled 
patients and 108 patients in the PIK3CA  MT cohort will be evaluable for analyses. This sample 
size allows us to detect an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-
0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozol e-only arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and 
Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power and 16% two-sided significance level.  The 
minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 
120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an absolute 
percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GD C-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the 
letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the 
4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is 
approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more substantial 
treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or there is an 
increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased 
to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  
MT.   
Secondary Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatmen t, assessed by modified RECIST criteria by 
breast MRI in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total  pCR) after completion of study drug in PIK3CA  WT 
patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be analyzed analogue 
to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by PIK3CA  mutation status: 
• ORR by clinical breast examination, mammography and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) 
• Change in 
Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to surgery 
(centrally assessed) 
• PEPI score (centrally assessed) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by breast MRI 
• Evaluation of different definitions of pCR in cluding the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) 
ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR). 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be compared between 
the two treatment arms within each population based on appropriate statistical analyses: ORR 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 25 will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal 
status; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by regression analyses, 
adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All se condary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided 
type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Determination of Sample Size   
 Please refer to the primary analysis in the Statistical Methods section.  
 Interim Analyses 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will monitor accumulating patient safety 
data at a minimum of once every 6 months until the last patient has completed study treatment.  Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, comm unication, affiliations) will be provided in the 
IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to re view the unblinded safety data after the first 20 
patients have either 1) finished the 30-day follow- up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on study 
for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the surgery).  The 
IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK 
summaries (all interim analyses).  While this revi ew is being conducted, patient accrual into the 
study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safety  analyses with the study team.  The study team 
will share interim safety results with study inve stigators as needed for the conduct of the study 
and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues antici pated in this trial, as well as 
measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following 
sections.  All available information of all enroll ed patients with all available assessments at the 
respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 30 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON THE PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-KINASE 
PATHWAY 
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase involved in tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and migration upon activation by growth factor receptors and integrins.  PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Cantley 2002), a second messenger involved in the phosphorylation of AKT and associated proteins in the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Guertin and Sabatini 2007).  Activating and transforming mutations, as well as amplification, in the p110 α subunit of 
PI3K are commonly found in solid and hematological tumors (Li et al. 1997).  In addition, the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numer ous types of cancer by receptor tyrosine 
kinase signaling, the loss of the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN), or RAS mutations (Shayesteh et al. 1999 ; Cantley 2002; Massion et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005). 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-POSITIVE, 
HER2-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of total cancer deaths (Jemal et al. 2011).  As a large proportion of breast cancer cases, especially in developed countries, are now diagnosed in early stages, they are amenable to cure with a stage-appropriate combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy), and radiotherapy. 
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative 
(HER2-) breast cancer accounts for about 60%
 − 70% of all breast cancers.  However, 
not all ER+ breast cancers respond optimally to endocrine therapy (Davies et al. 2011).  There are several mechanisms that can lead to primary and/or secondary hormonal resistance in ER+ breast cancer:  decrease of ER expression, loss of ER expression, or upregulation of growth factor signaling pathw ays, like the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR)/HER2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (Johnston 2009). 
In the setting of ER
 + /HER2-negative breast cancer, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays 
an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and is a viable therapeutic target to 
explore (Miller et al. 2010). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 31 1.3 BACKGROUND ON THE PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in 
breast cancer, especially in the ER+ subtype (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012).  Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway include the following: (1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding the alpha catalytic subunit of 
PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005); (2) Alterations in the tumor suppressor 
gene PTEN, either by loss of protein expression (PTEN null), inactivation mutations and/or epigenetic deregulation through promoter hypermethylation (García et al. 2004); (3) PDKP1 amplification and/or overexpression (Brugge et al. 2007); (4) AKT1 somatic gain of function mutations (Stemke-Hale et al. 2008) and AKT2 amplifications (Bellacosa et al. 1995). Overall, it is estimated that up to 70% of breast cancers can have some form of molecular aberration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (CGAN 2012).   
1.4 BACKGROUND ON REVERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE BY 
INHIBITING THE PI3K /MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, PI3K seems to play an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and may be a viable therapeutic target. Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway was proved to promote both de novo and acquired resistance to 
hormone therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models (Sabnis et al. 2007), and simultaneous blocking of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with everolimus and the ER pathway with letrozole enhances antitum or activity of either agent alone (Boulay 
et al. 2005). Importantly, a baseline protein signature of PI3K activation was found to be predictive of a poor prognosis after adjuvant endocrine therapy (Miller et al. 2010). 
In the clinical setting, impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial (Baselga et al. 2009). This trial compared everolimus and exemestane with placebo and exemestane in 724 postmenopausal patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer who had experienced recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting and/or in advanced disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the evero limus group was 6.9 months, as compared to 
2.8 months in the placebo group.  Hazard ratio (HR) for progression or death was 0.43, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.35
 − 0.54 (p  < 0.001), as per the investigator’s 
assessment, and the magnitude of the effect was even greater as per central assessment (HR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27
 − 0.47; p  < 0.001).  In the open-label Phase II 
TAMRAD trial, patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI) resistant metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen plus everolimus or tamoxifen alone (Bachelot et al. 2012). The 6-month clinical benefit rate was 61% (95% CI, 47%
 − 74%) with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29%  − 56%) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression 
increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 32 (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36  − 0.81).  Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24  − 0.81). 
In the neoadjuvant setting, combination of letrozole and everolimus also resulted in 
improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009).  In this study, 270 postmenopausal patients with operable ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment with letrozole and either everolimus or placebo. The primary endpoi nt of the trial, clinical response by 
palpation, was higher in the everolimus arm than in the control arm (68.1% vs. 59.1%, p
 = 0.062), a statistically significant result (one-sided, α = 0.1 level). 
An important finding in trials with mTOR-tar geting drugs like everolimus is that they 
produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT), resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies to effectively shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued.  One of these strategies is inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the level of PI3K. 
1.5 BACKGROUND ON NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN BREAST 
CANCER 
The use of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer has been studied in several large randomized trials that have compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy with standard adjuvant treatment (Mauriac and Smith 2003; Scholl et al. 1994; Semiglazov et al. 2004; Fisher et al. 2012; Wolff and Davidson 2000).  The randomized studies evaluating neoadjuvant therapy as well as meta-analyses of these studies have shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve breast cons ervation rates, decreasing the number of 
women obligated to undergo mastectomy (Mieog et al. 2007; Fisher et al. 2012).  A meta-analysis of nine randomized studies comparing adjuvant with neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer showed no difference in rates of death, disease progression, or disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy (Mauri et al. 2005).  The concept of neoadjuvant therapy is now well established and a standard treatment option for patients with early breast cancer.  The Collaborative Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2012).  The results of this meta-analysis confirmed an association of pathologic complete response [pCR] with favorable long-term outcomes in high-risk populations (i.e., HER2-positive, high-grade hormone receptor positive and triple negative subtypes), although the magnit ude of pCR improvement predictive of the 
long-term survival benefits could not be determined.  In September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 33 1.6 BACKGROUND ON GDC-0032 
GDC-0032 is a potent selective inhibitor of Class I PI3K alpha, delta, and gamma 
isoforms, with 30-fold less potent inhibition of the beta isoform that is being developed as a therapy for human cancers.  Nonclinica l studies with GDC-0032 demonstrate that 
GDC-0032 inhibits proliferation of p110 α-mutant breast cell lines, inhibits tumor growth 
in human breast xenograft models harboring PIK3CA  mutations, and results in a 
substantial reduction of PI3K pathway markers, including pAkt, pPRAS40, and pS6.   
GDC-0032 has demonstrated activity in nonclinical models of PIK3CA -mutant breast 
tumors in vivo as a single agent and in combination with standard of care (e.g., paclitaxel 
or docetaxel) or endocrine therapies (e.g., letrozole or fulvestrant).  GDC-0032 has a favorable in vitro and nonclinical in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination profile that has characterist ics consistent with a compound that can be 
delivered orally to achieve clinical exposure similar to the nonclinical efficacy findings 
described herein.  Additional studies, including 16-week toxicity studies in rats and dogs, phototoxicity studies, and an embryo-fetal development study, support the Phase II neoadjuvant trial with GDC-0032 in combination with endocrine therapy.   
In vitro, single-agent GDC-0032 potency is also observed in cell lines that do not harbor 
PIK3CA  mutations ( Figure 1).  In in vitro combination studies, the aromatase-expressing 
breast cancer cell line (MCF7 X
2.3.ARO) showed positive combination effects between 
GDC-0032 and endocrine therapies (see Figure 2).  In this cell line, GDC-0032 alone 
caused growth inhibitio n (50% effective concen
tration [EC 50]  = 95 nM). Effects on growth 
were also observed with letrozole and fulvestrant.  Combined treatment of cells with GDC-0032 and letrozole caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability at lower concentrations of either GDC-0032 or letrozole resulting in enhanced activity for the combination. In addition, combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  wild-type 
(WT) cell line ZR75-1 when GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapies (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).  However, in vivo data in a PIK3CA WT model are not available, because these cell lines do not 
grow as xenografts.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 36 1.7 SUMMARY OF CLINICAL DATA FOR GDC-0032  
1.7.1 Clinical Safety Data with GDC-0032  
As of 5 July 2013, a total of 144 patients have been treated with GDC-0032 either as 
single agent (90, 63%) or in combination with endocrine therapy (54, 37%). 
GDC-0032 is currently in Phase I (Study PMT4979g).  Study PMT4979g is an open-label, 
dose-escalation trial using a 3 + 3 design to assess the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 administered orally daily for 28 days to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and in combination with endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancers.  As of 5 July 2013, enrollment into the dose-escalation stage of 
Study PMT4979g had been completed with 34 patients enrolled at doses with a range of 3
  to 16 mg daily.  GDC-0032 was well tolerated in the first three cohorts (3, 5, and 8 mg), 
with no patients experiencing a dose-limiting to xicity (DLT).  At the 16-mg dose level, 
2 of the 11 safety-evaluable patients experienced a DLT (Grade 4 hyperglycemia and Grade 3 fatigue).  At the 12-mg dose level, 1 of the 10 safety-evaluable patients experienced a DLT of Grade 3 acute renal failure.  Although the single-agent GDC-0032 maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not exceeded at the 16-mg dose level, the recommended GDC-0032 dose and schedule for the single-agent expansion cohorts is 9 mg daily on the basis of long-term safety data through multiple treatment cycles.  As of the cutoff date, a total of 53 patients have been enrolled in the 9-mg daily dosing expansion cohorts.  
As of 5 July 2013, adverse events that occurred in ≥
 10% of the 87 patients treated with 
daily single-agent GDC-0032 and were assessed as related to GDC-0032 were as 
follows:  diarrhea (47%), hyperglycemia (38%), nausea (36%), fatigue (34.5%), decreased appetite (31%), rash (16%), stomatitis (13%), vomiting (13%), and mucosal inflammation (11.5%).  Study −drug-related Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included 
hyperglycemia (9.4%), colitis (7.5%), pneumonitis (3.8%), rash (including maculopapular rash with or without itching, redness, and peeling) 5.7%, asymptomatic increased aminotransferase levels in the blood (1.9%), anemia (1.9%), increase in blood creatinine (1.9%), diarrhea (1.9%), fatigue (1.9%), hypokalemia (1.9%), hypophosphatemia (1.9%), pneumonia (1.9%) and stomatitis (1.9%).    
As of 5 July 2013, a total of 27 patients have been enrolled in the expansion cohort of 
GDC-0032 at dose levels of 6 and 9 mg daily (19 patients at 6 mg, and 8 patients at 9 mg) daily in combination with letrozole (Cohort E).  No DLTs were observed at either dose level.  Adverse events that occurred in ≥ 10% of the 27 safety-evaluable patients 
assessed as related to GDC-0032 were diarrhea (67%), fatigue (30%), nausea (30%), decreased appetite (26%), hyperglycemia (26%), stomatitis (26%), dysgeusia (22%), mucosal inflammation (18.5%), rash (18.5%), asthenia (15%), pruritis (15%), vomiting (15%), dry mouth (11%), dry skin (11%) and muscle spasms (11%).

1.7.1.1 Preliminary Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 34 patients treated with GDC-0032 at 3, 5, 
8, 12, and 16 mg in the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial (Study PMT4979g).  The cohort mean apparent clearance and the terminal half-life (t
1/2) following a single, oral dose of 
GDC-0032 had a range of 4.77 −9.17 L/hour and 36.7− 43.8 hours, respectively.  
Following daily oral dosing for 8 days, there was a 2- to 4-fold accumulation of GDC-0032.  The pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 appears to be dose linear and time-independent.  Preliminary PK data from Cohort E suggest there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between letrozole plus GDC-0032.  Mean plasma exposure of letrozole when given in combination with GDC-0032 (maximum concentration observed [C
max] = 0.407 μM and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24  ] = 8.01 μ M*hr) was comparable with the historical single-agent exposure 
(Cmax  = 0.495 μM and AUC 0-24   = 10.1 μM*hr) (Awada et al. 2008). Similarly, plasma 
concentrations of GDC-0032, when given in combination with letrozole, were within the range predicted by the population PK model. Therefore, letrozole plus GDC-0032 can be co-administered without the risk of a DDI.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3 A4 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
and appeared to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro 
induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low to moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I/II study (PMT4979g) 
indicate that 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 38 GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk 
of a PK DDI.  
For additional details, refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure.   
1.7.1.2 Preliminary Pharmacodynamics 
Paired tumor biopsies were obtained from both PIK3CA MT and PIK3CA WT non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at either the 3-mg or 16-mg GDC-0032 dose 
level, respectively, at screening (pretreatment biopsy) and during Cycle 1 in Study PMT4979g (on-treatment biopsy).  Inhibi tion of PI3K pathway markers, including 
decreases of >
 60% in pAKT and pS6 (compared with baseline), were demonstrated in 
these patients’ paired tumor biopsies (see Figure 4).

As of 5 July 2013, metabolic partial responses via FDG-PET (  ≥ 20% decrease in 
maximum standardized uptake value) were observed in 23 out of 38 patients assessed 
(61%) and included patients from the lowest dose tested (3 mg).  Thirteen of these 23 were breast cancer patients.  Of the 13 response-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 plus letrozole, 10 patients (77%) had a partial metabolic response.  Of the 15 response-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 plus fulvestrant, 11 (73%) had a partial metabolic response.

1.8 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with solid tumors accounting for 
the majority of these deaths.  An estimated 1.38 million women across the world were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, accounting for 23% of all cancers diagnosed in women.  Breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, estimated to be responsible for almost 460,000 deaths in 2008 (Ferlay et al. 2010). 
A neoadjuvant study in a similar patient populat ion with the combination of letrozole and 
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has already been completed (Baselga et al. 2009).  
Please refer to Sections 1.4, 1.5, and 3.3 for further rationale supporting the proposed 
trial design of combining GDC-003
2 with letrozole in the neoadjuvant setting for this 
patient population.  In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, it is hypothesized that the combination of decreasing estrogen levels with letrozole and inhibition of the PI3K pathway with GDC-0032 may have improved anti-tumor activity as compared to endocrine therapy alone.  This is supported by the nonclinical and clinical data outlined below. 
GDC-0032 is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of Class 1 PI3K that is being 
developed by Roche/Genentech as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent.  Activating and transforming mutations in the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K are commonly found in tumors.  GDC-0032 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of growth in various human cancer cell lines, and especially in nonclinical models of PIK3CA  MT tumors.  In addition, 
combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  WT cell line ZR75-1 when 
GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapies (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).   
GDC-0032 has also shown additive efficacy in combination with endocrine therapy in a 
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer xenograft model as outlined in Section 1.6. 
Nonclinical data support
 the investigation of GDC-0032 as a single-agent in solid tumors 
and in combination with endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer.  
Available clinical data with single-agent GDC-0032 suggest that GDC-0032 has 
dose-linear pharmacokinetics with a half-life of approximately 37 −
 44 hours.  
Pharmacodynamic markers of PI3K pathway inhibition upon treatment with GDC-0032 have been observed.  These include decreases in phospho-S6 in platelet-rich plasma and decreases in F- flurodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography uptake.  Available clinical data also include multiple confirmed partial responses in patients treated with GDC-0032.  These include a patient with PIK3CA  MT lung adenocarcinoma treated at 
the 3 mg daily dose and another patient with PIK3CA  MT, hormone receptor-positive, 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated at the 5 mg daily dose.  In addition, a 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 40 patient with PIK3CA  WT lung cancer treated at the 3 mg daily dose has had prolonged 
stable disease and remained on study for over 11 months.  These data show that single-
agent GDC-0032 doses below 6 mg have been shown to have anti-tumor activity.  These aggregate data support the use of 6 mg in combination with letrozole.   
Letrozole is a marketed product that is approved in the European Union (E.U.) and the 
United States (U.S.) for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  Based upon the different mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-established safety profile of letrozole, there are no expected overlapping, significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.  
As of 5 July 2013, efficacy data are available for 24 patients treated with GDC-0032 in 
combination with letrozole; 3 patients (12.5%) had a partial response as best overall response, 2 of which were confirmed partial responses (cPRs) (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 cPR at 9 mg).  Of the 25 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 7 patients (28%) had a partial response as best overall response, of which 3 were cPRs (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 partial response at 9 mg).  cPRs have been observed in both PIK3CA  mutant and PIK3CA  WT breast cancer patients.  Maintenance of cPR has 
been observed in a patient who had a dose reduction from 6 mg to 3 mg for an adverse event.  In addition, no additional safety concerns have been observed with GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole in the ongoing Phase I study compared to GDC-0032 given as single agent. 
A number of clinically appropriate strategies to minimize risk to patients have been built 
into the protocol through the means of inclus ion/exclusion criteria, monitoring strategies, 
protocol design, and management guidelines.  These will also be clearly highlighted and discussed in detail at investigator meetings and site visits.  In addition, please refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure for details regarding potential risks, associated precautions, and other relevant nonclinical and clinical safety information. 
Due to the need to develop improved therapies to reverse or delay resistance to current 
endocrine therapy in HER2-negative, hor mone receptor-positive breast cancer  and on 
the basis of the clinical and nonclinical data available for GDC-0032, Genentech/Roche 
feels that the risk-benefit profile of GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole in 
postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive early stage 
breast cancer is favorable for proceeding with the proposed randomized Phase II clinical 
trial.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate 
the effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated, Stage I-III operable breast cancer 
whose primary tumors are ≥ 2 cm.  Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors are not eligible.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 43 Standard of care assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed 
within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumo r tissue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal 
cutting temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two 
pretreatment FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to beginning study drug treatment.  Tumor tissue from prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for enrollment eligibility purposes. For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. Remaining tissue will be retained for future translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed.   
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio.  Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 6 mg or placebo on a 5
 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A 
maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032
 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued 
up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 45 At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive 
disease and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspicion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound should be confirmed by investigator-assessed breast MRI.  Patients with primary disease not evaluable by ultrasound at baseline should be assessed by MRI at Week 9.  Suspected progression in nodes should also be confirmed by fine 
needle aspiration (FNA) if these nodes had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patient s with progressive disease (as defined by 
modified RECIST, Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or be taken off of 
the study, according to the investigator’s decisio n. If the patient goes off-
study, every 
reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surgeon.  The purpose of this visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and scheduling the date for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. 
Clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected at screening, at Week 3, 
and prior to surgery. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 47 Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local standards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be deliv ered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the 
end of the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at 
this visit and the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
of the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both physician recommendation and final patient decision should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pCR (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be established via a 
local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and 
directions for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be used to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  
IRF procedures are detailed in the IRF charter. 
3.1.2 Independent Data Monitoring Committee   
An IDMC will monitor accumulating patient safety data at a minimum of once every 6 months until the last patient has completed study treatment.  Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, communication, affiliation s) will be provided in the IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will convene for an interim safety analysis to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics after the first 20 patients have completed surgery and have had 30 days of follow-up.  The IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK summaries (all interim analyses).  While this review is being conducted, patient accrual into the study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safe ty analyses with the study team.  The study 
team will share interim safety results with study investigators as needed for the conduct 
of the study and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 48 3.2 END OF STUDY  
The end of the study is defined as the date when the last patient has her postsurgery 
visit. The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months for enrollment,
 plus 5.5 months after last patient in.   
3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.3.1 Rationale for Conducting the Study in the Neoadjuvant Setting  
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and not every breast tumor responds equally 
to a specific agent.  Studies based on global gene expression analyses have provided 
additional insights into this complex scenario.  Over the past 10 years, four major classes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like) and a Normal Breast-like group have been identified and intensively studied (Perou et al. 2000; Sørlie et al. 2001). Known as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, these groups of tumors have revealed critical differences in incidence, survival, and response to treatment. As genomic studies evolve, further sub-classifications of breast tumors are expected to emerge. Thus, a major challenge in breast cancer management is how to prospectively select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen, minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
Neoadjuvant therapy, a systemic therapy administered prior to breast cancer surgery, is 
now widely used in the treatment of early breast cancer patients. Outcomes of patients 
receiving neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy (Mauri et al. 2005), and the form er offers clear advantages to patients, 
especially those with larger tumors. The tumor may shrink prior to surgery, thus increasing the rate of BCS (Coudert et al. 2006), and since the response to therapy can be monitored, the patient might be also spared further treatment with inactive medications.  
The neoadjuvant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents. Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, usually from the diagnostic specimens. On-treatment biopsies may also be pre-specified in order to monitor treatment response at a biological level. Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well. The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes  of breast cancer (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 
2013; Cortazar et al. 2012). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
Postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, ER+, early stage breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.  This patient population is usually treated with a combination of surgery, anti-hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy, according to staging and biological features.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 49 Recently, everolimus was approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency in 
combination with exemestane for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer in patients after recurrence or progression following treatment with nonsteroidal AIs. In the neoadjuvant setting, a combination of letrozole and everolimus resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009). 
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, produce a 
pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the pAKT, resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies to shut down the pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued. One of these strategies is to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the PI3K level. PI3K-inhibitors are central regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, and nonclinical findings show that PI3K-inhibitors and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors induce a greater amount of apoptosis than everolimus in estrogen-deprived in vitro models (Sanchez et al. 2011); therefore, it is hypothesized that PI3K-inhibitors may be active and demonstrate greater anti-tumor activity as compared to AIs alone in the neoadjuvant setting. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group   
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been found to be more effective than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. 
Several trials have assessed the efficacy  and safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
using AIs in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer (Eiermann et al. 2001; Smith et 
al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011). 
The P024 trial was a worldwide, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that 
randomized 337 postmenopausal patients with ER
 +  breast cancer to receive either 
4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen (Eiermann et al. 2001). The primary endpoint of P024 was the percentage of patients in each treatment arm with objective response as determined by clinical palpation. Secondary endpoints included ORR determined by mammogram and ultrasound, and included the percentage of patients in each arm who had become eligible for BCS. The trial demonstrated a significantly higher clinical response rate for letrozole when compared to tamoxifen (55% vs. 36%; p
 < 0.001) 
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. An improved ORR for letrozole was also observed with ultrasound (35% vs. 25%; p
 < 0.042) and mammogram (34% vs. 16%; p  < 0.001). 
The higher response rate assessed by clinical palpation translated into a significantly higher rate of women undergoing BCS in tumors that had initially been considered unsuitable for this procedure (45% vs. 35%; p
 = 0.022). Median time-to-response was 66 
days in the letrozole group and 70 days in the tamoxifen group, and both treatments were well tolerated. 
The IMPACT trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER+ operable or locally 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 50 advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of 
anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery. The tumor ORR was assessed by both caliper and ultrasound. No significant differences in ORR in the ITT population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination were seen. However, in a predefined analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more patients requiring mastectomy at baseline actually receiving BCS with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (44% vs.  31%, respectively; p
 = 0.23); this 
difference became significant for patients deemed by their surgeon to be eligible for BCS after treatment (46% vs. 22%, respectively; p
 = 0.03). All treatments were well tolerated. 
The ACOSOG Z1031 trial compared three AIs in a randomized, Phase I I, neoadjuvant 
trial designed to select agents for Phase III investigations. Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical Stage II to III ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole. The primary endpoint was clinical response. No formal comparison between arms was pre-specified in the statistical plan. ORR was 62.9%, 74.8%, and 69.1% for the exemestane, letrozole and anastrozole arms, respectively. On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI score, or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. 
Results from these trials suggest that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be beneficial 
in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer, and that it offers an alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.3.4 Rationale for the Efficacy Ou tcome Measure of Response Rate 
Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
ORR is based on criteria related to changes in tumor size (e.g., RECIST) and is generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple, non-registrational, neoadjuvant trials in combination with endocrine therapy (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007; Baselga et al. 2009).  
Guidelines for RECIST 1.1 state that MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast 
lesions in a neoadjuvant setting, and it has  advantages over computed tomography (CT) 
and mammography (Eisenhauer et al. 2009). In addition, MRI has been shown to be more accurate than clinical palpation, ultrasound, and mammography for measuring residual tumor size after neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Akazawa et al. 2006; Balu-Maestro et al. 2002; Yeh et al. 2005), including the I-SPY trial (Hylton et al. 2012).  For these reasons, ORR as assessed by breast MRI has been chosen as a co-primary endpoint for this trial.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 51 3.3.4.1 Rationale for Efficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
pCR is a recognized efficacy endpoint of neoadjuvant trials, especially those with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it has been correlated with long-term outcomes, such as 
event-free survival (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013).  
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is an unlikely event.  For instance, in the 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole, pCR rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively (Baselga et al. 2009). 
In the ongoing Phase I/II trial that combines letrozole with GDC-0032, tumor shrinkage 
has been observed, and some patients presented sustained partial responses. As pCR is a recognized indicator of activity to a given regimen, it would be useful to assess it as a co-primary efficacy endpoint of this trial. Furthermore, for the same trial size, this would represent a minimal increase in the minimum detected difference (MDD) of the 
co-primary endpoint for pCR ORR (from MDD of 12% to MDD of 13%). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a 
complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, 
inflammatory or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.   
3.3.4.2 Rationale for Ki67 Measurements 
Ki67 is a well-established proliferation biomarker with prognostic value in ER+ breast cancer (Dowsett et al. 2011). Efficacy of endocrine therapy relies on induction of cell-cycle arrest, and during neoadjuvant treatment, Ki67 levels reflect the ability of endocrine agents to suppress proliferation (Smith et al. 2005; Ellis et al. 2011).  In the neoadjuvant trial of letrozole with everolimus, by using the definition that patients with natural log (Ki67)
 < 1 at Day 15 have an antiproliferative response, 57% of everolimus-
treated patients were responders vs. 30% in the placebo arm, with a significant p value 
of <  0.01 (Baselga et al. 2009). Furthermore, the mean reduction in the percentage of 
Ki67-positive tumor cells at Day 15 relative to baseline was greater in the everolimus-treated patients (90.7%
 ± 3.2%) than in the placebo group (74.8%  ± 6.8%; p  = 0.0002). In 
the IMPACT trial, Ki67 was assessed at baseline, on Day 15, and at surgery (Smith et al. 2005). For each treatment arm, the reduction in geometric mean Ki67 levels was significantly higher for anastrozole than for tamoxifen at both time points (p
 = 0.004, 
p = 0.001, respectively), but no differences were found between tamoxifen and the 
combination. In the ASCOSOG Z1031 trial (Ellis et al. 2011), although no data on Ki67 at Day 15 were available, no differences were found between treatments at baseline and at surgery (after 16
 − 18 weeks of therapy). The geometric mean percentage change in 
Ki67 for each treatment was similar between the arms (anastrozole 78%, exemestane 
81.2%, and letrozole 87.1%). 
The issue of whether Ki67 decrease at surgery or at any timepoint during treatment 
correlates with long-term efficacy outcomes has been addressed in the P024 trial 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 52 (Eiermann et al. 2001). Treatment with letrozole led to higher, treatment-induced 
reduction of Ki67 levels in the tumor at surgery (87% reduction in the letrozole arm vs. 75% in the tamoxifen arm; analysis of covariance p
 = 0.0009) based on the 185 
specimens with available data on Ki67 (Ellis et al. 2003). With a median follow-up of 61.2 months, low levels of Ki67 in the biopsy at the end of treatment were significantly associated with better relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.4 per natural log increase in the Ki67 value, 95% CI 1.2
 − 1.6, p  < 0.001), and breast cancer specific survival (HR 1.4, 
95% CI 1.1  − 1.7, p  =  0.009).  Finally, in the IMPACT trial, higher Ki67 expression after 2 
weeks of endocrine therapy was statistically significantly associated with lower RFS (p
 = 0.004), whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not (Smith et al. 2005). 
Importantly, the Ki67 suppression in these hormonal neoadjuvant trials mirrored efficacy outcomes in large adjuvant trials: adjuvant BIG1-98 trial (n
 = 8,010) showed the superior 
efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen (Regan et al. 2011), similar to the neoadjuvant P024 trial (n
 = 185); the adjuvant ATAC trial (n  = 9,366) showed that anastrozole was better 
than tamoxifen and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen (Cuzick et al. 2010), similar to neoadjuvant IMPACT (n
 = 259); and the adjuvant MA27 trial (n  = 7,576) showed 
similar efficacy of anastrozole and exemestane (Goss et al. 2013), mirroring neoadjuvant ACOSOG Z1031 (n
 = 266). These results suggest that a biological superiority hypothesis 
generated by a neoadjuvant study may help the design of future adjuvant hormonal therapy trials. 
In summary, reduction in Ki67 after neoadjuvant treatment with AIs is a good marker of 
suppression of cellular proliferation, correlates with long term efficacy outcomes, and mirrors results of large adjuvant endocrine trials, which make it an attractive endpoint to assess in the present trial. 
3.3.4.3 Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic 
Index Score 
In addition to Ki67, pathologic tumor size (T1 or T2 versus T3 or T4), node status (positive or negative), and the ER status (positive Allred score 3–8 versus negative 
Allred score 0–2) of the surgery specimen were also determined to have independent prognostic value for relapse and death after relapse in the P024 trial (Ellis et al. 2008).  A PEPI score, prognostic for RFS, which weighs each of these factors according to their associated hazard ratios, was developed and subsequently validated in an independent data set from the IMPACT trial (Ellis et al. 2008). No relapses were recorded in either trial in patients with tumors classified as T1N0 and with a PEPI score of 0 (residual tumor with a Ki67 level 
 ≤ 2.7%, and with maintained ER expression) or in the rare patient 
with a pCR. 
In this trial, the PEPI score will be assessed centrally.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 53 3.3.4.4 Rationale for Assessing O RR by Clinical Breast Exam 
(Palpation), Mammography, and Breast Ultrasound 
Objective overall response rate will also be assessed by clinical breast exam, 
mammography, and breast ultrasound during screening and prior to surgery. These data will allow for more direct comparison of results to other neoadjuvant trials with endocrine therapy as described in Section 3.3.3. The concurrent acquisition of ORR data with 
these techniques, in addition to MRI-based measures, will al so provide va
luable 
comparative information on these methods, which will be important for both future neoadjuvant studies and GDC-0032 clinical development.  
3.3.4.5 Rationale for Assessing Enha ncing Tumor Volume by Breast 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
As shown in the I-SPY trial, tumor volume measurements based on the percent of tumor with enhancing signal after contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures (Hylton et al. 2012). However, there are no established response criteria for volumetric data, and the extrapolation of current one- and two-dimensional criteria to volumetric data based on a spherical model may not be appropriate given the range of tumor morphologies expected in this population of patients (Loo et al. 2011).  Additionally, there are only very limited data on the clinical relevance of any particular range in change in tumor volume during the course of neoadjuvant treatment. For these reasons, changes in enhancing tumor volume as measured by breast MRI will be a secondary endpoint in the trial.     
3.3.5 Rationale for Inde pendent Review Facility  
Due to the relatively novel nature of using MRI as an imaging endpoint, a central assessment by an IRF for the co-primary endpoint of response rate via MRI will be performed to ensure consistency across all sites participating in the study.  
3.3.6 Rationale for Interim Safety Review  
The first 20 patients will be assessed for safety following surgery and 30 days beyond. This will allow the IDMC to review all safety data during the treatment period and to evaluate any surgery complications that may be attributed to GDC-0032. 
3.3.7 Rationale for GDC-0032 Dosage  
As of 5 July 2013, 34 patients have been enrolled into the dose-escalation stage of Study PMT4979g, and 56 patients have been enrolled into the single-agent expansion cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested.  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability, the recommended single-agent dose and schedule for the single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage is 9 mg daily. 
In Study PMT4979g, as of the 5 July 2013 data cutoff date, there were 87 safety 
evaluable patients treated with single-agent GDC-0032 (3
 − 16 mg daily).  A total of 97% 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 54 of patients experienced at least one adverse event per the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 (NCI CTCAE v4.0).  The most frequently reported adverse events, occurring in ≥
 10% safety-evaluable patients 
regardless of causality, were diarrhea (55%), fatigue (49%), nausea (47%), decreased appetite (39%), hyperglycemia (38%), vomiting (28%), dizziness (22%), rash (22%), dyspnea (18%), hypokalemia (18%), pyrexia (17%), cough (16%), anemia (13%), dehydration (13%), headache (13%), stomatitis (13%), AST increased (12%), mucosal inflammation (12%) and pruritis (10%).   
As of 5 July 2013, 54 patients have been treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
endocrine therapy with either letrozole (Cohort E) or fulvestrant (Cohort F) at either 6 mg or 9 mg dose levels.  No DLTs were observed during dose escalation in  either Cohorts E 
or F.  Expansion cohorts at the 6-mg dose level were enrolled to obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability.  Fifty (93%) of the 54 safety-evaluable patients experienced at least one adverse event that was assessed as related to GDC-0032.  
Of the 54 patients, 17 patients were treated with GDC-0032 plus letrozole. Adverse 
events that occurred in ≥
 10% of patients that were assessed as related to GDC-0032 
(6mg and 9mg) were diarrhea (67%), nausea (33%), fatigue (30%), rash (30%), hyperglycemia (26%), decreased appetite (26%), stomatitis (26%), dysgeusia (22%), mucosal inflammation (19%), asthenia (15%), vomiting (15%), pruritis (15%), muscle spasms (11%), dry skin (11%), and dry mouth (11%). 
Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
letrozole, one patient at 6 mg had a cPR. The PIK3CA  mutation status of this patient is 
unknown. Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg, and the long-term safety suggests that 6 mg is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study will utilize 6 mg GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg and 1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg. 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time 
(from the first dose of study treatment) to onset of colitis ranged from approximately 82 − 248 days as either a single agent or in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant.  
Most of the colitis cases have been observed at the 9-mg dose level or higher.  Most of the colitis cases have been observed at the 9-mg dose level or higher.  To mitigate the late-onset adverse events, such as colitis, an intermittent dosing schedule will be applied. With the 40-hour half-life, a limited impact on efficacy is anticipated.  PK modeling has shown that a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off will maintain GDC-0032 drug exposure 
levels within an efficacious range as assessed by various breast cancer cell lines.  There has also been data presented for another PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with a similar half-life in combination with letrozole in a Phase Ib study that demonstrated improved tolerability

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 55 with similar efficacy for a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off as compared to daily 
continuous dosing of the PI3K inhibitor (Mayer et al. 2012). 
3.3.8 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments   
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and PIK3CA  mutations have been shown to 
vary among patients (CGAN 2012).  Therefore, all patients may not equally likely benefit 
from treatment with GDC-0032.  Predictive biomarker samples collected prior to dosing will be assessed in an effort to identify those patients with PIK3CA -driven pathogenesis 
who are most likely to respond to GDC-0032.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be assessed to assess the biologic activity of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole.  
It has been suggested that not all molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
result in pathway activation.  In a comprehensive analysis of tumors from 850 breast cancer patients, protein markers of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (pAKT, pS6, and p4EBP1) correlated strongly with INPP4B and PTEN  loss, to a degree with PIK3CA 
amplification, but were not elevated in PIK3CA- MT luminal A cancers (CGAN 2012).  
This apparent disconnect between the presence of PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of 
pathway activation had been previously noted (Loi et al. 2010), and stress the need to find innovative and robust predictive biomarke rs to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibiting 
agents (Saini et al. 2013). 
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep genome sequencing, may offer 
a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the TSC1 gene was found in a 
metastatic bladder cancer patient with a prolonged response (>
 2 years) to everolimus as 
single agent (Iyer et al. 2012).  Among 13 additional bladder cancer patients treated with everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant tumors remained on therapy longer 
than those with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p
 = 0.004), suggesting that mTORC-1 
directed therapies may be most effective in cancer patients whose tumors harbor TSC1 
somatic mutations.  Similar approaches could be of great value when analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
In addition to mutational activation of proteins, levels of RNA and DNA can also activate 
the PI3K pathway.  For example, increases in DNA copy number in receptor tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1/2 and IGF-1R, which occur at some frequency in breast cancer, can activate downstream PI3K pathway.  Hormone receptor positive breast cancer can be divided into luminal A and luminal B subtype, with the luminal B subtype displaying a higher proliferative index.  Therefore, profiling the RNA and DNA expression of tumors will allow intrinsic subtyping of patients enrolled onto study.  In addition, PI3K transcription activation signatures may identify additional patients who could respond to PI3K inhibitors outside of PIK3CA  mutations.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 56 The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor response to treatment is an area of 
great interest.  It could allow for an early, non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates for specific therapies and monitoring of disease mutation status over time (Higgins et al. 2012).  The neoadjuvant setting is ideal to prospectively test these approaches. 
3.3.9 Rationale for Day 15 Biopsy  
On-study biopsies can provide valuable information regarding target engagement and downstream pathway suppression. Assessing ho w GDC-0032 interacts with letrozole in 
this previously untreated patient population provides a unique opportunity to understand the interaction between two anti-cancer molecules.  When available, FFPE tumor samples will be assessed for pathway m odulation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methodologies, and fresh frozen OCT samples will be assessed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technologies, or equivalent.  Measurement of Ki67 after 2 weeks of continuous letrozole and GDC-0032 combination treatment versus letrozole and placebo will give a good benchmark to prior neoadjuvant studies that demonstrated a larger decrease in Ki67 at this 2-week timepoint for a combination of letrozole and everolimus as compared to letrozole and placebo (Baselga et al. 2009).  This Day 15 biopsy will also be useful in identifying potential biomarkers that may help predict a tumor response for patients treated with GDC-0032.   
3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for the Detection 
of Plasma Protein Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases  in levels of systemic cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate response to drugs, particularly targeted agents such as GDC-0032 (Wilson et al. 2012).  Assays to assess the expression of soluble, sy stemic cytokines and chemokines from the 
plasma of patients will be carried out using ELISA-based mass spectrometry or equivalent methodologies.   
3.3.11 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for DNA Sequencing 
to Identify Mutations in Plasma  
There is increasing evidence that circulating DNA obtained from blood specimens of cancer patients is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells (Diehl et al. 2008; Maheswaran et al. 2008).  Assays are available that can detect the major PI3K mutations (and other cancer-related genes) in plasma, and results from this analysis will be correlated with tumor specimens. 
3.3.12 Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample for Next Generation 
Sequencing  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate a large quantity of sequencing data.  Tumor DNA can contain both reported and unreported chromosomal alterations due to tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing calls in 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 57 previously unreported genomic alterations, a normal blood sample will be taken during 
pre-screening to determine whether the alteration is somatic or germline.  
3.3.13 Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Schedule  
PK samples will be collected from early breast cancer patients in this study to assess the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 and possible DDI between letrozole and GDC-0032 in this population.  Considering the lack of DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole upon concomitant administration in the 24 metastatic breast cancer patients in the Phase I study (preliminary data), this drug interaction in early breast cancer patients is unlikely.  Hence, extensive PK sample collection is not needed; sparse PK sampling from patients enrolled in this study is adequate.  The proposed PK sample collection schedule will also enable assessment of a concentration and response relationship to better understand the following:  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (efficacy), PK/safety correlation, and population pharmacokinetics.  Additional PK samples may be collected for safety concerns (e.g., severe adverse event) in order to better characterize drug levels in these patients at the time of the adverse event.   
3.3.14 Rationale for the Coll ection of DNA for Exploratory 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
One sample (approximately 3 mL of whole bl ood) will be collected from all patients using 
K3-EDTA collection tubes. Samples  will be used for the evaluation of genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, and UGT1A1, and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1) and for genetic variants which could contribute to potentially drug-related rash and/or colitis safety assessments (including but not limited to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]).  For sample handling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Only in circumstances where there is concern for collection of this genetic material for above evaluations, can this assessment be c onsidered not mandatory as part of study 
assessments in this study.  Results of any analyses from these samples will be reported outside the clinical study report. 
It is established that genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN 38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan (O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006).  Preliminary results from in vitro metabolism studies with GDC-0032 suggest that they are partially metabolized by multiple Phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes, including C YP3A4.  
Although in vitro studies can help elucidate the roles of enzymes in the metabolism of the drug, these results are not always predictive of in vivo metabolism for a number of reasons, such as differences in drug concentrations that the enzymes encounter in vitro and in vivo.  For this reason, a blood sample for DNA isolation is proposed to be 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 58 collected from all patients in this study for potential pharmacogenetic analysis of genes 
or biomarkers that may affect the pharmacokinetics or response to GDC-0032.  The decision to analyze the samples will be based on a review of the pharmacokinetics and response data.  Most recently, the role of HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of drug-induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepine, abacavir, and allopurinol).  Therefore, evaluation of genetic variants of ge nes that may 
regulate the immune response (including but not limited to HLA) may also be investigated to characterize unusual safety responses that are not predicted by GDC-0032 pharmacokinetics. 
The analysis will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, because it is necessary to 
link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis would be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination and/or response of patients who develop severe adverse reactions such as colitis or rash.  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 15 years after the completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
3.3.15 Rationale for Patient-Reported Outcome Assessments   
A PRO is “any report on the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without any interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else” (FDA Guidance for Industry 2007).  PRO measures are able to contextualize a patient’s experience on trial,  elucidating symptom and treatment burden.  
Since early breast cancer is often asymptomatic, the PRO objective is to evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and the health-related quality of life between treatment arms (Lemieux et al. 2011).  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and associated breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23, were selected 
because they were specifically developed to assess the most salient constructs and experiences with breast cancer and its treatment.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely and frequently used PRO measure in oncology trials that contains a global health status scale, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptom scales/items with a recall period of ‘the past week.’  
The second measure, the QLQ-BR23, is a breast cancer specific modular supplement to 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, and includes additional functioning scales and symptom scales/items relating to breast cancer.  
These instruments demonstrate strong psychometric properties, of both reliability and 
validity, and meet the requirements for this study (EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 1999).  Therefore, PRO data will be collected from patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and modified QLQ-BR23 (Quinten et al. 2009).

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 64 4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING  
4.2.1 Patient Randomization  
After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility has been established, 
the study site will obtain a patient’s identification number and treatment assignment using a permuted block randomization algorithm via an interactive voice or web-based response system (IxRS).  
4.2.2 Stratification  
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio based on the following stratification factors: 
• Tumor size (T1-2 vs. T3) 
• Nodal status (cytologically positive vs. r adiologically or cytologically negative). If on 
ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes at the 
baseline examination, then fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy is required to 
confirm nodal status. 
 
4.2.3 Blinding  
Investigators and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment of GDC-0032 or 
placebo. 
For emergency situations, the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by 
contacting the IxRS .  The responsibility to break th e treatment code in emergency 
situations resides solely with  the investigator.   For non-emergency situations, the 
investigator needs to obtain approval from  the Medical Monitor to break  the treatment 
code.  Unblinding during the study will result in the withdrawal of a patient from the study.  
For regulatory reporting purposes, and if required by local health authorities, the 
Sponsor will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected, suspected adverse 
reactions that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to study drug. 
While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to 
maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK assay results for these patients are generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this trial.  The PK assay group will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignments to identify appropriate 
PK samples to be analyzed and bioanalytical methodology to employ.  However, the PK 
scientist does not have access to the PK assay results and therefore stays blinded until 
the PK assay results need to be interpreted and reported.  Samples from patients 
assigned to the comparator arm will be analyzed for letrozole.  However, GDC-0032 assay will be analyzed by request (i.e., to evaluate a possible error in dosing).

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 66 Unless otherwise instructed, GDC-0032 or placebo should be taken on an empty 
stomach (i.e., approximately 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). 
If a patient misses a GDC-0032 or placebo dose or vomits up a tablet, she should be 
instructed to skip that dose and to resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.  Missed doses will not be made up.  Patients will be instructed to bring their medication diary to each study visit for assessment of compliance.  Patients will also be instructed to bring all unused tablets to each study visit for GDC-0032 or placebo accountability. 
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are 
provided in Section 5.1. 
Any overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on 
the 
Study Drug Administration eCRF.  Adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.3.2.2 Letrozole 
Patients will receive an oral, daily dose of 2.5 mg letrozole for 16 weeks (or until time of surgery at the investigator’s discretion).  No dose modifications of letrozole are permitted.  
Any overdose or incorrect administration of letrozole should be noted on the letrozole Administration eCRF.  Adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of letrozole should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
4.3.3 Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability  
All investigational medicinal products (IMPs) required for completion of this study (letrozole and GDC-0032) will be provided by the Sponsor where required by local health 
authority regulations.  The investigational site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs, using the IxRS to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.  
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s institutional 
standard operating procedure (SOP) or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation.  The site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by the Sponsor.  The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form. 
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of 
by the study site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log. 
4.3.4 Post-Trial Access to GDC-0032  
The Sponsor will offer post-trial access to the study drug (GDC-0032, letrozole, or other study interventions) free of charge to eligible patients in accordance with the Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to Investigational Medicinal Product, as outlined below. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 67 A patient will be eligible to receive study drug after the end of the study if all  of the 
following conditions are met:

4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate that 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 68 Letrozole is mainly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite by 
CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 in vivo. GDC-0032, which has the potential to induce CYP3A4 based on in vitro induction studies, was administered in combination with letrozole in the expansion phase of Study PMT4979g to assess their DDI potential. Preliminary data from 10 patients in this cohort indicated that steady state plasma concentrations of both letrozole and GDC-0032, following once daily administration of the combination (2.5 mg letrozole plus 6 or 9 mg GDC-0032), were similar to historical, single-agent data suggesting lack of DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole. These preliminary results suggest that GDC-0032 and letrozole combination may be administered without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
In vitro CYP inhibition studies in HLMs and induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested a low to moderate potential of GDC-0032 to perpetrate DDIs.  A clinical DDI study with rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) and itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), to understand the effect of CYP inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, is currently ongoing (Study GP28617). 
4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy  
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer 
agents such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological 
response modifiers, or endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topical estrogens (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is 
receiving these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast 
and/or regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an 
alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions. 
• Potent CYP3A4 inducers:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital ) with GDC-0032 should be 
avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 induce r is co-administered with GDC-0032, 
patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 69 4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
Please see Appendix 1 for the schedule of assessments to be performed during the 
study. 
4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study-specific screening tests or  evaluations.  ICFs for enrolled patients 
and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before randomization.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 
4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases that are currently active or that were active within the previous 5 years, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 15 days prior to the screening visit.   
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
4.5.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination should incl ude an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems as well as weight and height (height is measured at the screening visit only).  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom-directed physical 
examination may be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature.  
4.5.5 Electrocardiograms  
Triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 70 4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor Assessment  
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization.   
As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or 
abnormal physical examination; ches t CT if pulmonary symptoms.   
• For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC: bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
should be conducted for all patients. 
In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease.   
4.5.7 Tumor and Response Evaluations  
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at subsequent timepoints as outlined in Appendix 1. Responses based on clinical breast 
exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will be investiga tor-assesse 
d.  Whenever 
possible, assessments should be performed by the same evaluator to ensure internal consistency across visits. Response via breast MRI will be centrally assessed, and all assessments will be based on modified RECIST criteria (see Appendix 3).  
Clinical Breast Examination:  Assessment of primary breast  tumor and regional lymph 
nodes must be done by physical examination (palpation) during baseline 
evaluation, 
Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13 and 16 during the treatment phase, and prior to surgery. Breast tumor measurement by caliper (preferred) or rule will be performed and recorded in the eCRF. 
Axillary lymph node status (and other regional lymph nodes if clinically indicated) will 
also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Mammogram:  Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within 28 days 
prior to enrollment and again prior to surgery. Mammographic tumor measurements are 
to be recorded in the eCRF.  
Breast Ultrasound:   Bilateral breast ultrasounds must be obtained at baseline within 
28 days prior to enrollment.  Investigator decision whether to perform unilateral or bilateral ultrasounds performed at Week 9 and prior to surgery (Week 16) may be unilateral or bilateral and per investigator discretion.  If on ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes  at the baseline examination, then FNA or 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 71 core biopsy is required.  Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded in the 
eCRF. The tumor site may be marked with a radiopaque clip or marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  
Breast MRI:  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans will be mandatory for all study 
patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to enrollment) and prior to surgery (Week 16).  
MRI is optional at Week 9, but will be mandatory if a primary breast lesion is not evaluable by ultrasound, or if there are signs of disease progression on the Week 9 ultrasound (see Figure 6 ).   
Breast MRI scans should not be acquired within 48 hours aft
er biopsy, and the timing 
and location of any clip or marker plac ement during study biopsies should be recorded 
for reference when MRI scans are read.  If the screening breast MRI scan is not evaluable for RECIST measurement due to technical limitations of the scan itself as assessed by the central reading facility, the scan may be repeated, at least 48 hours after the first scan before the start of study treatment. Other MRI acquisition sequences, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, may be acquired during this study during the MRI scan visits for each patient.  Additional MRI-derived metrics such as ADC value may provide additional insight into changes in tumor cellular composition.  
For information about patient preparation, scanner requirements and settings, and image 
acquisition, refer to the Study Imaging Manual. Standard site practice may be followed regarding the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolytics for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI. 
4.5.8 Surgical Treatment Plan  
The planned and actual surgical treatment (BCS or mastectomy) performed should be documented and reported in the eCRF.  Patients should be reassessed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and prior to surgery.  
4.5.9 Surgical Specimen – Pathology  
The co-primary endpoint of the study (pCR) will be as identified by local pathology review. Guidelines regarding pathology specimen preparation, labeling and review are outlined in the pathology manual. 
4.5.10 Laborator y Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [ R
BC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells]), and platelet count.   
• Coagulation (INR and aPTT/PTT) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 72 • Fasting serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, serum 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, AST, ALT), performed following  ≥ 10-hour 
fast 
• Fasting lipid profile and amylase (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed following 
a  ≥ 10 hour fast 
• Fasting insulin and glucose  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
• Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue 
• FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor 
biopsies and surgical resection.  All patients must consent to the collection of newly 
collected tumor biopsies (frozen and FFPE) for PIK3CA  mutation testing as well as 
for other protocol-mandated exploratory assessments at baseline, Day 15, and at 
surgery. 
• Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.  
Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a 
central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten 
unstained slides from a prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for enrollment eligibility purposes. 
Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies and one freshly frozen 
OCT core needle biopsy are required at baseline and Day 15 (Week 3).    
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection 
(Weeks 17
 − 18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various reasons 
(e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site should discuss with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, unstained slides (a minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a surgical specimen are required 
at surgery (Weeks 17
 − 18). 
The specimens will be used for confirmatory central laboratory assessment of PIK3CA  mutation status, Ki67, PTEN, ER/PgR and HER2 expression.  In addition, 
other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, PI3K signaling pathways 
may be evaluated, including protein expression and molecular profiling studies such as NGS and gene-expression. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers include, but are 
not limited, to the following:  ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 73 • Blood for NGS (if approved by local regulatory authorities) 
• Blood for pharmacogenomics (if approved by local regulatory authorities) 
• PK assessment  
 
Plasma samples will be collected to measure letrozole and GDC-0032 
concentrations (see Appendix 2) .  Any remaining samples collected for PK and 
biomarker assays may b e used for e
xploratory biomarker profiling, metabolite 
profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes as 
appropriate. 
 
4.5.11 Assay Methods  
4.5.11.1 Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA  
The PIK3CA mutation assay will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35%  − 40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 in the codons 
encoding amino acids E542, E545, and H1047 (Saal et al. 2005).  Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays that amplify exons that are commonly mutated in PIK3CA  offer a sensitive and quantitative method to detect mutations from a tumor 
specimen.  DNA will be extracted from tumor samples and subjected to allele-specific PCR assays that detect the WT allele, as well as to assays for nucleotide substitutions that include, but are not limited to, the following amino acid changes:  R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545K/A/G/D, E546K/E/R/L, M1043I, H1047R/L/Y, H1049R.  Following histopathological review, samples with 
 < 10% tumor content may not be evaluable for 
the PIK3CA assay. Samples will be run on  cobas z480 analyzer, and PIK3CA  mutation 
status (mutant or WT) will be made using appr opriate cutoffs and automated software.   
A designation of PIK3CA  status unknown will be assigned to a sample wherein any one 
of the predefined mutations was not conclusively assessed. 
4.5.11.2 Pharmacodynamic Biomar ker Assays in Tumor Tissues 
Ki67 antigen is an important cell cycle-related nuclear protein that is expressed by proliferating cells in all phases of the active cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M phase).  As such, it is a useful marker of the proliferative state of a tumor.  Ki67 protein levels will be determined by IHC through the use of standard techniques.   
PI3K pathway, and other pro-survival, biomarkers will be tested in the fresh tumor 
biopsies by IHC, including, but not limited to, phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4EBP1, and phospho-ERK.  If tissue quantity permits, change in expression of pathway biomarkers will be measured by t he RPPA using OCT fixed tissue.  The basis 
of the technology is to immobilize small amount s of lysate from a tumor biopsy sample in 
serial dilution on a microarray slide.  Multiple samples are thus arrayed on a slide and can be probed with antibodies that detect a particular phospho-epitope.  Using this technology, we will profile approximately 80 key signaling nodes representing a number 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 74 of pathways known to be dysregulated in cancer, including receptors in the HER family, 
multiple components of PI3K/mTor signaling, as well as key members of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. 
4.5.11.3 Analysis of Phosphatase Tensin Homolog Expression 
PTEN status will be examined by IHC using a protocol that has been validated for specificity using several available cell line controls at a central laboratory.  Tumor specimen will be scored only if appropriate staining is observed in internal control stromal or normal (non-tumor) tissue elements.  
4.5.11.4 Confirmation of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, 
and HER2 Status 
ER, PR, and HER2 status will be determined at a central laboratory according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. 
4.5.11.5 Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis 
ctDNA will be extracted from plasma samples collected from patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations using appropriate technologies.  The prevalence of 
the mutations measured at baseline and post-treatment may provide information on response or resistance to therapy. 
4.5.11.6 Messenger RNA Expression Profiling 
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression will be performed using gene expression assays conducted on the NanoString platform or equivalent.  Analysis may include, but is not limited to, a panel of genes important for intrinsic subtyping, breast cancer biology and PI3K signaling.  The goal will be to generate a database of expression status to examine whether there are gene expression patterns that are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
4.5.11.7 Next Generation Sequencing 
In cases where there is sufficient material to isolate DNA, NGS will be performed using NGS platforms, such as Illumina or equivalent. The goal will be to deter mine whether the 
percentage of genetic mutations are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
4.5.11.8 Copy Number Analysis  
The level of copy number alterations in cancer-related genes may be determined using DNA-based technologies, either cytogenetically using chromosomal in situ hybridization (ISH), using next-generation sequencing platforms or by RT-PCR-based or equivalent technologies.  For cytogenetic assays, detection may be either fluorescence-based (fluorescence in situ hybridization assay) or chromogenic-based (chromogenic in situ hybridization).  Increased copy number of PI3K pathways activating genes may provide information on response or resistance to therapy.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 75 4.5.11.9 Plasma Biomarker Analyses 
Assays to assess the expression of soluble,  systemic cytokines, and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using appropriate methodologies, such as 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based or mass spectrometry-based or equivalent technologies.   
4.5.11.10 Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Plasma GDC-0032 and letrozole samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
After the plasma samples are analyzed, any remaining samples may be used for 
exploratory metabolite profiling and identification, ex vivo protein binding, and PK, or pharmacodynamic assay development purposes. 
4.5.11.11 Pharmacogeneti c Polymorphism Assay 
If approved by the local regulatory authority, gene mutations will be assayed using multiplex PCR, allele-specific PCR, direct sequencing, or other acceptable methods.  Results may be correlated to population PK parameters or other clinical measures in order to better understand the impact of genetic variants on drug metabolism, exposure, adverse events, and/or response.   
A sample will also be utilized as a source of normal DNA to determine whether sequence 
variants in the PIK3CA gene and in other relevant oncogenes in the tumor DNA are somatic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
4.5.11.12 Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.11.13  DLCO Testing 
A diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test will be required at baseline and at the end of study-drug treatment (prior to surgery) for all patients.  The DLCO test should be repeated if there is  clinical suspicion of pneumonitis.  Further 
guidance regarding DLCO testing is contained in Appendix 7 and in the management 
guidelines  f
or pneumonitis (Section 5.1.1.2).   
4.5.11.14  Osteoporosis Assessment and Monitoring 
Treatment with aromatase inhibitors results in  bone loss due to estrogen deficiency.  
For patients who have a history of osteoporosis and/or fractures, or who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, a bone mineral density assessment will be required at baseline prior to initiating study treatment.  Baseline bone mineral density wi ll be measured via 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  DXA measurement of both the hip and 
lumbar spine is suggested.  When either the hip or lumbar spine is not a valid skeletal 
site for a bone mineral density measurement, then the 33% (one-third) radius should be 
measured.  In some patients, measurement of the hip alone could be sufficient. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 76 Appropriate monitoring in these patients will occur per institutional guidelines.  
Assessment for fractures is already included as part of the scheduled physical examinations.  Determination of  patients who are at increa sed risk for osteoporosis will 
be per institutional guidelines.  Clinical risk factors for fracture include advancing age, previous fracture, glucocorticoid therapy, parental history of hip fracture, low body weight, current cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and secondary osteoporosis (e.g., hypogonadism or premature menopause, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory  bowel disease) (Kanis et al., 2005).   
4.5.12 Patient-Reported Outcomes   
PRO data will be elicited from the patients in this study to more fully characterize the clinical profile of GDC-0032.  The PRO questionnaires, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient.  To ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, PRO questionnaires should be self-administered at the investigational site prior to the completion of other study assessments and the administration of study treatment.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and the Modified Breast Cancer module QLQ-BR23 
questionnaires will be used to assess HRQoL, including side-effects of systemic therapy (e.g., sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, skin problems) and patient functioning during the neoadjuvant period (refer to schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 1 for a detailed description of timepoints) and post-surgery follow-up.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used HRQoL measure in oncology trials with excellent 
psychometric properties demonstrating both relia bility and validity. The measure consists 
of “five functional sca
les (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom 
scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale” with a recall period of “the past week” (Aaronson et al. 1993). Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item scales, global health status/QoL scale, and six single items by using a liner transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score.   
The EORTC QLQ-BR23 breast cancer module was first validated for use in 1995, uses a 
recall period of “the past week,” and is intended for use across multiple treatment modalities (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment).  As this trial will include patients in the neo-adjuvant setting, the last seven items of the original BR23 questionnaire, items numbered 47
 − 53 that deal with symptoms and side effects 
not relevant to the population under study, will be removed.  These seven items addressed symptoms experienced by metastatic breast cancer patients and those undergoing radiation.  Therefore, in consultation with the EORTC, these items were deleted, as the validity of the measure would not be compromised by their removal.  In addition, as “oral mucositis” and “skin problem s” are key symptoms of this therapy not 
assessed by currently available tools, validated items from the EORTC item bank were added to assess the presence and bothersomeness of oral mucositis (2 items:  sore 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 77 mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing) and skin problems (2 items).  Data analysis will be 
performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item and single-item scales by using a linear transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score. 
The PRO instruments, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by 
the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient.  Patients must 
complete these instruments in the clinic (cannot be taken home) prior to any healthcare provider interactions (i.e., prior to administration of study drug and prior to any other study assessment) to ensure that the validity of the instruments are not compromised and to ensure that data quality meet regulatory requirements. 
Refer to Appendix 4 for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified QLQ-BR23. 
4.5.13 Samples for Clinical Repository  
All residual samples (or leftover biologic samples after protocol-defined studies are 
completed) obtained during the study (FFPE, fresh-frozen, plasma, etc.) will be stored in an academic central repository.  The specim ens in the study repository will be made 
available for future biomarker research towards further understanding of treatment with GDC-0032, of breast cancer, related diseases, and adverse events, and for the development of potential, associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation of study repository specimens is governed by the Study Steering Committee, with guidance from a dedicated Translational Research Committee to ensure the appropriate use of the study specimens. 
All biomarker specimens will be retained for new  research related to this study and/or 
disease in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Study Steering 
Committee.  Samples will be only destroyed if required by local laws relating to the collection, storage, and destruction of biological specimens. 
Specimens will be stored up to 15 years or unt il they are exhausted.  The storage period 
will be in accordance with the institutional review board/ethics committee 
(IRB/EC)-approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as describ
ed below.   
4.5.13.1 Confidentiality 
Patient medical information associated with biologic specimens is confidential and may only be disclosed to third parties as permitted by the ICF (or separate authorization for 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 78 use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless 
permitted or required by law. 
Data derived from biologic specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The 
aggregate results of any research conducted using biologic specimens will be available in accordance with the effective Translational Reseach Committee policy on study data publication. 
4.6 PATIENT, TREATMENT, STUD Y, AND SITE DISCONTINUATION 
4.6.1 Patient Discontinuation   
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study 
• Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient • Patient non-compliance 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain inform ation on patients who withdraw from the 
study.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
4.6.2 Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients must discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following: 
• Pregnancy 
• Disease progression • Unacceptable toxicity 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced. 
4.6.3 Conditions for Terminating the Study  
Both the Sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate their participation in the study under the circumstances agreed upon in the site agreement.  Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual basis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, the Sponsor and investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interest.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 79 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
GDC-0032 is not approved and is currently in early clinical development.  Thus, the 
entire safety profile is not known at this ti me.  Human experience is currently limited.  
The following information is based on results from ongoing clinical studies .  The safety 
plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below.  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities (see Section 5.3.5.3), defined 
and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  General safety assessments will includ
e 
serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistry and blood counts.  All serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest will be reported in an expedited fashion, via fax to Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) safety department and also captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  In addition, the Sponsor and the investigators will review and evaluate obser ved adverse events on a regular basis. 
All adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until the end of study visit, whichever occurs later.  Patients who have an ongoing study treatment-related adverse event upon study completion or at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be attributed by the investigator to study drug or to another 
clearly identified etiology by the investigator (see Table 10).  
Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, a
s well as measures intended to 
avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.  
5.1.1 Management of Specifi c Adverse Events of GDC-0032  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.  
Additional guidelines are provided in the subsec
tions below.  
Due to the approximately 40-hour half-life for GDC-0032, investigators should consider holding GDC-0032 for certain Grade 2 toxicities until the adverse event resolves to Grade ≤  1 as discussed below (e.g., stomatitis/mucositis, colitis, rash, diarrhea, 
pneumonitis).  Certain toxicities can occur within 1 −2 weeks of holding or discontinuing 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 80 GDC-0032 drug (e.g., pneumonitis, colitis, rash).  In these cases, the adverse event 
eventually resolves.  Investigators should follow management guidelines and dose 
modifications for toxicities as described below, including administration of topical or systemic corticosteroids as appropriate.

Second reduction  3 mg at 3 days on / 4 days off a 
 a If the patient continues to experience specified drug-related adverse 
events after the second dose redu ction, the treatment should be 
discontinued.   
5.1.1.1 Management of Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients who received GDC-0032 in the single-
agent Phase I study.   
Patients with diabetes requiring daily anti-hyperglycemic medication or who have a 
fasting blood glucose level > 125 mg/dL will be excluded from the study.  HbA 1c and 
fasting glucose levels will be monitored at baseline, and additional monitoring of fasting glucose levels during the study will be implemented, as outlined in the schedule of assessments.  Patients should be instructed to report symptoms associated with hyperglycemia such as thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision. 
Metformin is the first antihyperglycemic medica tion of choice because of the lower risk of 
hypoglycemia with this agent.  Because metformin in some patients may also cause 
diarrhea and not be well tolerated, other antihyperglycemic medications such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride, glipizide) can be used.  Extra caution should be used with other drugs such as sulfonylureas because of the increased risk for hypoglycemia with these agents.  Consultation with an endocrinologist can be helpful in managing hyperglycemia.   
Specific dose modification and management gui delines for hyperglycemia are provided 
in Table 2.

5.1.1.2 Management of Pneumonitis 
Patients who require any daily supplemental oxygen are not eligible for the study.  
Patients who have DLCO values  < 60% will be excluded from the study.  Patients will 
be assessed for pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study.   The DLCO test 
should be repeated if there is clinical susp icion of pneumonitis.  The DLCO test will 
also be repeated presurgery after completion of study treatment.   Management 
guidelines for patients with possible pneumonitis are listed in Table 3.

5.1.1.3 Management of Rash 
Rash and other dermatological events should be closely monitored, and patients with 
severe rash should be monitored for associated signs and symptoms such as fever and hypotension that may be suggestive of a system ic hypersensitivity reaction.  For severe 
rash, dosing of GDC-0032 should be interrupted, and patients should be treated with supportive therapy per standard of care.  Use of antihistamines, as well as topical or systemic corticosteroids, may be considered (see Table 4).

etc.).   
5.1.1.4 Management of G astrointestinal Toxicity 
5.1.1.4.1 Management of Diarrhea 
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed per protocol guidelines and institut ional standard of care.  For example, 
prompt management of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold GDC-0032 for Grade ≥  2 diarrhea until it improves to Grade ≤  1.   
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea are provided in 
Table 5.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 84 Table 5 GDC-0032 Dose Modificati on and Management Guidelines 
for Diarrhea 
Grade of Diarrhea Dose Modification and Management Guidelines  
Grade 1 • Manage per institutional standa rd of care that includes 
antidiarrheals. a 
Grade 2 • Hold GDC-0032 and manage per institutional standard of care 
until Grade  ≤ 1.  These include antidiarrheals. a 
• For persistent Grade 2 non-infec tious diarrhea despite treatment 
with antidiarrheals, additional coadm inistration of corticosteroids 
(e.g., budesonide 9 mg PO QD) are recommended. b  Non-
infectious diarrhea can be diagnosed by stool culture. 
• For persistent Grade 2 diarrhea lasting longer than 1 week with 
an adequate trial of anti-diarrheal medications, or for recurrent 
Grade 2 diarrhea, restarting at the next lower dose level should 
be strongly considered after diarrhea improves to Grade  ≤  1.  
• If Grade 2 diarrhea is persistent despite treatment with SOC, 
consider work-up for colitis (e.g., performing abdominal/pelvis CT and/or endoscopy, and stool culture as appropriate).   
Grade 3 or 4 • Hold GDC-0032 and manage per institutional standard of care 
until Grade  ≤ 1. These include antidiarrheals. a   
• Consider work-up for colitis (e.g., performing abdominal/pelvis 
CT and/or endoscopy, and stool culture as appropriate). 
• Restart GDC-0032 at the next lower dose level upon resolution 
to Grade  ≤ 1. 
• For persistent Grade 3  − 4 non-infectious diarrhea despite 
treatment with antidiarrheals, administration of systemic corticosteroids should be considered. 
b 
• For Grade 3 diarrhea, may consider restarting at the same dose 
if event occurred because of  lack of optimal medical 
management with antidiarrheal medications, after discussion with and approval by the medical monitor.   
• For Grade 4 diarrhea, consider permanent discontinuation of 
GDC-0032. 
CT  = computed tomography; PO  = oral; QD  = once daily; SOC  = standard of care. 
a Suggested antidiarrheals include the followin g: loperamide (initial: 4 mg, followed by 
2 mg after each loose stool, up to 16 mg/day); diphenoxylate and atropine 
(Diphenoxylate 5 mg 4 times/day until cont rol achieved [maximum:  20 mg/day], then 
reduce dose as needed; some patients may be controlled on doses of 5 mg/day; tincture 
of opium (6 mg of undiluted opium tincture [10 mg/mL]) 4 times daily. 
b Examples of corticosteroid regimens include the following:  For the steroid taper, 
suggested steroids include a methylprednisolone dose pack or prednisone 60 mg daily followed by a taper (e.g., 60 mg

consider budesonide 9 mg PO QD or prednisone 5 mg to 10 mg PO QD. 
  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 85 5.1.1.4.2 Management of Colitis 
Data as of October 2013 show an incidence rate for colitis of 6.2% (10/160) (1 at 16 mg; 
8 at 9 mg; 1 at 6 mg  + fulvestrant) with onset at approximately 100 days or longer after 
initiation of treatment with daily GDC-0032 dosing.  Some patients have developed Grade 2 or Grade 3 diarrhea, which is non-responsive to anti-diarrheal medication.  In some of these patients, a CT scan or colonoscopy has revealed colitis, which has resolved upon treatment with systemic corticosteroids. 
For persistent Grade 2 diarrhea that does not resolve or for Grade ≥  3 diarrhea, further 
evaluation should include colitis in the differential diagnosis with the appropriate work-up 
(e.g., abdominal/ pelvis CT scan, endoscopy with biopsy, stool cultures for cytomegalovirus, Clostridium difficile, and parasites).  Grade ≥ 2 colitis should be 
managed by interruption of study treatment.  In addition, discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or any other medications known to exacerbate colitis symptoms should be considered.  If noninfectious colitis is suspected, treatment with corticosteroids per institutional standard of care should be considered.  It is suggested that prednisone (for oral administration) or solumedrol (for IV administration) are the corticosteroids of choice in the treatment of colitis.  For severe symptoms, prednisone 60 mg or equivalent may be required to control initial symptoms, and the dose should  be 
gradually tapered.  Lower doses of prednisone, oral budesonide, or mesalamine (or other 5-aminosalicyclic acid derivatives)  may be considered for less severe cases of 
colitis. 
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for colitis are provided in Table 6.

Aggressive mouth care for oral mucositis and stomatitis with mouthwash formulations 
(e.g., combinations of local anesthetic, antihistamine, corticosteroid, antacid, antifungal and/or antibiotics) may also be helpful in managing symptoms, and it is recommended that these are implemented with early signs of dry mouth, Grade 1 mucositis, or Grade 1 stomatitis (see Table 7).  Avoidance of spicy foods may also be helpful.

5.1.3 General Guidance for Dose Modifications and Delays for 
Letrozole  
The letrozole dose level cannot be modified.  In general, the investigator can consider 
continuing letrozole if it is not thought to be letrozole-related.   
All dose modifications should be based on the adverse event requiring the greatest 
modification and should be properly documented in the source documents. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 88 5.1.4 Management of Increases in QT Interval   
Study drug should be discontinued in patients who develop any of the following, unless 
there is a clear alternative cause for the changes: 
1. Sustained (at least two ECG measurements  > 30 minutes apart) QTcF that 
is  > 500 msec and  > 60 msec longer than the baseline value 
2. Sustained absolute QTcF that is  > 515 msec  
3. An episode of torsades de pointes or a new ECG finding of clinical concern 
 
Of note, if there is a new intraventricular conduction block, the increase in QRS complex 
duration should be subtracted from the QTcF change, as this represents an increase in QTcF unrelated to alterations in repolarization.  Also of note, it is not uncommon to record arrhythmias such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, pauses, or atrial fibrillation in healthy volunteers receiving placebo during 
periods of extended ECG monitoring.  Therefore, it is critical that expert electrophysiologic advice be sought to conf irm any ECG changes and to ascertain the 
likelihood of a drug-induced arrhythmia versus the background occurrence of this arrhythmia.  In such a situation, saving all available ECG data is highly suggested. 
Management of patients with sustained QTcF prolongation should include close 
monitoring, with ECGs repeated at least hourly until two successive ECGs show resolution of the findings, correction of any electrolyte abnormalities, and possible discontinuation of other concomitant medications that are known to prolong the QT interval.  Consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is recommended, to help in the management of such patients. 
In rare circumstances, it may be acceptable to resume study drug, at a lower dose, 
provided that any ECG abnormalities have resolved and the patient is appropriately monitored.  Clinical judgment should be applied. 
5.1.5 Safety Monitoring for Letrozole  
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal AI indicated for first line treatment of hormone receptor positive, locally advanced, or metastatic  breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  
Letrozole is also indicated for adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal hormone-receptor positive patients and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following anti-estrogen therapy. 
The most frequently reported adverse events in a first line, breast cancer clinical trial 
with letrozole were bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, arthralgia, and dyspnea.  Clinically significant adverse events also include bone effects (osteoporosis and bone fractures) and hypercholesterolemia.  Discontinuations for adverse events other than progression of tumor occurred in 2% of patients on letrozole.  Refer to the U.S. letrozole Package Insert or SmPC for additional information.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 89 There are no expected significant overlapping toxicities between letrozole and 
GDC-0032. Routine safety monitoring and periodic laboratory tests for the letrozole and GDC-0032 combination will occur throughout the study. 
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS 
Safety assessments will consist of monito ring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest; measurement of protocol-specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
5.2.1 Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical  investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.9  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 90 5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to ABCSG)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
Severity and
 seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to ABCSG safety 
department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.3 Non-Serious Adverse Events of  Special Interest (Immediately 
Reportable to ABCSG)   
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by the 
investigator to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of 
special interest for this study include 
 the following: 
• Grade 4 hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  3 symptomatic hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  2 colitis or enterocolitis  
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
• Grade  ≥  3 rash 
• Grade  ≥  2 pneumonitis  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 91 • Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s 
law (see Section 5.3.5.5) 
• Suspected tr ansmission
 of an infectious agent by the study drug   
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and additionally reported to ABCSG 
safety department in case they fulfill t
he criteria for expedited reported in accordance 
with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4 − Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event CRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriou
sness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3 ), and 
causality (see Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study 
drug, will be reported until 30 days  after the last dose of study drug or until the end of 
study visit, whichever occurs later.  After this period, investigators should report any deaths, serious adverse events, or other adv erse events of concern deemed related to 
prior study drug treatment or study procedures ( Section 5.6). 
5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 9 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE.

a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b Examples of self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dr essing and undressing, 
feeding one's self, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who 
are not bedridden. 
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medi cal event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions),  per the definition of seriou s 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instruction
s), per the definiti on of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 10): 
• Temporal relationship of  event onset to the initiat
ion of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 93 Table 10 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO Adverse events will be consid ered related, unless they fulf ill the criteria as specified 
below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by one adverse event 
report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 94 5.3.5.1 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
5.3.5.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  The progression (increase and decrease) of an adverse event must be documented in the Adverse Event eCRF.   
The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated 
to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens. If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.3.5.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 95 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 times the ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
5.3.5.4 Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 96 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  
Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the 
following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) 
and reported to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learnin g of the event), either as se
rious adverse event or a non-serious adverse 
event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
5.3.5.6 Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to ABCSG safety department (see Section  5.4.2 
). This includes death attributed to progression of breast cancer. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be replaced by the established cause of death. 
5.3.5.7 Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions CRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 97 5.3.5.8 Hospitalization or  Prolonged Hospitalization 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalizat ion (i.e., in-patient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2), except as outlined 
below.   
The following hospitalization scenar ios are not  considered to be adverse events: 
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study 
• Hospitalization for respite care 
• Planned hospitalization required by the protocol for breast cancer surgery  
• Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
• The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during 
the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the 
expected normal progression of the disease 
• The patient has not suffered an adverse event 
• Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer 
 
• Hospitalization for outpatient care outside of normal clinic operating hours that is 
required per protocol or per local standard of care 
• Hospitalization for protocol mandated biopsies 
 
5.3.5.9 Adverse Events Asso ciated with an Overdose 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
5.3.5.10 Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any patient responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO questionnaires, site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the patient's medical record per site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an adverse event, it will be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 98 5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO ABCSG 
Certain events require immediate reporting to  allow ABCSG safety department to take 
appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator 
must report such events to ABCSG safety department immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to ABCSG safety department within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events 
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest 
• Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report new significant follow-up information for these events to 
ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results • Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery 
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 99 5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, 
investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fax. In addition the serious adverse event and non-serious adverse event of special interest informat ion will be captured in the EDC system.   
Worldwide Sites: ABCSG safety department  
Fax No.: +43 1 409 09 90 
Relevant follow-up information should be s ubmitted to ABCSG safety department as 
soon as it becomes available and/or upon request. 
5.5 FOLLOW-UP OF PATIEN TS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.5.1 Investigator Follow-Up  
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. 
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilit ate source data 
verification (SDV).  For follow-up reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, investigators should record all follow up information immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fa x. In addition the serious adverse event 
and non-serious adverse event of special interest follow-up information will be captured in the EDC system. If, after follow-up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and paper Serious Adverse Event form, if applicable.   
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome, 
and they should be reported according to the instructions provided in Section 5.4. 
5.5.2 Sponsor Follow-Up  
For serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the Sponsor and/or ABCSG safety department or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 100 5.6 POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
At the time of study completion or study discontinuation, the investigator should instruct 
each patient to report to the investigator any subsequent adverse events that the patient’s personal physician believes could be related to prior study drug treatment or study procedures.   
The investigator should report these events directly to Genentech Safety Risk 
Management via telephone at 1-888-835-2555. 
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all seri ous adverse events and non-serious adverse 
events of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events us ing the following reference documents: 
• GDC-0032 Investigator's Brochure   
• Local prescribing information for letrozole SmPC 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. 
An IDMC will monitor the incidence of t he above-listed anticipated events during the 
study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the 
test product will be submitted to health authorities. 
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN   
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization. Final analysis will be performed after last patient, last visit (LPLV) and subsequent data cleaning, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated by randomization. 
Safety analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization and 
received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 101 6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
This study is designed for testing the effect of GDC-0032 on the two co-primary 
endpoints in all enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 
patients in total. Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) 
for approximately 10% of the patients and the prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, 
there will be approximately 120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, 
there might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT 
cohort, which may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical power even when the treatment assignment is imbalanced, 
the sample size was calculated based on a conservative scenario by assuming that the treatment assignment imbalance in PIK3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was 
calculated based on a chi²-test using continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable for the MRI ORR, approximately 300 
enrolled patients and 108 patients in the PIK3CA  MT cohort will be evaluable for 
analyses. This sample size allows us to detect an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-0032 plus letr ozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only 
arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power 
and 16% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. 
Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled 
patients and 120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to 
detect an absolute percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA MT cohort at the 4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more 
substantial treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA MT cohort than assumed, or 
there is an increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  MT.   
6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY 
Enrollment, study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be summarized overall and by treatment arm. The incidence of study treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression will be tabulated. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 102 6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPARABILITY 
Demographic variables, stratification factors, and other baseline characteristics will be 
summarized by treatment arm. 
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the ITT population; that is, all randomized patients will be included in the analyses, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are (1) tumor ORR, assessed by modified RECIST criteria by breast MRI and (2) the rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug. 
The tumor ORR will be calculated by treatment arm in all enrolled population and in 
PIK3CA MT population . Within each population, the ORR for the two treatment arms will 
be compared at a two-sided alpha of 16% using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status. The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR. The two alpha values account for a family-wise type I error rate of 20%. Patients with early study termination and hence missing efficacy outcome will be considered as non-responders. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatment, assessed by modified RECIST 
criteria by breast MRI in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug in 
PIK3CA  WT patients.  
• These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be 
analyzed analogue to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
• The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients 
and separated by PIK3CA  mutation status: 
• ORR by clinical breast examination, mammography, and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) • Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to 
surgery (centrally assessed) 
• PEPI score (centrally assessed) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by breast 
MRI 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 103 • Evaluation of different definitions of pCR including the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and 
b) ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR) 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be compared 
between the two treatment arms within each population based on appropriate statistical analyses:  ORR will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by regression analyses, adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All secondary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES 
Safety analyses will include all patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory 
test results, changes in vital signs, and letrozole and GDC-0032 exposure. 
Verbatim descriptions of adverse events will be mapped to thesaurus terms.  Adverse 
event data will be listed by study site, tr eatment arm, patient number, and study day, 
severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, and action taken with the study treatments.  Events occurring on or after treatment on Day 1 of Week 1 will be summarized by thesaurus term, appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade.  Serious adverse events, including deaths, will be listed separately and will be summarized.  
Relevant laboratory and vital sign (heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) data will 
be displayed by time, with NCI CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 and 4 values identified, where appropriate.  Additionally, all laboratory data will be summarized in tables by NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade. 
6.6 PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSES   
Ki67 biomarker analyses will include patients with at least one predose and one postdose biomarker assessment, with patients grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
6.7 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES   
Individual C max and trough plasma concentrations (C min) of GDC-0032 and letrozole from 
all patients enrolled will be reported. Mean of trough plasma concentrations of GDC-0032 and letrozole will be tabulated. The population pharmacokinetics of letrozole and GDC-0032 in this study will be compared with historical single-agent pharmacokinetics to assess the potential DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole in this population.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 104 Additional PK analyses on metabolites of GDC-0032, letrozole, and/or other concomitant 
medications may be conducted as appropriate. 
6.8 PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME ANALYSES  
Patient-reported outcomes of breast cancer symptoms, patient functioning, and HRQoL will be assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified Breast Cancer module 
(QLQ-BR23)  
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median and range) of linear transformed scores will be reported for all the items and subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, and the modified QLQ-BR23 according to the EORTC scoring manual guidelines for each assessment time point. The mean change of the linear transformed scores from baseline (and 95% CI using the normal approximation) will also be assessed. Line charts depicting the mean changes (and standard errors) of items and subscales over time will be provided for each treatment arm from the baseline assessment. 
Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the 
final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  
Completion and compliance rates will be summarized at each timepoint by treatment 
arm with reasons for missing data. Only patients with a baseline assessment and at least one post-treatment assessment will be included in the analyses. The number and proportion of patients who improved, worsened, or remained stable for all of the symptom and functional domains, global QoL, and single items of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 will be summarized. 
6.9 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES   
Additional details on analyses will be specified in the SAP. 
6.10 INTERIM ANALYSES   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to review the unblinded safety data after the first 20 patients have either 1) finished the 30-day, follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the 
surgery).  All available information of all enr olled patients with all available assessments 
at the respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.  In addition, the IDMC or the Medical Monitor may request additional ad hoc meetings of the IDMC at any time during the study to review safety data.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2 105 7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ABCSG will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking 
of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, ABCSG and/or all involved clinical research associat es (CRAs) will request data clarification from 
the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
ABCSG will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including review of the ABCSG’s data management plan and corresponding specifications.  Data will be transferred electronically from ABCSG to the Sponsor at the end of the study and whenever otherwise contractually agreed, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at ABCSG and  records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the ABCSG’s standard procedures. 
Data from paper PRO questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by site staff. 
Original PRO questionnaires will be kept in the patient’s medical record as source documentation. 
7.2 DATA(BASE) MANAGEMENT 
ABCSG Clinical Data Management will check all e-forms for plausibility and consistency by automatic edit checks and manual data review according to study-specific data management plan (DMP).  If necessary, web-based data queries (data clarification requests [DCRs]) will be generated and subsequently visible for the investigators, dedicated site staff, responsible CRAs, and responsible ABCSG staff.  For those eCRFs which pass all verification procedures and are regarded as correct and complete, they will be frozen subsequently by ABCSG clinical data management. Consequently, no further data entries or changes on frozen eCRFs are possible. The status of frozen eCRFs is flagged by the specific icon. 
Clinical Data Management ensures that the database is corrected for the following eCRF 
issues without immediate notification to site staff (self-evident corrections). Notification of site staff is provided via a specific report after final data cleaning procedures and before final data confirmation by the investigator or a designee: 
• misspellings/typing errors that do not change the meaning of the word 
• location of data recorded at an incorrect variable field or eForm (e.g., moving lab 
data from general comments to the appropriate lab table) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 106 • standard time to 24-hour clock 
• correction of date format, if required (dd/mm/yyyy) 
• if equivalent units of terms are recorded instead of the acceptable ABCSG standard 
• data changes due to plausibility checks and eCRF content (e.g., combination of 
several variables and/or eCRFs) 
All data management workflows are described in detail in the relevant SOPs and 
working instructions of ABCSG. 
7.3 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed using the Clinical Data Management System “MACRO,” a web-interface DATAPORT.  Sites will receiv e training by the responsible CRAs and have 
access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion (web data entry).   
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff in a timely manner, 
usually within 2 weeks after the patient visit.  Electronic CRFs should be reviewed and respective data confirmation eCRF should be electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee at the end of the study.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a storage medium (compact disc [CD], digital video disk [DVD] etc.) 
that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the storage medium is required. 
7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors (CRAs) will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that criti cal protocol data 
(i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 107 Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigators a nd institut
ions must provide the Sponsor/CRAs 
direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The investigational site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change. 
7.6 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, PRO data (if applicable), ICFs, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer. After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor. Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location. 
8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
This study will be conducted in full conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for GCP and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. The study will comply with the requirements of the ICH E2A guideline (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). Studies conducted in the United States or under a U.S. Investigational New Drug (IND) application will comply with U.S. FDA regulations and applicable local, state, and federal laws.  Studies conducted in the European Union/European Economic Area will comply with the E.U. Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 108 8.2 INFORMED CONSENT 
The Sponsor’s sample ICF (and ancillary sample ICFs) will be provided to each site.  If 
applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample ICFs or any alternate cons ent forms proposed by the site (collectively, 
the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC submission.  The final IRB/EC-approved consent forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements. 
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory 
samples for optional exploratory research.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives of the exploratory research. Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research. Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature. 
The ICFs must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative before participation in the study. The case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. 
The eCRF contains a section to document whether the patient has signed the ICF or not. 
The ICFs should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures or when 
new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate. The final revised IRB/EC-approved consent forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes. 
Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of the consent forms (or to a 
significant new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study. For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised consent forms for continued participation in the study. 
For patients not qualified or incapable of giving legal consent, written consent must be 
obtained from the legally acceptable representat ive. In the case where both the patient 
and his/her legally acceptable representativ e are unable to read, an impartial witness 
should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. After the patient and representative have orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature on the form will attest that the information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood. The investigator or designee must also explain that the patients are 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 109 completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any 
reason. 
A copy of each signed ICF must be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative. All signed and dated ICFs must remain in each patient’s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
For sites in the United States, each ICF may also include patient authorization to allow 
use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). If the site utilizes a separate authorization form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies. 
8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR ETHICS COMMITTEE 
This protocol, the ICFs, any information to be given to the patient, and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the sponsor, the affiliated groups, or contract research organizations (CROs) according to the applicable local laws and regulations, if applicable by the Principal Investigator, and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.  
The Sponsor, affiliated groups, or CROs are responsible for providing written summaries 
of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with 
the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the local IRB/EC. The Sponsor, affiliated groups, or CROs are also  responsible for promptly informing the 
IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see Section 9.6). 
In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse eve
nts to the Sponsor, 
investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with local health authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and archived in the site’s study file.  
8.4 DATA PRIVACY 
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the study through assignment of a unique identif ication number. This means that patient 
names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location. 
Patient medical information obtained by th is study is confidential and may only be 
disclosed to third parties as permitted by the ICF (or separate authorization for use and 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 110 disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or 
required by local law. 
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare, for treatment purposes, provided the patient has given consent. 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of the U.S. FDA and other national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate. The patient will have to consent to such access by signing the informed consent form. 
8.5 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study (i.e., LPLV). 
9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, MONITORING, AND 
ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented, including but  not limited to the protocol, protocol 
amendments, ICFs, and documentation of IRB/ EC and governmental (health authorities) 
approval. In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive the patient data, which includes an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data. 
9.2 ON SITE QUALITY CONTROL (MONITORING) 
During the study, CRAs will visit their respective sites on a regular basis as outlined in the study specific monitoring plan (MP) and all other relevant specifications, in order to guarantee adherence to the protocol and to the principles of GCP and to check for the progress of enrolment, adequate storage conditions of IMP and adequate drug dispensing and accounting records.  
CRAs will review documented data in the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy 
according to the study-specific MP, subsequently flag all reviewed pages with a specific mark (“SDV done”) within the EDC system “MACRO,” web-interface DATAPORT, developed by .  The CRAs will raise data queries (“DCRs”) in cases of 
missing source data or incorrect data entries. Immediately after electronic issue of the queries, they become visible to the investigator, the clinical data managers, and the ABCSG clinical safety officers (“raised  DCRs”).  CRAs and/or clinical data managers 

 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 111 and/or ABCSG clinical safety officers will follow up with trial site personnel until final data 
query resolution. 
9.3 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
The investigator should document and expl ain any deviations from the approved 
protocol. The investigator should promptly  report any deviations that might impact 
patient safety and data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC policies and procedures. 
9.4 SITE INSPECTIONS 
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for inspection of study data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will permit international and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 
9.5 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE 
This trial will be sponsored by Genentech and will be managed by Genentech in 
collaboration with the Breast International Group (BIG), ABCSG, and  the Spanish Breast 
Cancer Research Group (SOLTI). Genentech in collaboration with BIG, ABCSG, and 
SOLTI will provide clinical operatio ns management, data management, and medical 
monitoring.  Approximately 110 U.S. and international sites will participate to enroll approximately 330 patients. 
An IDMC will be in place throughout the study  and will provide oversight of safety and 
efficacy analyses (see Section 3.1.2). 
After written informed consent has been obtained, the study site will obtai n the patien
t’s 
screening number from the IxRS system. Once eligibility has been established, the 
patient will be enrolled, and the study site will obtain the patient’s identification number from the IxRS. Once results of the tissue analysis are made available, the patient will be randomized, and the site will obtain the bli nded treatment assignment from the IxRS.  
The IxRS will manage GDC-0032/placebo drug inventory at all sites and letrozole drug inventory at all study sites outside the United States.  IxRS will be required to randomize patients, to monitor enrollment and patient status, and to manage study treatment requests and shipments.  
Patient data will be recorded via an electronic data capture (EDC) system from  
, United Kingdom), which will be managed by ABCSG using eCRFs 
(see Section 7.2).   
Central laboratories, including Genentech and Genentech collaborators, will be used for 
PIK3CA  
mutation detection, Ki67, and PTEN status and/or will provide kits for PK, 
pharmacogenomic, tissue, whole blood, and plasma sample analyses to be conducted at 
central laboratories, Genentech, or Genentech collaborators. 

 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2 112 An independent radiologic review facility will be used for the purpose of collecting and 
assessing the quality of patient scans throughout the trial. The review facility will retain 
copies of scans for centralized assessments of MRI-related endpoints .   
9.6 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
Any protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor.  Protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. 
Approval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authorities (as locally 
required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients or changes that involve logistical or administrative aspects only (e.g., change in Medical Monitor or contact information).

Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer 
Conventional response criteria may not be ideal for the assessment of response in the 
setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer. Therefore, RECIST 1.1 criteria have been modified to specifically address assessment of primary breast lesions along with axillary lymph node disease, using a range of breast imaging modalities.  Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1
1 
are presented below, with modifications and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity. For detailed information on the read methodology including how imaging data should be processed prior to reads, please refer to the Study Imaging Charter.  
 RECIST v1.1 Modified RECIST Early Breast 
Cancer Neoadjuvant Therapy 
Modalities CT as primary modality, 
ultrasound not 
recommended No CT; primary assessments by MRI; 
also assessments by ultrasound, 
mammography, and clinical exam  
Lymph nodes May be considered 
target lesions based on 
size criteria ( ≥ 15 mm in 
SAD) Only axillary lym ph nodes assessed; 
nodes that are considered abnormal on imaging (based on morphological factors including, but not limited to SAD) to be followed as non-target 
lesions 
Possibility of having only 
non-target disease Allowed Not allowed; primary breast lesions 
must be measurable by MRI and/or 
ultrasound 
CT = computed tomography; MRI  = magnetic resonance imaging; SAD  = short axis dimension. 
 
BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. All baseline evaluations shoul d be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Method of Measurement  
According to RECIST 1.1 guidelines, MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting.  CT is currently the preferred modality for assessing metastatic disease, but should not be used in this focused setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.  Ultrasound, mammography, and clinical exam are all

Protocol GO28888, Version 2   125 common and useful modalities for assessing breast lesions, and will also be used to 
assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Up to 2 
lesions in the breast may be identified as target lesions.  A sum of the diameters of all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, and 
lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see below for 
more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment. The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality. If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment time point, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as 
non-target lesions at baseline. Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in the 
assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions should 
be followed qualitatively, as described below at each response assessment timepoint.   
Appendix 3  
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2   126 Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged 
• Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum • Irregular margins or spiculations • Rim enhancement • Decreased echogenicity of cortex 
• Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.  While on study, all lesions 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.  
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is abl e to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.

Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 2   127 Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment.   When non-nodal lesions fragment, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
• All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
• PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2   128 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response. Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.

Protocol GO28888, Version 2   129 Special Notes on Response Assessment  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease as shown in Table 1.

Note: The T classification of the primary tumor is the same regar dless of whether it is based on clinical or pathologic criteri a, or both.  Size should 
be measured to the nearest millimeter.  If the tumor size is slig htly less than or greater than a cut-off for a given T classification, it is recommended 
that the size be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cut-o ff.  For example, a reported size of 1.1 mm is r eported as 1 mm, or a 
size of 2.01 cm is reported as 2 cm.  Designation should be made wi th the subscript "c" or "p" modi fier to indicate whether the  T classification was 
determined by clinical (physical examination or radiologic) or pathologic measurements, respectively.  In general, pathologic d etermination should 
take precedence over clinical determination of T size.

a Clinically detected is defined as detected by imaging studies (excluding lymphoscintigraphy) or by clinical examination and ha ving characteristics 
highly suspicious for malignancy or a presumed pathologic macrometastasis based on fine needle aspiration biopsy with cytologic  examination.  
Confirmation of clinically detected metast atic disease by fine needle aspiration without excision biopsy is designated with an (f) suffix, for 
example, cN3a(f).  Excisional biopsy of a lymph node or biopsy of a sentinel node, in the absence of assignment of a pT, is cla ssified as a 
clinical N, for example, cN1.  Information regarding the confirmation of the nodal status will be designated in site-specific f actors as clinical, fine 
needle aspiration, core biopsy, or sentinel  lymph node biopsy.  Pathologic classification (pN) is used for excision or sentinel  lymph node biopsy 
only in conjunction with a pathologic T assignment.

Post-treatment yp M classification.  The M category for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy is the category assigned in the 
clinical stage, prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  Identification of distant metastases after the start of therapy in cases where 
pre-therapy evaluation showed no metastases is considered progre ssion of disease.  If a patient was designated to have detectab le 
distant metastases (M1) before chemotherapy, the patient will be designated as M1 throughout.

Note: Stage designation may be changed if postsurgical imaging studi es reveal the presence of distant metastases, provided that  the studies are 
carried out within 4 months of diagnosis in the absence of dise ase progression and provided that the patient has not received n eoadjuvant therapy.  
Post-neoadjuvant therapy is designated with "y c" or "yp" prefix.  Of note, no stage group is assigned if there is a complete pa thologic response (CR) 
to neoadjuvant therapy, for example, ypT0cM0.   
a T1 includes T1mi.   
b T0 and T1 tumors with nodal micrometastases only are excluded from Stage IIA and are classified Stage IB.   
c M0 includes M0(i+); The designation pM0 is not valid; any M0 should be clinical.  If a patient presents with M1 prior to NAST,  the stage is 
considered Stage IV and remains Stage IV regardless of response to neoadjuvant therapy.

Correction of Predicted DLCO  for Hemoglobin and Alveolar 
Volume 
All DLCO measurements will be obtained as per the American Thoracic Society and 
European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) gu idelines (MacIntyre et al. 2005).  
The predicted DLCO value should be corrected for both hemoglobin (H b) and alveolar 
volume (v a).   
Pulmonary function test laboratories that follow the ATS/ERS guidelines should be able 
to provide the value for DLCO, corrected for v a.  A single breath v a may be used to 
obtain DLCO, corrected for va.  Use the following equation to determine the predicted DLCO, corrected for H
b and v a: 
Predicted DLCO, corrected for H b and v a = [DLCO, corrected for v a] × [1.7 × Hb / 
(9.38 + Hb)] 
Use the formula below to determine the percentage of predicted DLCO value (now corrected both for Hb and v
a):  
% of predicted DLCO (corrected for H b and v a) = [actual DLCO / (predicted 
DLCO corrected for H b and v a)] × 100

Objectives  
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluat e the efficacy of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus 
letrozole plus placebo in women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) early stage breast  cancer, as measured by the following co-
primary endpoints: 
• Tumor overall objective response rate (O RR) by centrally assessed breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  mutant (MT) patients 
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in  breast and axilla (ypT 0/Tis ypN0) by local 
evaluation in all enrolled patients and PIK3CA  MT patients 
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are the following: 
• Tumor objective response rate (ORR), asse ssed by centrally assessed breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) via modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) in PIK3CA  WT patients 
• pCR rate in breast and axilla (total pC R ypT0/Tis ypN0) by local evaluation in PIK3CA  
wildtype (WT) patients  
The following secondary objectives will be perfo rmed in all enrolled patients and separated by 
PIK3CA  mutation status: 
• Compare letrozole plus GDC-0032 with letrozole plus placebo in terms of locally assessed 
ORR using the following methods: 
• Breast ultrasound 
• Clinical breast exam (i.e., palpation) 
• Mammography  
• Central assessment of changes in Ki67 levels upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC-0032 
versus letrozole plus placebo from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery; and Week 3 to surgery.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 13 • Compare the centrally  assessed, preoperati ve endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score 
upon treatment with letrozole plus GDC- 0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
• Evaluate the changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by 
breast MRI via central assessment. 
• Evaluate different definitions of pCR including the following: a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) ypT0/is, 
ypNX (breast pCR). 
Safety Objective 
The safety objective for this study is as follows: 
• Evaluate the safety of letrozole plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo 
Patient-Reported Outcome Objectives   
The patient-reported outcome (PRO) objectives for this study are as follows: 
• Evaluate and compare PROs of treatment-re lated symptoms, patient functioning, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) betwee n treatment arms as measured by the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and the modified Breast Cancer Module (QLQ-BR23) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To evaluate changes in tumor cellular comp osition as assessed by diffusion-weighted MRI 
• To assess whether biomarkers from tumor tissue or blood, including but not limited to 
somatic cancer associated mutations, PTEN ex pression, pro-survival pathways (such as 
PI3K/AKT, MAPK etc.), apoptotic markers, and levels of RNA and DNA expression are 
predictive of response  
• To determine whether inhibition of PI3K with  GDC-0032 results in changes in downstream 
markers in tumor tissue and to examine t he relationship to anti-tumor activity 
• To assess concordance and percentage of PIK3CA  mutation status from baseline biopsy 
and surgical specimen 
• To assess emergence of resistance alleles from tumor tissue or blood  
• To assess concordance of the different imaging modalities (MRI [volume, enhancement, 
diffusion metrics], ultrasound, mammography) in measuring tumor response 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics and possible drug interaction between letrozole and GDC-
0032 upon concomitant administration 
• To assess the correlation of GDC-0032  drug levels and GDC-0032 related response 
(efficacy or adverse events [e.g., colitis, rash]) 
• To assess the influence of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms on GDC-0032 and/or letrozole 
on pharmacokinetics and response (eithe r efficacy and/or adverse events) 
• Compare the rates of breast-conserving surg ery (BCS) and conversion to BCS in letrozole 
plus GDC-0032 versus letrozole plus placebo. 
Study Design  
Description of Study 
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate the 
effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated,  Stage I-III operable breast ca ncer whose primary tumors 
are
 ≥ 2 cm.  Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors  are not eligible.  Standard of care 
assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tiss ue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal cutting 
temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffi n-embedded cores [FFPE]). Two pretreatment 
FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to 
beginning study drug treatment.  Prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for 
enrollment eligibility purposes.  For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), 
and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. ER, PR, HER2, and 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 14 the percentage of Ki67-positive cells will also be  centrally assessed, but the results do not have 
to be available prior to enrollment in the study.  Remaining tissue will be retained for future 
translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed. 
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization ratio.  
Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily pl us either GDC-0032 at 6 mg or placebo on a 
5 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A maximum of 
16 weeks of GDC-0
032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued up to surgery per the 
investigator’s discretion. 
After confirmation of all the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized to one of the treatment 
arms.  A second biopsy will be performed on Day 15 (Week 3) for biomarker analyses. Biopsies 
should be performed at least 2 hours after GDC-0032 dose administration. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed according to 2 factors: 
1. Tumor size (T1-T2 vs. T3) 
2. Nodal status (cytologically positive vs . radiologically or cytologically negative) 
The study will enroll approximately 330 pati ents at approximately 110 global sites. 
At Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, and 16 the primar y breast tumor and axillary lymph nodes will be 
assessed by clinical breast ex amination (palpation and caliper measurement).  Suspicion of 
progression based on clinical exam at  any time should be further evaluated ( Figure 6).  
At Week 9, a breast ultra
sound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive disease 
and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspic ion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound 
should be confirmed by investigator-assessed br east MRI.  Patients with primary disease not 
evaluable by ultrasound at baseline should be assessed by MRI at Week 9.  Suspected 
progression in nodes should also be confirmed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) if these nodes 
had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patients with progressive 
disease (as defined by modified RECIST, Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or 
be taken off of 
the study, according to the invest igator’s decision. If the patient goes off-study, 
every reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another 
systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surg eon.  The purpose of th is visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. 
mastectomy) and scheduling the dat e for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. Clinical 
breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected at screening, at Week 3, and 
prior to surgery. 
Surgery 
Surgery will take place after at leas t 16 weeks of treatment, during Weeks 17
 − 18.  Surgery 
should be performed within 4 days after the last dose of GDC-0032, if possible, to best observe 
pharmacodynamic knockdown with GDC-0032 in the surgical specimen.  Surgery may be 
delayed due to toxicity or other safety issues, upon discussion with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section 5.4.1) or recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; 
see below).  
A maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032 can be administered.  Letrozole can be 
continued up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion.   
Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice . However, pre-surgical SLNB is not allowed. 
Information on the type of surgery will be co llected and recorded. Su rgery specimens will be 
collected for histological examination to as sess for pCR and for other endpoint analyses. 
Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local st andards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be de livered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, 
radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+  1 week) after surgery, and will mark the end of 
the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at this visit and 
the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 15 The patient should be evaluated at baseline and a fter Week 13 of treatment for planning of the 
surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both physician recommendation and final patient 
decision should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pathological complete response (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be 
established via a local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and directions 
for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Revie
w Facility (IRF) will be us ed to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  IRF 
procedures are detailed in the IRF charter. 
Number of Patients 
The study will enroll approximately 330 pati ents at approximately 110 global sites.

Concomitant Therapy 
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g ., prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, 
herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplement s) used by a patient from 7 days prior to 
screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.   
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4  in HLM and appeared to be a weak time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data 
from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate t hat 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in 
patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC 0032 may be adminis tered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates 
without the risk of a pharmacokineti c drug-drug interaction (DDI).  
Prohibited Therapy 
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer agents such 
as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted t herapy, biological response modifiers, or 
endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topical estrogens (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is receiving 
these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to 
randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast and/or 
regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment includi ng bisphosphonates and receptor activator 
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the management of 
osteoporosis in patients who have been receivin g them at a stable dose for at least 2 weeks 
prior to randomization.  Patients who develop osteopenia or osteoporosis in the follow-up 
period may receive bone-targeted therapy as per the clinician’s discretion.  Primary use of 
bisphosphonates as a prevention of bone metastasis or as a prevention of bone loss is prohibited.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with no or 
minimal potential to inhi bit CYP3A4.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
Length of Study 
The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months for enrollment, plus 5.5 months after last patient in. 
End of Study 
The end of the study is defined as the date when the last patient has her postsurgery visit.

at the investigator’s discretion).   
Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis 
This study is designed for testing the effect of  GDC-0032 on the two co-primary endpoints in all 
enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 patients in total. 
Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) for appr oximately 10% of 
the patients and t he prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, there will be approximately 120 
patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, there 
might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT cohort, which 
may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical 
power even when the treatment assignment is  imbalanced, the sample size was calculated 
based on a conservative scenario by assuming that the treatment assignment imbalance in 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 20 PIK3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was calculated based on a chi²-test using 
continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980). 
To control an overall two-sided, family-wis e error rate under 20%, we use a two-sided 
significance level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable fo r the MRI ORR, approximately 300 enrolled 
patients and 108 patients in the PIK3CA  MT cohort will be evaluable for analyses. This sample 
size allows us to detect an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-
0032 plus letrozole arm (64%) versus the letrozol e-only arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and 
Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 80% power and 16% two-sided significance level.  The 
minimal detectable difference for ORR is approximately 15%. Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 
120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an absolute 
percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GD C-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the 
letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005; Ellis and Ma 2007) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the 
4% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for pCR rate is 
approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more substantial 
treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA  MT cohort than assumed, or there is an 
increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased 
to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  
MT.   
Secondary Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatmen t, assessed by modified RECIST criteria by 
breast MRI in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total  pCR) after completion of study drug in PIK3CA  WT 
patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be analyzed analogue 
to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by PIK3CA  mutation status: 
• ORR by clinical breast examination, mammography and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) 
• Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to surgery 
(centrally assessed) 
• PEPI score (centrally assessed) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by breast MRI 
• Evaluation of different definitions of pCR in cluding the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and b) 
ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR). 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be compared between 
the two treatment arms within each population based on appropriate statistical analyses: ORR will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by regression analyses, 
adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All se condary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided 
type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Determination of Sample Size   
 Please refer to the primary analysis in the Statistical Methods section.  
 Interim Analyses 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will monitor accumulating patient safety 
data at a minimum of once every 6 months until the last patient has completed study treatment.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 21 Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, comm unication, affiliations) will be provided in the 
IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to re view the unblinded safety data after the first 20 
patients have either 1) finished the 30-day follow- up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on study 
for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the surgery).  The 
IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK 
summaries (all interim analyses).  While this revi ew is being conducted, patient accrual into the 
study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may 
call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safety  analyses with the study team.  The study team 
will share interim safety results with study inve stigators as needed for the conduct of the study 
and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues antici pated in this trial, as well as 
measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following 
sections. 
All available information of all enrolled patients with all available assessments at the respective 
timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 26 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON THE PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-KINASE 
PATHWAY 
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase involved in tumor cell proliferation, 
survival, and migration upon activation by growth factor receptors and integrins.  PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Cantley 2002), a second messenger involved in the phosphorylation of AKT and associated proteins in the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Guertin and Sabatini 2007 [29]).  Activating and transforming mutations, as well as amplification, in the p110 α 
subunit of PI3K are commonly found in solid and
 hematological tumors (Li et al. 1997 
[38]).  In addition, the PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in numerous types of cancer by 
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling,  t
he loss of the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN), 
or RAS mutations (Shayesteh et al. 1999 [ 58]; Cantley 2002 [ 11]; Massion et al. 2004 
[42]; Wu et al. 2005 [ 68]). 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-POSITIVE, 
HER2-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of total cancer deaths (Jemal et al. 2011 [ 34]).  As a large proportion of breast cancer 
cases, espe cially in developed coun
tries, are now diagnosed in early stages, they are 
amenable to cure with a stage-appropriate combination of surgery, systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy), and radiotherapy. 
Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative 
(HER2-) breast cancer accounts for about 60%
 − 70% of all breast cancers.  However, 
not all ER+ breast cancers respond optimally to endocrine therapy (Davies et al. 2011 [15]).  There are several mechanisms that can lead to primary and/or secondary 
hormonal resistance in ER+ breast cancer:  decrease of ER expression, loss of ER 
expression, 
or upregulation of growth fact or signaling pathways, like the epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (Johnston 2009 [ 35]). 
In the setting of ER
 + /HER2-negative breast cancer, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays 
an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and is a viable therapeutic target to explore (Miller et al. 2010 [47]). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 27 1.3 BACKGROUND ON THE PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY AND 
BREAST CANCER 
Genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are frequently mutated or amplified in 
breast cancer, especially in the ER+ s ubtype (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012 [ 10]).  
Molecular alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway include the following: (1) Mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA , the gene encoding th e alpha cata
lytic subunit of 
PI3K (p110α ) (Saal et al. 2005 [ 52]; Wu et al. 2005 [68]); (2) Alterations in the tumor 
suppressor gene PTEN, either by loss of protein  expression 
(PTEN null), inactivation 
mutations and/or epigenetic deregulation through promoter hypermethylation (García et al. 2004 [ 27]); (3) PDKP1 amplification and/or overexpression (Brugge et al. 2007 [ 9]); (4) 
AKT1 somatic gain of fu nction mutations (Stemke-Hale et al. 
 2008 [ 61]) and AKT2 
amplifications (Bellacosa  et al. 1995 [ 7
]). Overall, it is estimated that up to 70% of breast 
cancers can have some form of mole cular aberra
tion of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
(CGAN 2012).   
1.4 BACKGROUND ON REVERSING HORMONAL RESISTANCE BY 
INHIBITING THE PI3K /MTOR/AKT PATHWAY 
In the setting of ER+ breast cancer, PI3K seems to play an important role in mediating hormonal resistance and may be a viable therapeutic target. Hyperactivation of this signaling pathway was proved to promote both de novo and acquired resistance to 
hormone therapy in ER+ breast cancer cell lines and xenograft models (Sabnis et al. 2007 [ 53]), and simultaneous blocking of the PI 3K/AKT/mTOR pathwa y
  with everolimus 
and the ER pathway with letrozole enhances antitumor activity of either agent alone (Boulay et al. 2005 [8]). Importantly, a baseline protein signature of PI3K activation was found to be predictive of a poor prognosis after a djuvant endocrine thera
py (Miller et al. 
2010 [47]). 
In the clinical  setting, 
impressive results of the combination of exemestane and 
everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, were reported in the BOLERO-2 trial (Baselga et al. 
2009 [6]). This trial compared everolimus and exemestane with placebo and exemestane in 724 postmenopausal patients wit 
h ER+ advanced breast cancer who had 
experienced recurrence or progression while  receiving previous therapy with a 
nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting and/or in advanced disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the everolimus group was 6.9 months, as 
compared to 2.8 months in the placebo group.  Hazard ratio (HR) for progression or death was 0.43, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.35
 − 0.54 (p  < 0.001), as per the 
investigator’s assessment, and the magnitude of the effect was even greater as per central assessment (HR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27
 − 0.47; p  < 0.001).  In the open-label Phase 
II TAMRAD trial, patients with aromatase inhibitors (AI) resistant metastatic breast cancer received tamoxifen plus everolimus or tamoxifen alone (Bachelot et al. 2012 [ 4]). 
The 6-month clinical benefit rate was 61% (95% CI, 47%
 − 74%) with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29%  − 56%) with tamoxifen alone. Time to progression 
increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 28 everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination 
(HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36  − 0.81).  Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus 
everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24  − 0.81). 
In the neoadjuvant setting, combination of letrozole and everolimus also resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]).  In this study, 270 postmenopausal patients with operable ER+ breast 
cancer were randomly assigned to receive 4 months of neoadjuvant treatment with 
letrozole an 
d either everolimus or placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial, clinical 
response by palpation, was higher in the everolimus arm than in the control arm (68.1% vs. 59.1%, p
 = 0.062), a statistically significant result (one-sided, α  = 0.1 level). 
An important finding in trials with mTOR-tar geting drugs like everolimus is that they 
produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of the phosphorylated form of AKT (pAKT), resulting in feedback PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009 [ 62]). This finding suggests 
that alternative pharmacologic strate gies to effectively shut down the pathway upstream 
of AKT should be pursue 
d.  One of these strategies is inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway at the level of PI3K. 
1.5 BACKGROUND ON NEOADJUVANT THERAPY IN BREAST 
CANCER 
The use of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer has been studied in several large randomized trials that have compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy with standard adjuvant treatment (Mauriac and Smith 2003 [ 44]; Scholl et al. 1994 [ 56]; Semiglazov et 
al. 2004 [ 57]; Fisher et al. 2012 [ 26]; Wolff and Davidson 2000 [ 67]).  The randomized 
studies evaluating neoadjuvant therapy as well as meta-analyses of these studies ha ve 
shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve br e 
ast conservation rates, decreasing the 
number of women obligated to undergo mastectomy (Mieog et al. 2007 [ 46]; Fisher et al. 
2012).  A meta-analysis of nine randomized stud ies comparing adjuvant with 
neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer
 showed no difference in rates of death, 
disease progression, or disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy (Mauri et al. 2005 [ 43]).  The concept of neoadjuvant therapy is now well 
established and a stand ard treatment option for 
patients with early breast cancer.  The 
Collaborative Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was recently conducted evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2012 [ 12]).  The results of this 
meta-analysis confirmed an association of pathologic comple te response 
[pCR] with 
favorable long-term outcomes in high-risk populations (i.e., HER2-positive, high-grade hormone receptor positive and triple negative subtypes), although the magnitude of pCR improvement predictive of the long-term surv ival benefits could not be determined.  In 
September 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 29 of Perjeta as part of a complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, 
locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. 
1.6 BACKGROUND ON GDC-0032 
GDC-0032 is a potent selective inhibitor of Class I PI3K alpha, delta, and gamma isoforms, with 30-fold less potent inhibition of the beta isoform that is being developed as a therapy for human cancers.  Nonclinica l studies with GDC-0032 demonstrate that 
GDC-0032 inhibits proliferation of p110 α-mutant breast cell lines, inhibits tumor growth 
in human breast xenograft models harboring PIK3CA  mutations, and results in a 
substantial reduction of PI3K pathway markers, including pAkt, pPRAS40, and pS6.   
GDC-0032 has demonstrated activity in nonclinical models of PIK3CA -mutant breast 
tumors in vivo as a single agent and in combination with standard of care (e.g., paclitaxel 
or docetaxel) or endocrine therapies (e.g., letrozole or fulvestrant).  GDC-0032 has a favorable in vitro and nonclinical in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination profile that has characterist ics consistent with a compound that can be 
delivered orally to achieve clinical exposure similar to the nonclinical efficacy findings 
described herein.  Additional studies, including 16-week toxicity studies in rats and dogs, phototoxicity studies, and an embryo-fetal development study, support the Phase II neoadjuvant trial with GDC-0032 in combination with endocrine therapy.   
In vitro, single-agent GDC-0032 potency is also observed in cell lines that do not harbor 
PIK3CA  mutations ( Figure 1).  In in vitro combination studies, the aromatase-expressing 
breast cancer cell line (MCF7 X
2.3.ARO) showed positive combination effects between 
GDC-0032 and endocrine therapies (see Figure 2).  In this cell line, GDC-0032 alone 
caused growth inhibitio n (50% effective concen
tration [EC 50]  = 95 nM). Effects on growth 
were also observed with letrozole and fulvestrant.  Combined treatment of cells with GDC-0032 and letrozole caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability at lower concentrations of either GDC-0032 or letrozole resulting in enhanced activity for the combination. In addition, combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  wild-type 
(WT) cell line ZR75-1 when GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapies (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).  However, in vivo data in a PIK3CA WT model are not available, because these cell lines do not 
grow as xenografts.

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 32 1.7 SUMMARY OF CLINICAL DATA FOR GDC-0032  
1.7.1 Clinical Safety Data with GDC-0032  
As of 5 July 2013, a total of 144 patients have been treated with GDC-0032 either as 
single agent (90, 63%) or in combination with endocrine therapy (54, 37%). 
GDC-0032 is currently in Phase I (Study PMT4979g).  Study PMT4979g is an open-label, 
dose-escalation trial using a 3 + 3 design to assess the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 administered orally daily for 28 days to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and in combination with endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancers.  As of 5 July 2013, enrollment into the dose-escalation stage of 
Study PMT4979g had been completed with 34 patients enrolled at doses with a range of 3
  to 16 mg daily.  GDC-0032 was well tolerated in the first three cohorts (3, 5, and 8 mg), 
with no patients experiencing a dose-limiting to xicity (DLT).  At the 16-mg dose level, 
2 of the 11 safety-evaluable patients experienced a DLT (Grade 4 hyperglycemia and Grade 3 fatigue).  At the 12-mg dose level, 1 of the 10 safety-evaluable patients experienced a DLT of Grade 3 acute renal failure.  Although the single-agent GDC-0032 maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not exceeded at the 16-mg dose level, the recommended GDC-0032 dose and schedule for the single-agent expansion cohorts is 9 mg daily on the basis of long-term safety data through multiple treatment cycles.  As of the cutoff date, a total of 53 patients have been enrolled in the 9-mg daily dosing expansion cohorts.  
As of 5 July 2013, adverse events that occurred in ≥
 10% of the 87 patients treated with 
daily single-agent GDC-0032 and were assessed as related to GDC-0032 were as 
follows:  diarrhea (47%), hyperglycemia (38%), nausea (36%), fatigue (34.5%), decreased appetite (31%), rash (16%), stomatitis (13%), vomiting (13%), and mucosal inflammation (11.5%).  Study −drug-related Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included 
hyperglycemia (9.4%), colitis (7.5%), pneumonitis (3.8%), rash (including maculopapular rash with or without itching, redness, and peeling) 5.7%, asymptomatic increased aminotransferase levels in the blood (1.9%), anemia (1.9%), increase in blood creatinine (1.9%), diarrhea (1.9%), fatigue (1.9%), hypokalemia (1.9%), hypophosphatemia (1.9%), pneumonia (1.9%) and stomatitis (1.9%).    
As of 5 July 2013, a total of 27 patients have been enrolled in the expansion cohort of 
GDC-0032 at dose levels of 6 and 9 mg daily (19 patients at 6 mg, and 8 patients at 9 mg) daily in combination with letrozole (Cohort E).  No DLTs were observed at either dose level.  Adverse events that occurred in ≥ 10% of the 27 safety-evaluable patients 
assessed as related to GDC-0032 were diarrhea (67%), fatigue (30%), nausea (30%), decreased appetite (26%), hyperglycemia (26%), stomatitis (26%), dysgeusia (22%), mucosal inflammation (18.5%), rash (18.5%), asthenia (15%), pruritis (15%), vomiting (15%), dry mouth (11%), dry skin (11%) and muscle spasms (11%). Study
 − drug-related 
Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included diarrhea (11%), mucosal inflammation (7.4%), increased amylase in the blood (3.7%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 33 the blood (3.7%), increased alkaline phosphate in the blood (3.7%), fatigue (3.7%), 
increased gamma-glutamyltransferase in the blood (3.7%), hyperglycemia (3.7%), hypokalemia (3.7%), increased lipase in the blood (3.7%), papilloedema (3.7%) and stomatitis (3.7%). 
As of 5 July 2013, a total of 27 patients have been enrolled in the expansion cohort of 
GDC-0032 at dose levels of 6 and 9 mg daily (21 patients at 6 mg and 6 patients at 9 mg) in combination with fulvestrant (Cohort F).  No  DLTs were observed at either dose level.  
One patient has been enrolled in the Phase II part of the study with 6 mg GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant.  Adverse events that occurred in ≥ 10% of the 27 patients 
and were assessed as related to GDC-0032 were diarrhea (46%), hyperglycemia (32%), nausea (32%), decreased appetite (25%), fatigue (25%), rash (21%), stomatitis (21%), asthenia (18%), muscle spasms (14%), vomiting (14%), dysgeusia (11%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (11%) and mucosal inflammation (11%).  Study −
 drug-
related Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included hyperglycemia (14%), diarrhea (7%), dyspnea (4%), flank pain (4%), hyponatremia (4%), neutropenia (4%), rash (4%) and 
vomiting (4%). 
Please refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure for additional information. 
1.7.1.1 Preliminary Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 34 patients treated with GDC-0032 at 3, 5, 
8, 12, and 16 mg in the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial (Study PMT4979g).  The cohort mean apparent clearance and the terminal half-life (t
1/2) following a single, oral dose of 
GDC-0032 had a range of 4.77 −9.17 L/hour and 36.7− 43.8 hours, respectively.  
Following daily oral dosing for 8 days, there was a 2- to 4-fold accumulation of GDC-0032.  The pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 appears to be dose linear and time-independent.  Preliminary PK data from Cohort E suggest there is no drug-drug interaction (DDI) between letrozole plus GDC-0032.  Mean plasma exposure of letrozole when given in combination with GDC-0032 (maximum concentration observed [C
max] = 0.407 μM and area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24  ] = 8.01 μ M*hr) was comparable with the historical single-agent exposure 
(Cmax  = 0.495 μM and AUC 0-24   = 10.1 μM*hr) (Awada et al. 2008 [3]). Similarly, plasma 
concentrations of GDC-0032, when given in combination with letrozole, w
ere within the 
range predicted by the population PK model. Therefore, letrozole plus GDC-0032 can be co-administered without the risk of a DDI.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3 A4 in human liver microsomes (HLMs) 
and appeared to be a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro 
induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low to moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I/II study (PMT4979g) 
indicate that 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 34 GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk 
of a PK DDI.  
For additional details, refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure.   
1.7.1.2 Preliminary Pharmacodynamics 
Paired tumor biopsies were obtained from both PIK3CA MT and PIK3CA WT non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated at either the 3-mg or 16-mg GDC-0032 dose 
level, respectively, at screening (pretreatment biopsy) and during Cycle 1 in Study PMT4979g (on-treatment biopsy).  Inhibi tion of PI3K pathway markers, including 
decreases of >
 60% in pAKT and pS6 (compared with baseline), were demonstrated in 
these patients’ paired tumor biopsies (see Figure 4).

As of 5 July 2013, metabolic partial responses via FDG-PET (  ≥ 20% decrease in 
maximum standardized uptake value) were observed in 23 out of 38 patients assessed 
(61%) and included patients from the lowest dose tested (3 mg).  Thirteen of these 23 were breast cancer patients.  Of the 13 response-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 plus letrozole, 10 patients (77%) had a partial metabolic response.  Of the 15 response-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 plus fulvestrant, 11 (73%) had a partial metabolic response.

1.8 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with solid tumors accounting for 
the majority of these deaths.  An estimated 1.38 million women across the world were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, accounting for 23% of all cancers diagnosed in women.  Breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, estimated to be responsible for almost 460,000 deaths in 2008 (Ferlay et al. 2010 [ 25]). 
A neoadjuvant study in a similar patient populat ion with the combination of letrozole and 
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has already been completed (Baselga et
 al. 2009 [6]).  
Please refer to Sections 1.4, 1.5 , and
 3.3 for further rationale supporting the proposed 
trial design of combinin g GDC-003
2 with letrozole in the neoadjuvant setting for this 
patient population.  In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, it is hypothesized that the combination of decreasing estrogen levels with letrozole and inhibition of the PI3K pathway with GDC-0032 may have improved anti-tumor activity as compared to endocrine therapy alone.  This is supported by the nonclinical and clinical data outlined below. 
GDC-0032 is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of Class 1 PI3K that is being 
developed by Roche/Genentech as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent.  Activating and transforming mutations in the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K are commonly found in tumors.  GDC-0032 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of growth in various human cancer cell lines, and especially in nonclinical models of PIK3CA  MT tumors.  In addition, 
combination activity was demonstrated in the PIK3CA  WT cell line ZR75-1 when 
GDC-0032 was added to either fulvestrant or tamoxifen endocrine therapies (combination with letrozole not available in this cell line).   
GDC-0032 has also shown additive efficacy in combination with endocrine therapy in a 
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer xenograft model as outlined in Section 1.6. 
Nonclinical data support
 the investigation of GDC-0032 as a single-agent in solid tumors 
and in combination with endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer.  
Available clinical data with single-agent GDC-0032 suggest that GDC-0032 has 
dose-linear pharmacokinetics with a half-life of approximately 37 −
 44 hours.  
Pharmacodynamic markers of PI3K pathway inhibition upon treatment with GDC-0032 have been observed.  These include decreases in phospho-S6 in platelet-rich plasma and decreases in F- flurodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography uptake.  Available clinical data also include multiple confirmed partial responses in patients treated with GDC-0032.  These include a patient with PIK3CA  MT lung adenocarcinoma treated at 
the 3 mg daily dose and another patient with PIK3CA  MT, hormone receptor-positive, 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated at the 5 mg daily dose.  In addition, a 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 36 patient with PIK3CA  WT lung cancer treated at the 3 mg daily dose has had prolonged 
stable disease and remained on study for over 11 months.  These data show that single-
agent GDC-0032 doses below 6 mg have been shown to have anti-tumor activity.  These aggregate data support the use of 6 mg in combination with letrozole.   
Letrozole is a marketed product that is approved in the European Union (E.U.) and the 
United States (U.S.) for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  Based upon the different mechanisms of action of GDC-0032 and the well-established safety profile of letrozole, there are no expected overlapping, significant toxicities between letrozole and GDC-0032.  
As of 5 July 2013, efficacy data are available for 24 patients treated with GDC-0032 in 
combination with letrozole; 3 patients (12.5%) had a partial response as best overall response, 2 of which were confirmed partial responses (cPRs) (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 cPR at 9 mg).  Of the 25 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with fulvestrant, 7 patients (28%) had a partial response as best overall response, of which 3 were cPRs (1 cPR at 6 mg; 1 partial response at 9 mg).  cPRs have been observed in both PIK3CA  mutant and PIK3CA  WT breast cancer patients.  Maintenance of cPR has 
been observed in a patient who had a dose reduction from 6 mg to 3 mg for an adverse event.  In addition, no additional safety concerns have been observed with GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole in the ongoing Phase I study compared to GDC-0032 given as single agent. 
A number of clinically appropriate strategies to minimize risk to patients have been built 
into the protocol through the means of inclus ion/exclusion criteria, monitoring strategies, 
protocol design, and management guidelines.  These will also be clearly highlighted and discussed in detail at investigator meetings and site visits.  In addition, please refer to the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure for details regarding potential risks, associated precautions, and other relevant nonclinical and clinical safety information. 
Due to the need to develop improved therapies to reverse or delay resistance to current 
endocrine therapy in HER2-negative, hor mone receptor-positive breast cancer  and on 
the basis of the clinical and nonclinical data available for GDC-0032, Genentech/Roche 
feels that the risk-benefit profile of GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole in 
postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, hormone receptor-positive early stage 
breast cancer is favorable for proceeding with the proposed randomized Phase II clinical 
trial.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pre-operative study to evaluate 
the effect of combining letrozole and GDC-0032 versus letrozole and placebo in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- untreated, Stage I-III operable breast cancer 
whose primary tumors are ≥ 2 cm.  Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors are not eligible.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 39 Standard of care assessments/procedures (e.g., bilateral mammogram) performed 
within 28 days of Day 1 dosing do not need to be repeated for screening purposes. 
All patients will undergo pretreatment tumo r tissue acquisition (snap-frozen [optimal 
cutting temperature; OCT] and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cores [FFPE]).  Two 
pretreatment FFPE core biopsies and one freshly frozen core biopsy must be obtained for all patients prior to beginning study drug treatment.  Tumor tissue from prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsies may be used for enrollment eligibility purposes. For the purpose of enrollment, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment. Remaining tissue will be retained for future translational studies. Pre-surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not allowed.   
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms with a 1:1 randomization 
ratio.  Letrozole at 2.5 mg will be dosed once daily plus either GDC-0032 at 6 mg or placebo on a 5
 − days-on/ 2  − days-off schedule for a total of 16 weeks (see Figure 5).  A 
maximum of 16 weeks of GDC-0032
 can be administered.  Letrozole can be continued 
up to surgery per the investigator’s discretion. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 41 At Week 9, a breast ultrasound will be performed to ensure that there is no progressive 
disease and for the purpose of surgery planning. Suspicion of progressive disease on breast ultrasound should be confirmed by investigator-assessed breast MRI.  Patients with primary disease not evaluable by ultrasound at baseline should be assessed by MRI at Week 9.  Suspected progression in nodes should also be confirmed by fine 
needle aspiration (FNA) if these nodes had not been previously shown to be cytologically positive for cancer.  Patient s with progressive disease (as defined by 
modified RECIST, Appendix 3), can either proceed directly to surgery or be taken off of 
the study, according to the investigator’s decisio n. If the patient goes off-
study, every 
reasonable effort should be made to obtain a new biopsy prior to beginning another systemic treatment. 
From Week 13, the patient will visit with the surgeon.  The purpose of this visit is two-fold:  
tentative planning of the type of breast surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and scheduling the date for definitive surgery.  
During Week 16, breast MRI will be done for the purpose of primary endpoint analysis. 
Clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will also be conducted prior to surgery for the purpose of the secondary endpoint analysis.  
Blood sample for exploratory endpoint analysis will be collected at screening, at Week 3, 
and prior to surgery. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 43 Following surgery, follow-up will proceed according to local standards of care.  Adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy will be deliv ered as per the investigator’s choice. 
Postoperative radiotherapy is required if BCS is performed.  In the event of mastectomy, radiotherapy is to be administered according to local guidelines. 
A postsurgery visit will be performed 4 weeks (+
 1 week) after surgery, and will mark the 
end of the study. Assessment of adverse events and general safety will be collected at 
this visit and the plan for future treatment will be recorded. 
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and after Week 13 of treatment for planning 
of the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy), and both physician recommendation and final patient decision should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint, pCR (pCR–ypT0/is, ypN0) will be established via a 
local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.  
Please refer to the pathology manual for further guidance of evaluation for pCR and 
directions for sending a copy of the pathology report.  
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1.  
An Independent Review Facility (IRF) will be used to determine the tumor ORR via MRI.  
IRF procedures are detailed in the IRF charter. 
3.1.2 Independent Data Monitoring Committee   
An IDMC will monitor accumulating patient safety data at a minimum of once every 6 months until the last patient has completed study treatment.  Additional details (e.g., IDMC members, communication, affiliation s) will be provided in the IDMC charter.   
The IDMC will convene for an interim safety analysis to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics after the first 20 patients have completed surgery and have had 30 days of follow-up.  The IDMC will create and review unblinded, pooled summaries of the safety and available PK summaries (all interim analyses).  While this review is being conducted, patient accrual into the study will continue.  The Medical Monitor may also request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the IDMC to review ongoing safety data.  
The IDMC will share results from interim safe ty analyses with the study team.  The study 
team will share interim safety results with study investigators as needed for the conduct 
of the study and the safety of the patients.  Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections.

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 44 3.2 END OF STUDY  
The end of the study is defined as the date when the last patient has her postsurgery 
visit. The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months for enrollment,
 plus 5.5 months after last patient in.   
3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.3.1 Rationale for Conducting the Study in the Neoadjuvant Setting  
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and not every breast tumor responds equally 
to a specific agent.  Studies based on global gene expression analyses have provided 
additional insights into this complex scenario.  Over the past 10 years, four major classes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like) and a Normal Breast-like group have been identified and intensively studied (Perou et al. 2000 [49]; Sørlie et al. 2001 [ 60]). Known as the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, these 
groups of tumors have revealed critical diffe rences in inciden
ce, survival, and response 
to treatment. As genomic studies evolve, further  sub-classifications of breast tumors are 
expected to emerge. Thus, a major challenge in breast cancer management is how to prospectively select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from a given drug regimen, minimizing unnecessary toxicities for patients with non-responsive disease. 
Neoadjuvant therapy, a systemic therapy administered prior to breast cancer surgery, is 
now widely used in the treatment of early breast cancer patients. Outcomes of patients 
receiving neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy (Mauri et al. 2005 [ 43]), and the former offers clear advantages to patients, 
especially those with larger tumors. The tumor may shrink prior to surgery, thus increasing t
he rate of BCS (Coudert et al. 2006 [ 13]), and since the response to therapy 
can be monitored, the patient might be also spared further treatment with inactive medications.  
The neoadju v
ant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents. Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, 
usually from the diagnostic specimens. On-treatment biopsies may also be pre-specified in order to monitor treatment response at a biological level. Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well. The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes  of breast cancer (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 
2013 [ 64]; Cortazar et al. 2012 [ 12]). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
Postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative, ER+, early stage breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.  This patient population is usually treated with a combination of surgery, anti-hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy, according to staging and biological features.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 45 Recently, everolimus was approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency in 
combination with exemestane for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer in patients after recurrence or progression following treatment with nonsteroidal AIs. In the neoadjuvant setting, a combination of letrozole and everolimus resulted in improved responses over letrozole alone in patients with ER+ breast cancer (Baselga et al. 2009 [6]). 
Important findings in trials with drugs targeting mTOR, like everolimus, produce a pharmacodynamic paradox:  while inhibiting mTOR, they lead to an upregulation of t he 
pAKT, resulting in feedb
ack PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (Tabernero et al. 2009 
[62]). This finding suggests that alternative pharmacologic strategies to shut down the 
pathway upstream of AKT should be pursued. One of these strategies 
is to inhibit the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the PI3K level. PI3K-inhibitors are central regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway, and nonclinical findings show that PI3K-inhibitors and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors induce a greater amount of apoptosis than everolimus in estrogen-deprived in vitro models (Sanchez et al. 2011 [ 55]); therefore, it is 
hypothesized that PI3K-inhibitors may be active and demonstrate greater anti-tumor activity as compared to AIs alone in the neoadju
vant setting. 
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group   
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have been found to be more effective than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. 
Several trials have assessed the efficacy  and safety of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 
using AIs in patients with postmenopausal breast cancer (Eiermann et al. 2001 [ 18]; 
Smith et al. 2005 [59]; Ellis et al. 2011 [ 23]). 
The P024 trial was a worldwide, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial that 
randomized 337 postmenopausal patients with ER
 +  breast cancer to receive either 
4 months of neoadjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen (Eiermann et al. 2001 [ 18]). The primary 
endpoint of P024 was the percentage of patients in each trea tment arm with object
ive 
response as determined by clinical palpation. Secondary endpoints included ORR determined by mammogram and ultrasound, and included the percentage of patients in each arm who had become eligible for BCS. The trial demonstrated a significantly higher clinical response rate for letrozole when compared to tamoxifen (55% vs. 36%; p
 < 0.001) 
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. An improved ORR for letrozole was also observed with ultrasound (35% vs. 25%; p
 < 0.042) and mammogram (34% vs. 16%; p  < 0.001). 
The higher response rate assessed by clinical palpation translated into a significantly higher rate of women undergoing BCS in tumors that had initially been considered unsuitable for this procedure (45% vs. 35%; p
 = 0.022). Median time-to-response was 66 
days in the letrozole group and 70 days in the tamoxifen group, and both treatments were well tolerated. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 46 The IMPACT trial was a randomized, Phase II, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter 
trial that randomly assigned 330 postmenopausal women with ER+ operable or locally advanced, potentially operable breast cancer in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen placebo, tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole placebo, or a combination of tamoxifen 20 mg and anastrozole 1 mg for 12 weeks before surgery. The tumor ORR was assessed by both caliper and ultrasound. No significant differences in ORR in the ITT population between patients receiving tamoxifen, anastrozole, or the combination were seen. However, in a predefined analysis, there was a nonsignificant trend towards more patients requiring mastectomy at baseline actually receiving BCS with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (44% vs.  31%, respectively; p
 = 0.23); this 
difference became significant for patients deemed by their surgeon to be eligible for BCS after treatment (46% vs. 22%, respectively; p
 = 0.03). All treatments were well tolerated. 
The ACOSOG Z1031 trial compared three AIs in a randomized, Phase I I, neoadjuvant 
trial designed to select agents for Phase III investigations. Three hundred seventy-seven postmenopausal women with clinical Stage II to III ER+ breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole. The primary endpoint was clinical response. No formal comparison between arms was pre-specified in the statistical plan. ORR was 62.9%, 74.8%, and 69.1% for the exemestane, letrozole and anastrozole arms, respectively. On the basis of clinical response rates, letrozole and anastrozole were selected for further investigation; however, no other differences in surgical outcome, PEPI score, or Ki67 suppression were detected. The BCS rate for mastectomy-only patients at presentation was 51%. 
Results from these trials suggest that neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can be beneficial 
in postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer, and that it offers an alternative to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
3.3.4 Rationale for the Efficacy Ou tcome Measure of Response Rate 
Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
ORR is based on criteria related to changes in tumor size (e.g., RECIST) and is generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple, non-registrational, neoadjuvant trials in combination with endocrine therapy (Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]; Ellis and Ma 2007 [21]; Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]).  
Guidelines for RECIST 1.1 state tha t MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast 
lesions 
in a neoadjuvant setting, and it has  advantages over computed tomography (CT) 
and mammography (Eisenhauer et al. 2009 [ 19]). In addition, MRI has been shown to be 
more accurate than clinical palpation, ultrasound, and mammo
graphy for measuring 
residual tumor size after neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Akazawa et al. 2006 [2]; Balu-Maestro et al. 2002 [ 5]; Yeh et al. 2005 [ 69]), including the I-SPY trial 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 47 (Hylton et al. 2012 [ 32]).  For these reasons, ORR as assessed by breast MRI has been 
chosen as a co-primary endpoint for this trial.
  
3.3.4.1 Rationale for Efficacy Outcome Measure of Pathologic 
Complete Response 
pCR is a recognized efficacy endpoint of neoadjuvant trials, especially those with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it has been correlated with long-term outcomes, such as 
event-free survival (von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013 [ 64]).  
In trials of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, pCR is  an unlikely event.  For instance, in t
he 
neoadjuvant trial comparing everolimus plus letrozole to letrozole, pCR rates were 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively (Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]). 
In the ongoing Phase I/II trial that combines letrozole with GDC-0032, tumor shrinkage has been ob served, and some patients presented
 sustained partial responses. As pCR 
is a recognized indicator of activity to a given regimen, it would be useful to assess it as a co-primary efficacy endpoint of this trial. Furthermore, for the same trial size, this would represent a minimal increase in the minimum detected difference (MDD) of the 
co-primary endpoint for pCR ORR (from MDD of 12% to MDD of 13%). 
In September of 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval of Perjeta as part of a 
complete treatment regimen for patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, 
inflammatory or early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.   
3.3.4.2 Rationale for Ki67 Measurements 
Ki67 is a well-established proliferation biomarker with prognostic value in ER+ breast cancer (Dowsett et al. 2011 [17]). Efficacy of endocrine therapy relies on induction of cell-cycle arrest, and during neoadju v
ant treatment, Ki67 levels reflect the ability of 
endocrine agents to suppress proliferation (Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]; Ellis et al. 2011 [ 23]).  
In the neoadjuvant trial of letrozole with ever olimu s
, by using the definition that patients 
with natural log (Ki67)  < 1 at Day 15 have an antiproliferative response, 57% of 
everolimus-treated patients were responders vs. 30% in the placebo arm, with a significant p  value of <
 0.01 (Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]). Furthermore, the mean reduction in 
the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells at Day 15 relative to baseline was greater in 
the everolimus-treated p
atients (90.7%  ± 3.2%) than in the placebo group (74.8%  ± 6.8%; 
p = 0.0002). In the IMPACT trial, Ki67 was assessed at baseline, on Day 15, and at 
surgery (Smith et al. 2005). For each treatment arm, the reduction in geometric mean Ki67 levels was significantly higher for anastrozole than for tamoxifen at both time points (p
 = 0.004, p  = 0.001, respectively), but no differences were found between tamoxifen and 
the combination. In the ASCOSOG Z1031 trial (Ellis et al. 2011), although no data on Ki67 at Day 15 were available, no differences were found between treatments at baseline and at surgery (after 16
 − 18 weeks of therapy). The geometric mean 
percentage change in Ki67 for each treatment was similar between the arms (anastrozole 78%, exemestane 81.2%, and letrozole 87.1%). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 48 The issue of whether Ki67 decrease at surgery or at any timepoint during treatment 
correlates with long-term efficacy outcomes has been addressed in the P024 trial (Eiermann et al. 2001 [ 18]). Treatment with letrozole led to higher, treatment-induced 
reduction of Ki67 levels in the tumor at surgery (87% reduction in the letrozole arm vs. 75% in the t amoxifen arm; analysis of covariance p
 = 0.0009) based on the 185 
specimens with available data on Ki67 (Ellis et al. 2003 [ 20]). With a median follow-up of 
61.2 months, low levels of Ki67 in the biopsy at the end of treatment were significantly associat ed 
with better relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.4 per natural log increase in the 
Ki67 value, 95% CI 1.2  − 1.6, p  < 0.001), and breast cancer specific survival (HR 1.4, 
95% CI 1.1  − 1.7, p  =  0.009).  Finally, in the IMPACT trial, higher Ki67 expression after 2 
weeks of endocrine therapy was statistically significantly associated with lower RFS (p
 = 0.004), whereas higher Ki67 expression at baseline was not (Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]). 
Importantly, the Ki67 suppression in t
hese hormonal neoadjuvant trials mirrored efficacy 
outcomes in large adjuvant trials: adjuvant BIG1-98 trial (n  = 8,010) showed the superior 
efficacy of letrozole over tamoxifen (Regan et al. 2011 [ 51]), similar to the neoadjuvant 
P024 trial (n  = 185); the adjuvant ATAC trial (n  = 9,366) showed that anastrozole was 
better than tamoxifen and the combination of anastrozole plus tamoxifen (Cuzick et al. 2010 [14]), similar to neoadjuvant IMPACT (n
 = 259); and the adjuvant MA27 trial 
(n = 7,576) showed similar efficacy of anastr ozole and exemestane (Goss et al. 2013 
[30]), mirroring neoadjuvant ACOSOG Z1031 (n  = 266). These results suggest that a 
biological superiority hypothesis generat ed by a neoadjuvant study may help the design 
of future adjuvant hormonal therapy trials. 
In summary, reduction in Ki67 after neoadjuvant treatment with AIs is a good marker of 
suppression of cellular proliferation, correlates with long term efficacy outcomes, and mirrors results of large adjuvant endocrine trials, which make it an attractive endpoint to assess in the present trial. 
3.3.4.3 Rationale for Using the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic 
Index Score 
In addition to Ki67, pathologic tumor size (T1 or T2 versus T3 or T4), node status (positive or negative), and the ER status (positive Allred score 3–8 versus negative 
Allred score 0–2) of the surgery specimen were also determined to have independent prognostic value for relapse and death after relapse in the P024 trial (Ellis et al. 2008 [22]).  A PEPI score, prognostic for RFS, which weighs each of these factors according 
to their associated hazard ratios, wa s developed and subseq
uently validated in an 
independent data set from the IMPACT trial (Ellis et al. 2008). No relapses were recorded in either trial in patients with tumors classified as T1N0 and with a PEPI score of 0 (residual tumor with a Ki67 level 
 ≤ 2.7%, and with maintained ER expression) or in 
the rare patient with a pCR. 
In this trial, the PEPI score will be assessed centrally.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 49 3.3.4.4 Rationale for Assessing O RR by Clinical Breast Exam 
(Palpation), Mammography, and Breast Ultrasound 
Objective overall response rate will also be assessed by clinical breast exam, 
mammography, and breast ultrasound during screening and prior to surgery. These data will allow for more direct comparison of results to other neoadjuvant trials with endocrine therapy as described in Section 3.3.3. The concurrent acquisition of ORR data with 
these techniques, in addition to MRI-based measures, will al so provide va
luable 
comparative information on these methods, which will be important for both future neoadjuvant studies and GDC-0032 clinical development.  
3.3.4.5 Rationale for Assessing Enha ncing Tumor Volume by Breast 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
As shown in the I-SPY trial, tumor volume measurements based on the percent of tumor with enhancing signal after contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures (Hylton et al. 2012 [ 32]). However, there are no established response criteria for 
volumetric data, and the extrapolation of current one- and two-dimensional criteria to  
volumetric data based o
n a spherical model may not be appropriate given the range of 
tumor morphologies expected in this population of patients (Loo et al. 2011 [ 40]).  
Additionally, there are only very limited data on the clinical relevance of any particular 
range in cha nge in tumor volume duri
ng the course of neoadjuvant treatment. For these 
reasons, changes in enhancing tumor volume as measured by breast MRI will be a secondary endpoint in the trial.     
3.3.5 Rationale for Inde pendent Review Facility  
Due to the relatively novel nature of using MRI as an imaging endpoint, a central assessment by an IRF for the co-primary endpoint of response rate via MRI will be performed to ensure consistency across all sites participating in the study.  
3.3.6 Rationale for Interim Safety Review  
The first 20 patients will be assessed for safety following surgery and 30 days beyond. This will allow the IDMC to review all safety data during the treatment period and to evaluate any surgery complications that may be attributed to GDC-0032. 
3.3.7 Rationale for GDC-0032 Dosage  
As of 5 July 2013, 34 patients have been enrolled into the dose-escalation stage of Study PMT4979g, and 56 patients have been enrolled into the single-agent expansion cohorts at 9 mg in Stage 2 (Cohorts A-D and G).  Five dose-escalation cohorts (i.e., 3, 5, 8, 12, and 16 mg daily) were tested.  The maximal administered dose was 16 mg.  To obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability, the recommended single-agent dose and schedule for the single-agent GDC-0032 expansion stage is 9 mg daily. 
In Study PMT4979g, as of the 5 July 2013 data cutoff date, there were 87 safety 
evaluable patients treated with single-agent GDC-0032 (3
 − 16 mg daily).  A total of 97% 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 50 of patients experienced at least one adverse event per the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 (NCI CTCAE v4.0).  The most frequently reported adverse events, occurring in ≥
 10% safety-evaluable patients 
regardless of causality, were diarrhea (55%), fatigue (49%), nausea (47%), decreased appetite (39%), hyperglycemia (38%), vomiting (28%), dizziness (22%), rash (22%), dyspnea (18%), hypokalemia (18%), pyrexia (17%), cough (16%), anemia (13%), dehydration (13%), headache (13%), stomatitis (13%), AST increased (12%), mucosal inflammation (12%) and pruritis (10%).   
As of 5 July 2013, 54 patients have been treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
endocrine therapy with either letrozole (Cohort E) or fulvestrant (Cohort F) at either 6 mg or 9 mg dose levels.  No DLTs were observed during dose escalation in  either Cohorts E 
or F.  Expansion cohorts at the 6-mg dose level were enrolled to obtain more safety data on long-term tolerability.  Fifty (93%) of the 54 safety-evaluable patients experienced at least one adverse event that was assessed as related to GDC-0032.  
Of the 54 patients, 17 patients were treated with GDC-0032 plus letrozole. Adverse 
events that occurred in ≥
 10% of patients that were assessed as related to GDC-0032 
(6mg and 9mg) were diarrhea (67%), nausea (33%), fatigue (30%), rash (30%), hyperglycemia (26%), decreased appetite (26%), stomatitis (26%), dysgeusia (22%), mucosal inflammation (19%), asthenia (15%), vomiting (15%), pruritis (15%), muscle spasms (11%), dry skin (11%), and dry mouth (11%). 
Of the 19 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
letrozole, one patient at 6 mg had a cPR. The PIK3CA  mutation status of this patient is 
unknown. Since efficacy has been observed at 6 mg, and the long-term safety suggests that 6 mg is better tolerated, the neoadjuvant study will utilize 6 mg GDC-0032 in combination with letrozole.  
Of the 27 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with GDC-0032 in combination with 
fulvestrant, 2 confirmed partial responses were observed at 6 mg and 1 confirmed partial response at 9 mg. 
Colitis has been observed with an incidence rate of 6.2% (10/160 patients).  The time 
(from the first dose of study treatment) to onset of colitis ranged from approximately 82 − 248 days as either a single agent or in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant.  
Most of the colitis cases have been observed at the 9-mg dose level or higher.  Most of the colitis cases have been observed at the 9-mg dose level or higher.  To mitigate the late-onset adverse events, such as colitis, an intermittent dosing schedule will be applied. With the 40-hour half-life, a limited impact on efficacy is anticipated.  PK modeling has shown that a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off will maintain GDC-0032 drug exposure 
levels within an efficacious range as assessed by various breast cancer cell lines.  There has also been data presented for another PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with a similar half-life in combination with letrozole in a Phase Ib study that demonstrated improved tolerability 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 51 with similar efficacy for a schedule of 5 days on/2 days off as compared to daily 
continuous dosing of the PI3K inhibitor (Mayer et al. 2012 [ 45]). 
3.3.8 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments   
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and PIK3CA  mutations have been shown to 
vary among patients (CGAN 2012).  Therefore, all patients may not equally likely benefit 
from treatment with GDC-0032.  Predictive biomarker samples collected prior to dosing will be assessed in an effort to identify those patients with PIK3CA -driven pathogenesis 
who are most likely to respond to GDC-0032.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be assessed to assess the biologic activity of the addition of GDC-0032 to letrozole.  
It has been suggested that not all molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
result in pathway activation.  In a comprehensive analysis of tumors from 850 breast cancer patients, protein markers of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation (pAKT, pS6, and p4EBP1) correlated strongly with INPP4B and PTEN  loss, to a degree with PIK3CA 
amplification, but were not elevated in PIK3CA- MT luminal A cancers (CGAN 2012).  
This apparent disconnect between the presence of PIK3CA mutations and biomarkers of 
pathway activation had been previously noted (Loi et al. 2010 [ 39]), and stress the need 
to find innovative and robust predictive biomarkers to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
inhibiting a
gents (Saini et al. 2013 [ 54]). 
Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, like deep gen
ome sequencing, may offer 
a unique opportunity to identify such biomarkers of response.  For example, using whole genome sequencing, a two base-pair deletion in the TSC1 gene was found in a 
metastatic bladder cancer patient with a prolonged response (>
 2 years) to everolimus as 
single agent (Iyer et al. 2012 [ 33]).  Among 13 additional bladder cancer patients treated 
with everolimus in the same trial, those with TSC1 mutant tumors remai ned on therapy 
longer than t
hose with WT tumors (7.7 vs. 2.0 months, p  = 0.004), suggesting that 
mTORC-1 directed therapies may be most effective in cancer patients whose tumors harbor TSC1 somatic mutations.  Similar approaches could be of great value when 
analyzing responses to agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. 
In addition to mutational activation of proteins, levels of RNA and DNA can also activate 
the PI3K pathway.  For example, increases in DNA copy number in receptor tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1/2 and IGF-1R, which occur at some frequency in breast cancer, can activate downstream PI3K pathway.  Hormone receptor positive breast cancer can be divided into luminal A and luminal B subtype, with the luminal B subtype displaying a higher proliferative index.  Therefore, profiling the RNA and DNA expression of tumors will allow intrinsic subtyping of patients enrolled onto study.  In addition, PI3K transcription activation signatures may identify additional patients who could respond to PI3K inhibitors outside of PIK3CA  mutations.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 52 The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor response to treatment is an area of 
great interest.  It could allow for an early, non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates for specific therapies and monitoring of disease mutation status over time (Higgins et al. 2012 [ 31]).  The neoadjuvant setting is 
ideal to prospectively test these approaches. 
3.3.9 Rationale for Day 15 Biopsy  
On-study biopsies can provide valuable information regarding target engagement and downstream pathway suppression. Assessing ho w GDC-0032 interacts with letrozole in 
this previously untreated patient population provides a unique opportunity to understand the interaction between two anti-cancer molecules.  When available, FFPE tumor samples will be assessed for pathway m odulation using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methodologies, and fresh frozen OCT samples will be assessed using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technologies, or equivalent.  Measurement of Ki67 after 2 weeks of continuous letrozole and GDC-0032 combination treatment versus letrozole and placebo will give a good benchmark to prior neoadjuvant studies that demonstrated a larger decrease in Ki67 at this 2-week timepoint for a combination of letrozole and everolimus as compared to letrozole and placebo (Baselga et al. 2009 [ 6]).  This Day 15 biopsy will 
also be useful in identifying potential biomarkers that may hel p predict a t
umor response 
for patients treated with GDC-0032.   
3.3.10 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for the Detection 
of Plasma Protein Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases  in levels of systemic cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate response to drugs, particularly targeted agents such as GDC-0032 (Wilson et al. 2012 [ 66]).  
Assays to assess the expression of 
soluble,  systemic cytokines and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using ELISA-based mass spectrometry or equivalent methodologies.   
3.3.11 Rationale for Collection of  Blood Sample for DNA Sequencing 
to Identify Mutations in Plasma  
There is increasing evidence that circulating DNA obtained from blood specimens of cancer patients is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells (Diehl et al. 2008 [16]; Maheswaran et al. 2008 [ 41]).  Assays are available that can 
detect the major PI3K mutations (and other cancer-related genes) in plasma, and results from this analysis will be correlated with tumor specimens. 
3.3.12 Rationale for Collection of Blood Sample for Next Generation 
Sequencing  
Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate a large quantity of sequencing data.  Tumor DNA can contain both reported and unreported chromosomal alterations due to tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing calls in 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 53 previously unreported genomic alterations, a normal blood sample will be taken during 
pre-screening to determine whether the alteration is somatic or germline.  
3.3.13 Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Schedule  
PK samples will be collected from early breast cancer patients in this study to assess the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 and possible DDI between letrozole and GDC-0032 in this population.  Considering the lack of DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole upon concomitant administration in the 24 metastatic breast cancer patients in the Phase I study (preliminary data), this drug interaction in early breast cancer patients is unlikely.  Hence, extensive PK sample collection is not needed; sparse PK sampling from patients enrolled in this study is adequate.  The proposed PK sample collection schedule will also enable assessment of a concentration and response relationship to better understand the following:  pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (efficacy), PK/safety correlation, and population pharmacokinetics.  Additional PK samples may be collected for safety concerns (e.g., severe adverse event) in order to better characterize drug levels in these patients at the time of the adverse event.   
3.3.14 Rationale for the Coll ection of DNA for Exploratory 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
One sample (approximately 3 mL of whole bl ood) will be collected from all patients using 
K3-EDTA collection tubes. Samples  will be used for the evaluation of genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, CYP2C9, CYP3A4/5, and UGT1A1, and transporters (e.g., OATP1B1) and for genetic variants which could contribute to potentially drug-related rash and/or colitis safety assessments (including but not limited to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]).  For sample handling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Only in circumstances where there is concern for collection of this genetic material for above evaluations, can this assessment be c onsidered not mandatory as part of study 
assessments in this study.  Results of any analyses from these samples will be reported outside the clinical study report. 
It is established that genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which affects their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN 38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan (O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006 [ 48]).  Preliminary 
results from in vitro metabolism studies with GDC-0032 suggest that they  are partially 
metabolized by multiple Phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes, including C YP3A4.  
Although in 
vitro studies can help elucidate the roles of enzymes in the metabolism of 
the drug, these results are not always predictive of in vivo metabolism for a number of reasons, such as differences in drug concentrations that the enzymes encounter in vitro and in vivo.  For this reason, a blood sample for DNA isolation is proposed to be 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 54 collected from all patients in this study for potential pharmacogenetic analysis of genes 
or biomarkers that may affect the pharmacokinetics or response to GDC-0032.  The decision to analyze the samples will be based on a review of the pharmacokinetics and response data.  Most recently, the role of HLA has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of drug-induced rash for some drugs (carbamazepine, abacavir, and allopurinol).  Therefore, evaluation of genetic variants of ge nes that may 
regulate the immune response (including but not limited to HLA) may also be investigated to characterize unusual safety responses that are not predicted by GDC-0032 pharmacokinetics. 
The analysis will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, because it is necessary to 
link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis would be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination and/or response of patients who develop severe adverse reactions such as colitis or rash.  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 15 years after the completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
3.3.15 Rationale for Patient-Reported Outcome Assessments   
A PRO is “any report on the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without any interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else” (FDA Guidance for Industry 2007 [ 24]).  PRO measures are able to 
contextualize a patient’s experience on trial,  elucidating symptom and treatment burden.  
Since early breast cancer is often a s 
ymptomatic, the PRO objective is to evaluate and 
compare PROs of treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and the health-related quality of life between treatment arms (Lemieux et al. 2011 [ 37]).  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and associated breast cancer module, QLQ-BR23 , were selected 
because the
y were specifically developed to assess the most salient constructs and 
experiences with breast cancer and its treatment.  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely and frequently used PRO measure in oncology trials that contains a global health status scale, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and general cancer symptom scales/items with a recall period of ‘the past week.’  
The second measure, the QLQ-BR23, is a breast cancer specific modular supplement to 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, and includes additional functioning scales and symptom scales/items relating to breast cancer.  
These instruments demonstrate strong psychometric properties, of both reliability and 
validity, and meet the requirements for this study (EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 1999).  Therefore, PRO data will be collected from patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and modified QLQ-BR23 (Quinten et al. 2009 [ 50]).

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING  
4.2.1 Patient Randomization  
After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility has been established, 
the study site will obtain a patient’s identification number and treatment assignment using a permuted block randomization algorithm via an interactive voice or web-based response system (IxRS).  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 60 4.2.2 Stratification  
Patients will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio based on 
the following stratification factors: 
• Tumor size (T1-2 vs. T3) 
• Nodal status (cytologically positive vs. r adiologically or cytologically negative). If on 
ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes at the 
baseline examination, then fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy is required to confirm nodal status. 
 
4.2.3 Blinding  
Investigators and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment of GDC-0032 or 
placebo. 
If unblinding is necessary for patient management (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse 
event for which patient management might be affected by knowledge of treatment assignment), the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by contacting the IxRS following approval from the Medical Monitor.  Treatment codes should not be broken except in emergency situations where unblinding is needed for treatment decisions.  Effort should be made to contact the Medical Monitor before unblinding.  Patient treatment assignment may be unblinded at the time the patient discontinues from the blinded treatment phase at the request of the treating physician by contacting the IxRS following approval from the Medical Monitor and stating the reason for unblinding.  Unblinding during the study will result in the withdrawal of a patient from the study.  For regulatory reporting purposes, and if required by local health authorities, the Sponsor will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to study drug.  
While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK assay results for these patients are generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this trial.  The PK assay group will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignments to identify appropriate 
PK samples to be analyzed and bioanalytical methodology to employ.  However, the PK 
scientist does not have access to the PK assay results and therefore stays blinded until 
the PK assay results need to be interpreted and reported.  Samples from patients 
assigned to the comparator arm will be analyzed for letrozole.  However, GDC-0032 assay will be analyzed by request (i.e., to evaluate a possible error in dosing). 
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT  
4.3.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Handling  
4.3.1.1 GDC-0032 and Placebo  
GDC-0032 Drug Substance and Drug Product are manufactured according to current 
Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines for use in the clinical studies.  Each lot of 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 61 GDC-0032 for clinical studies is subjected to a series of quality control tests to confirm 
its identity, purity, potency, and quality. 
GDC-0032 is provided for use in clinical studies as a white, film-coated, 
immediate-release tablet formulation of 3 mg strength.  The tablet formulation consists of GDC-0032 active, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, and Opadry 2 white film coating.  All excipients used in the formulation are compendial (USP/NF/Ph. Eur/JP) grade with the exception of the film-coating.  The film-coating consists of polyviny l alcohol-part hydrolyzed, titanium dioxide, 
polyethylene glycol 3350, and talc, and these ingredients are compendial. 
Placebo tablets will be identical in shape and color to the 3-mg tablets of GDC-0032 and 
will be indistinguishable from the 3-mg tablets of GDC-0032.  The ingredients in the placebo tablets are identical to those in the 3-mg tablets of GDC-0032, except for the absence of GDC-0032 active. 
The GDC-0032 active and placebo tablets are packaged in high-density polyethylene 
bottles, are labeled for clinical use, and should not be stored above 25 °C. 
For further details, see the GDC-0032 Investigator’s Brochure.

The Sponsor will provide letrozole free of charge to all study sites. 
Refer to the letrozole (e.g., Femara
®) Package Insert or summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC) for details on the formulation and storage of letrozole. 
4.3.2 Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
4.3.2.1 GDC-0032 and Placebo 
Patients will receive an oral, daily dose of 6 mg GDC-0032 or placebo on a schedule of 
5 days on/2 days off for a maximum of 16 weeks.  Patients will take GDC-0032 at the same time of day
 ± 2 hours, unless otherwise instructed.  Patients will be instructed as to 
the number of tablets to take.  Patients will be asked to record the time and date that they take each dose in a medication diary. 
Unless otherwise instructed, GDC-0032 or placebo should be taken on an empty 
stomach (i.e., approximately 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). 
If a patient misses a GDC-0032 or placebo dose or vomits up a tablet, she should be 
instructed to skip that dose and to resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.  Missed doses will not be made up.  Patients will be instructed to bring their medication diary to 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 62 each study visit for assessment of compliance.  Patients will also be instructed to bring 
all unused tablets to each study visit for GDC-0032 or placebo accountability. 
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are 
provided in Section 5.1. 
Any overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on 
the 
Study Drug Administration eCRF.  Adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.3.2.2 Letrozole 
Patients will receive an oral, daily dose of 2.5 mg letrozole for 16 weeks (or until time of surgery at the investigator’s discretion).  No dose modifications of letrozole are permitted.  
Any overdose or incorrect administration of letrozole should be noted on the letrozole Administration eCRF.  Adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of letrozole should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
4.3.3 Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability  
All investigational medicinal products (IMPs) required for completion of this study (letrozole and GDC-0032) will be provided by the Sponsor where required by local health 
authority regulations.  The investigational site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs, using the IxRS to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.  
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s institutional 
standard operating procedure (SOP) or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation.  The site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by the Sponsor.  The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form. 
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of 
by the study site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log. 
4.3.4 Post-Trial Access to GDC-0032

A patient will be eligible to receive study drug after the end of the study if all
 of the 
following conditions are met: 
• The patient has a life-threatening or severe medical condition and requires 
continued study drug treatment for his or her well-being 
• There are no appropriate alternative treatments available to the patient 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 63 • The patient and his or her doctor comply with and satisfy any legal or regulatory

http://www.roche.com/policy_continued_access_to_investigational_medicines.pdf.  
4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening to the study completion/discontinuation visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
GDC-0032 was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 in HLM and appeared to be a weak 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Although in vitro induction studies in human hepatocytes suggested that GDC-0032 has low-to-moderate potential to induce CYP3A4, preliminary data from the Phase I study (PMT4979g) indicate that 9 mg of GDC-0032 daily for 2 weeks in patients had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate).  Therefore, GDC-0032 may be administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
Letrozole is mainly metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive carbinol metabolite by 
CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 in vivo. GDC-0032, which has the potential to induce CYP3A4 based on in vitro induction studies, was administered in combination with letrozole in the expansion phase of Study PMT4979g to assess their DDI potential. Preliminary data from 10 patients in this cohort indicated that steady state plasma concentrations of both letrozole and GDC-0032, following once daily administration of the combination (2.5 mg letrozole plus 6 or 9 mg GDC-0032), were similar to historical, single-agent data 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 64 suggesting lack of DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole. These preliminary results 
suggest that GDC-0032 and letrozole combination may be administered without the risk of a pharmacokinetic DDI.  
In vitro CYP inhibition studies in HLMs and induction studies in human hepatocytes 
suggested a low to moderate potential of GDC-0032 to perpetrate DDIs.  A clinical DDI study with rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) and itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), to understand the effect of CYP inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032, is currently ongoing (Study GP28617). 
4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy  
Prohibited therapy is as follows: 
• Anti-cancer therapy:  No additional investigational or commercial anti-cancer 
agents such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological 
response modifiers, or endocrine therapy (other than letrozole permitted in this protocol) will be allowed.  
• Hormone replacement therapy , topical estrogens (including any intra-vaginal 
preparations), hormonal contraception, megestrol acetate,  and selective 
estrogen-receptor modulators  used with prophylactic intent : If a patient is 
receiving these at the moment of registration, treatment should be discontinued prior to randomization.  
• Radiation therapy:   Radiation therapy should not be administered to the breast 
and/or regional lymph nodes prior to surgery in this study.   
• Bone-targeted therapy:  treatment including bisphosphonates and receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors  are prohibited except for the 
management of osteoporosis in patients who have been receiving them at a stable 
dose for at least 2 weeks prior to random ization.  Patients who develop osteopenia 
or osteoporosis in the follow-up period may receive bone-targeted therapy as per 
the clinician’s discretion.  Primary us e of bisphosphonates as a prevention of bone 
metastasis or as a prevention of bone loss is prohibited.   
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors:   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole and itraconazole) with GDC-0032 should be avoided.  Consider an 
alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor is co-administered with GDC-0032, patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions. 
 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
Please see Appendix 1 for the schedule of assessments to be performed during the 
study. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 65 4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study-specific screening tests or  evaluations.  ICFs for enrolled patients 
and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before randomization.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 
4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases that are currently active or that were active within the previous 5 years, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 15 days prior to the screening visit. 
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
4.5.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination should incl ude an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems as well as weight and height (height is measured at the screening visit only).  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom-directed physical 
examination may be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature.  
4.5.5 Electrocardiograms  
Triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor Assessment  
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 66 As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or abnormal physical examination; ches t CT if pulmonary symptoms.   
• For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC: bone scan and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
should be conducted for all patients. 
In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease.   
4.5.7 Tumor and Response Evaluations  
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at subsequent timepoints as outlined in Appendix 1. Responses based on clinical breast 
exam, breast ultrasound, and mammography will be investiga tor-assesse 
d.  Whenever 
possible, assessments should be performed by the same evaluator to ensure internal consistency across visits. Response via breast MRI will be centrally assessed, and all assessments will be based on modified RECIST criteria (see Appendix 3).  
Clinical Breast Examination:  Assessment of primary breast  tumor and regional lymph 
nodes must be done by physical examination (palpation) during baseline 
evaluation, 
Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13 and 16 during the treatment phase, and prior to surgery. Breast tumor measurement by caliper (preferred) or rule will be performed and recorded in the eCRF. 
Axillary lymph node status (and other regional lymph nodes if clinically indicated) will 
also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation.  
Mammogram:  Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within 28 days 
prior to enrollment and again prior to surgery. Mammographic tumor measurements are 
to be recorded in the eCRF.  
Breast Ultrasound:   Bilateral breast ultrasounds must be obtained at baseline within 
28 days prior to enrollment.  Investigator decision whether to perform unilateral or bilateral ultrasounds performed at Week 9 and prior to surgery (Week 16) may be unilateral or bilateral and per investigator discretion.  If on ultrasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes  at the baseline examination, then FNA or 
core biopsy is required.  Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded in the eCRF. The tumor site may be marked with a radiopaque clip or marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 67 Breast MRI:  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans will be mandatory for all study 
patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to enrollment) and prior to surgery (Week 16).  
MRI is optional at Week 9, but will be mandatory if a primary breast lesion is not evaluable by ultrasound, or if there are signs of disease progression on the Week 9 ultrasound (see Figure 6 ).   
Breast MRI scans should not be acquired within 48 hours aft 
er biopsy, and the timing 
and location of any clip or marker plac ement during study biopsies should be recorded 
for reference when MRI scans are read.  If the screening breast MRI scan is not evaluable for RECIST measurement due to technical limitations of the scan itself as assessed by the central reading facility, the scan may be repeated, at least 48 hours after the first scan before the start of study treatment. Other MRI acquisition sequences, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, may be acquired during this study during the MRI scan visits for each patient.  Additional MRI-derived metrics such as ADC value may provide additional insight into changes in tumor cellular composition.  
For information about patient preparation, scanner requirements and settings, and image 
acquisition, refer to the Study Imaging Manual. Standard site practice may be followed regarding the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolytics for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI. 
4.5.8 Surgical Treatment Plan  
The planned and actual surgical treatment (BCS or mastectomy) performed should be documented and reported in the eCRF.  Patients should be reassessed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and prior to surgery.  
4.5.9 Surgical Specimen – Pathology  
The co-primary endpoint of the study (pCR) will be as identified by local pathology review. Guidelines regarding pathology specimen preparation, labeling and review are outlined in the pathology manual. 
4.5.10 Laborator y Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed at the local laboratory.  The frequency of assessments is provided in Appendix 1. 
• Hematology (complete blood count, including red blood cell [ R
BC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential [neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells]), and platelet 
count.   
• Coagulation (INR and aPTT/PTT) 
• Fasting serum chemistry (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, serum 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, AST, ALT), performed following  ≥ 10-hour 
fast 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 68 • Fasting lipid profile and amylase (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], 
low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed following 
a  ≥ 10 hour fast 
• Fasting insulin and glucose  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
• Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
 
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory.  Instruction 
manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue 
• FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor 
biopsies and surgical resection.  All patients must consent to the collection of newly 
collected tumor biopsies (frozen and FFPE) for PIK3CA  mutation testing as well as 
for other protocol-mandated exploratory assessments at baseline, Day 15, and at 
surgery. 
• Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.  
Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content by a 
central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of ten unstained slides from a prior diagnostic FFPE core biopsy would be required for 
enrollment eligibility purposes. 
Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies and one freshly frozen 
OCT core needle biopsy are required at baseline and Day 15 (Week 3).    
A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block from surgical resection 
(Weeks 17
 − 18) is required.  If a tumor block cannot be obtained for various reasons 
(e.g., the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site should discuss 
with the central study team.  In such cases, paraffin-embedded, unstained slides (a 
minimum of 20 and up to 40 unstained slides) from a surgical specimen are required 
at surgery (Weeks 17  − 18). 
The specimens will be used for confirmatory central laboratory assessment of PIK3CA  mutation status, Ki67, PTEN, ER/PgR and HER2 expression.  In addition, 
other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, PI3K signaling pathways 
may be evaluated, including protein expression and molecular profiling studies such as NGS and gene-expression. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers include, but are 
not limited, to the following:  ctDNA and plasma protein biomarkers 
• Blood for NGS (if approved by local regulatory authorities) 
• Blood for pharmacogenomics (if approved by local regulatory authorities) 
• PK assessment  
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 69 Plasma samples will be collected to measure letrozole and GDC-0032 
concentrations (see Appendix 2) .  Any remaining samples collected for PK and 
biomarker assays may b e used for e
xploratory biomarker profiling, metabolite 
profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes as 
appropriate. 
 
4.5.11 Assay Methods  
4.5.11.1 Mutational Analysis for PIK3CA  
The PIK3CA mutation assay will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Somatic mutations in the PIK3CA  gene are found in approximately 35%  − 40% of 
ER-positive breast cancers and occur most commonly in Exons 9 and 20 in the codons 
encoding amino acids E542, E545, and H1047 (Saal et al. 2005 [52]).  Real-time polymerase chain reacti on (RT-PCR) assays tha 
t amplify exons that are commonly 
mutated in PIK3CA  offer a sensitive and quantitative method to detect mutations from a 
tumor specimen.  DNA will be extracted from tumor samples and subjected to allele-specific PCR assays that detect the WT allele, as well as to assays for nucleotide substitutions that include, but are not limited to, the following amino acid changes:  R88Q, N345K, C420R, E542K, E545K/A/G /D, E546K/E/R/L, M1043I, H1047R/L/Y, 
H1049R.  Following histopathological review, samples with 
 < 10% tumor content may 
not be evaluable for the PIK3CA  assay. Samples will be run on cobas z480 analyzer, 
and PIK3CA  mutation status (mutant or WT) will be made using appropriate cutoffs and 
automated software.   
A designation of PIK3CA  status unknown will be assigned to a sample wherein any one 
of the predefined mutations was not conclusively assessed. 
4.5.11.2 Pharmacodynamic Biomar ker Assays in Tumor Tissues 
Ki67 antigen is an important cell cycle-related nuclear protein that is expressed by 
proliferating cells in all phases of the active cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M phase).  As such, it is a useful marker of the proliferative state of a tumor.  Ki67 protein levels will be determined by IHC through the use of standard techniques.   
PI3K pathway, and other pro-survival, biomarkers will be tested in the fresh tumor 
biopsies by IHC, including, but not limited to, phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-4EBP1, and phospho-ERK.  If tissue quantity permits, change in expression of pathway biomarkers will be measured by t he RPPA using OCT fixed tissue.  The basis 
of the technology is to immobilize small amount s of lysate from a tumor biopsy sample in 
serial dilution on a microarray slide.  Multiple samples are thus arrayed on a slide and can be probed with antibodies that detect a particular phospho-epitope.  Using this technology, we will profile approximately 80 key signaling nodes representing a number of pathways known to be dysregulated in cancer, including receptors in the HER family, multiple components of PI3K/mTor signaling, as well as key members of the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 70 4.5.11.3 Analysis of Phosphatase Tensin Homolog Expression 
PTEN status will be examined by IHC using a protocol that has been validated for 
specificity using several available cell line controls at a central laboratory.  Tumor specimen will be scored only if appropriate staining is observed in internal control stromal or normal (non-tumor) tissue elements.  
4.5.11.4 Confirmation of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, 
and HER2 Status 
ER, PR, and HER2 status will be determined at a central laboratory according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. 
4.5.11.5 Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis 
ctDNA will be extracted from plasma samples collected from patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations using appropriate technologies.  The prevalence of 
the mutations measured at baseline and post-treatment may provide information on response or resistance to therapy. 
4.5.11.6 Messenger RNA Expression Profiling 
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression will be performed using gene expression assays conducted on the NanoString platform or equivalent.  Analysis may include, but is not limited to, a panel of genes important for intrinsic subtyping, breast cancer biology and PI3K signaling.  The goal will be to generate a database of expression status to examine whether there are gene expression patterns that are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
4.5.11.7 Next Generation Sequencing 
In cases where there is sufficient material to isolate DNA, NGS will be performed using NGS platforms, such as Illumina or equivalent. The goal will be to deter mine whether the 
percentage of genetic mutations are associated with clinical response to GDC-0032. 
4.5.11.8 Copy Number Analysis  
The level of copy number alterations in cancer-related genes may be determined using DNA-based technologies, either cytogenetically using chromosomal in situ hybridization (ISH), using next-generation sequencing platforms or by RT-PCR-based or equivalent technologies.  For cytogenetic assays, detection may be either fluorescence-based (fluorescence in situ hybridization assay) or chromogenic-based (chromogenic in situ hybridization).  Increased copy number of PI3K pathways activating genes may provide information on response or resistance to therapy.  
4.5.11.9 Plasma Biomarker Analyses 
Assays to assess the expression of soluble,  systemic cytokines, and chemokines from 
the plasma of patients will be carried out using appropriate methodologies, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based or mass spectrometry-based or equivalent technologies.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 71 4.5.11.10 Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Plasma GDC-0032 and letrozole samples will be analyzed using a validated liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
After the plasma samples are analyzed, any remaining samples may be used for 
exploratory metabolite profiling and identification, ex vivo protein binding, and PK, or pharmacodynamic assay development purposes. 
4.5.11.11 Pharmacogeneti c Polymorphism Assay 
If approved by the local regulatory authority, gene mutations will be assayed using multiplex PCR, allele-specific PCR, direct sequencing, or other acceptable methods.  Results may be correlated to population PK parameters or other clinical measures in order to better understand the impact of genetic variants on drug metabolism, exposure, adverse events, and/or response.   
A sample will also be utilized as a source of normal DNA to determine whether sequence 
variants in the PIK3CA gene and in other relevant oncogenes in the tumor DNA are somatic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
4.5.11.12 Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at each specified timepoint (see the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1).  
4.5.12 Patient-Reported Outcomes   
PRO data will be elicited from the patients in this study to more fully characterize the clinical profile of GDC-0032.  The PRO questionnaires, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient.  To ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, PRO questionnaires should be self-administered at the investigational site prior to the completion of other study assessments and the administration of study treatment.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and the Modified Breast Cancer module QLQ-BR23 
questionnaires will be used to assess HRQoL, including side-effects of systemic therapy (e.g., sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing, diarrhea, skin problems) and patient functioning during the neoadjuvant period (refer to schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 1 for a detailed description of timepoints) and post-surgery follow-up.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used HRQoL measure in oncology trials with excellent 
psychometric properties demonstrating both relia bility and validity. The measure consists 
of “five functional sca
les (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom 
scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale” with a recall period of “the past week” (Aaronson et al. 1993 [ 1]). Scale scores can 
be obtained for each of the multi-item scales, global health status/QoL 
scale, and six 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 72 single items by using a liner transformation for standardization of the calculated raw 
score.   
The EORTC QLQ-BR23 breast cancer module was first validated for use in 1995, uses a 
recall period of “the past week,” and is intended for use across multiple treatment modalities (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatment).  As this trial will include patients in the neo-adjuvant setting, the last seven items of the original BR23 questionnaire, items numbered 47
 − 53 that deal with symptoms and side effects 
not relevant to the population under study, will be removed.  These seven items addressed symptoms experienced by metastatic breast cancer patients and those undergoing radiation.  Therefore, in consultation with the EORTC, these items were deleted, as the validity of the measure would not be compromised by their removal.  In addition, as “oral mucositis” and “skin problem s” are key symptoms of this therapy not 
assessed by currently available tools, validated items from the EORTC item bank were added to assess the presence and bothersomeness of oral mucositis (2 items:  sore mouth/tongue, difficulty swallowing) and skin problems (2 items).  Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  Scale scores can be obtained for each of the multi-item and single-item scales by using a linear transformation for standardization of the calculated raw score. 
The PRO instruments, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by 
the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient.  Patients must 
complete these instruments in the clinic (cannot be taken home) prior to any healthcare provider interactions (i.e., prior to administration of study drug and prior to any other study assessment) to ensure that the validity of the instruments are not compromised and to ensure that data quality meet regulatory requirements. 
Refer to Appendix 4 for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified QLQ-BR23. 
4.5.13 Samples for Clinical Repository  
All residual samples (or leftover biologic samples after protocol-defined studies are 
completed) obtained during the study (FFPE, fresh-frozen, plasma, etc.) will be stored in an academic central repository.  The specim ens in the study repository will be made 
available for future biomarker research towards further understanding of treatment with GDC-0032, of breast cancer, related diseases, and adverse events, and for the development of potential, associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation of study repository specimens is governed by the Study Steering Committee, with guidance from a dedicated Translational Research Committee to ensure the appropriate use of the study specimens. 
All biomarker specimens will be retained for new  research related to this study and/or 
disease in accordance with the recommendations and approval of the Study Steering 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 73 Committee.  Samples will be only destroyed if required by local laws relating to the 
collection, storage, and destruction of biological specimens. 
Specimens will be stored up to 15 years or unt il they are exhausted.  The storage period 
will be in accordance with the institutional review board/ethics committee 
(IRB/EC)-approved ICF and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as describ
ed below.   
4.5.13.1 Confidentiality 
Patient medical information associated with biologic specimens is confidential and may only be disclosed to third parties as permitted by the ICF (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by law. 
Data derived from biologic specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The 
aggregate results of any research conducted using biologic specimens will be available in accordance with the effective Translational Reseach Committee policy on study data publication. 
4.6 PATIENT, TREATMENT, STUD Y, AND SITE DISCONTINUATION 
4.6.1 Patient Discontinuation   
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study 
• Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient 
• Patient non-compliance 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain inform ation on patients who withdraw from the 
study.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
4.6.2 Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients must discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following: 
• Pregnancy 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 74 • Disease progression 
• Unacceptable toxicity 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced. 
4.6.3 Conditions for Terminating the Study  
Both the Sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate their participation in the study under the circumstances agreed upon in the site agreement.  Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual basis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, the Sponsor and investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interest. 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
GDC-0032 is not approved and is currently in early clinical development.  Thus, the entire safety profile is not known at this ti me.  Human experience is currently limited.  
The following information is based on results from ongoing clinical studies .  The safety 
plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below.  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and 
non-serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities (see Section 5.3.5.3), defined 
and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  General safety assessments will includ
e 
serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistry and blood counts.  All serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest will be reported in an expedited fashion, via fax to Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) safety department and also captured in the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  In addition, the Sponsor and the investigators will review and evaluate obser ved adverse events on a regular basis. 
All adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until the end of study visit, whichever occurs later.  Patients who have an ongoing study treatment-related adverse event upon study completion or at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be attributed by the investigator to study drug or to another 
clearly identified etiology by the investigator (see Table 10).  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 75 Specific potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to 
avoid, minimize, and manage such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 
See Section 5 (Assessment of Safety) for complete details of the safety evaluation for 
this study.  
5.1.1 Management of Specifi c Adverse Events of GDC-0032  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.  
Additional guidelines are provided in the subsec
tions below.  
Due to the approximately 40-hour half-life for GDC-0032, investigators should consider holding GDC-0032 for certain Grade 2 toxicities until the adverse event resolves to Grade ≤  1 as discussed below (e.g., stomatitis/mucositis, colitis, rash, diarrhea, 
pneumonitis).  Certain toxicities can occur within 1 −2 weeks of holding or discontinuing 
GDC-0032 drug (e.g., pneumonitis, colitis, rash).  In these cases, the adverse event eventually resolves.  Investigators should follow management guidelines and dose 
modifications for toxicities as described below, including administration of topical or systemic corticosteroids as appropriate.   
Table 1 Overall Dose Modification Guideline for GDC  − 0032-Related 
Adverse Events 
 GDC-0032 
Starting dose 6 mg at 5 days on / 2 days off 
First reduction 3 mg at 5 days on / 2 days off  
Second reduction  3 mg at 3 days on / 4 days off a 
 a If the patient continues to experience specified drug-related adverse 
events after the second dose redu ction, the treatment should be 
discontinued.  
5.1.1.1 Management of Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients who received GDC-0032 in the single-
agent Phase I study.   
Patients with diabetes requiring daily anti-hyperglycemic medication or who have a 
fasting blood glucose level > 125 mg/dL will be excluded from the study.  HbA 1c and 
fasting glucose levels will be monitored at baseline, and additional monitoring of fasting glucose levels during the study will be implemented, as outlined in the schedule of assessments.  Patients should be instructed to report symptoms associated with hyperglycemia such as thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision. 
Metformin is the first antihyperglycemic medica tion of choice because of the lower risk of 
hypoglycemia with this agent.  Because metformin in some patients may also cause 
diarrhea and not be well tolerated, other antihyperglycemic medications such as sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride, glipizide) can be used.  Extra caution should be used

etc.).   
5.1.1.4 Management of G astrointestinal Toxicity 
5.1.1.4.1 Management of Diarrhea 
Patients should be closely monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, and changes in stool, including checking for blood in stool if clinically indicated).  Patients should be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild.  Gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed per protocol guidelines and institut ional standard of care.  For example, 
prompt management of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications should be implemented.  Because of the approximately 40-hour half-life of GDC-0032, investigators should hold GDC-0032 for Grade ≥  2 diarrhea until it improves to Grade ≤  1.   
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for diarrhea are provided in 
Table 5.

Grade of Diarrhea Dose Modification and Management Guidelines  
Grade 1 • Manage per institutional standa rd of care that includes 
antidiarrheals. a 
Grade 2 • Hold GDC-0032 and manage per institutional standard of care 
until Grade  ≤ 1.  These include antidiarrheals. a 
• For persistent Grade 2 non-infec tious diarrhea despite treatment 
with antidiarrheals, additional coadm inistration of corticosteroids 
(e.g., budesonide 9 mg PO QD) are recommended. b  Non-
infectious diarrhea can be diagnosed by stool culture. 
• For persistent Grade 2 diarrhea lasting longer than 1 week with 
an adequate trial of anti-diarrheal medications, or for recurrent 
Grade 2 diarrhea, restarting at the next lower dose level should 
be strongly considered after diarrhea improves to Grade  ≤  1.  
• If Grade 2 diarrhea is persistent despite treatment with SOC, 
consider work-up for colitis (e.g., performing abdominal/pelvis CT and/or endoscopy, and stool culture as appropriate).   
Grade 3 or 4 • Hold GDC-0032 and manage per institutional standard of care 
until Grade  ≤ 1. These include antidiarrheals. a   
• Consider work-up for colitis (e.g., performing abdominal/pelvis 
CT and/or endoscopy, and stool culture as appropriate). 
• Restart GDC-0032 at the next lower dose level upon resolution 
to Grade  ≤ 1. 
• For persistent Grade 3  − 4 non-infectious diarrhea despite 
treatment with antidiarrheals, administration of systemic corticosteroids should be considered. 
b 
• For Grade 3 diarrhea, may consider restarting at the same dose 
if event occurred because of  lack of optimal medical 
management with antidiarrheal medications, after discussion with and approval by the medical monitor.   
• For Grade 4 diarrhea, consider permanent discontinuation of 
GDC-0032. 
CT  = computed tomography; PO  = oral; QD  = once daily; SOC  = standard of care. 
a Suggested antidiarrheals include the followin g: loperamide (initial: 4 mg, followed by

GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 80 5.1.1.4.2 Management of Colitis 
Data as of October 2013 show an incidence rate for colitis of 6.2% (10/160) (1 at 16 mg; 
8 at 9 mg; 1 at 6 mg  + fulvestrant) with onset at approximately 100 days or longer after 
initiation of treatment with daily GDC-0032 dosing.  Some patients have developed Grade 2 or Grade 3 diarrhea, which is non-responsive to anti-diarrheal medication.  In some of these patients, a CT scan or colonoscopy has revealed colitis, which has resolved upon treatment with systemic corticosteroids. 
For persistent Grade 2 diarrhea that does not resolve or for Grade ≥  3 diarrhea, further 
evaluation should include colitis in the differential diagnosis with the appropriate work-up 
(e.g., abdominal/ pelvis CT scan, endoscopy with biopsy, stool cultures for cytomegalovirus, Clostridium difficile, and parasites).  Grade ≥ 2 colitis should be 
managed by interruption of study treatment.  In addition, discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or any other medications known to exacerbate colitis symptoms should be considered.  If noninfectious colitis is suspected, treatment with corticosteroids per institutional standard of care should be considered.  It is suggested that prednisone (for oral administration) or solumedrol (for IV administration) are the corticosteroids of choice in the treatment of colitis.  For severe symptoms, prednisone 60 mg or equivalent may be required to control initial symptoms, and the dose should  be 
gradually tapered.  Lower doses of prednisone, oral budesonide, or mesalamine (or other 5-aminosalicyclic acid derivatives)  may be considered for less severe cases of 
colitis. 
Specific dose modification and management guidelines for colitis are provided in Table 6.

5.1.3 General Guidance for Dose Modifications and Delays for 
Letrozole  
The letrozole dose level cannot be modified.  In general, the investigator can consider 
continuing letrozole if it is not thought to be letrozole-related.   
All dose modifications should be based on the adverse event requiring the greatest 
modification and should be properly documented in the source documents. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 83 5.1.4 Management of Increases in QT Interval   
Study drug should be discontinued in patients who develop any of the following, unless 
there is a clear alternative cause for the changes: 
1. Sustained (at least two ECG measurements  > 30 minutes apart) QTcF that 
is  > 500 msec and  > 60 msec longer than the baseline value 
2. Sustained absolute QTcF that is  > 515 msec  
3. An episode of torsades de pointes or a new ECG finding of clinical concern 
 
Of note, if there is a new intraventricular conduction block, the increase in QRS complex 
duration should be subtracted from the QTcF change, as this represents an increase in QTcF unrelated to alterations in repolarization.  Also of note, it is not uncommon to record arrhythmias such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, pauses, or atrial fibrillation in healthy volunteers receiving placebo during 
periods of extended ECG monitoring.  Therefore, it is critical that expert electrophysiologic advice be sought to conf irm any ECG changes and to ascertain the 
likelihood of a drug-induced arrhythmia versus the background occurrence of this arrhythmia.  In such a situation, saving all available ECG data is highly suggested. 
Management of patients with sustained QTcF prolongation should include close 
monitoring, with ECGs repeated at least hourly until two successive ECGs show resolution of the findings, correction of any electrolyte abnormalities, and possible discontinuation of other concomitant medications that are known to prolong the QT interval.  Consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is recommended, to help in the management of such patients. 
In rare circumstances, it may be acceptable to resume study drug, at a lower dose, 
provided that any ECG abnormalities have resolved and the patient is appropriately monitored.  Clinical judgment should be applied. 
5.1.5 Safety Monitoring for Letrozole  
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal AI indicated for first line treatment of hormone receptor positive, locally advanced, or metastatic  breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  
Letrozole is also indicated for adjuvant treatment in postmenopausal hormone-receptor positive patients and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following anti-estrogen therapy. 
The most frequently reported adverse events in a first line, breast cancer clinical trial 
with letrozole were bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, arthralgia, and dyspnea.  Clinically significant adverse events also include bone effects (osteoporosis and bone fractures) and hypercholesterolemia.  Discontinuations for adverse events other than progression of tumor occurred in 2% of patients on letrozole.  Refer to the U.S. letrozole Package Insert or SmPC for additional information.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 84 There are no expected significant overlapping toxicities between letrozole and 
GDC-0032. Routine safety monitoring and periodic laboratory tests for the letrozole and GDC-0032 combination will occur throughout the study. 
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS 
Safety assessments will consist of monito ring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest; measurement of protocol-specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
5.2.1 Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical  investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.9  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition ( e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
•
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 85 5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to ABCSG)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10) 
• Results in persistent or signifi
cant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se vere headache without any further findings). 
Severity and
 seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to ABCSG safety 
department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.3 Non-Serious Adverse Events of  Special Interest (Immediately 
Reportable to ABCSG)   
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by the 
investigator to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of 
special interest for this study include 
 the following: 
• Grade 4 hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  3 symptomatic hyperglycemia 
• Grade  ≥  2 colitis or enterocolitis  
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
• Grade  ≥  3 rash 
• Grade  ≥  2 pneumonitis  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 86 • Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s 
law (see Section 5.3.5.5) 
• Suspected tr ansmission
 of an infectious agent by the study drug   
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and additionally reported to ABCSG 
safety department in case they fulfill t
he criteria for expedited reported in accordance 
with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4 − Section 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on  the Adverse Event CRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriou
sness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3), and causality (se e 
Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study 
drug, will be reported until 30 days  after the last dose of study drug or until the end of 
study visit, whichever occurs later.  After this period, investigators should report any deaths, serious adverse events, or other adv erse events of concern deemed related to 
prior study drug treatment or study procedures ( Section 5.6). 
5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 9 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif ica
lly listed in the NCI CTCAE.

Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v 4.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b Examples of self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dr essing and undressing, 
feeding one's self, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who 
are not bedridden. 
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medi cal event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions),  per the definition of seriou s 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instruction
s), per the definiti on of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 10): 
• Temporal relationship of  event onset to the initiat
ion of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 88 Table 10 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO Adverse events will be consid ered related, unless they fulf ill the criteria as specified 
below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by one adverse event 
report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 89 5.3.5.1 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
5.3.5.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  The progression (increase and decrease) of an adverse event must be documented in the Adverse Event eCRF.   
The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated 
to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens. If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.3.5.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 90 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 times the ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
5.3.5.4 Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens or improves. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 91 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  
Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the 
following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) 
and reported to ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learnin g of the event), either as se
rious adverse event or a non-serious adverse 
event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 
5.3.5.6 Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to ABCSG safety department (see Section  5.4.2 
). This includes death attributed to progression of breast cancer. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condit i
on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term “sudden death” should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be replaced by the established cause of death. 
5.3.5.7 Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions CRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 92 5.3.5.8 Hospitalization or  Prolonged Hospitalization 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalizat ion (i.e., in-patient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2), except as outlined 
below.   
The following hospitalization scenar ios are not  considered to be adverse events: 
• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study 
• Hospitalization for respite care 
• Planned hospitalization required by the protocol for breast cancer surgery  
• Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
• The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during 
the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the 
expected normal progression of the disease 
• The patient has not suffered an adverse event 
• Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer 
 
• Hospitalization for outpatient care outside of normal clinic operating hours that is 
required per protocol or per local standard of care 
• Hospitalization for protocol mandated biopsies 
 
5.3.5.9 Adverse Events Asso ciated with an Overdose 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
5.3.5.10 Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any patient responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO questionnaires, site staff will alert the investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an adverse event have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the patient's medical record per site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an adverse event, it will be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 93 5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO ABCSG 
Certain events require immediate reporting to  allow ABCSG safety department to take 
appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator 
must report such events to ABCSG safety department immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to ABCSG safety department within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events 
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest 
• Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report new significant follow-up information for these events to 
ABCSG safety department immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results • Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery 
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 94 5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, 
investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fax. In addition the serious adverse event and non-serious adverse event of special interest informat ion will be captured in the EDC system.   
Worldwide Sites: ABCSG safety department  
Fax No.: +43 1 409 09 90 
Relevant follow-up information should be s ubmitted to ABCSG safety department as 
soon as it becomes available and/or upon request. 
5.5 FOLLOW-UP OF PATIEN TS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.5.1 Investigator Follow-Up  
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. 
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilit ate source data 
verification (SDV).  For follow-up reports of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest, investigators should record all follow up information immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) on the paper Serious Adverse Event reporting form and transmit to ABCSG safety department via fa x. In addition the serious adverse event 
and non-serious adverse event of special interest follow-up information will be captured in the EDC system. If, after follow-up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and paper Serious Adverse Event form, if applicable.   
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome, 
and they should be reported according to the instructions provided in Section 5.4. 
5.5.2 Sponsor Follow-Up  
For serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the Sponsor and/or ABCSG safety department or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 95 5.6 POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
At the time of study completion or study discontinuation, the investigator should instruct 
each patient to report to the investigator any subsequent adverse events that the patient’s personal physician believes could be related to prior study drug treatment or study procedures.   
The investigator should report these events directly to Genentech Safety Risk 
Management via telephone at 1-888-835-2555. 
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all seri ous adverse events and non-serious adverse 
events of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events us ing the following reference documents: 
• GDC-0032 Investigator's Brochure   
• Local prescribing information for letrozole SmPC 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. 
An IDMC will monitor the incidence of t he above-listed anticipated events during the 
study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the 
test product will be submitted to health authorities. 
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN   
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization. Final analysis will be performed after last patient, last visit (LPLV) and subsequent data cleaning, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated by randomization. 
Safety analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization and 
received at least one dose of study treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 96 6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
This study is designed for testing the effect of GDC-0032 on the two co-primary 
endpoints in all enrolled patients and in the PIK3CA  MT patients and plans to enroll 330 
patients in total. Assuming the PIK3CA  mutation status will not be available (unknown) 
for approximately 10% of the patients and the prevalence of PIK3CA  mutant is 40%, 
there will be approximately 120 patients in the PIK3CA MT cohort. 
Given that the PIK3CA  mutation status is not a stratification factor for randomization, 
there might be a possible imbalance between treatment arms within the PIK3CA  MT 
cohort, which may reduce the statistical power in this cohort. To ensure the study provides sufficient statistical power even when the treatment assignment is imbalanced, 
the sample size was calculated based on a conservative scenario by assuming that the treatment assignment imbalance in PIK3CA  MT is 40% vs. 60%. The sample size was 
calculated based on a chi²-test using continuity correction (Ury and Fleiss 1980 [ 63]). 
To control an overall, two-sided, family-wise error rate under 20%, we use a two-side d 
significance 
level of 16% and 4% for the co-primary endpoints MRI ORR, and pCR, 
respectively. 
Assuming 10% of the patients are unevaluable for the MRI ORR, approximately 300 
enrolled patients and 108 patients in the PIK3CA  MT cohort will be evaluable for 
analyses. This sample size allows us to detect an absolute percentage increase of 24% in MRI ORR rate in the GDC-0032 plus letr ozole arm (64%) versus the letrozole-only 
arm (40%; Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]; Ellis and Ma 2007 [ 21]) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at 
80% power and 16% two-sided significance level.  The minimal detectable difference for 
ORR is approximately 1
5%. 
Assuming that all patients are evaluable for pCR (i.e., approximately 330 enrolled patients and 120 in the PIK3CA  MT cohort), this sample size provides 80% power to 
detect an absolute percentage increase of 18% in pCR in the GDC-0032 plus letrozole arm (19%) versus the letrozole-only arm (1%, Smith et al. 2005 [ 59]; Ellis and Ma 2007 
[21]) in the PIK3CA  MT cohort at the  4% two-sided significan
 ce level.  The minimal 
detectable difference for pCR rate is approximately 13%. 
If the prevalence of the PIK3CA  mutation is lower than assumed, if there is more 
substantial treatment assignment imbalance in the PIK3CA MT cohort than assumed, or 
there is an increased number of unevaluable patients for the MRI ORR, the sample size may be increased to obtain the level of power at 80%, and the enrollment may be limited to patients with PIK3CA  MT.   
6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY 
Enrollment, study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be summarized overall and by treatment arm. The incidence of study treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression will be tabulated. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 97 6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPARABILITY 
Demographic variables, stratification factors, and other baseline characteristics will be 
summarized by treatment arm. 
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include the ITT population; that is, all randomized patients will be included in the analyses, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are (1) tumor ORR, assessed by modified RECIST criteria by breast MRI and (2) the rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug. 
The tumor ORR will be calculated by treatment arm in all enrolled population and in 
PIK3CA MT population . Within each population, the ORR for the two treatment arms will 
be compared at a two-sided alpha of 16% using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status. The pCR rate will also be calculated and compared at a two-sided alpha of 4% based on the same analytical approach as ORR. The two alpha values account for a family-wise type I error rate of 20%. Patients with early study termination and hence missing efficacy outcome will be considered as non-responders. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Tumor ORR after completion of study treatment, assessed by modified RECIST 
criteria by breast MRI in PIK3CA  WT patients. 
• Rate of pCR in breast and axilla (total pCR) after completion of study drug in 
PIK3CA  WT patients.  
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be analyzed 
analogue to the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed in all enrolled patients and 
separated by PIK3CA  mutation status: 
• ORR by clinical breast examination, mammography, and breast ultrasound 
• Ki67 values at baseline, Week 3, and surgery (centrally assessed) • Change in Ki67 from baseline to Week 3; baseline to surgery, and Week 3 to 
surgery (centrally assessed) 
• PEPI score (centrally assessed) 
• Change in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as measured by breast 
MRI 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 98 • Evaluation of different definitions of pCR including the following:  a) ypT0, ypN0, and 
b) ypT0/is, ypNX (breast pCR) 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by treatment arm and will be compared 
between the two treatment arms within each population based on appropriate statistical analyses:  ORR will be compared using a Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by tumor size and nodal status; PEPI, Ki67, and tumor volume change will be compared by regression analyses, adjusted for tumor size and nodal status. All secondary endpoints will be tested at a two-sided type I error of 5%. 
More details of the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES 
Safety analyses will include all patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment, with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen actually received.  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory 
test results, changes in vital signs, and letrozole and GDC-0032 exposure. 
Verbatim descriptions of adverse events will be mapped to thesaurus terms.  Adverse 
event data will be listed by study site, tr eatment arm, patient number, and study day, 
severity, relationship to study drug, outcome, and action taken with the study treatments.  Events occurring on or after treatment on Day 1 of Week 1 will be summarized by thesaurus term, appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade.  Serious adverse events, including deaths, will be listed separately and will be summarized.  
Relevant laboratory and vital sign (heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) data will 
be displayed by time, with NCI CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 and 4 values identified, where appropriate.  Additionally, all laboratory data will be summarized in tables by NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade. 
6.6 PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSES   
Ki67 biomarker analyses will include patients with at least one predose and one postdose biomarker assessment, with patients grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
6.7 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES   
Individual C max and trough plasma concentrations (C min) of GDC-0032 and letrozole from 
all patients enrolled will be reported. Mean of trough plasma concentrations of GDC-0032 and letrozole will be tabulated. The population pharmacokinetics of letrozole and GDC-0032 in this study will be compared with historical single-agent pharmacokinetics to assess the potential DDI between GDC-0032 and letrozole in this population.   
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 99 Additional PK analyses on metabolites of GDC-0032, letrozole, and/or other concomitant 
medications may be conducted as appropriate. 
6.8 PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME ANALYSES  
Patient-reported outcomes of breast cancer symptoms, patient functioning, and HRQoL will be assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the modified Breast Cancer module 
(QLQ-BR23)  
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median and range) of linear transformed scores will be reported for all the items and subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, and the modified QLQ-BR23 according to the EORTC scoring manual guidelines for each assessment time point. The mean change of the linear transformed scores from baseline (and 95% CI using the normal approximation) will also be assessed. Line charts depicting the mean changes (and standard errors) of items and subscales over time will be provided for each treatment arm from the baseline assessment. 
Data analysis will be performed on the final modified BR23 data set in parallel with the 
final data analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the modified instrument and will be reported along with the clinical trial results.  
Completion and compliance rates will be summarized at each timepoint by treatment 
arm with reasons for missing data. Only patients with a baseline assessment and at least one post-treatment assessment will be included in the analyses. The number and proportion of patients who improved, worsened, or remained stable for all of the symptom and functional domains, global QoL, and single items of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 will be summarized. 
6.9 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES   
Additional details on analyses will be specified in the SAP. 
6.10 INTERIM ANALYSES   
The IDMC will conduct interim analyses to review the unblinded safety data after the first 20 patients have either 1) finished the 30-day, follow-up visit after the surgery, or 2) been on study for 20 weeks after the randomization date (for those who do not receive the 
surgery).  All available information of all enr olled patients with all available assessments 
at the respective timepoint will be included in the interim analyses.  In addition, the IDMC or the Medical Monitor may request additional ad hoc meetings of the IDMC at any time during the study to review safety data. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 100 7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ABCSG will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking 
of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, ABCSG and/or all involved clinical research associat es (CRAs) will request data clarification from 
the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
ABCSG will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including review of the ABCSG’s data management plan and corresponding specifications.  Data will be transferred electronically from ABCSG to the Sponsor at the end of the study and whenever otherwise contractually agreed, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at ABCSG and  records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the ABCSG’s standard procedures. 
Data from paper PRO questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by site staff. 
Original PRO questionnaires will be kept in the patient’s medical record as source documentation. 
7.2 DATA(BASE) MANAGEMENT 
ABCSG Clinical Data Management will check all e-forms for plausibility and consistency by automatic edit checks and manual data review according to study-specific data management plan (DMP).  If necessary, web-based data queries (data clarification requests [DCRs]) will be generated and subsequently visible for the investigators, dedicated site staff, responsible CRAs, and responsible ABCSG staff.  For those eCRFs which pass all verification procedures and are regarded as correct and complete, they will be frozen subsequently by ABCSG clinical data management. Consequently, no further data entries or changes on frozen eCRFs are possible. The status of frozen eCRFs is flagged by the specific icon. 
Clinical Data Management ensures that the database is corrected for the following eCRF 
issues without immediate notification to site staff (self-evident corrections). Notification of site staff is provided via a specific report after final data cleaning procedures and before final data confirmation by the investigator or a designee: 
• misspellings/typing errors that do not change the meaning of the word 
• location of data recorded at an incorrect variable field or eForm (e.g., moving lab 
data from general comments to the appropriate lab table) 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 101 • standard time to 24-hour clock 
• correction of date format, if required (dd/mm/yyyy) 
• if equivalent units of terms are recorded instead of the acceptable ABCSG standard 
• data changes due to plausibility checks and eCRF content (e.g., combination of 
several variables and/or eCRFs) 
All data management workflows are described in detail in the relevant SOPs and 
working instructions of ABCSG. 
7.3 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed using the Clinical Data Management System “MACRO,” a web-interface DATAPORT.  Sites will receiv e training by the responsible CRAs and have 
access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion (web data entry).   
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff in a timely manner, 
usually within 2 weeks after the patient visit.  Electronic CRFs should be reviewed and respective data confirmation eCRF should be electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee at the end of the study.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a storage medium (compact disc [CD], digital video disk [DVD] etc.) 
that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the storage medium is required. 
7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors (CRAs) will perform ongoing SDV to confirm that criti cal protocol data 
(i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 102 Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigators a nd institut
ions must provide the Sponsor/CRAs 
direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The investigational site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change. 
7.6 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, PRO data (if applicable), ICFs, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer. After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor. Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location. 
8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
This study will be conducted in full conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for GCP and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. The study will comply with the requirements of the ICH E2A guideline (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). Studies conducted in the United States or under a U.S. Investigational New Drug (IND) application will comply with U.S. FDA regulations and applicable local, state, and federal laws.  Studies conducted in the European Union/European Economic Area will comply with the E.U. Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC). 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 103 8.2 INFORMED CONSENT 
The Sponsor’s sample ICF (and ancillary sample ICFs) will be provided to each site.  If 
applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample ICFs or any alternate cons ent forms proposed by the site (collectively, 
the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC submission.  The final IRB/EC-approved consent forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements. 
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory 
samples for optional exploratory research.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives of the exploratory research. Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research. Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature. 
The ICFs must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative before participation in the study. The case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. 
The eCRF contains a section to document whether the patient has signed the ICF or not. 
The ICFs should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures or when 
new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate. The final revised IRB/EC-approved consent forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes. 
Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of the consent forms (or to a 
significant new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study. For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised consent forms for continued participation in the study. 
For patients not qualified or incapable of giving legal consent, written consent must be 
obtained from the legally acceptable representat ive. In the case where both the patient 
and his/her legally acceptable representativ e are unable to read, an impartial witness 
should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. After the patient and representative have orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature on the form will attest that the information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood. The investigator or designee must also explain that the patients are 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 104 completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any 
reason. 
A copy of each signed ICF must be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative. All signed and dated ICFs must remain in each patient’s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
For sites in the United States, each ICF may also include patient authorization to allow 
use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). If the site utilizes a separate authorization form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies. 
8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR ETHICS COMMITTEE 
This protocol, the ICFs, any information to be given to the patient, and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the sponsor, the affiliated groups, or contract research organizations (CROs) according to the applicable local laws and regulations, if applicable by the Principal Investigator, and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.  
The Sponsor, affiliated groups, or CROs are responsible for providing written summaries 
of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with 
the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the local IRB/EC. The Sponsor, affiliated groups, or CROs are also  responsible for promptly informing the 
IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see Section 9.6). 
In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse eve
nts to the Sponsor, 
investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with local health authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and archived in the site’s study file.  
8.4 DATA PRIVACY 
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the study through assignment of a unique identif ication number. This means that patient 
names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location. 
Patient medical information obtained by th is study is confidential and may only be 
disclosed to third parties as permitted by the ICF (or separate authorization for use and 
 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 105 disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or 
required by local law. 
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare, for treatment purposes, provided the patient has given consent. 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of the U.S. FDA and other national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate. The patient will have to consent to such access by signing the informed consent form. 
8.5 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study (i.e., LPLV). 
9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, MONITORING, AND 
ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented, including but  not limited to the protocol, protocol 
amendments, ICFs, and documentation of IRB/ EC and governmental (health authorities) 
approval. In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive the patient data, which includes an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data. 
9.2 ON SITE QUALITY CONTROL (MONITORING) 
During the study, CRAs will visit their respective sites on a regular basis as outlined in the study specific monitoring plan (MP) and all other relevant specifications, in order to guarantee adherence to the protocol and to the principles of GCP and to check for the progress of enrolment, adequate storage conditions of IMP and adequate drug dispensing and accounting records.  
CRAs will review documented data in the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy 
according to the study-specific MP, subsequently flag all reviewed pages with a specific mark (“SDV done”) within the EDC system “MACRO,” web-interface DATAPORT, developed by .  The CRAs will raise data queries (“DCRs”) in cases of 
missing source data or incorrect data entries. Immediately after electronic issue of the queries, they become visible to the investigator, the clinical data managers, and the ABCSG clinical safety officers (“raised  DCRs”).  CRAs and/or clinical data managers 

 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 106 and/or ABCSG clinical safety officers will follow up with trial site personnel until final data 
query resolution. 
9.3 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
The investigator should document and expl ain any deviations from the approved 
protocol. The investigator should promptly  report any deviations that might impact 
patient safety and data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC policies and procedures. 
9.4 SITE INSPECTIONS 
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for inspection of study data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will permit international and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 
9.5 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE 
This trial will be sponsored by Genentech and will be managed by Genentech in 
collaboration with the Breast International Group (BIG), ABCSG, and  the Spanish Breast 
Cancer Research Group (SOLTI). Genentech in collaboration with BIG, ABCSG, and 
SOLTI will provide clinical operatio ns management, data management, and medical 
monitoring.  Approximately 110 U.S. and international sites will participate to enroll approximately 330 patients. 
An IDMC will be in place throughout the study  and will provide oversight of safety and 
efficacy analyses (see Section 3.1.2). 
After written informed consent has been obtained, the study site will obtai n the patien
t’s 
screening number from the IxRS system. Once eligibility has been established, the 
patient will be enrolled, and the study site will obtain the patient’s identification number from the IxRS. Once results of the tissue analysis are made available, the patient will be randomized, and the site will obtain the bli nded treatment assignment from the IxRS.  
The IxRS will manage GDC-0032/placebo drug inventory at all sites and letrozole drug inventory at all study sites outside the United States.  IxRS will be required to randomize patients, to monitor enrollment and patient status, and to manage study treatment requests and shipments.  
Patient data will be recorded via an electronic data capture (EDC) system from  
( , United Kingdom), which will be managed by ABCSG using eCRFs (see Section 7.2).   
Central laboratories, including Genentech and Genentech collaborators, will be used for 
PIK3CA  
mutation detection, Ki67, and PTEN status and/or will provide kits for PK, 
pharmacogenomic, tissue, whole blood, and plasma sample analyses to be conducted at central laboratories, Genentech, or Genentech collaborators. 

 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 107 An independent radiologic review facility will be used for the purpose of collecting and 
assessing the quality of patient scans throughout the trial. The review facility will retain 
copies of scans for centralized assessments of MRI-related endpoints .   
9.6 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
Any protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor.  Protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. 
Approval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authorities (as locally 
required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients or changes that involve logistical or administrative aspects only (e.g., change in Medical Monitor or contact information).

Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer 
Conventional response criteria may not be ideal for the assessment of response in the 
setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer. Therefore, RECIST 1.1 criteria have been modified to specifically address assessment of primary breast lesions along with axillary lymph node disease, using a range of breast imaging modalities.  Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1
1 
are presented below, with modifications and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity. For detailed information on the read methodology including how imaging data should be processed prior to reads, please refer to the Study Imaging Charter.  
 RECIST v1.1 Modified RECIST Early Breast 
Cancer Neoadjuvant Therapy 
Modalities CT as primary modality, 
ultrasound not 
recommended No CT; primary assessments by MRI; 
also assessments by ultrasound, 
mammography, and clinical exam  
Lymph nodes May be considered 
target lesions based on 
size criteria ( ≥ 15 mm in 
SAD) Only axillary lym ph nodes assessed; 
nodes that are considered abnormal on imaging (based on morphological factors including, but not limited to SAD) to be followed as non-target 
lesions 
Possibility of having only 
non-target disease Allowed Not allowed; primary breast lesions 
must be measurable by MRI and/or 
ultrasound 
CT = computed tomography; MRI  = magnetic resonance imaging; SAD  = short axis dimension. 
 
BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. All baseline evaluations shoul d be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Method of Measurement  
According to RECIST 1.1 guidelines, MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting.  CT is currently the preferred modality for assessing metastatic disease, but should not be used in this focused setting of neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.  Ultrasound, mammography, and clinical exam are all

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 120 common and useful modalities for assessing breast lesions, and will also be used to 
assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Up to 2 
lesions in the breast may be identified as target lesions.  A sum of the diameters of all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, and 
lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see below for 
more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment. The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality. If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment time point, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as 
non-target lesions at baseline. Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in the 
assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions should 
be followed qualitatively, as described below at each response assessment timepoint.   
Appendix 3  
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  
Assessment of Response of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early 
Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 121 Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged 
• Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum • Irregular margins or spiculations • Rim enhancement • Decreased echogenicity of cortex 
• Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.  While on study, all lesions 
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.  
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is abl e to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.

Breast Cancer (cont.) 
GDC-0032—Genentech, Inc. 
Protocol GO28888, Version 1 122 Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment.   When non-nodal lesions fragment, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
• All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
• PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.

Protocol GO28888, Version 1 123 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
Timepoint Response (Overall Response)  
Table 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each protocol-specified timepoint for which a response assessment occurs.

CR NE No PR 
PR Any except PD No PR 
SD Any except PD No SD 
NE (Any lesion) Any except PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or no PD 
Any PD Yes or no PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR  = complete response; NE  = not evaluable; PD  = progressive disease; 
PR  = partial response; SD  = stable disease.  
Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response. Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.  
Special Notes on Response Assessment  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease as shown in Table 1.

Note: The T classification of the primary tumor is the same regar dless of whether it is based on clinical or pathologic criteri a, or both.  Size should 
be measured to the nearest millimeter.  If the tumor size is slig htly less than or greater than a cut-off for a given T classification, it is recommended 
that the size be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cut-o ff.  For example, a reported size of 1.1 mm is r eported as 1 mm, or a 
size of 2.01 cm is reported as 2 cm.  Designation should be made wi th the subscript "c" or "p" modi fier to indicate whether the  T classification was 
determined by clinical (physical examination or radiologic) or pathologic measurements, respectively.  In general, pathologic d etermination should 
take precedence over clinical determination of T size.

a Clinically detected is defined as detected by imaging studies (excluding lymphoscintigraphy) or by clinical examination and ha ving characteristics 
highly suspicious for malignancy or a presumed pathologic macrometastasis based on fine needle aspiration biopsy with cytologic  examination.  
Confirmation of clinically detected metast atic disease by fine needle aspiration without excision biopsy is designated with an (f) suffix, for 
example, cN3a(f).  Excisional biopsy of a lymph node or biopsy of a sentinel node, in the absence of assignment of a pT, is cla ssified as a 
clinical N, for example, cN1.  Information regarding the confirmation of the nodal status will be designated in site-specific f actors as clinical, fine 
needle aspiration, core biopsy, or sentinel  lymph node biopsy.  Pathologic classification (pN) is used for excision or sentinel  lymph node biopsy 
only in conjunction with a pathologic T assignment.

Post-treatment yp M classification.  The M category for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy is the category assigned in the 
clinical stage, prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.  Identification of distant metastases after the start of therapy in cases where 
pre-therapy evaluation showed no metastases is considered progre ssion of disease.  If a patient was designated to have detectab le 
distant metastases (M1) before chemotherapy, the patient will be designated as M1 throughout.

Note: Stage designation may be changed if postsurgical imaging studi es reveal the presence of distant metastases, provided that  the studies are 
carried out within 4 months of diagnosis in the absence of dise ase progression and provided that the patient has not received n eoadjuvant therapy.  
Post-neoadjuvant therapy is designated with "y c" or "yp" prefix.  Of note, no stage group is assigned if there is a complete pa thologic response (CR) 
to neoadjuvant therapy, for example, ypT0cM0.   
a T1 includes T1mi.

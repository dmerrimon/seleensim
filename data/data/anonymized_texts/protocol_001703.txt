Study  
Objective  The objective of the clinical study is to demonstrate the AcQBlate Force 
Sensing System is  safe and effective when used to ablate the 
cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) for the treatment of t ypical  atrial flutter 
when compared to a literature -based control.  
Data will be used to support a pre-market approval (PMA) application.

Acutus Medical, Inc.   CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021  Page 8 of 82 Study  
Design  The Acutus Medical AcQForce Flutter  clinical study is a prospective, 
multi- center, non-randomized  global study designed to demonstrate the 
safety and effectiveness of the AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation 
System  in the ablation management of symptomatic cavotricuspid 
isthmus dependent atrial flutter . 
All subjects  with typical  atrial flutter  will undergo percutaneous catheter 
ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus  using the AcQBlate Force Sensing 
System with the endpoint of achieving bidirectional block (BDB).  
Post procedural follow -up visits will be completed at pre -discharge, to 
assess device and procedure- related serious adverse event s (SAEs), a 7-
day phone call, and a 30 -day clinic  visit to assure compliance with all 
aspects of the study and report on the observational effectiveness 
endpoint.  
The expected safety and efficacy rates for the primary endpoints were 
derived from a meta- analysis of recently completed IDE trials). Event 
rates were estimated from Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data 
(SSED) or results disclosed on clinicaltrials.gov  and calculated based 
on the occurrence of events that constitute the primar y safety and 
efficacy endpoints defined in this protocol. 
Patien t 
Population Subjects 18  years and older , presenting for a de novo  percutaneous 
cardiac ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus for typical  atrial flutter will 
be included in the AcQForce Flutter  study.  
Primary 
Safety 
Endpoint  The Primary Safety Endpoint for the AcQForce Flutter  study is a 
comparative analysis of subjects free from a composite list of pre -
specified procedure/device related Serious Adverse Event s (SAE s) 
through 7-days post ablation using a literature -based control.   
Serious Adverse Events  are pre-defined and include: 
• Death  
• Cardiac tamponade/ perforation  
• Myocardial infarction 
• Stroke 
• Systemic embolism  
• Major access site complications  
• Major bleeding requiring transfusion 
• Complete heart block  
• Other SAEs/SADE s adjudicated by an independent 
review  as “probably or definitely related” to the 
Investigational device.

CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021  Page 9 of 82 Primary 
Effectivenes s 
Endpoint  The Primary Effectiveness Endpoint for the AcQForce Flutter  study is 
an analysis of subjects achieving acute procedural success . Acute 
procedural success is defined as the demonstration of bidirectional 
cavotricuspid isthmus block at least  20 minutes following the last 
radiofrequency application at the cavotricuspid isthmus with the 
inves tigational System . 
Bidirectional block (BDB ) confirmation is defined as: 
• Demonstration of bidirectional electrophysiological 
conduction block through the cavotricuspid isthmus ( CTI) 
using both coronary sinus ostium (CS) and annular low 
right atrial pacing maneuvers .  
Observational 
Effectiveness 
Endpoint   Freedom from recurrence of typical  CTI dependent atrial flutter OFF 
Class I/III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) at 30 -days post index 
procedure as measured by a 24 -hour continuous electrocardiogram 
(ECG ) monitor. 
Study Sample 
Size The sample size consists of 110 Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) 
subjects, based on using a one -sided α of 0.05, with 90% power . A 
maximum of 120 Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT)  subjects will be 
enrolled. mITT  subjects are any enrolled subjects who initiate  the 
ablation procedure using the AcQBlate Force Sensing System. 
Study 
Geographies  The AcQForce Flutter  Study will be conducted at up to 20 clinical study  
sites in the USA and Europe.  
Stud y 
Duration  The clinical study is anticipated to take approximately 12 -months to 
enroll and will include a 30- day follow- up period. Total clinical study 
duration is anticipated to be approximately  12-18 months. The per 
patient clinical study duration is expected to be approximately six (6 ) 
weeks .

3.1 Background 
Atrial Flutter  
Atrial flutter (AFL) is a macroreentrant  atrial arrhythmia typified by regular atrial 
contraction s between 250 and 350 beats per minute , a constant P -wave morphology, and a 
2:1 atrial to ventricular conduction.1,2 Atrial flutter, while being a common arrythmia, can 
cause significant symptoms (palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness or fainting) and 
sequelae. The hemodynamic condition of the patient determines whether immediate 
cardioversion to sinus rhythm  (SR) is attempted. Endocardial mapping suggests that typical 
atrial flutter is based on right atrial macro  reentry which involves the isthmus between the 
inferior vena cava (IVC) and the tricuspid annulus (TA). An atrial flutter circuit that is dependent on conduction through the cavotricuspid  isthmus (CTI) is designated CTI-
dependent atrial flutte r. A flutter involv ing a circuit that wraps around the tricuspid valve in 
a counter clockwise fashion is termed “typical ” AFL , while  a circuit rotates in a clockwise 
fashion is called “clockwise or reverse typical” AFL .
1,3 In typical AFL, the flutter waves are 
negative in leads II and III and positive in lead V 1.2 
Atrial flutter is a relatively common arrhythmia. The  overall incidence of atrial flutter is 
estimated to be  0.088% (or 88 per 100,000 people) .4 The incidence is 2.5 times higher in men 
than in women, and increases with age. Over one -half of these patients  with atrial flutter also 
have atrial fibrillation  (AF) . Atria l flutter can be triggered by atrial tachycardia (AT) or atrial 
fibrillation (AF). Atrial flutter alone is seen in 0.037% of the population. The incidence of 
atrial flutter increased markedly with age, from 5 per 100,000 of those older than 50 years of 
age to 587 per 100,000 for those older than 80 years of age. The incidence of atrial flutter 
has been  reported  to be approximately twice  that of paroxysmal supraventricular 
tachycardia.2,5 According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, the risks of 
thrombo- embolic events due to atrial flutter, including stro kes, is the same as that for atrial 
fibrillation, therefore recommendations for anticoagulation therapy should be similar to those 
for subjects  with AF .6,7,8 
Current Therapies for Atrial Flutter  
Current treatments offer  non-invasive and invasive options which  include pharmaceutical 
and ablation catheter -based approaches.7 Since 2003, the FDA has approved premarket 
approval (PMA ) applications for ablation catheter systems indicated for the treatment of 
atrial flutter. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA Task Force ) has applied a Classification of Recommendation (COR) and 
Level of Evidence (LOE) for cavotricuspid isthmus catheter -based ablation for symptomatic 
or drug refractory AFL of COR I and LOE B .
7 Catheter ablation of typical  AFL has been 
shown to be highly effective with an acute procedural success rate that in some studies may 
be as high as 97%.9 A systematic review and meta -analysis evaluating the safety and efficacy 
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.   CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 21 of 82 of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of typical AFL demonstrated a  single-procedur e acute 
success rate for AFL at 91.7% (95% CI: 88.4%-94.9%). Multiple -procedure success  was 
97.0% (95% CI : 94.7%- 99.4%). Post -ablation arrhythmia was noted in 13.2% of  subjects  
(95% CI : 7.5% - 18.9%), while repeat ablation was reported in 8% (95% CI : 4.5%-11.4%). 
Reported all -cause mortality has been relatively low in AFL studies (<1%), while serious 
adverse event rates up to 9% have been reported in clinical studies supporting PMA 
applications. Studies of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of AFL and 
supraventricular tachycardia ( SVT ) report high efficacy rates and relatively low rates of 
major complications .9 
Among the various physical principles applied to  catheter ablation, the application of RF 
energy is the most widespread technology. Alternative types of ablation energy include cryo-
ablation, laser ablation, and ultrasound ablation. During the process of RF ablation 
electromagnetic energy is transformed  into thermal energy, whereby the process of resistive 
heating destroys cardiac tissue, modifying the electrical properties of the tissue, establishing electrical isolation of arrhythmic triggers or circuits.
10 Currently, RF ablation is considered 
first-line therapy for treatment of AFL. Lesion formation created during RF catheter ablation 
of the CTI depends on multiple factors: power delivery, duration of the energy applied, tissue temperature, atrial anatomy , ablation catheter tip size and orientation.
11 Success of AFL 
ablation is highly influenced by CTI length and morphology, to perhaps a greater degree than 
choice of catheter tip. Da Costa, et al. , evaluated the role of CTI anatomy in the ability to 
achieve acute and chronic procedural success. An  8 millimeter ( mm) tip catheter w as more 
effective than an irrigated catheter in straight isthmus anatomy , while ablation efficacy was 
increased with  an irrigated tip catheter in concave isthmus morphologies.12 The depth of the 
sub-Eustachian pouch has been shown to be the sole factor that influenced RF duration and 
energy during a CTI ablation often necessitating th e deflection of the catheter by more than 
90 degrees to ablate within the pouch (knuckle -curve ablation) .13 Achieving lesion 
transmurality, i.e., lesions that extend the full thickness along the 1- 6 centimeter (cm ) of the 
isthmus , is essential for the continuity and durability of catheter ablation success.14 By 
employing catheters which improve the electrode -tissue interface, the transfer of thermal 
energy to the cardiac tissue is  enhanced.10  
Contact Force Technology 
Contact force (CF) catheter technology provides real -time sensing of catheter -to-tissue 
pressure enabling the appropriate delivery of RF energy to the endocardial surface. The distal 
tip of a contact force catheter houses a force sensing mechanism, providing real -time 
assessme nt of catheter -tissue contact.15 With improved electrode -tissue contact the transfer 
of thermal energy to the tissue is maximized. When contact force is increased the proportion 
of the electrode surface in contact with the endocardium is enhanced. Further, by increasing 
catheter -tissue contact, lesion size, volume, and depth are increased.16,17,18 Animal models 
suggest that the optimal contact force required to make transmural lesions is between 10 
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.    CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 22 of 82 grams (g) and 20 g.19 These findings have been similarly represented with human data.20 The 
benefits  of contact force sensing were initially demonstrated by the TOCCATA 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) study which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the real -time CF 
sensing using the TactiCath catheter in 77 subjects  treated for right sided supraventricular 
tachycard ias (SVT) and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF).21 From this initial study it was 
identified that a mean contact force of > 20 g was associated with an 80% probability of 
being in sinus rhythm 12 -months following an index ablation. Results from multiple studies 
have demonstrated that using optimal cont act force improves mid to long term AF ablation 
success rates and reduces arrhythmia recurrence rates when CF sensing catheters were 
compared to a non -CF sensing catheters.20,22,23 The TOCCASTAR study  established that the 
atrial arrhythmia free rate was significantly higher when a minimum of ≥  10 g was applied 
to ≥ 90% of the ablation lesions, confirming that optimal contact force is associated with 
improved effectiveness.20  
While the use of contact force is well established for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), there 
is limited information regarding its utility in CTI ablation. CTI ablation creates unique 
challenges given the anatomy of the CTI is non- uniform , exhibiting decreasing tissue density 
when transitioning from the tricuspid annulus to the vena cava. Additionally, the presence of 
the Eustachian ridge, sub- Eustasti an pouches, or pectinate muscle may limit the ability to 
create adequate lesions and may benefit from contact force. While low contact force (< 10 g) during PVI has been shown to be a play a critical role in lesion size and has been identified as a predictor of acute and chronic PVI reconnection, a similar  association was lacking for 
CTI ablation. Kumar et  al., examined the effect of varying anatomy on levels of contact force  
achieved during CTI ablation. The CTI was divided into equal length segments; annular, mid, 
and caval. The annular isthmus corresponded to the vestibule leading to the tricuspid valve, while the caval segment was closest to the orifice of the inferior vena cava, containing the Eustachian ridge. Wide variations in CF were observed within and between CTI regions. The 
highest CF was recorded in the caval region, followed by mid and annular  sections. Low 
contact force was correlated with an increase in both the total ablation time to achieve bidirectional block and acute reconnection. The majority of reconnections observed during the 30 minute post ablation waiting period were in the mid- CTI region (54%).
24 Verner et . 
al., found an inverse correlation betwe en RF delivery and the percent of lesions delivered > 
10 g, with total RF time significantly increased with lesions <  10 g.25 Use of a detectible long 
vascular sheath has been suggested to achieve CF catheter stability along the CTI , improve 
maneuverability , thereby enhancing CF .23,24  
When comparing the performance of ablation catheter type s, a recent study evaluated the 
acute efficacy  of a CF catheter and a non -CF catheter with the  endpoint of achieving 
bidirectional block.26 Catheter ablation using a CF catheter achieved acute bidirectional block 
in 100% of patients while only 90% of non- CF catheter ablations  met the endpoint of 
bidirectional block. The authors suggest CF parameters may help overcome potential 
anatomical difficulties.26 The recent analysis of the safety and effectiveness of an irrigated,

CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 23 of 82 gold tipped contact force catheter (AlCath Force catheter equivalent to AcQBlate FORCE)  
for subjects indicated for CTI and PAF ablation demonstrated acute proced ural success 
(bidirectional block)  with a mean contact force of  25.6 ± 7.3 g. Detailed results are provided 
in section 4. 
3.2 Justification for Investi gation and Study Design  
Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus has been  a therapeutic mainstay for the 
treatment of typical atrial flutter for the past decade. The current understanding of the field 
of catheter ablation makes for a mature marketplace of irrigated , non-irrigated , and contact 
force  catheters for CTI ablation. The  intended us e and intended use population of the 
AcQBlate® FORCE  is identical to those of current RF ablation catheters from other 
manufacturers approved for the ablation of atrial flutter .  
The expected safety rates  for the primary safety and efficacy endpoints were derived from a 
meta -analysis of recently completed IDE trials  and publications  related to the safety and 
efficacy of typical CTI dependent atrial flutter ablation  (see Table 1). Event rates were 
estimated from Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data ( SSED ), results disclosed on 
clinicaltrials.gov , peer reviewed publications . and were calculated based on the occurrence 
of events that constitute the primary safety and efficacy endpoint s defined in this protocol.

that corresponds with the composite list used for the statistical analysis of the primary 
safety endpoint of the AcQForce Flutter clinical study. The TOCCATTA trial21 was the 
first multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that used direct contact force in human subjects. The overall event rate for right sided ablations was 2.3%. A comparison of reported events within  the SSEDs  and the TOCCATTA trial  to the pre -defined composite 
safety definitions suggests an approximate SAE mean event rate of 3.0% , and a weighted 
mean of 2.9%  (Table 2). Note that rates reported in individual studies varied between 2.1% 
and 5.3%. To account for any differences between the AcQFor ce Flutter study ’s primary 
safety endpoint  compared to the previous studies used in the meta -analysis, a  derived safety 
event rate of 3%  is expected . Based on this , a performance goal is proposed based on an 
expected rate of 98.5% and a 5.5% statistical margin . This  will define the safety population 
sample size to support a primary safety endpoint with at least 90% power  for the planned 
sample size.

4 REPORT OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS  
4.1 Overview  
In May of 2019, Acutus Medical, via a joint agreement, acquired the Biotronik AlCath Force 
Sensing Catheter and Qubic Force Sensing Module technology. The AlCath Force catheter was rebranded as  the AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation Catheter and manufacturing was 
moved to Carlsbad, California. The Qubic Force Sensing Module retained its initial branding.  
Following CE Mark approval, Biotronik conducted the post- market,  prospectiv e, 
BIO|CONCEPT  AlCa th Force study enrolling 30 subjects  with PAF and/or typical  AFL at 6 
sites in Australia . Ablation procedure included PVI only (n=12), CTI only (n=16), and PVI 
plus CTI (n=2). The study objective was to provide continued clinical evidence supporting 
the safety and efficacy of the devices  and identify additional risks associated with use. Safety 
endpoints included the collection of all SAEs and serious adverse device effects ( SADEs ) 
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.   CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 28 of 82 through procedure discharge. The efficacy endpoint was the determination of electrical 
isolation defined as PV isolation for the pulmonary vein ( PV) ablation and bidirectional block 
for the CTI ablations.  
4.2 AlCath Force Ablation Procedure  
Electrophysiological examinations during the ablation procedure were performed according 
to clinical study site preference for PVI and CTI ablations. The AlCath Force catheter and 
Qubic Force were operated as labeled. Target values for contact force, contact force ranges, 
and force time integrals (FTI) were at the discretion of the Investigator. The following 
recommendations were adhered to:  
• Maximum tip temperature: 42°  C (mandatory).  
• Energy delivery ≤  FTI of 450 gram seconds (gs) in any catheter  position. 
• Initial power titration of  energy  ≤ 25 W. After 15 seconds, the energy could 
be increased un til a transmural lesion wa s achieved .  
• When ablating the posterior wall, a reduction in power and FTI was 
recommended.  
• Irrigation flow rat es during mapping and ablation followed the Instructions 
for Use (IFU).

No deaths or SADEs were reported throughout the duration of the clinical study.  
Acute Procedural Success  
Acute p rocedural success was defined as isolation of all four pulmonary veins with 
demonstrated entrance and exit block in subjects receiving an ablation for AF. Fourteen 
subjects treated for AF demonstrated acute procedural success (14/14, 100%). For subjects receiving a CTI ablation, acute procedural success was defined as bidirectional block across 
the cavotricuspid isthmus with conformation via differential pacing. Seventeen subjects (17/18 94.4%) achieved the procedure endpoint.  
Device Performance  
A total of  38 catheters were used in the 30 procedures. Six device deficiencies were observed 
(6/38, 15.8%). Three of the device deficiencies required the crossover to another AlCath Force catheter. No device deficiencies were noted with the Qubic Force.  
A total of  56 usability parameters were assessed:  27 parameters for the AlCath Force catheter 
and 29 parameters for the Qubic Force. The assessment of usability of the AlCath Force catheter and Qubic Force was positive with 99% of usability aspects rated as “adequat e”, 
“good”, or “very good”. Approximately 1% of rates were ranked as “poor” or “very poor”.

CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 32 of 82 5 STUDY DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
5.1 Indication for Use (proposed)  
The Ac QBlate® FORCE Sensing Ablation Catheter and related accessory devices are 
indicated for cardiac electrophysiological mapping, delivery of diagnostic pacing stimuli, 
and radiofrequency ablation of  recurrent and symptomatic atrial flutter (AFL)  when used 
with a compatible RF Generator. When used with the Qubic F orce® module , the AcQBlate® 
FORCE Sensing Ablation C atheter provides a real time measurement of contact force 
between the catheter tip and the heart.  
5.2 AcQBlate® Force Sensing Ablation System  
The AcQBlate® Force Sensing Ablation System ( herein known as AcQBl ate Force Sensing 
System) comprises the AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation Catheter (AcQBlate® FORCE ), the 
Qubic Force Sensing Module (Qubic Force), the Qubic RF Generator, and the Qiona 
Irrigation Pump with  Tubing Set. The System is designed for EP mapping and RF ablation 
of typical  atrial flutter.  
5.3 AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation Catheter  
The AcQBlate Force is a unidirectionally deflectable, steerable, quadripolar , irrigated 
ablation catheter with an integrated force sen sor for intracardiac application. It is designed 
for EP mapping and RF ablation of cardiac arrhythmias .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3.1 Qubic Force Sensing Module  
The AcQBlate FORCE  contact force monitoring capability requires connection with the 
Qubic Force Sensing Module  (Qubic Force) by means of an optical cable which is 
permanently attached to the catheter.  
The Qubic Force is a non -sterile, reusable unit that does not contact the patient . It  processes 
the contact force signal from the AcQBlate FORCE  during an EP procedure irrespective of 
an RF energy application (ablation).  
 
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.   CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 33 of 82 5.4 Qubic Radiofrequency (RF) Generator  
The Qubic RF Generator is a modular RF generator that can be used in combination with the 
AcQBlate FORCE  for cardiac RF ablation. The values measured during ablation are shown 
on the display and control unit screen. 
   
5.5 Qiona Irrigation Pump and Tubing  Set 
The Qiona Ablation Irrigation Pump is used in conjunction with a tubing set to deliver a 
sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline) for the purpose of cooling the AlCath  
Flux catheter tip during ablation procedures.  
 
 
 
  
 
5.6 The AcQBlate Force System Operation  
General  
Equipment used during an EP procedure may include devices for introduction of the catheter 
into the vascular system, catheter visualization, processing the EP signals, and devices 
providing electrical stimulation for diagnostic purposes. In this clinical study, t he AcQBlate 
FORCE  catheter  will be used with the Qubic Force, the Qubic RF Generator and the Qiona 
Ablation Irrigation Pump with Tubing Set  . These devices are not FDA approved and 
therefore considered investigational devices.  
In a typical ablation  procedure, EP mapping is performed to identify and map the 
arrhythmogenic areas in the heart to be targeted for subsequent ablation. All catheter 
manipulations during mapping and ablation should be performed with a navigational guidance (fluoroscopic, int racardiac echo  and/or 3D navigation devices). 
Electrophysiologic Mapping 
Prior to the actual ablation, diagnostic EP mapping may be performed with the AcQBlate FORCE . During this process, the contact force information provided by the Qubic Force may 
be used to monitor the contact between the catheter tip and the myocardial tissue and may 
assist the operator to obtain stable intracardiac signals of appropriate quality. Moreover, 
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.   CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 34 of 82 contact force monitoring may reduce the risk of cardiac perforation as a result of excessive 
contact force. During EP mapping the electrodes of the AcQBlate FORCE can be used for pacing. Procedures and routines used during the mapping procedure strongly depend on the 
arrhythmia(s) to be treated.  
Advanced Mapping Systems 
The AcQBlate Force System is compatible with the Acutus Medical AcQMap System with 
investigational frame software v3.6.4.XX. Use of the AcQMap System with the investigational frame software may be utilized to support display of ablation parameters. The 
ablatio n specific data includes the below listed parameters:  
• Contact force from Qubic Force 
• Power from Qubic RF 
• AcQTag – used to color and size markers automatically on the 3D anatomy 
model 
• Listing of generic auxiliary catheters 
The AcQMap System with the investigational frame software is considered part of the investigational device and is an optional accessory to the AcQBlate Force System. Use of 
the AcQMap System
 with investigational frame software v3.6.4.XX should be at the 
discretion of the Investigator. 
RF Ablation  
Once the targets for ablation have been appropriately identified, ablation is performed using the AcQBlate FORCE ablation functionality. The ablation electrode at the tip of the catheter 
is positioned by means of the steering mechanism on the proximal handle and RF current is applied by the Qubic RF generator. RF application is a functionality of the Qubic RF generator, not directly controlled by the AcQBlate FORCE catheter . Irrigated ablation 
catheters like the AcQBlate FORCE are used in power -controlled mode. In this mode, the 
supply of RF current is regulated and/or discontinued if the power exceeds a user -defined 
threshold. Additionally, a temperature cut -off is set to define a maximum catheter tip 
temperature to stop RF delivery in case of overheat. This may reduce the risk of steam pops and cardiac perforation as well as prevent excessive scar formation and thermal coagulation 
of blood at the ablation site.  
The contact force shown by the Qubic Force is an indication of the quality of the contact 
between the ablation electrode and the myocardial tissue. The operator may use the contact force information to monitor the tissue -electrode contact and achieve effective lesion creation 
while minimizing the risk of cardiac perforation.  The direction of the total contact force 
vector indicated by the Qubic Force may assist the operator to control the orientation of the AcQBlate FORCE regarding the tissue. For instance, a perpendicular orientation of the 
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.    CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 35 of 82 ablation electrode would be indica ted by a minimal lateral force component. In addition, the 
FTI parameter informs the operator about the stability of the catheter tip on the tissue, which 
contributes to the effectiveness of lesion creation.  
The tip design of the AcQBlate FORCE allows the  application of a heparinized saline flow 
to be dispensed through the irrigation holes of the tip. Irrigated RF ablation is intended to 
allow the application of a relatively high RF power without overheating the tissue surface. This may increase the effect iveness of lesion creation.  
As part of the manufacturing process, each AcQBlate FORCE is individually calibrated in order to associate the optical signal with the actual contact force. This calibration data and additional manufacturing data are stored in an RFID chip integrated in the fiber optics connector of the AcQBlate FORCE . Upon connection of the AcQBlate FORCE with the 
Qubic Force, these data are automatically read by the Qubic Force and used to provide catheter -specific, calibrated contact force in formation. As a result, a separate calibration 
procedure before using the catheter is not required, and the contact force reading is accurate after zero -setting the contact force while the AcQBlate FORCE is free -floating in the heart 
chamber (i.e., no cont act with the cardiac wall).

6.7 Clinical Study Enrollment Definitions  
For the purposes of this clinical study, the following definitions regarding the status of a 
subject will apply: 
Enrolled Subject  – Any subject who has signed an informed consent form, is 
deemed study eligible by meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria  up to the point of the procedure.  
Pre-pr
ocedure Testing F ailure  (PPT)  – An enrolled subject who  has presented for 
the procedure in any rhythm other than sinus rhythm or typical atrial flutter  and 
has not undergone venous access . These subjects will be treated per the 
recommendations of the study physician and  exited from the study. No use of the 
investigational device is allowed. A Study Exit electronic case report form ( eCRF ) 
will be completed .   
Intent- to-T reat Failure Subject (ITT)  – Any e nrolled subject who has the venous 
access portion of the ablation procedure initiated and up to the point of completion of the right -atrial access  but prior to any RF application with the investigational 
device. The ITT population will be followed for safety reasons through the 7- day 
follow- up visit . ITT subjects that the AcQBlate FORCE Catheter has been inserted 
into will be included in the safety data analysis but excluded from the efficacy data analysis.  All other ITT patients will be excluded from any safety or efficacy data 
analysis.  In addition to the Discharge eCRF  and the 7-day Follow -up eCRF, a 
Study Exit eCRF will also be completed.  The ITT population may include: 
• At the time of the procedure, if the subject does not demonstrate 
conduction through cavotricuspid isthmus, the subject will be exited from 
the study and followed for safety through the 7-day follow-up visit.   
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.   CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 43 of 82 • At the time of procedure, if atrial fibrillation is initiated during the process 
of inducing typical AFL, a direct current cardioversion ( DCCV ) may be 
performed to attempt conversion to sinus rhythm so that the CTI 
conduction portion of the study may proceed. If during confirm ation of 
CTI conduction, the investigator determines that further ablation beyond 
the CTI is warranted the subject  will be exited from the study and followed 
for safety through the 7-day follow-up visit. 
Modified Intent -to-Treat Subject  (mITT)  – Any e nroll ed subject who initiates the 
ablation procedure using the AcQBlate Force Sensing System. A n initiated 
ablation procedure is defined as a procedure where the AcQBlate Force Sensing 
System is used for the ablation procedure irrespective if a non -investigational 
device was used to complete the ablations. m ITT subjects will be followed for all 
study outcome measures for the full duration of the clinical study and will 
comprise the data set for the Primary Safety and Efficacy Endpoints.

7.5.4 Subject  Preparation  
Subjects will be prepped and draped for the ablation procedure f ollowing standard hospital 
practice. This includes placement of all cables/patches used for ECG monitoring and 
operation of all devices to be used during the procedure.  
7.5.5 Anesthesia  
Use of conscious sedation or general anesthesia will follow the Investigator  preferences as 
directed by the subject’s health status.  
7.5.6 AcQBlate Force System Set -Up 
The AcQBlate Force System including the AcQBlate FORCE catheter, the  Qubic RF 
Generator, the Qiona Irrigation Pump, Tubing Set, and assorted cables should be prepared 
and connected following the IFU and Investigator training. During the procedure, Acutus 
Medical personnel will be available to provide onsite training on any aspects of the AcQBlate Force  System set -up and operation.  
7.6 CTI Ablation Procedure 
7.6.1 Conf irmation of Conduction through the CTI  
Entrainment pacing from the cavotricuspid isthmus during atrial flutter will be attempted 
prior to initiating RF ablation to verify that the CTI is part of the arrhythmia circuit . When 
clinically reasonable, the investigator may attempt to induce atrial flutter using pacing 
maneuvers when the subject presents to the lab in sinus rhythm.  
Documentation of concealed entrainment should be printed and recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF.  
If Investigator is unable to induce and entrain CTI dependent AFL, the Investigator may 
choose to confirm and document conduction through the CTI . CTI conduction must be 
confirmed  prior to initiating RF ablation . Documentatio n of inability to induce and/or entrain 
should be printed and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Confirmation of conduction through the CTI should be demonstrated using pacing maneuvers.  
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.    CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 49 of 82 Documentation of conduction through the CTI should be printed and reco rded on appropriate 
CRF.  
If CTI dependent AFL  cannot be confirmed or CTI conduction cannot be confirmed, the 
subject will be considered a n ITT failure subject and exited from the study at the 7- day 
follow -up visit .  
If during inducement, entrainment, or other pacing maneuvers the subject  is paced into AF, 
DCCV may be performed to attempt conversion to sinus rhythm  so the CTI conduction 
measurement  may proceed.  If the investigator determines further ablation beyond the CTI is 
warranted  the subject  will be exited from the study after being followed for 7- days for safety . 
The AcQBlate FORCE catheter shall not be used to initiate ablation procedure until 
conduction through the CTI is confirmed.  
7.6.2 Ablation Considerations  
In order to reduce the ris k of complications the following measures need to be considered for 
ablation of the  atria . Recommended ablation target values are identified in Table 8 below.  
• Titrate the energy, starting with an initial power of ≤  25 W. Do not exceed 30 
W.  
• If a transmural lesion is not achieved, defined by 70% -  80% reduction of the 
intracardiac electrogram (IEGM) signal or emergence of double potentials of 
equal and low  amplitude, after 20 seconds the energy may be increased  but 
not in excess of 40  W. Ablations at 31- 40 W should not exceed 15 seconds in 
duration. 
• Avoid excessive ablation durations at any focal location. If focal ablations are 
applied, duration of RF power at one location requires careful attention to commonly used abla tion effectiveness parameters such as electrogram 
amplitude reduction, electrogram morphology change or impedance changes.  
• Avoid excessive contact force  while using a steerable sheath to guide the 
ablation  catheter.  
• Optimal contact force is 3 -20 g. Do not exceed 40 g for prolonged periods.  
• Do not increase power only because no or little temperature increase is 
measured by the AcQBlate FORCE  and the Biotronik Qubic RF ablation 
generator. The tip of the AcQBlate FORCE  has good cooling properties to 
avoid thrombus formation. The displayed temperature reflects the 
temperature of the irrigated electrode, not of the tissue.  
• Irrigation flow rate must follow the IFU.  
• Use of  half-normal saline  is not allowed.

Temperature monitoring during RF application** * 40° - 50° C  
Contact Force Range 3 grams to 20 grams  
*      It is recommended that lower power levels be used and titrated up to 40W when clinically effective 
ablation cannot be achieved at lower energy levels and within the contact force range. Maximum power 
must not  exceed 40W. Note that high power levels increase the risk of steam pops, perforation, char, 
coagulum and/or extracardiac damage, especially when applied to the posterior wall. Impedance drops, electrogram reduction and/or electrogram morphology change may be used to guide RF termination.  
 
**   Maximum duration of ablation applies to the duration of RF ablation energy delivery at the same 
location.  Duration of ablation as well as the decision to interrupt RF power delivery at any time during RF ablation sh ould be guided by the clinical judgement of the investigator and monitoring of commonly used 
ablation effectiveness parameters such as electrogram amplitude reduction, electrogram morphology change or impedance changes.  
 
*** The temperature displayed on th e RF generator is not representative of the tissue temperature or the 
temperature of the electrode- tissue interface. 
 
Warning:  Higher contact forces may not improve the characteristics of lesion formation and may increase 
the risk for perforation during manipulation of the catheter.  
 
7.6.3 CTI Ablation  
Ablation of the CTI using the investigational device should follow the Investigator’s standard 
of care. Use of a deflectable long vascular sheath to achieve catheter stability is encouraged. 
Pacing from the CS during the ablation is at the discretion of the Investigator. Power and 
irrigation flow setting should follow Table  8. Ablation beyond the CTI is not allowed . No 
left sided ablations are allowed.  
7.6.4 Confirmation of Bidirectional Block  
Initial bidirectional block (BDB) confirmation should meet the study  endpoint definition of:  
• Demonstration of bidirectional electrophysiological conduction block 
through the cavotricuspid isthmus ( CTI) using both coronary sinus ostium 
(CS) and annular low right atrial pacing maneuvers.  
AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.    CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 52 of 82 This acute endpoint should be re -confirmed at least 20-minutes following the last RF ablation  
with the investigational device . If recovery of isthmus conduction occurs , additional 
ablations should be performed at the site of the reconnection, and the 
confi rmation/reconfirmation steps must be repeated. A reset of the 20 -minute wait time for 
reconfirmation is required. A second investigative catheter or alternate catheter curve may 
be used prior to designation as ablation failure. Maximum RF time before considering a non -
investigational catheter is at the discretion of the Investigator but shall not exceed 60 minutes 
of RF time.  If the Investigator  is unable to achieve b idirectional block with the investigational 
catheter(s), it is recommended, at the Investig ator’s discretion, to use a commercially 
available ablation catheter approved for typical atrial  flutter to complete the procedure.  
7.7 Post Ablation Recovery  
At the conclusion of the procedure, the subject  should be recovered following the 
Institution’s stand ard practice. Sheath removal may be completed when acceptable 
hemostasis can be achieved. The use of protamine to reverse anticoagulation is at the 
discretion of the Investigator. Protamine use will be recorded  on the Procedure eCRF.  
7.8 Procedure Data Collec tion 
Collection of data generated as a result of the procedure should include:  
• Print out of 12- lead ECG at procedure start  
• Print out of intracardiac AFL   
• Print out of e ntrainment pacing results pre -ablation for the CTI  
• Print out of attempts to prove conduction through the CTI  
• Print out of 12- lead ECG at end of procedure  
• Demonstration of  initial BDB  
• Demonstration of BDB 20 minutes following initial determination  
• Total procedure time (from first venous access to last cardiac catheter 
removed)

• Recording of all IV cardiac medications and anticoagulation infused during 
the procedure  
• Usability characteristic data will be collected.  
• Device identification  
7.8.1 Post Ablation Recovery  
Post ablation recovery and removal of the introducer sheaths should follow the institution’s 
standard of care.  
7.8.2 Post Ablation Antiarrhythmic Use  
Following the ablation procedure, Investigators are encouraged to discontinue all Class I/III 
AADs. If continuation of an AAD is clinically indicated, it must be discontinued at least 5 
half-lives (Table 10) prior to the 30- day arrhythmia assessment. Changes in any AAD 
medication will be recorded on the concomitant medica tion eCRF.  
7.8.3 Post Ablation Anticoagulation Use  
Due to the potential of atrial stunning following conversion from AFL to SR and to prevent the risk of thromboembolic events, it is recommended that therapeutic anticoagulation be 
given for at least four (4) we eks with all subjects that presented with pre -ablation AFL of ≥ 
48-hours . All anticoagulation medications will be recorded on the concomitant medication 
eCRF.  
7.8.4 Hospital Discharge  
The following evaluations must be completed prior to discharge (see Table 12): 
• Arrhythmia History since the procedure  
• Physical Exam  (at a minimum Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Extremities 
should be evaluated)  
• Vital Signs  
• Symptoms  
• Medications  
• Adverse Events  
• 12-lead ECG  
Note: in the event that post -procedure 12- lead ECG documented sinus rhythm

post-procedure 12- lead ECG may be used to satisfy this requirement. 
Careful attention should be placed in the identification of potent ial cardiac effusions and 
post-procedure cardiac tamponade. Unexplained reduction in blood pressure, chest pain or 
shortness of breath may require a post -procedure Transthoracic Echo ( TTE)  and further 
evaluation and management as indicated.

8.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Evaluation 
The primary safety endpoint, the proportion of m ITT and select ITT  subjects who are free 
from device/procedure related SAE that occur through 7- days post ablation procedure , will be 
analyzed using a binomial proportion test . Subjects who do not have evidence of a SAE/SADE 
from the composite list of safety events  will be c onsidered a success.  
8.2.1 Primary Safety Endpoint Hypothesis 
The null and alternate hypotheses for primary safety endpoint are as follows:

confidence bound is greater than 93.0%.  
8.2.2 Other Safety Analyses  
Individual procedure -device related SAEs at 7 -days will be analyzed by event frequencies and 
proportions of subjects. Total and i ndividual non -serious procedure -device AEs at 30 -days 
will also be analyzed by event frequencies and p roportion of subjects. Adverse events will be 
analyzed in terms of their severity, action tak en, and duration to resolution.

subjects are not lost to follow -up and that there is a minimal amount of missing data. However, 
it is recognized that some degree of missing data may exist. To address the potential impact 
of any such missing data, sensitivity analyses of the primary safety and efficacy endpoints 
will be performed using the m ITT and select ITT  Cohort s.  
8.6 Primary Endpoints Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analyses of the primary safet y and efficacy endpoints are exploratory. No labeling 
claims are planned. A  Pearson chi -squared test will be performed for any significant 
differences between gender, ethnicity, race and individual co -morbidities and using a logistic 
regression test for ag e.  
8.7 Secondary Endpoints  
There are no secondary endpoints established for this study.  
8.8 Study Sample Size Rationale  
The sample size requirement for this protocol was determined using the  Statistical Analysis 
System  (SAS) Software (Cary, NC ) Proc Power one sample proportion using a normal -
approximate z test, with at least 90% power and a one -sided 5% significance level.  
For the primary safety endpoint, assuming an estimated primary safety rate of 97% and a null 
hypothesis proportion of 93%,  a minimum sample size of 110 subjects is required.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, assuming an estimated primary efficacy rate of 93.7% and a null hypothesis proportion of 83.7%, a minimum sample size of 85 subjects is required.  
Therefore, the minimu m required sample size for this study will be 110 subjects. A maximum 
of 120 mITT subjects will be enrolled.  
8.9 Statistical Methods for Baseline, Screening , Procedural Experience and Hospital

9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
For the purpose of this CIP/ protocol, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence, 
unintended disease or injury, or any untoward clinical signs in subjects whether or not related to the AcQBlate Force Sensing System, and includes events related to the procedures involved 
in the CIP/protocol.  
Any medical conditions, problems, signs, symptoms, or findings that occurs in a subject  once 
they are considered a component of the “Intention to Treat ” is considered an adverse event 
(AE). Any medical conditions, problems, signs, symptoms, and findings occurring prior to 
enrollment are to be reported as pre -existing conditions on the Medical History eCRF.  
All AEs will be documented with the event  term and description, start date , duration, severity, 
seriousness, relatedness to either the device or the procedure, action taken , and outcome, will 
be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF . The Investigator has the responsibility of classifying 
any event as related to a component of the AcQBlate Force Sensing System, or the ablation 
procedure.   
9.1 Serious Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Device Effect  
A Serious Adverse Event/ Serious Adverse Device Effect is any event that:
1 
• led to death  
• led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in: 
- a life -threatening illness or injury, or 
- a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function including 
chronic diseases , or 
- in-patient or prolonged hospitalization, or 
- medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function 
• led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Reports relating to the subject’s  subsequent medical course following an SAE must be 
submitted to the Sponsor until the event has subsided or, in the event of permanent

Acutus Medical, Inc.    CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 61 of 82 impairment, until the event has stabilized, and the overall clinical outcome has been 
ascertained.  
A planned, in- patient hospitalization, without a serious deterioration in health, is not 
considered to be a n SAE .   
Recurrence of atrial flutter  is not considered an adverse event as there is a known recurrence 
rate associated with atrial flutter ablation. Scheduled hospitalizations to treat these 
arrhythmias will not be considered serious in nature. However, if a subje ct is hospitalized for 
a clinical condition resulting from the arrhythmia, an adverse event should be reported.  
9.2 Adverse Device Effects (ADEs)  
Adverse Device Effects (ADEs) are a subset of AEs. The ADEs are only those AEs caused by, or related to the device , including any AE resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies 
in the instructions for use, the s ystem components, or any product malfunction, including any 
event that is a result of a user error or intentional misuse.   
With any procedure or treatment, there are known possible risks and complications. A list of 
known or anticipated ADEs is found in the CIP/protocol, IFU, and Operator’s Manual ( OM).   
9.3 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect is any event that occurs as a result of the device use 
that was not identified as a known or an anticipated risk for the AcQBlate Force Sensing 
System , as found in the CIP/protocol, IFU, and OM  for the device.  
When an Investigator suspects an event meets the definition for a  UADE, the event  term and 
description, start date , duration, severity , seriousness, relatedness to either the device or the 
procedure, action taken, and outcome , will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF . 
Additionally, reports must be provided to the reviewing Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee /Competent Authority  (IRB /EC/CA) per national and local requirements.   
The Sponsor/manufacturer must then conduct an evaluation of the suspected UADE and report the results of the findings to all reviewing IRBs /ECs /CA and participating Investigators within 
five (5) business days after first receiving notice of the effect.  
9.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all procedure and device related AEs that occur during the follow -up period. Initial reporting will be with the Adverse Event eCRF; however, 
additional information may be required by the Sponsor or any regulatory authority. The Investigator must  report any SAEs, SADEs, UADEs , or Device Deficiency (DD)  to the 
Sponsor as soon as possible after becoming aware of the event, but no later than ten  (10) 
business days after receiving knowledge of the event occurrence. All SAEs, SADEs, and UADEs will be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF along with an explanation of any

CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 62 of 82 medical treatment administered. Documentation should include the time of onset, complete 
description of the event, severity, duration, actions taken, and outcome.   
9.5 Event Relationship to the Device  
The Investigator should provide information regarding the relationship of the event to the 
procedure and/or the AcQBlate Force Sensing System . The device relationships and severity 
definitions are defined in Tables 10 and 11 below: 
Table 10. Adverse Event Relationship Definitions  
Not Related  The cause of the AE is known and is not related to any aspect of the 
AcQBlate Force System during the ablation procedure. 
Possibly 
Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may be related to the 
ablation procedure. The AE has a timely relat ionship to the study 
procedure(s); however, it follows no known pattern of response  and 
an alternative cause seems more likely or there is significant uncertainty.  
Probably 
Related  It is probable that the event is related to the ablation procedure. The AE 
has a timely relationship  to the study procedure(s) and follows a known 
pattern of response , but a potential alternative cause may be present.  
Definitely 
Related  The event is defin itely related to the ablation procedure. A related event 
has a strong temporal relationship and an alternative cause is unlikely. 
 
Table 11. Adverse Event Severity Definitions  
Mild  Event results in mild or transient discomfort, not requiring intervention 
or treatment; does not limit or interfere with daily activities (e.g., 
insomnia, mild headache). 
Moderate  Event is sufficiently discomforting so as to limit or interfere with daily 
activities; may require interventional treatment (e.g., fever  requiring 
antipyretic medication).  
Severe  Event results in significant symptoms that prevents normal daily 
activities; may require hospitalization or invasive intervention (e.g., 
anemia resulting in blood transfusion).  
9.6 Death Notice  
When a site becomes aware of a subject ’s death, it will be reported to the Sponsor. Notification 
should be made to the reviewing IRB/EC /CA/local requirements  within two (2) days of

AcQForce Flutter   
Acutus Medical, Inc.   CONFIDENTIAL  
CLP-21 Rev 11 23 September  2021   Page 65 of 82 The following ADEs may be experienced if the IFU is not followed: 
• Injury to user during defibrillation. 
• Excessive force, if applied, may damage the AcQBlate FORCE catheter sensor at 
the distal section .  
• The AcQBlate FORCE may be damaged through introducer sheath if the 
transseptal sheath lumen is less than 8.5F. 
10.2 Mitigation of Risks 
The completed risk analysis ( RSK -21) of the AcQBlate Force Sensing System identified all 
known risks to the Investigat or and subject. The risks associated with a standard ablation 
procedure are listed in section 10.1. AcQBlate FORCE  is similar in design to existing 
commercially available ablation catheters. AcQBlate Force Sensing System does not create 
new safety risks or  increase procedural risks beyond those associated with commercially 
available ablation systems.  
Pre-clinical research , and a first -in-man clinical study  of the AcQBlate Force Sensing System 
has demonstrated that the system and catheters are  safe for human use. All potential risks have 
been evaluated and mitigation strategies have been implemented to reduce potential risks to 
acceptable levels. Any additional information that would alter the risk potential will be 
communicated by the Sponsor.  
Risks associated with participation in this clinical study are minimized through strict 
adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in s ection s 6.6.1 and 6.6.2, training 
of Investigators and staff, and CIP/ protocol compliance. Subjects should be followed as 
described in the CIP/ protocol to avoid any potential interaction with concomitant medical 
treatments. Acutus Medical believes that the potential benefits of the AcQBlate Force Sensing 
System outweigh the potential risks in the appropriate  patient population and when the 
procedure is completed by an appropriately trained Investigator.   
11 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Acutus Medical  will oversee the data collection  for this study in accordance with the Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR), Good Clinica l Practices (GCP), regulatory requirements, the Data

4 Study Design  
The AcQForce Flutter and AcQForce Flutter -EU clinical studies are  prospective, multi -center, 
non-randomized , global clinical studies  designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of the 
AcQBlate Force Sensing System. All subjects with typical atrial flutter will undergo percutaneous 
catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus using the AcQBlate Force Sensing System with the endpoint of achieving bidirectional block (BDB). Treated s ubjects will have data collected at 
screening, pr ocedure, pre -hospital discharge, and 7 -and 30 -days post procedure.  The  subject 
population will consist of men and women 18 years of age or older, presenting for  a de novo 
percutaneous cardiac ablation of the  cavotricuspid isthmus  for typical atrial flutter.

5 Statistical Analyses  
5.1 General Considerations  
Except where otherwise specified, the following general principles apply to the planned statistical analyses. All statistical analysis will be conducted using SAS  software  version 9.3 or 
later or other widely  accepted statistical or graphical software as required.  
 
5.1.1 Descriptive Statistics  
Continuous variables will be summarized as means,  standard deviatio ns, medians, and ranges . 
Categorical variables will be  summarized as frequencies and percentages.  
 Confidence intervals may be presented, where appropriate, using the t -distribution for 
continuous data and Clopper -Pearson Exact  method for categorical variables.  
 
5.1.2 Study Day  
Study day 0 is the date of the index procedure. Day in study will be calculated relative to the 
index procedure as follows:  
Study Day = Assessment Date –  Index Procedure Date  
For each subject , duration in study will be based on last study contact date which is the latest 
date of all follow -up visits , assessments, adverse event onset or resolution, and study exit 
including date of death.

Duration variables will be calculated as follows:  
Duration  Days = End Date  – Start Date  
5.1.3 Visit Windows  
Unless otherwise spe cified, visit  based  assessments will be analyzed for  each analysis time point 
according  to the nominal visit entered in the Case Report Form (CRF) regardless of  if it is out of 
window.  
 
5.1.4 Statistical Significance  
Confidence intervals and statistical tests  will be  performed at a two -sided 5% significance level 
unless specified otherwise. P-values will be rounded to four  decimal places. If a p -value is less 
than 0.001 it will be reported as “ <0.001”.  
 
5.1.5 Precision  
Unless otherwise specified, the following conventions will apply for data display. In general, 
percentages will be displayed to 1 decimal place. Percentages <0.05% will be reported to 2 
decimal places . 
 
5.2 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populatio ns are defined for analysis:  
1. The Enrolled  Analysis Set  will consist of subject s who have  signed an informed consent 
form, are deemed study eligible by meeting all of the inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria up to the point of the procedure.  
2. The Pre-procedure Testing  (PPT) Failure Set will consist of enrolled subjects  who have  
presented for the procedure in any rhythm other than sinus rhythm or typical atrial 
flutter and ha ve not undergone venous access. These subjects will be treated per the 
recommendations of the study physician and exited from the study. No use of the 
invest igational device is allowed. A St udy Exit electronic case report form (eCRF) will be 
completed.  
3. The Intention -to-Treat  (ITT) Failure Analysis Set will consist of enrolled subject s who 
have the venous access portion of the ablation procedure initiated, rega rdless of 
whether the AcQBlate FORCE Catheter has been inserted, and up to the point of completion of the right -atrial access but prior to any RF application with the

investigational device. The ITT Failure subjects will be followed for safety reasons  
thro ugh the 7 -day follow -up visit . All ITT Failure subjects will be excluded from any 
efficacy data analysis . In addition to the Discharge eCRF  and the 7 -day Follow -up eCRF,  a 
Study Exit eCRF will also be completed.  The ITT Failure population may include:  
• At the time of the procedure, if the subject does not demonstrate conduction 
through cavotricuspid isthmus , the subject will be exited from the study and 
followed for safety through the 7 -day follow -up visit.  
• At the time of procedure, if atrial fibrillation is  initiated during the process of 
inducing typical AFL, a direct current cardioversion (DCCV) may be performed to 
attempt conversion to sinus rhythm so that the  CTI conduction portion of the study 
may proceed. If during confirmation of the CTI conduction, t he investigator 
determines that further ablation beyond the CTI is warranted the subject will be exited from the study and followed for safety through the 7 -day follow -up visit.  
4. The Modified Intent ion-to-Treat (mITT)  Analysis S et will consist of enrolled subjects 
who initiates  the ablation procedure using the AcQBlate Force Sensing System. A n 
initiated ablation procedure is defined as a procedure where the AcQBlate Force Sensing 
System is used for the ablation procedure irrespective if a non -investigational device 
was used to complete the ablations. m ITT subjects will be followed for all study 
outcome measures for the full duration of the clinical study  and will comprise the data 
set for the Primary Efficacy Endpoints . 
 
5.3 Handling of  Missing Data  
All attempts will be made to limit the amount of missing data. Unless otherwise specified , no 
attempt will be made to impute missing data. If a data point is missing, that data point will not 
contribute to that portion of the analysis. The nu mber of evaluable observations will be 
reported in analysis so that extent of missing data can be assessed.  Sensitivity analyses will be 
performed for the primary safety and efficacy endp oints  as detailed in Section 6.6 . 
 
5.4 Subject Disposition  
The number of subjects in each analysis population will be presented along with reason for any exclusions. Subject accountability will be summarized by visit. The number of subjects who are enrolled, eligible for follow -up, and number completing clinical f ollow -up will be summarized 
for each protocol -required visit.  In addition, the number of subjects who complete the study or 
exit early will be summarized by reason.

5.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics, baseline data, including but not l imited to relevant descriptors from the medical 
history, co -morbidities,  and medications, will be summarized.  
 
Procedural data collection will also be analyzed and summarized.  
 
5.6 Analysis of Study Endpoints  
5.6.1 Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint  is defined as the proportion of m ITT and select ITT Failure  subjects 
(i.e., subjects who had the AcQBlate FORCE  Catheter inserted) who are free from a composite 
list of pre -specified device/procedure related SAE s that occur through 7 -days post ablation 
procedure. Subjects who do not have evidence of a SAE/SADE from the composite list of safety 
events will be considered a success.    
 
Serious adverse events that meet the definition for Primary Safety Endpoint are pre -defined 
and include:  
• Death 
• Cardiac tampon ade/perforation  
• Myocardial infarction  
• Stroke  
• Systemic embolism  
• Major access site complications  
• Major bleeding requiring transfusion  
• Complete heart block  
• Other SAEs/SADEs adjudicated by an independent review as “probably or definitely 
related” to the Investigational device.  
  
 Primary  Safety Endpoint  Analysis 
The null and alternate hypotheses for primary safety endpoint are as follows:

Ho: The proportion of mITT subjects  and select ITT Failure subjects  (ρ) who are free from 
device/procedure related  SAE through 7 -days post ablation procedure is less than or equal to 
93.0%.  
 
Ho: ρ ≤ 93.0%  
 
Ha: The proportion of m ITT and select ITT Failure subjects  (ρ)who are free from 
device/procedure related  SAE through 7 -days post ablation procedure is greater than 93.0%.  
 
Ha: ρ > 93.0%  
 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if the one -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson Exact lower  
confidence bound is greater than 93.0%.  
 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of missing data on the primary safety endpoint  will be 
performed including:  
 
• A tipping point analysis in which missing data are varied from worst case to best case to 
evaluate mITT and ITT Failure subjects with missin g primary safety data . 
 
5.6.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoin t is defined as  the proportion of mITT subjects (β) achieving acute 
procedural success. Acute procedural success is defined as the demonstration of bidirectional  
cavotricuspid isthmus block confirmed at  least 20 minutes following the last radiofrequency 
(RF) application at the cavotricuspid isthmus with the investigational cat heter .  
 
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The null and alternate hypotheses for primary efficacy endpoint are as follows:  
 
Ho: T he proportion of mITT subjects (β) demonstrating bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus 
block confirmed at 20 minutes following the last right atrial  radiofrequency (RF) application at 
the cavotricuspid isthmus with the investigational catheter  is less than or equal to 83.7%.

Ho: β ≤ 83.7%  
 
Ha: The proportion of mITT subjects (β) demonstrating bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block 
confirmed at 20 minutes following the last right atrial radiofrequency (RF) application at the 
cavotricuspid is thmus with the investigational cat heter  is greater than 83.7%.  
 
Ha: β > 83.7%  
 
The null hypothesis will be rejected if the one -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson Exact lower 
confidence bound is greater than 83.7%.  
 
A primary efficacy failure will comprise the follo wing:  
• The inability to achieve and maintain bidirectional CTI block at least 20 minutes following the last RF application with the investigation device. A second investigative catheter or alternate AcQBlate FORCE catheter curve may be used prior to designa tion 
as failure. Maximum RF time before considering a non -investigational catheter is at the 
discretion of the Investigator but shall not exceed 60 minutes of RF time.  
OR 
• The use of a commercially available non -investigational catheter for any ablation of the 
CTI. 
 NOTE: Use of iso proterenol is at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
 Sensitivi ty Analysis 
Sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of missing data  on the primary  efficacy endpoint  will be 
performed including:  
 
• A tipping point analysis in which missing data are varied from worst case to best case to 
evaluate subjects with missin g primary efficacy data in the mITT analysis set . 
 
5.6.3 Other Safety Analyses  
Adverse events (AE) will be reported for all  mITT  and ITT Failure subjects.

Individual device /procedure  related SAEs at 7 -days will be analyzed by event frequenc ies and 
proportions of subjects. Total and individual non -serious, device/procedure related A Es at 30 -
days will also be analyzed by event frequencies and proportion of subjects. Adverse events will 
be analyzed in terms of their severity, action taken, and duration to resolution.  
 Device Deficiency Reports will be analyzed for frequencies of safety events and proportion of 
subjects as part of the safety analyses.
 
 All AEs and SAEs will be tabulated with the number of events and subjects with event for each 
event type and overall. Th e rate of all AEs and SAEs reported in the study will be reported as 
well as the rates at  7 and 30 days.  AEs and SAEs will also be summarized by relatedness  and 
severity . Adverse events leading to death or study discontinuation will be provided in listing 
format.  Rates will be reported as the number of subjects who experience at least one event 
during the analysis interval out of the total number of subjects with follow- up to the beginning 
of the analysis interval.  
 
5.6.4 Observational Effectiveness Endpoint  
The observational effectiveness endpoint, defined as  the proportion of m ITT subjects free from 
recurrence of typical CTI dependent atrial flutter OFF  Class I/III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) at 
30-days post index procedure measured by a 24 -hour continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) 
monitor, will be reported with 95% Clopper -Pearson  Exact confidence intervals.  
 
5.7 Poolability Analyses  
All investigational sites will follow the requirements of a common protocol and standardized data collection procedures and forms. The primary endpoints will be presented separately for each site using descriptive statistics. Poolability of the primary endpoints across investigational sites will be evaluated using a logistic regression model with fixed effect  for site .  If the  p-value  
for the site effect is below 0.15 , additional exploratory analyses will be performed to 
understand any variations in outcomes by site. Assessment of poolability by geography (US vs. OUS) will also be performed as described for  site.

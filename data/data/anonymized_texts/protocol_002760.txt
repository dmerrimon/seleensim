PROTOCOL  SD-809-C-16 
TITLE An Open-Label, Long Term Safety Study o f SD-809 ER in Subjects With Chorea 
Associated With Huntington Disease  
Running Title Alternatives for Reducing Chorea in HD (ARC -HD) 
PHASE 3 (Safety) 
INDICATION  Treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease  
NO. SITES  Approximately 40 
OBJECTIVES  1)Evaluate the safety and tolerability of titration and maintenance therapy with
SD-809 ER
2)Evaluate the safety and tolerability of switching su bjects from tetrabenazine to
SD-809 ER
3)Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of tetrabenazine, SD -809 and their respective α - and
β-HTBZ metabolites in subjects switching from tetrabenazine to SD -809 ER
STUDY 
POPULATION  Approximately 116 male and female adul t subjects with manifest Huntington disease 
(HD) who are receiving approved doses of tetrabenazine for treatment of chorea ( approx. 
36) or have successfully completed the SD -809-C-15 efficacy study (approx. 80) will be
enrolled. 
STUDY DESIGN  
STUDY DESIGN  This is an open-label, single -arm study in which subjects with manifest HD who are 
receiving FDA-approved doses of tetrabenazine1 (TBZ) for the treatment of chorea 
associated with HD  or have successfully completed the SD -809-C-15 efficacy study will 
be invited to participate.  Two groups of subjects will be enrolled into this trial:  
Switch subjects  are those who are currently receiving stable doses of tetrabenazine for 
treatment of chorea associated with HD and convert to SD -809 ER based on an algorithm 
designed to achieve comparable exposure to total (α+β) -HTBZ metabolites.  
Rollover subjects  are those who have successfully completed Study SD -809-C-15 and 
are continuing on long -term SD-809 ER after a 1-week wash out period.  
Subjects who do not already have a legally authorized representative will undergo an 
independent evaluation by a qualified healt hcare provider to determine their capacity to 
provide informed consent.  Informed consent/assent will be obtained before any study 
procedures are performed. A Research Advance Directive ( See Section 6.12) will be 
obtained from subjects with the ability to self consent.  Subjects rolling over  from the 
SD-809-C-15 study may have capacity assessment/informed consent /assent/research 
advance directive  obtained up to 30 days in advance of subject’s First -HD Week 13 
Visit/ARC -HD Baseline Visit .   
Subjects Switching from Tetrabenazine (Switch):   Subjects who are currently receiving 
an FDA-approved dose of tetrabenazine that is providing a therapeutic bene fit for chorea 
control may be eligible to participate in the study.  Subjects in this cohort will undergo a 
full screening evaluation within 30 days of the Baseline assessment prior to switching to 
SD-809 ER (Schedule of Events A ).  These subjects will be converted from their TBZ 
regimen to an SD -809 ER regimen that is predicted to provide comparable exposure to 
total (α+β) -dihydrotetrabenazine (α - and β-HTBZ).  Subjects will continue taking their 
TBZ regimen through midnight of Day 0 and then direc tly switch to their assigned 
1 The maximum dose of tetrabenazine is 100 mg/day (with a maximum single dose of 37.5 mg), unless the subject has known 
impaired CYP2D6 function, in which case the maximum dose is 50 mg/day with a maximum single dose of 25 mg.

STUDY DESIGN  
(continued)  SD-809 ER regimen the next morning.  The dose of SD -809 ER may be adjusted (upward 
or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day  (each week)  (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a 
total daily dose of 48 mg is reached)  until a dose level that adequately controls chorea  is 
identified , the subject experiences a protocol defined “clinically significant” adverse event 
(defined as related to study medication and either a) moderate or severe in intensity or b) 
meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event [SAE])1, or the maximal allowable dose is 
reached.  If a subject experiences a “clinically significant” AE attributable to SD -809 ER, 
the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary.  The 
investigator,  in consultation with the subject and caregiver, will determine when an 
adequate level of chorea control has been achieved.  Subjects will have a clinic visit at 
Week 1 and a telephone contact at Week 2, in order to evaluate safety and establish an 
optimal dose.  Although s ubjects will enter the Long term treatment period after Week 2 , 
dose adjustment (upward or downward) may continue through Week 4 to optimize dose 
level.  Additional dose adjustments may be made after Week 4 if clinically indicated.  
Subjects Enrolled from the SD -809-C-15 Study (Rollover):   Subjects who have 
successfully completed Study SD -809-C-15 may be eligible to rollover directly into this 
study after they complete a one week washout and the Week 13 evaluation of Study 
SD-809-C-15.  To reduce subject burden, after obtaining  capacity assessment (if 
necessary)/ informed consent/assent  and Research Advance Directive (if applicable) , some 
data collected in the SD-809-C-15 study will be utilized in the SD -809-C-16 study and 
will provide some of the baseline data for SD -809-C-16 (See Schedule of Events B) .  In 
addition to assessments completed for the SD -809-C-15 Week 13 visit , evaluations 
required as part of the SD -809-C-16 study will be completed on the same day  as the Week 
13 visit. All subjects are expected to rollover to SD -809-C-16 at the Week 13 visit of SD -
809-C-15.   
As Rollover subjects will have discontinued study drug (SD-809 ER or placebo) for 1 
week at completion of the SD -809-C-15 study they will undergo titration on SD -809 ER.  
During titration, the investigator, in consultation with the subject and caregiver, will 
determine when an adequate level of chorea control has  been achieved.  The dose of 
SD-809 ER may be adjusted (upward or downward), in increments of 6 mg per day  (each 
week) (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached) , until there is 
adequate control of chorea , the subject experiences a protocol defined “clinically 
significant” adverse event (defined as related to study medication and either a) moderate 
or severe in intensity or b) meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event [SAE ])1, or the 
maximal allowable dose is reached.   If a subject experiences a “clinically s ignificant” AE 
attributable to SD -809 ER, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or 
suspension is necessary.  Subjects will have a telephone contact at Week 1 and a clinic 
visit at Week 2 , in order to evaluate safety and establish a dose of st udy drug that 
adequately control s chorea and is well -tolerated.  Although subjects will enter the long 
term treatment period after Week 2 , titration may  continue through Week 8 to optimize 
dose level .  Additional dose adjustments may be made after week 8 if clinically indicated.  
 
Long-Term Treatment P eriod: During long term treatment, all subjects will be 
contacted by telephone at Week 3 (the first week of Long -Term Treatment Period) and 
will return to the clinic at Weeks 4, 8, 15, 28  and every 13 weeks th ereafter for evaluation 
of safety and chorea control .  Rollover subjects will have an additional telephone contact 
at Week 5. Switch subjects will have an additional telephone contact at Week 7 , to remind 
subjects to complete diary card before the Week 8 visit .  Subjects who have not achieved

Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 5 a dose level that adequately controls chorea and is well tolerated  by the Week 4 visit 
(Switch subjects) or Week 5 telephone contact (Rollover subjects) sho uld have 
unscheduled visits or telephone contacts in order to further adjust their dose upward or 
downward.  Site interactions for dose adjustment should alternate between telephone 
contacts and clinic visits.  During long -term treatment,  further dose adju stments of 
SD-809 ER may be made, if necessary, but not more often than weekly.  Dose 
adjustments should be based on all available information including the subject’s and 
caregiver’s reports of adverse events and chorea control,  as well as  information from  
rating scales and safety evaluations , when available . Long term treatment will continue 
until SD-809 ER becomes commercially available in the U.S. 
Post-Treatment Safety Follow Up:   All subjects will discontinue study drug at the End 
of Treatment visit and return for their final clinic visit one week later  for evaluation of 
safety, chorea and motor function.  During this one week washout, subjects should not 
take prohibited concomitant medications.  Subjects will also have a follow up telephone 
contact four weeks after their last dose of study drug, to evaluate adverse events and 
concomitant medication usage.  
PK Sub-Study (Switch subjects only) :  A sub-study will be conducted to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of tetrabenazine and SD -809 ER in Sw itch subjects.  
Approximately 12 subjects will have rich PK sampling and approximately 24 subjects will 
have sparse PK sampling (See PK section of synopsis).  The PK of tetrabenazine and 
metabolites will be assessed at the Baseline visit and the PK of SD -809 and metabolites 
will be assessed at the Week 8 visit.  If a subject requires a dose change at Week 8, the 
Week 8 visit assessments should be conducted except for PK sampling which should be 
postponed  until Week 15 . 
FORMULATION  SD-809 extended release (ER) tablets will be provided i n dose strengths of 6, 9 and 
12 mg.  Each dose strength will have a marking of SD 6, SD 9 and SD 12, corresponding 
to the dose strength and a distinct color:  6 mg - purple; 9 mg - blue; 12 mg - beige. 
 During dose adjustment /titration, SD-809 ER will be supplied in weekly blister cards.   
 Once the investigator determines that a stable dose has been reached, SD -809 ER will 
be supplied in 30 count containers .

 The dose of SD -809 ER may be adjusted (upward or downward) in increments of 
6 mg per day  (each week)  (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after  a total daily dose of 48 mg is 
reached) until a dose level that adequately controls chorea is identified,  the subject 
experiences a protocol defined “clinically significant” adverse event (defined as 
related to study medication and either a) moderate or severe in intensity or b) m eets 
the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event [SAE])1; or the maximal allowable dose is 
reached.  If a subject experiences a “clinically significant” AE attributable to SD -809 
ER, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary.   
Rollover Subjects : 
 The starting dose will be SD -809 ER 6 mg in the AM, regardless of previou s 
treatment in the SD -809-C-15 trial.  Prior treatment assignment from Study SD-809-
C-15 will remain blinded.  
 During the titration period, the dose of SD -809 ER may be increased or decreased on 
a weekly basis in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 m g/day after a total 
daily dose of 48 mg is reached ) until there is adequate control of chorea; the subject 
experiences a protocol defined “clinically significant” adverse event (defined as 
related to study medication and either a) moderate or severe in int ensity or b) meets 
the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event [SAE])1; or the maximal allowable dose is 
reached.   If a subject experiences a “clinically significant” AE attributable to SD -809 
ER, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspen sion is necessary.     
Long term Treatment : 
For all subjects d uring the long -term treatment period, the dose of SD -809 ER may be 
adjusted (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day  (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day 
after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached) , if necessary, to optimize chorea control while 
minimizing adverse events.  However, such changes in dose may not occur more 
frequently than once per week.

 A pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study will be conducted in subjects switching  from TBZ to 
SD-809 ER.  Blood samples will be obtained for measurement of plasma concentrations 
of SD-809, tetrabenazine and their respective  α-HTBZ, β-HTBZ, total (α+β) -HTBZ and 
other met abolites, as required.  Approximately one third of the PK sub-study population 
will have rich samples drawn and the remaining two thirds will have sparse sampling.  
The rich sampling cohort should be enrolled first .  Subjects who are unable or unwilling 
to participate in the  rich sampling cohort may be assigned to the sparse sampling cohort . 
Blood samples will be collected at Baseline (on tetrabenazine) and at Week 8 (on SD-809 
ER) as follows:  
Cohort Visit Day 0 (TBZ)  Week 8* (SD-809 ER) 
Rich Sampling 
(N=12) Morning 
only Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2 and 
6 hours post -dose Pre-dose, 1.5, 2.5, 4 
and 6 hours post -dose 
Sparse 
Sampling 
(N=24) Morning Pre-dose and 1 -2 
hours post -dose Pre-dose and 2 -4 hours 
post-dose  
Afternoon  1st sample during the 
visit and 2nd at least 1 
hr† afterward  1st sample during the 
visit and 2nd at least 2 
hrs† afterward  
* If a subject requires a dose change at Week 8, the Week 8 visit assessments should be conducted except for  
PK sampling which should be postponed until Week 15 . 
† The second PK sample for s parse sampling (afternoon) should be taken as late as possible  
Subjects in the rich sampling cohort must have a morning visit in which the AM dose of 
tetrabenazine or SD -809 ER is administered  in clinic.  Subjects in the sparse sampling 
cohort may have a morning or an afternoon visit.  If sparse sample subjects have a 
morning visit, the AM dose of tetrabenazine or SD -809 ER should be administered  in 
clinic as with the rich sampling cohort.  If the subject is assigned to the rich group at the 
Screening Visit but forgets to hold tetrabenazine dose the morning of the Baseline visit, 
the subject must be re -consented to undergo sparse sampling.  If sparse sampling subjects 
have an afternoon visit, te trabenazine or SD -809 ER should be taken per their usual 
schedule.  At each time point, four (4) mL of blood will be collected into lithium heparin 
tubes and processed to plasma.  After centrifugation, the plasma will be split into 2 
aliquots and stored fr ozen in polypropylene plasma storage tubes at -70°C or below.  
Switch Subjects will be provided  with a diary  at Screening and at Week 4 to record meal 
and dosing times before PK sampling  visits at Baseline and Week 8 .  Prior to clinic visits 
subjects will b e reminded to record the start time of their last meal and the time of their 
last dose in their diary and to bring the diary with them to the clinic visit.     
Subjects in the rich sampling cohort  and those in the sparse sampling cohort who 
have a morning v isit should be reminded not to take their morning dose at home 
prior to their Baseline visit  (tetrabenazine) , and prior to their Week 8 visit  (SD-809 
ER) as it will be administered  in clinic. Morning clinic visits should be scheduled 
early in the day to allow sufficient time for PK blood sampling.  
Subjects who withdraw early from the study should have a single blood sample  collected 
for PK at the Early Termination Visit if the last dose was within the prior 48  hours, if 
possible.  
Subjects experiencing an  SAE should have a single blood sample collected as soon as  
possible after the SAE and within 48 hours for the pharmacokinetics of α - and β-HTBZ, if 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 13 possible. The date and time of the last dose of study medication should be  recorded along 
with the date and  time of the sample collection.  
STATISTICS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Safety: 
Safety data will be summarized descriptively for the overall population and based on prior 
treatment [SD-809 ER or placebo (Rollover subjects) or tetrabenazine (Switch subjects)].  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative data and frequency counts and 
percentages will be provided for categorical data.  The nature, frequency, and severity of 
adverse events will be tabulated for all subjects combined and by  prior treatment.  
Baseline, within study, end of study, and change -from-baseline values for clinical 
laboratory evaluations and vital signs will be summarized as appropriate.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events and laboratory, vital sign, and ECG parameters will 
be summarized.  I n addition, change from baseline will be summarized for laboratory and 
vital sign parameters.  Shift tables will be provided for clinical laboratory results.  ECG 
results will be classified as normal and abnormal and summarized . 
Descriptive statistics of c hange-from-baseline for Rollover subjects will utilize the 
Baseline from Study SD -809-C-15 (C-15 Baseline) and the Baseline from the present 
study (C-16 Baseline), as appropriate, and will be specified in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.    
Pharmacokinetics:  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using data from all subjects 
switching from TBZ to SD -809 ER in this study together with data obtained from subjects 
in Study SD -809-C-15 to examine the pharmacokinetics of SD -809 and TBZ and to 
explore the potential effect of various covariates on the p harmacokinetics of SD -809 and 
TBZ.  The population pharmacokinetic analysis will be discussed in detail in a 
prospective Statistical Analysis Plan.

Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 28 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Disease Background 
Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disorder characterized 
by progressive motor, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms that cause profound disability.  The 
adult onset form of HD typically manifests between 35 and 40 years of age.  Progression of the 
disease is slow and inexorable, with death ensuing approximately 10 to 20 years after onset of 
the first motor symptoms.  The worldwide prevalence of HD is estimated to be 5-10 cases per 
100,000 persons.  
Histopathologically, HD is characterized by progressive loss of medium spiny neurons in the 
striatum and to a lesser extent of pyramidal neurons in the cortex.  The disease is due to a 
mutation in the polyglutamine repeat sequence in the huntingtin  gene located on Chromosome 4.   
The most commonly recognized motor sign of HD is  the involuntary movement chorea, which 
can affect all muscle groups.  Chorea has the potential to interfere with daily functioning.  In its 
early stages, chorea can contribute to impaired  speaking, writing, and Activities of Daily Living 
(ADLs) such as feeding, dressing and bathing.  In its later stages, chorea can cause gait 
instability and poor postural control, with an increased risk of injury from falling or flailing into 
objects. 
Both preclinical studies in transgenic mice and clinical experience in patients with a genetic 
predisposition to HD implicate a relative excess of dopamine in the pathogenesis of these 
involuntary movements.  These observations led to the development of tetrabenazine, which 
depletes presynaptic dopamine, as a treatment for chorea associated with Huntington disease. 
1.2 Tetrabenazine 
Tetrabenazine is approved in the United States (US), Canada and several European Union ( EU) 
countries as a therapy for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD).  
Tetrabenazine is rapidly and extensively converted in the liver by carbonyl reductase to alpha-
dihydrotetrabenazine (α-HTBZ) and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (β-HTBZ).  These metabolites 
are potent and selective inhibitors of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT)-2, resulting in 
reduced storage and release of presynaptic dopamine, and are responsible for mediating the in 
vivo efficacy of orally administered tetrabenazine. 
Details on the previous experience with tetrabenazine in patients with Huntington disease can be 
found in the SD-809 ER Investigator’s Brochure (IB), which includes the tetrabenazine 
prescribing information. 
Limitations of the Current Commercial Product 
The commercial form of tetrabenazine (Xenazine®, Nitoman®) is an immediate release 
formulation.  While generally effective in the treatment of chorea, tetrabenazine has limitations 
for use in Huntington disease patients, including: 
 High peak concentrations of the active metabolites.  Clinical experience in patients, and 
Phase 1 data in healthy volunteers, indicate that important adverse events of 
tetrabenazine, such as somnolence, akathisia, and anxiety are often associated with peak 
concentration after dosing.   
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 29  Short half -lives of the active metabolites and the attendant requirement to dose the 
immediate release formulation frequently.  The rapid decline in plasma concentrations 
may lead to loss of efficacy at the end of the dosing interval.  The fluctuation in plasma 
concentration, as indicated by high peak concentrations and low trough concentrations, 
necessitates more frequent dosing.  Therefore, many patients must take tetrabenazine 
three times a day due to the short half-lives of the active metabolites, α-HTBZ and 
β-HTBZ.  A less frequent dosing schedule is preferred as it may improve medication 
compliance.   
 The active metabolites α- and β-HTBZ are either primarily (α) or exclusively (β) 
metaboli
zed by CYP2D6.  Polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene necessitate genotyping to 
prevent poor metabolizers from significantly greater exposure to the active drug moiety 
than extensive metabolizers.     
To address the limitations of commercial tetrabenazine, Auspex has developed a deuterated 
analogue of tetrabenazine (referred to as SD-809) which, due to the deuteration, is eliminated 
more
 slowly than tetrabenazine (See below). It is also administered in an extended release 
formulation.  As outlined in Section 1.4 and the Investigator’s Brochure, SD-809 extended 
release (ER) has been shown to reduce plasma fluctuation and dosing frequency and thus, has the 
potential to improve overall tolerability as compared to tetrabenazine. 
1.3 Deuterium 
Deuterium (D) is a naturally-occurring, non-radioactive stable isotope of hydrogen (H) which, 
due to the presence of a neutron, has twice the mass as H.  Deuterium has a natural abundance of 
approximately 0.0156% of all H atoms ( 1).  The adult male body contains approximately 57% 
water (2), the major source of H in the body ( 3).  A 70 kilo gram (Kg) male contains 
approximately 39,900g of water of which 0.0156% or 6.22g is D 2O, yielding a naturally-
occurring body content of 1.24g of deuterium.  
Small molecule drugs have been developed in which carbon (C)-H bonds have been replaced 
with C-D bonds ( 4).  The increased mass of deuterium in the C-D bond in small molecule drugs 
requires more energy for cleavage by cytochrome P 450 (CYP450) enzymes as compared to the 
corresponding C-H bond, a phenomenon known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect ( 1).  
Replacing H with D at a C-H bond in a molecule has the potential to attenuate its metabolism if 
that C-H bond is the site of rate limiting cleavage by a CYP isozyme.  By attenuating metabolism 
in this manner,  area under the curve ( AUC), maximum concentration (C max), and half-life may all 
be increased relative to the non-deuterated molecule ( 4).  
The presence of D in the C-D bonds of small molecule drugs does not pose a unique safety risk.  
The C-D bond is more stable than the C-H bond and as such, D is not readily subject to exchange 
with H in H 20 or in other organic materials ( 4). The shape and surface charge of small molecule 
drugs is defined by the electron cloud of the component atoms.  The surface charge and spatial 
characteristics of deuterated drugs are thought to be biologically indistinguishable from their 
non-deuterated forms ( 5, 6).  As a consequence, deuterium-substituted small molecule drugs and 
their non-deuterated forms are not likely to be physiologically different in their binding to 
macromolecular structures such as receptors, transporters, enzymes, or ion channels.   
1.3.1 Clinical Experience with Deuterium 
A number of studies in healthy volunteers and patients have evaluated the effects of acute and 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 30 long term use of deuterated water (D 2O).  Acute exposures of to up to 23% D replacement in 
plasma were tolerated without reported adverse events ( 7).  In several metabolic labeling studies 
healthy subjects consumed daily doses of up to 9.8g D in the form of D 2O for up to 4-9 weeks, 
treatments sufficient to maintain 1.0– 2.0% D enrichment in body water.  No adverse events were 
reported in these studies ( 8-12).  Deuterium has also been delivered to humans in the form of 
D-substituted glucose.  Twenty-five subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 10 
control subjects were infused intravenously over 48 hours with up to 200 g of [6,6-d2]-glucose, 
an amount which corresponds to 4.4 g of deuterium.  These infusions were not associated with 
adverse events ( 13).  
1.4 SD-809 (d 6-Tetrabenazine) 
SD-809 is a deuterated analog of tetrabenazine in which the two O-linked methyl groups (CH 3) 
of the tetr
abenazine molecule have been replaced by two trideuteromethyl groups (CD 3).  The 
conversion of SD-809 and tetrabenazine to their active metabolites,  α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ, 
proceeds similarly in human liver S9 fraction and in human liver microsomes.  The CD 3 groups 
in SD-809, which are conserved in α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ, attenuate the metabolism of these 
active metabolites by CYP2D6 relative to the non-deuterated metabolites from tetrabenazine, 
leading to longer in vitro  half-lives in human liver microsomes, human liver S9 fraction and in 
cells transfected with CYP2D6.  These pharmacokinetic benefits have been confirmed in a 
clinical setting and enable less frequent dosing and reduced  the plasma fluctuation of the active 
metabolites.  Furthermore, the attenuated metabolism achieved through deuteration reduces the 
impact of CYP2D6 genotype on exposure as compared to tetrabenazine, with the potential to 
simplify dosing. 
The safety and pharmacokinetics of oral SD-809 have been evaluated in five Phase 1 studies in 
healthy adult volunteers.  Single doses of SD-809 (either as an immediate-release or as an 
extended-release [ER] formulation) have been administered to 130 subjects at doses ranging 
from 7.5 to 24 mg, either alone or in conjunction with CYP2D6 inhibition.  Multiple dose 
regimens of the ER formulation have also been administered to 24 of those subjects for up to 5 
days (at doses up to 22.5 mg twice daily [BID] for 3 days).   
For all studies, plasma concentrations of parent drug were low and sporadic because of the rapid 
and extensive hepatic metabolism of SD-809 to the active metabolites d 6-αHTBZ and d 6-β-
HTBZ.  Peak plasma concentrations of the active moieties d 6-α-HTBZ and d 6-β-HTBZ were 
reached within 1 to 1½ hours post-dosing following administration of an immediate release 
formulation.  Peak plasma concentrations were significantly later (median t max 3 to 4 hours) and 
lower for the ER formulation without a comparable loss of exposure.  In all studies where 
tetrabenazine was included as a control arm, deuteration was shown to significantly prolong the 
half-lives of both α - and β-HTBZ,  resulting in an increase in exposure (~130% increase) for 
both active metabolites at comparable doses.  Based on the pharmacokinetics over a dose range 
of 7.5-
22.5 mg SD-809 ER, it is estimated that a 6 mg dose of SD-809 will provide an exposure 
(AUC(inf)) comparable to 12.5 mg of tetrabenazine.   Inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism by 
paroxetine administration led to a 3-fold increase in bioavailability of d 6-(α+β)-HTBZ, 
comparatively less than has been reported with in a similar drug interaction study with 
tetrabenazine. 
To date, five Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers have been conducted with SD-809, including 
two with an immediate release formulation (powder in capsule) (AUS- SD-809-CTP-06, SD-809-
C-12) and three with extended release formulations (AUS- SD-809-CTP-07 Part 1 and Part 2 and 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 31 SD-809-C-08, SD-809-C-11).  In total, 100 subjects have received single doses of SD-809 or 
SD-809 ER, ra
nging from 7.5 to 22.5 mg and 24 subjects have received repeated doses of 
SD-809 ER for up to 5 days at 22.5 mg BID.  In these studies, no SAEs were reported and all 
AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.  Commonly reported AEs included headache, 
somnolence, nausea, dizziness and vessel puncture reaction.  When tetrabenazine was used as a 
comparator, the adverse events of SD-809 were qualitatively similar to tetrabenazine.  The 
adverse events reported with SD-809 were also consistent with prior clinical experience with 
tetrabenazine. 
Additional information on the study results may be found in the SD-809 ER Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
A well controlled study of SD-809 ER is presently being conducted in subjects with chorea 
associated with HD (Study SD-809 -C-15:  A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled 
Study of SD-809 Extended Release for the Treatment of Chorea associated with Huntington 
Disease).  Subjects who successfully complete Study SD-809-C-15 are candidates to participate 
in this open label safety study.  In addition, subjects on stable, FDA-approved doses of TBZ will 
also be considered for this study .  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are:  
1. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of titration and maintenance therapy with SD-809 ER 
2. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of switching subjects from tetrabenazine to 
SD-809 ER 
3. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of tetrabenazine, SD-809 and their respective α- and 
β-HTBZ metabolites in subjects switching from tetrabenazine to SD-809 ER 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
This is an open -label, single-arm study designed to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability 
of SD-809 ER dose adjustments/titrations for the treatment of chorea associated with HD over 
long term treatment.  Approximately 116 subjects who are receiving FDA-approved doses of 
tetrabenazine for treatment of chorea (approx. 36) or have successfully completed the SD-809 -C-
15 efficacy study (approx. 80) will be enrolled.  The study will be conducted at approximately 40 
centers in the U.S.,  Canada, and Australia.  The study is divided into a screening period, a dose 
adjustment/titration period, a long term treatment period and a post-treatment safety follow up 
period.  Overall study participation will continue until SD-809 ER becomes commercially 
available in the U.S.  
3.1 Study Design 
This is an open-label, single-arm study in which subjects with manifest HD who are receiving 
FDA-approved doses of tetrabenazine1 for treatment of chorea associated with HD or have 
successfully completed the SD-809 -C-15 efficacy study will be invited to participate.  Successful 
completion of Study SD-809 -C-15 is defined as (1) study participation through Week 13 (2) the 
                                                 
1 The maximum dose of tetrabenazine is 100 mg/day (with a maximum single dose of 37.5 mg), unless the subject has known 
impaired CYP2D6 function, in which case the maximum dose is 50 mg/day with a maximum single dose of 25 mg.

Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 32 subject has generally been compliant with study medication and procedures, in the opinion of the 
investigator and (3) the subject has no ongoing adverse events that that are serious (SAE)1, 
severe in intensity or are expected to interfere with safety evaluations in this study. Two groups 
of subjects will be enrolled into this trial:  
Switch subjects  are those who are currently receiving stable doses of tetrabenazine for treatment 
of chorea associated with HD and convert to SD -809 ER based on an algorithm designed to 
achieve comparable exposure to total (α+β)-HTBZ metabolites. 
Rollover subjects are those who have successfully completed Study SD-809-C-15 and may be 
e
ligible to continue on long-term SD -809 ER after a 1-week wash out period.  
S
ubjects who do not already have a legally authorized representative will undergo an 
independent evaluation by a qualified healthcare provider to determine their capacity to provide 
informed consent prior to consent/assent process.  Informed consent/assent will be obtained 
before any study procedures are performed.  A Research Advance Directive (See Section 6.12) 
will be obtained from subjects with the ability to self consent.  Subjects rolling over from the 
SD-809-C-15 study may have capacity assessment (if necessary)/informed consent/assent and 
R
esearch Advance Directive (if applicable) (See Section 6.12) obtained up to 30 days in advance 
of subject’s First-HD Week 13 Visit/ARC-HD Baseline Visit. Subjects who meet the selection 
criteria will be eligible to participate.  
Subjects Switching from Tetrabenazine (Switch):   Subjects who are currently receiving an 
FDA approved dose of tetrabenazine (TBZ ) that is providing a therapeutic benefit for chorea 
control associated with HD will be eligible to participate in the study.  Subjects in this cohort 
will undergo a full screening evaluation within 30 days of the Baseline assessment prior to 
switching to SD-809 ER.  See Schedule of Events A.  These subjects will be converted from 
their TBZ regimen to an SD-809 ER regimen that is predicted to provide comparable exposure to 
total (α+β)-dihydrotetrabenazine (α- and β-HTBZ).  Subjects will continue taking their TBZ 
regimen through midnight of Day 0 and then directly switch to their assigned SD-809 ER 
regimen the next morning.  The dose of SD-809 ER may be adjusted weekly (upward or 
downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 
mg is reached) to identify a dose level that adequately controls chorea, the subject experiences a 
protocol defined “clinically significant” adverse event (defined as related to study medication 
and either a) moderate or severe in intensity or b) meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event 
[SAE])1; or the maximal allowable dose is reached.  If a subject experiences a “clinically 
significant” AE attributable to SD-809 ER, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or 
suspension is necessary.  The investigator, in consultation with the subject and caregiver, will 
determine when an adequate level of chorea control has been achieved.  Subjects will have a 
clinic visit at Week 1 and a telephone contact at Week 2, in order to evaluate safety and establish 
an optimal dose.  Although subjects will enter the Long term treatment period after Week 2, dose 
adjustment (upward or downward) may continue through Week 4 to optimize dose level.  
Additional dose adjustments may be made after Week 4 if clinically indicated. 
Subjects Enrolled from the SD-809 -C-15 Study (Rollover):   Subjects who have successfully 
completed Study SD-809-C-15 may be eligible to rollover directly into this study after they 
complete a one week washout and the Week 13 evaluation of Study SD-809-C-15.  To reduce 
subject burden, after obtaining capacity assessment (if applicable)/informed consent/assent and

Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 33 Research Advance Directive (if applicable), some data collected in the SD-809-C-15 study will 
be utilized in the SD-809-C-16 study and will provide some of the baseline data for SD-809-C-
16 (See Schedule of Events B).  In addition to assessments completed for the SD-809-C-15 
Week 13 visit, evaluations required as part of the SD-809-C-16 study will be completed on the 
same day as the Week 13 visit. All subjects are expected to rollover to SD-809-C-16 at the Week 
13 visit of SD-809-C-15. 
As Rollover subjects will have discontinued study drug (SD-809 ER or placebo) for 1 week at 
completion of the SD-809-C-15 study, they will undergo titration on SD-809 ER.  During 
titration, the investigator, in consultation with the subject and caregiver, will determine when an 
adequate level of chorea control has been achieved.  The dose of SD-809 ER may be adjusted 
(upward or downward), in increments of 6 mg per day (each week) (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after 
a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached), until there is adequate control of chorea; the subject 
experiences a protocol defined “clinically significant” adverse event (defined as related to study 
medication and either a) moderate or severe in intensity or b) meets the criteria for a Serious 
Adverse Event [SAE])1, or the maximal allowable dose is reached.  If a subject experiences a 
“clinically significant” AE attributable to SD-809 ER, the investigator will determine if a dose 
reduction or suspension is necessary.  Subjects will have a telephone contact at Week 1 and a 
clinic visit at Week 2, in order to evaluate safety and establish a dose of study drug that 
adequately controls chorea and is well-tolerated.  Although subjects will enter the Long term 
treatment period after Week 2, titration may continue through Week 8 to optimize dose level.  
Additional dose adjustments may be made after Week 8 if clinically indicated. 
Long-Term Treatment Period:  During long term treatment, all subjects will be contacted by 
telephone at Week 3 (the first week of Long-term treatment period) and will return to the clinic 
on Weeks 4, 8, 15, 28 and every 13 weeks thereafter for evaluation of safety and chorea control.  
Switch subjects will have an additional telephone contact at Week 7.  Rollover subjects will have 
an additional telephone contact at Week 5.  Subjects who have not achieved a stable dose by the 
Week 4 visit (Switch subjects) or Week 5 telephone contact (Rollover subjects)  may have 
unscheduled visits or telephone contacts in order to further adjust their dose upward or 
downward.  Site interactions for dose adjustment should alternate between telephone contacts 
and clinic visits.  During long-term treatment, further dose adjustments of SD-809 ER may be 
made, if necessary, but not more often than weekly.  Dose adjustments should be based on all 
available information including the subject’s and caregiver’s reports of adverse events and 
chorea control, information from rating scales and all safety evaluations.  Long term treatment 
will continue until SD-809 ER becomes commercially available in the U.S. 
Post-Treatment Safety Follow Up:  All subjects will discontinue study drug at the End of 
Treatment visit and return for their final clinic visit one week later for evaluation of safety, 
cognition, behavior, chorea and motor function.  During this one week washout, subjects should 
not take prohibited concomitant medications.  After the one week washout is complete, 
concomitant medication use is per the discretion of the investigator.  Subjects will also have a 
follow up telephone contact four weeks after their last dose of study drug, to evaluate adverse 
events and concomitant medication usage. 
PK Sub-Study:   A sub-study will be conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
tetrabenazine and SD-809 ER in Switch subjects.  Approximately 12 subjects will have rich PK 
sampling and approximately 24 subjects will have sparse PK sampling (See Section 6.8).  The

Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 34 PK of tetrabenazine and metabolites will be assessed at the Baseline visit and the PK of SD-809 
ER and metabolites will be assessed at the Week 8 visit.   If a subject requires a dose change at 
Week 8, the Week 8 visit assessments should be conducted except for PK sampling which should 
be postponed until Week 15.  
3.2 Rationale for Study Design 
The study is designed to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of SD-809 ER in subjects 
with chorea associated with HD.  Two cohorts of subjects may enter the study: 1) Rollover 
subjects, who successfully complete the well-controlled efficacy study (SD-809-C-15) and 
2) Switch subjects, who are receiving FDA-approved doses of tetrabenazine for treatment of 
chorea.   
Given the two groups of subjects entering this trial have different background therapy at entry; 
identification of their optimal dose will be approached differently.  Rollover subjects from Study 
SD-809-C-15 will have discontinued study medication (SD-809 ER or placebo) for at least one 
week and consequently they will begin dosing at 6 mg/day and titrate to their optimal dose level 
for up to 8 weeks.  In contrast, Switch subjects will be on a stable dose of TBZ at entry and will 
make a direct conversion to SD-809 ER overnight based on their incoming TBZ regimen.  As 
such, Switch subjects should reach their target dose more rapidly and they are allowed up to 4 
weeks to adjust their SD-809 ER regimen after conversion.  Although the time to reach an 
optimal dose may differ between these cohorts, both groups are expected to reach a 
pharmacologically active dose by two weeks:  Rollover subjects would be at 12 mg/day, unless 
they experienced adverse events or adequate chorea control; and Switch subjects would have 
converted to a dose level that p rovides comparable exposure to their incoming tetrabenazine 
dose, with one intervening visit to evaluate/adjust dose level.  Accordingly, the long term period 
of the study will be deemed to have started after two weeks of treatment even though dose 
adjustment may continue after this point. 
For both Rollover and Switch subjects, the SD -809 ER dose level should be adjusted in order to 
identify a dose that reduces chorea and is well-tolerated.  In addition to the assessments of chorea 
control and tolerability by the subject, caregiver and study staff, safety evaluations that target 
adverse events observed in the drug class (e.g., akathisia), will be employed and considered in 
the dose adjustment decision.  In this manner, the daily dose of study drug for treating chorea is 
determined individually for each subject.  Once adequate control of chorea has been achieved, 
the dose of study drug should not be increased further.  In general, subjects will continue the 
dose established during titration into the long term treatment period, but dose adjustments 
(upward or downward) are permitted so long as they do not occur more often than once per 
week. 
To convert Switch subjects from stable doses of tetrabenazine to an effective dose of SD-
809 ER, extensive Phase 1 work has been conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 
both drugs and their active metabolites [total (α+β)-HTBZ].  These data allowed construction of 
a pharmacokinetic model that permitted calculation of the plasma exposure associated with 
various tetrabenazine and SD-809 ER regimens.  Based on a subject’s incoming tetrabenazine 
regimen, an initial SD-809 ER regimen will be identified that provides comparable exposure 
(AUC) to total (α+β)-HTBZ with reduced peak concentrations.  Following conversion, subjects 
will have clinic visits at Weeks 1 and 4 and telephone contacts at Weeks 2 and 3 to optimize 
dose level.  
Rollover subjects will begin treatment at the lowest SD-809 ER dose of 6 mg/day and undergo 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 35 titration/evaluation on a weekly basis for chorea control, adverse events, and possible dose 
adjustment.  Subjects will have clinic visits at Weeks 2 and 4 and telephone contacts at Weeks 1, 
3, and 5 to optimize dose level. 
The
 present investigation is an open label safety study of long term treatment with SD-809 ER at 
a pharmacologically active dose and will enroll subjects with chorea associated with HD who 
were either previously exposed to SD-809 ER  or placebo (from Study SD-809-C-15, First- HD); 
or who are switching directly from TBZ to SD-809 ER.  It is, therefore, adequate to characterize 
the safety and tolerability of titration and maintenance therapy with SD-809 ER in the target 
population.   
The U.S. prescribing information for tetrabenazine indicates that CYP2D6 genotyping should be 
performed at dose levels higher than 50 mg , although genotyping is often not performed in 
clinical practice as the drug is titrated.  In the present study, CYP2D6 genotyping will be 
performed in a blinded manner to allow evaluation of the effect of phenotype on safety 
parameters at the conclusion of the study. 
3.3 Rationale for Dose Selection 
As with tetrabenazine, SD-809 ER treatment will be individualized, and, therefore fixed doses 
will not be evaluated in the study.  The starting dose of 6 mg of SD-809 ER provides an AUC of 
total (α+β)-HTBZ that is comparable to the 12.5 mg starting dose of tetrabenazine, but with a 
lower peak concentration and higher trough concentration.  The dose level of SD-809 ER 
treatment will be evaluated on a weekly basis during the titration/dose adjustment period, based 
on assessments of chorea control and adverse events, in order to determine if dose adjustment is 
needed.  This approach is consistent with the tetrabenazine prescribing information.   
Dose adjustments should occur in increments of 6 mg/day (each week) (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day 
after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached).  Dose reductions in increments greater than 6 mg 
should be reviewed with the Clinical Monitor (See Section 5.2.5).   
The maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER is 72 mg  per day, unless the subject is receiving a 
strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, See Appendix 11), in which case the maximum total 
daily dose is 42 mg.

5 STUDY TREATMENT  
The study medication to be used in this trial is an extended release (ER) formulation of SD-
809.  Three dose strengths of SD-809 ER will be available for use: 6, 9, and 12 mg tablets.  Each 
dose strength will have a black marking of SD 6, SD 9 or SD 12, corresponding to the dose 
strength and a distinct tablet color:  6 mg - purple; 9 mg - blue; 12 mg - beige.     
5.1 Investigational Product 
The investigational product is a matrix formulation and is designed as a gastro-erosional, 
extended release tablet to be administered with food.   Study drug is coated with a colored 
polymer coating to aid in swallowing.  The colored polymer coating is applied to the tablets 
according to dose strength; 6 mg - purple; 9 mg - blue; 12 mg - beige.  Each dose strength will 
have a black marking of SD 6, SD 9 or SD 12, corresponding to the dose strength.  SD -809 ER 
tablets have been manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations.  
During titration/dose adjustment, SD-809 ER tablets will be supplied in weekly blister packs as 
6, 9, and/or 12 mg tablets and will be labeled according to applicable regulatory guidelines.  
Each blister pack will contain a sufficient supply of drug until the next specified visit, plus 
overage to account for potential delays in study visits or evaluations or receipt of their supplies. 
Once the investigator determines that a stable dose has been reached, SD-809 ER will be 
supplied in 30 count containers and labeled according to applicable regulatory guidelines. 
Complete details regarding SD-809 ER supply, dispensing and ordering will be provided in the 
study Operations Manual. 
SD-809 ER tablets must be stored in a secure area with access limited to authorized staff, 
protected from light at controlled room temperature, 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). 
5.2 Treatment Regimen 
5.2.1 General Guidelines 
The following general guidance applies to treatment regimens for all subjects in the study: 
 All treatment regimens will be administered with meals  
 A daily dose of 6 mg will be given once a day in the morning and daily doses of 12 mg and 
higher will be administered twice daily, approximately 10 hours apart during the day. 
 The maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER is 72 mg (36  mg BID), unless the subject is 
receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (See Appendix 11 ), in which case the maximum total 
daily dose is 42 mg  
o Individual doses up to and including 12 mg are given as a single tablet 
o Individual doses of 15 to 24 mg will be given as two tablets 
o Individual doses of 27 to 36 mg will be given as three tablets 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 40  Dose adjustments are limited to 6 mg/day (each week) (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total 
dail
y dose of 48 mg is reached).  Dose reductions in increments greater than 6 mg should be 
reviewed with the Clinical Monitor. (See Section 5.2.5)   
 If a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is started (i.e., paroxetine, fluoxetine, bupropion), the Clinical 
Monitor should be notified as a dose reduction of more than 6 mg may be required.  
5.2.2 Dosing in Switch Subjects 
For Switch subjects, the initial SD-809 ER dosing regimen will be based on the subject’s 
incoming total daily dose of tetrabenazine.  As outlined in Table 1 and Appendix 14, an initial 
dosing regimen of SD-809 ER will be assigned which targets a steady state AUC of total (α+β)-
HTBZ that is comparable to that of the subject’s tetrabenazine regimen ( Table 1). 
After initial dose conversion, the investigator may adjust the dose of SD-809 ER upward or 
downward over the following 4 weeks, if necessary, to a level in which adequate chorea control 
has been achieved and the subject is tolerating the treatment regimen.  Changes in dose should 
not be made more often than once per week unless the subject is experiencing an intolerable 
adverse event. 
Once adequate control of chorea has been achieved, the dose of study drug should not be 
increased further. 
Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of Phase 1 data were performed to estimate the overall 
systemic exposure (AUC) for various tetrabenazine and SD-809 ER regimens.  Appendix 14 
depicts the values for AUC 0-24 for extensive and intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6.   
Based on the data in Appendix 14 , an initial SD-809 ER regimen has been identified which 
approximates the AUC 0-24 for total (α+β)-HTBZ of the corresponding tetrabenazine total daily 
dose in CYP2D6 extensive and intermediate metabolizers ( Table 1).  Although the median AUCs 
for SD-809 ER are slightly lower than those for the corresponding tetrabenazine regimen, there 
is considerable overlap in the distributions of this parameter.  Subjects with diminished CYP2D6 
function (e.g., poor metabolizers or receiving potent CYP2D6 inhibitors) who undergo dose 
conversion according to Table 1 may have an initial AUC on SD-809 ER that is up to 30-40% 
below that of their tetrabenazine regimen (See Appendix 15).  As with intermediate and 
extensive metabolizers, there is considerable overlap in the distribution of AUCs between 
SD-809 and tetrabenazine in poor metabolizers.  Furthermore, subjects with inadequate control 
of chorea may undergo dose adjustment for the four weeks following initial dose conversion.  
Additional dose adjustments may be made after Week 4 if clinically indicated.

5.2.3 Dosing in Rollover subjects  
The starting dose of SD -809 ER is 6 mg in the morning, regardless of previous treatment in the 
SD-809-C-15 trial.  Treatment assignment (SD-809 ER or placebo) from SD-809-C-15 will 
remain blinded.  Study drug will be titrated over the initial 8 weeks of therapy, if necessary, to 
identify a dose that  provides adequate chorea control and is well tolerated.   Changes in dose 
should not be made more often than once per week unless the subject is experiencing an 
intolerable adverse event.  Additional dose adjustments may be made after week 8 if clinically 
indicated. 
During the titration period, the dose of SD-809 ER may be increased on a weekly basis in 
increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached) 
until there is adequate control of chorea; the subject experiences a protocol defined “clinically 
significant” adverse event (defined as related to study medication and either a) moderate or 
severe in intensity or b) meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event [SAE])1; or the maximal 
allowable dose is reached. If a subject experiences a “clinically significant” AE attributable to 
SD-809, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary.  
Once adequate control of chorea has been achieved, the dose of study drug should not be 
increased further. 
5.2.4 Dosing in Long Term Treatment 
Initially during the long-term treatment period, a well-tolerated dose of SD-809 that provides 
adequate chorea control may not yet be established.  Dose adjustments may continue during long 
term treatment as specified in Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3.  Once a stable dose is achieved, SD-809 
ER should be dosed at the same level throughout the remaining long term period.  If necessary, 
however, the dose may be adjusted further during long term treatment (upward or downward) to 
optimize chorea control or minimize adverse events.  In general, dose changes are limited to 
6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached ; See Section 
5.2.5).  However, such changes in dose should not occur more frequently than once per week. 
Once subjects are on a stable dose of SD-809 ER, drug will be provided to study subjects in 30-
count containers until the next specified visit.  Each order will contain a sufficient supply of drug

Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 42 until the next specified visit, plus overage to account for potential delays in study visits or 
evaluations or receipt of their supplies. 
5.2.5 Dose Reduction or Suspension 
If a subject experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event (defined below)1 that is attributed 
to SD-809 ER, the investigator will use his or her judgment to determine if a dose reduction or 
suspension is necessary.  Dose adjustments should be made based on all available information 
including the subject’s and caregiver’s reports of adverse events and chorea control, the clinical 
assessment of safety and efficacy by the investigator and information from rating scales. 
Dose reductions  should generally occur in increments of 6 mg/day, except in the case of addition 
of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (i.e., paroxetine, fluoxetine, bupropion) or if the most recent dose 
increase was 12 mg/day, in which a greater dose reduction may be required.  Dose reductions in 
this context should be reviewed with the Clinical Monitor.  A dose reduction of 6 mg/day can be 
made by requesting that the next lowest dose level be shipped directly to the subject.  Dose 
reduc
tions greater than 6 mg/day should be reviewed with the Clinical Monitor.  If a subject 
requires a dose reduction based on a telephone contact during the maintenance period, an 
unscheduled clinic visit should be conducted in a timely manner thereafter. 
Suspension  of study medication for up to one week, if warranted, is allowed.   
Suspensions of study medication for adverse events must be reviewed with the Clinical 
Monitor before therapy is restarted .  If study medication is restarted after a suspension for 
an adverse event, a dose reduction of 6 mg or more is permitted. 
Suspensions for more than 7 days must be reviewed by the Clinical Monitor.  If the subject 
restarts study medication within 7 days of suspension, the full dose of SD-809 ER may be 
resumed without titration.  If subject restarts study medication greater than 7 days following a 
suspension,  re-titration will be required.    
The reason for a dose reduction or suspension must be clearly documented.  
5.3 Treatment Administration 
Each tablet should be swallowed whole with water and not broken, crushed or chewed.  Tablets 
should not be taken on an empty stomach. 
Subjects should be instructed to take the investigational product with meals: tablets will be 
administered twice daily with meals in the morning and evening, as indicated on drug packaging.  
It is recommended that BID doses be taken approximately 10 hours apart during the day.  A 
minimum of 6 hours should elapse between doses.  If a subject misses a dose and it is within 
6 hours of their next dose, the missed dose should be skipped.  
5.4 Accountability of Study Drug 
The study drug must be used in accordance with the protocol and only under the direction of the 
Investigator.  All materials supplied are for use only in this clinical study and should not be used 
for any other purpose. 
The Investigator is responsible for study drug accountability, reconciliation, and record 
                                                 
1 See Section 7 for evaluation of AEs regarding severity, relationship to study drug and definition of SAE.  
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 43 maintenance at the investigational site.  In accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements, the Investigator or designated site staff must maintain study drug accountability 
records throughout the course of the study.  This person will document the amount of study drug 
received, dispensed, and disposition of unused study drug. 
A Drug Dispensing/Accountability Log must be kept current and will contain the following 
information: 
 The identification of the subject to whom the drug was dispensed; 
 The date(s) and quantity of the drug dispensed to the subject. 
The inventory must be available for inspection by the Sponsor and/or study monitor during the 
study.  Drug supplies, including partially used or empty containers, will be fully accounted for by  
the study monitor at each visit.  When requested in writing by the Sponsor or if a site does not 
have available storage space to hold drug, returned and unused drug supplies will be destroyed 
on site according to the site’s standard operating procedure or returned to the Sponsor (or 
designee) after study drug accountability has been completed by and with approval of the study 
monitor.  Records shall be maintained by the Investigator of any such alternate disposition of the 
study drug.  These records must show the identification and quantity of each unit disposed of, the 
method of destruction (taking into account the requirements of local law), and the person who 
disposed of the study drug.  Such records must be submitted to the Sponsor.   
5.5 Study Drug Compliance 
The investigator or designated study staff is responsible for monitoring the subject’s compliance 
with study medication during the trial. Compliance will be assessed by tablet count, i.e., 
evaluation of returned study medication blister cards/containers (e.g., amount used/amount 
expected to be used in interval between visits) and must be reviewed at every visit while the 
subject is still in clinic to determine if the subject is taking study medication as directed .   
Compliance will be evaluated by calculating the number of tablets used (tablets dispensed minus 
tablets returned) divided by the expected number of tablets to be used.  A subject will be deemed 
compliant if the subject has taken 80-100% of the expected tablets of study drug. 
6 STUDY METHODS AND PR OCEDURES  
6.1 Screening Period 
6.1.1 Screening Visit (up to Week -4) (Switch Subjects) 
See the Schedule of Events A for a detailed summary of activities.  
Prior to conduct of any study-specific screening procedures, the Investigator, or designee, will 
explain to the subject and caregiver the study procedures, including the risks involved and the 
fact that their participation is voluntary.  If the subject lacks the capacity to provide informed 
consent (as determined by an independent assessment by a qualified healthcare provider not 
directly involved in other study activities), a legally authorized representative must provide 
written informed consent and the subject must provide assent.  Each subject and caregiver will 
acknowledge receipt of this information by signing and dating a current, IRB/IEC-approved 
written informed consent,  or subject assent if an LAR is utilized, for their involvement in the 
study in the presence of the Investigator, or designee, who will also sign and date the informed 
consent or assent. A Research Advance Directive (See Section 6.12) will be obtained from 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 44 subjects with the ability to self consent. Subjects rolling over from the SD-809-C-15 study may 
have capacity assessment/informed consent/assent/research advance directive obtained up to 30 
days in advance of subject’s First-HD Week 13 Visit/ARC-HD Baseline Visit.   
Each potentially eligible subject who has signed an informed consent or assent and is  screened 
will be assigned a Subject Identification (ID) Number in consecutive order by the site from the 
site-specific Subject Identification list provided to the site by the Clinical Trials Coordination 
Center (CTCC); this four-digit number will identify subjects on all study forms and lab 
specimens.  Should the subject proceed to enrollment, the Subject ID Number will continue to be 
used for the subject through the duration of the study.  For subjects who have signed the 
informed consent form and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria or withdraw consent, the 
source record should contain at least minimum information as documentation of screen failure 
(i.e., demographics, eligibility criteria reviewed, procedures performed, etc.).   
In addition, subjects will be assigned a 9-digit Unique ID Number at the Screening Visit.  This 
ID system has the ability to track individual subjects across multiple HSG CTCC studies without 
storing any personally identifiable information.  The protected system uses an algorithm of nine 
data element inputs (last name at birth, first name at birth, gender at birth, day, month and year of 
birth, city and country of birth, and mother’s maiden name), and produces an electronic 
“fingerprint” output.  The system stores only the “fingerprint” and clears the individual’s 
inputted data elements from memory.  The subject is then assigned a 9-digit CTCC Unique ID 
Number that is associated with their electronic “fingerprint.”   
Once the informed consent/assent, is signed to obtain the CTCC unique ID, the subject (or 
designee) will be directed to a secure website where he/she or the site Study Coordinator (if the 
patient requests/prefers) will enter the subject’s nine data elements. The CTCC Unique ID 
Number will be printed and provided to the patient.  The Study Coordinator will record this 
number on the eCRF and Confidential Subject ID Log.   
If a patient has participated in previous CTCC studies and already has an existing CTCC Unique 
ID Number, this number will be used for this study.  When the same nine data elements are 
entered in the exact same way they were entered the first time, the same CTCC Unique ID 
Number will be generated.   
The caregiver will also be asked to review and sign the consent form. Caregivers will not be 
assigned Subject Identification or Unique ID numbers. 
After informed consent/assent has been obtained, and any washout of prohibited medication s 
completed, screening activities will be performed on all suitable subjects within the 4 weeks 
prior to first dose to determine if subjects meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Subjects switching from tetrabenazine (Switch subjects)  will undergo a full screening 
evaluation within 30 days of the Baseline assessment prior to switching to SD-809 ER.  See 
Schedule of Events A.   
The Switch Screening clinic visit will consist of the following: 
 Evaluate capacity for consent and obtain informed consent/assent 
 Assign Subject ID 
 Assign Unique ID 
 Complete Research Advance Directive, if subject has the capacity to provide informed

 Provide Switch subjects with a diary card to record the start time of their last meal and 
time of their last tetrabenazine dose prior to the Baseline visit and ask them to bring the 
diary card with them to the next clinic visit. 
o Schedule a telecon one week before the Baseline visit to remind Switch subjects 
to complete the diary card, and hold dose of tetrabenazine on the day of their 
Baseline visit if their visit is scheduled in the morning. If the subject is scheduled 
in the afternoon, subjects will be reminded to take their dose(s) of tetrabenazine as 
per their usual schedule. Subjects will be reminded to bring their tetrabenazine 
with them to their Baseline visit.  
 Evaluate selection criteria and, if eligible to enroll, schedule Baseline clinic visit 
 Order study medication 
Abnormal screening labs may be repeated once, without medical monitor approval,  to 
determine the subject’s eligibility.   
Subjects may be rescreened, with approval of the medical monitor, if they have an abnormal 
laboratory value or an acute condition preventing them from qualifying for the study if the 
condition: 
 Has resolved or is resolving

Subjects from the SD-809-C-15 Study (Rollover subjects)  
Subjects who have successfully completed Study SD-809 -C-15 may be eligible to rollover 
directly into this study after they complete the Week 13 evaluation of Study SD-809-C-15.  To 
reduce subject burden, after obtaining capacity assessment (if necessary)/informed 
consent/assent and Research Advance Directive (if applicable), some data collected in the SD-
809-C-15 study will be utilized in the SD-809-C-16 study and will provide some of the baseline 
data for SD-809-C-16 (See Schedule of Events B). Additional evaluations required as part of the 
SD-809-C-16 study will be completed on the same day as the Week 13 visit of the SD-809-C-15 
study after SD-809-C-16 informed consent/assent is provided. All subjects are expected to 
rollover to SD-809 -C-16 at the Week 13 visit of SD-809 -C-15.  See Schedule of Events B.  
Prior to conduct of any study-specific screening procedures, the Investigator, or designee, will 
explain to the subject and caregiver the study procedures, including the risks involved and the 
fact that their participation is voluntary.  If subject lacks the capacity to provide informed 
consent (as determined by an independent assessment by a qualified healthcare provider not 
directly involved in other study activities), a legally authorized representative must provide 
written informed consent and the subject must provide assent.  Each subject and caregiver will 
acknowledge receipt of this information by signing and dating a current, IRB/IEC-approved 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 48 written informed consent, or subject assent if an LAR is utilized, for their involvement in the 
study in the presence of the Investigator, or designee, who will also sign and date the informed 
consent or assent. 
 
The Rollover Baseline clinic visit will consist of the following: 
 Evaluate capacity for consent and obtain informed consent/assent (for subjects who do 
not already have a legally authorized representative) 
 Complete Research Advance Directive, if subject has the capacity to provide informed 
consent (See Section 6.12) 
 Update medical history  
 Urine pregnancy test (women of child-bearing potential only) 
 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA©) 
 Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) 
o Cognitive 
o Behavior 
 Baseline results will be assessed by the Investigator or Sub-Investigator and subjects who 
meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. 
 Subjects will be provided with one week of study medication 
 Week 1 telephone visit will be scheduled 
6.2 Dose Adjustment/Titration Period  
All subjects will interact weekly with the clinical site, either by telephone contact or clinic visit, 
during the dose adjustment/titration period, in order to evaluate safety and establish a dose of 
study drug that adequately controls chorea and is well-tolerated.  Safety evaluations include 
UHDRS motor examination, laboratory testing, ECGs, monitoring for adverse events and rating 
scales for depression, cognitive function, akathisia, swallowing disturbance and somnolence.  
Subjects on allowed doses of citalopram (Celexa) or escitalopram (Lexapro, Cipralex) will have 
additional ECGs during the titration period as specified in the Schedule of Events. 
For subjects switching from tetrabenazine (Switch subjects)  the dose of SD-809 ER may be 
adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day 
after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached) until a dose level that adequately controls chorea is 
identified, the subject experiences a protocol defined “clinically significant” adverse event 
(define
d as related to study medication and either a) moderate or severe in intensity or b) meets 
the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event [SAE])1; or the maximal allowable dose is reached.  If a 
subject experiences a “clinically significant” AE attributable to SD-809 ER, the investigator will 
determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary. The investigator, in consultation with 
the subject and caregiver, will determine when an adequate level of chorea control has been 
achieved.  Subjects will have a clinic visit at Week 1 and a telephone contact at Week 2, in order 
to evaluate safety and establish an optimal dose.  Although subjects will enter the long term 
                                                 
1 See Section 7 for evaluation of AEs regarding severity, relationship to study drug and definition of SAE. 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 49 treatment period after Week 2, dose adjustment (upward or downward) may continue through 
Week 4 to optimize dose level.  Additional dose adjustments may be made after Week 4 if 
clinically indicated. 
As all subjects from the SD-809 -C-15 Study (Rollover subjects) will have discontinued study 
drug (SD-809 ER or placebo) for 1 week after completion of the SD-809-C-15 study, they will 
undergo titration on SD-809 ER.  During titration, the investigator, in consultation with the 
subject and caregiver, will determine when an adequate level of chorea control has been 
achieved.  The dose of SD-809 ER may be adjusted on a weekly basis (upward or downward), in 
increments of 6 mg per day ( 6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached ), 
until there is adequate control of chorea; the subject experiences a protocol defined “clinically 
significant” adverse event (defined as related to study medication and either a) moderate or 
severe in intensity or b) meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event [SAE]); or the maximal 
allowable dose is reached.   If a subject experiences a “clinically significant” AE attributable to 
SD-809 ER, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary.  
Subjects will have a telephone contact at Week 1 and a clinic visit at Week 2, in order to evaluate 
safety and establish a dose of study drug that adequately controls chorea and is well-tolerated.  
Although subjects will enter the Long term treatment period after Week 2, titration may continue 
through Week 8 to optimize dose level.  Additional dose adjustments may be made after Week 8 
if clinically indicated. 
Once adequate control of chorea has been achieved or the maximum allowable dose has 
been reached, the dose of SD-809 ER should not be increased further. 
If a subject experiences an AE that is attributed to study drug, the investigator will use his or her 
judgment to determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary.  Dose adjustments should 
be made based on all available information including the subject’s and caregiver’s reports of 
adverse events and chorea control, the clinical assessment of safety and efficacy by the 
investigator, and information from rating scales such as the UHDRS, the HADS, the UPDRS 
(dysarthria item), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, the Epworth sleepiness scale, and the C-
SSRS.  At the end of the dose adjustment/titration period, the subject’s dose will be established 
for the remainder of the long term treatment period.  
6.2.1 Switch Subjects - Weeks 1 and 2 
See the Schedule of Events A for a detailed summary of activities. 
Switch subjects will have a clinic visit at Week 1 and a telephone contact at Week 2 for

 The next telephone contact will be scheduled/reconfirmed. 
6.3 Long Term Treatment Period  
All subjects will enter the long term treatment period after Week 2, although dose adjustment 
may continue in Switch subjects and titration may continue in Rollover subjects.   
During long term treatment, all subjects will be contacted by telephone at Week 3 and will return 
to the clinic on Weeks 4, 8, 15, 28 and every 13 weeks thereafter for evaluation of safety and 
chorea control.  In addition, Rollover subjects will have an additional telephone contact at Week 
5.  Switch subjects will have an additional telephone contact at Week 7, to remind subjects to 
complete diary card before the Week 8 visit.  Subjects who have not achieved a dose level that 
adequately controls chorea and is well tolerated by the Week 4 visit (Switch subjects) or 
Week 5 telecon (Rollover subjects) should have unscheduled visits or telephone contacts in 
order to further adjust their dose upward or downward.   Site interactions for dose 
adjustment should alternate between telephone contacts and clinic visits.  During long-term 
treatment, further dose adjustments of SD-809 ER may made, if necessary, but not more often 
than weekly and in increments of 6 mg (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg 
is reached).  Dose adjustments should be based on all available information including the 
subject’s and caregiver’s reports of adverse events and chorea control, information from rating 
scales and all safety evaluations.  If subjects become non-ambulatory or require more aid than an 
assistive device during long term treatment, they will be permitted to remain in the study.

has rested quietly in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes.   
6.6.5 Orthostatic Blood Pressure and Pulse 
Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse will be recorded at Baseline, Week 8 and End of 
Treatment/ET . 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 58 Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse will be assessed in the supine and standing positions. The 
subject should be supine for at least 5 minutes before the supine blood pressure and pulse are 
measured. Subjects will then move to the sitting position briefly to assure no symptoms occur 
after which they will stand for 3 minutes. Standing blood pressure and pulse will be obtained 
after the subject has been in the standing position for at least 3 minutes.  
6.6.6 Laboratory Tests 
Blood and urine samples will be collected and analyzed, and applicable parameters calculated 
according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) at the central laboratory.  If abnormal,

Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 59 SUBJECTS ROLLING OVER FROM SD-809-C-15  and interpreted by a cardiologist.  Heart 
rate and ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF) and clinical interpretation will be assessed by 
the cardiologist and recorded in the CRF.     
6.6.8 Detecting Adverse Events 
The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) should be sought by non-leading questioning of the 
subject and caregiver during the study and may also be identified when the subject and/or 
caregiver spontaneously volunteered them.  Open-ended, non-leading questioning of the subject 
is the preferred method to detect AEs.   
Suitable non-leading questions include:    
 “How are you feeling?”   
 “How have you been doing since your last evaluation?” 
 “Have you taken any new medicines since your last evaluation?  If so, why?” 
Adverse events may also be detected by the medical staff through physical examination, 
evaluation of laboratory tests results or other assessments.  All adverse events occurring from 
signing of the ICF to the end of the study, regardless of suspected causal relationship to study 
drug, will be recorded in the source documentation and on the appropriate eCRF page for 
subjects who are enrolled.  
6.7 Rating Scales 
Subject completed assessments will be available in English, Spanish and French. 
6.7.1 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
The HADS is a self-administered instrument reliable for detecting states of depression and 
anxiety in an outpatient medical setting ( 14).  The HADS is recommended by the National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Elements for Huntington 
Disease because it serves as a good screening measure, it has been widely used and it is 
relatively simple to complete.  It focuses on subjective disturbances of mood rather than physical 
signs, and aims at distinguishing depression from anxiety.   The scale consists of 14 items (7 each 
for anxiety and depression).  Each item is rated on a four point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 
3 (very often).  Responses are based on the relative frequency of symptoms over the preceding 
week. 
6.7.2 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is an FDA endorsed questionnaire to 
screen for suicidality in trials of central nervous system (CNS) active compounds ( 15, 16).  The 
C-SSRS is an interview by trained study personnel that should be done at Baseline and during 
the study as outlined in the Schedule of Events.  The form provided at Screening collects the 
history of suicide (C-SSRS form version termed “baseline”) and subsequent visits use a C-SSRS 
termed “Since the Last Visit”. 
6.7.3 Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) 
The UHDRS is a research tool which has been developed by the HSG to provide a uniform 
assessment of the clinical features and course of HD ( 17).  As the authors sought to develop a 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 60 tool for evaluating interventions that modify disease progression, they suggested the UHDRS 
may be suitable for tracking longitudinal changes.  The instrument was not intended to assess the 
impact of short-term treatment effects, although it has often been used for such purposes. The 
components of the UHDRS are: 
 Motor Assessment 
 Cognitive Assessment 
 Behavioral Assessment 
 Independence Scale 
 Functional Assessment 
 Total Functional Capacity (TFC)   
6.7.4 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA©) 
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA©) is a validated rapid screening instrument for 
assessing mild cognitive dysfunction.  It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and 
concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual 
thinking, calculations, and orientation.  Time to administer the MoCA© is approximately 
10 minutes.  The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.  
There are 3 versions in the English language.  Given the relatively frequent use of this 
instrument, the versions will be rotated at each visit. Additionally, Spanish and French language 
versions m ay be utilized.  
6.7.5 Unified Parkinson ’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a comprehensive instrument used to 
assess the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  The UPDRS is comprised of various 
patient and clinician based assessments of motor, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms.  UPDRS 
questions pertaining to dysarthria will be utilized to screen and monitor study subjects for 
parkinsonism. 
6.7.6 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) 
The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) is a widely used rating scale for evaluation of drug 
induced akathisia.  This scale includes an objective assessment, subjective measures, including 
self-awareness and distress, and a global clinical assessment ( 18).    
6.7.7 Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) 
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire comprised of eight 
questions that provides a measure of a subject’s general level of daytime sleepiness (19).  The 
ESS asks respondents to rate, on a 4-point Likert scale (0 – 3), their usual chances of dozing off 
or falling asleep in different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their 
daily lives.  The total ESS score is the sum of 8 item-scores and can range between 0 and 24 with 
a higher the score indicating a higher level of daytime sleepiness.  Most people can complete the 
ESS, without assistance, in 2 or 3 minutes. 
6.7.8 Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ) 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 61 The Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire comprised of 15 
questions that assess frequency of swallowing disturbance ( 20).  It has been validated in subjects 
with Parkinson’s disease and has been shown to be a sensitive and accurate tool for identifying 
subjects with swallowing disturbances arising from different etiologies.  A sensitivity and 
specificity analysis demonstrated that a threshold score of 11 was the optimal score for 
identifying subjects with dysphagia that had underlying pathology confirmed on fiberoptic 
endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) (21). 
6.8 Pharmacokinetic Evaluations 
A pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study will be conducted in subjects switching  from TBZ to SD-809 
ER.  Blood samples will be obtained for measurement of plasma concentrations of SD-809, 
tetrabenazine and their respective α HTBZ, β-HTBZ, total (α+β)-HTBZ and other metabolites, as 
required.  Approximately one third of the population will have rich samples drawn and the 
remaining two thirds will have sparse sampling.  The rich sampling cohort should be enrolled 
first.  Subjects who are unable or unwilling to participate in the rich sampling cohort may be 
assigned to the sparse sampling cohort.   
Subjects in the rich sampling cohort must have a morning visit in which the AM dose of 
tetrabenazine or SD-809 ER is administered in clinic.  If the subject is assigned to the rich group 
at the Screening Visit but forgets to hold tetrabenazine dose the morning of the Baseline visit, the 
subject must be re-consented to undergo sparse sampling.  Subjects in the sparse sampling cohort 
may have a morning or an afternoon visit.  If sparse sample subjects have a morning visit, the 
AM dose of tetrabenazine or SD-809 ER should be administered in clinic as with the rich 
sampling cohort.  If sparse sampling subjects have an afternoon visit, tetrabenazine or SD-809 
ER should be taken at home per their usual schedule.   Blood samples will be collected at 
Baseline (on tetrabenazine) and at Week 8 (on SD -809 ER) as follows: 
Cohort Visit Day 0 (TBZ)  Week 8* (SD -809 ER) 
Rich Sampling 
(N=12) Morning 
only Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2 and 6  hours 
post-dose Pre-dose, 1.5, 2.5, 4 and 6 
hours post -dose 
Sparse Sampling 
(N=24) Morning Pre-dose and 1 -2 hours post -
dose Pre-dose and 2 -4 hours post -
dose  
Afternoon  1st sample during the visit  and 
2nd at least 1 hr† afterward  1st sample during the visit  and 
2nd at least 2 hrs† afterward  
* If a subject requires a dose change at Week 8, the Week 8 visit assessments should be conducted except for PK 
sampling which should be postponed until Week 15. 
† The second PK sample for sparse sampling (afternoon) should be taken as late as possible during the visit. 
Subjects in the rich sampling cohort and those in the sparse sampling cohort who have a 
morning visit should be reminded not to take their morning dose at home prior to their 
Baseline visit (tetrabenazine) and prior to their Week 8 visit (SD-809 ER) as it will be 
administered in clinic.  Morning clinic visits should be scheduled early in the day to allow 
sufficient time for PK blood sampling.  
Samples should be collected as close to the target time as possible.  The pre-dose specimen 
should be taken within one hour prior to drug administration.  The actual sample collection time  
will be recorded in the source document worksheets.    
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 62 At each time point, four (4) mL of blood will be collected into lithium heparin tubes and 
processed to plasma.  After centrifugation, the plasma will be split into 2 aliquots and stored 
frozen in polypropylene plasma storage tubes at -70°C or below.   If a subject requires a dose 
change at Week 8, the Week 8 visit assessments should be conducted except for PK sampling 
which should be postponed until Week 15. 
Switch subjects will be provided with a diary at the Screening and Week 4 visits to record meal 
and dosing times before PK sampling at Baseline and Week 8.  Prior to clinic visits subjects will 
be reminded to record the start time of their last meal and the time of their last dose in their diary 
card and to bring the diary card with them to the clinic visit.   Switch subjects will be reminded 
to bring their tetrabenazine to the Baseline visit and the SD-809 ER to the Week 8 visit.   
Subjects who withdraw early from the study should have a single blood sample collected for PK 
at the Early Termination Visit if the last dose was within the prior 48 hours, if possible. 
Subjects experiencing an SAE should have a single blood sample collected as soon as possible 
after the SAE and within 48 hours for the pharmacokinetics of α- and β- HTBZ, if possible. The 
date and time of the last dose of study medication should be recorded along with the date and 
time of the sample collection.  
6.9 Subject Restrictions  
6.9.1 Concomitant Medications 
The following products should not be used within 4 weeks of Screening or Baseline and 
throughout the study: 
 Antipsychotics (See Appendix 13 ) 
 Metoclopromide  
 MAO Inhibitors 
 Levodopa or dopamine agonists 
 Reserpine 
 Amantadine 
 Memantine (Rollover subjects only) 
o Switch subjects may receive Memantine if on a stable, approved dose for at least 30 
days. 
Subjects discontinuing anti-psychotics (See Appendix 13) or the other concomitant medications 
noted above in order to enroll in the trial must be stable off therapy for at least 30 days before 
Screening. 
Subjects receiving antidepressant therapy must be on a stable dose for 8 weeks before Screening.  
Additionally, subjects switching or discontinuing SSRIs in order to enter the trial, must be stable 
on their new regimen for at least 8 weeks before Screening. 
The drugs listed above and other drugs which are known to cause QT prolongation (See 
Appendix12 ) should not be taken concomitantly with study medication.  A washout period of 
5 half-lives is recommended or other duration as approved by the Clinical Monitor. 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 63 Female subjects on hormonal contraception (approved oral, transdermal, or depot regimen) for 
birth control must be on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to Screening and through study 
completion. 
Subjects will be instructed to inform the study Investigator of the details (indication, dose, and 
dates of administration) if they do take any medication, and these details will be recorded in the 
eCRF.   
6.9.2 Use of Alcohol or Sedating drugs 
As with other VMAT2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, reserpine), subjects should be advised that the 
concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs with SD-809 ER may have additive effects 
and cause or worsen somnolence.  Until subjects are receiving a stable dose of SD-809 ER and 
understand how the drug affects them, alcohol should be used with caution.  
6.9.3 Other Restrictions 
Subjects should be advised to not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until they 
understand how SD-809 ER affects them. 
Use of illicit drugs is prohibited from the time of signing of the Informed Consent Form or 
Assent and throughout study participation. 
6.10 Caregiver Responsibilities 
Each subject participating in the study must have a reliable caregiver.   The caregiver must 
interact on a daily basis with the subject and oversee study drug administration.  In addition, the 
caregiver will assure attendance at study visits and participate in evaluations, as required.  Note: 
 Subjects with a TFC score of 5-7 at Screening must have a live-in caregiver. 
 Subjects with a TFC score of 5-7 at Screening or those who enrolled with the consent of 
an LAR, must have caregivers present at all study visits. 
 For subjects with a TFC score of 8-13 at Screening who did not require an LAR to 
provide informed consent, the caregiver must attend the following visits: Screening, 
Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 15, 28  and visits every 13 weeks thereafter through the end of the 
Long Term Treatment Period.  Caregivers will be encouraged to attend other visits. 
The caregiver must also make him/herself available for telephone contacts in order to report 
chorea control and adverse events to determine whether dose adjustment of study drug will be 
made.  As subjects may have agnosia to chorea, telephone contacts should involve the subject 
and c
aregiver at the same time , if possible. 
6.11 Capacity Assessment 
In order to determine if a subject can provide informed consent to participate in the trial, an 
assessment of capacity must be made by a qualified healthcare provider who is not directly 
involved with other aspects of the study (e.g., cannot be the Site Investigator).  The qualified 
individual must be a health care professional with documented training and experience who has 
an established role for assessing capacity for treatment consent at the institution.  A written 
assessment verifying the subject has the capacity to provide consent must be maintained in the 
subject’s source documentation.

Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 64 6.12 Research Advance Directive 
During the consenting process, subjects who have the capacity to provide informed consent will 
be required to provide a research advance directive specific for this trial and will expire when the 
subject completes participation.  A research advance directive will specify whether a subject 
wishes to continue participation in the study should he or she lose capacity.  In the event that a 
subject loses the capacity to provide consent during the course of the trial, it would allow the 
subject to continue participation, if so expressed ( 22, 23). 
6.13 Withdrawal Criteria 
Subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
 Subject voluntarily discontinues study participation (subject withdrawal); 
 The need to take medication which may interfere with study measurements; 
 Intolerable/unacceptable adverse events; 
 Major violation or deviation of study protocol procedures; 
 Non-compliance of subject with protocol; 
 Subject is unable to comply with study procedures; 
 Withdrawal from the study is, in the Investigator’s judgment, in the subject’s best 
interest; 
 Subject is lost to follow-up; 
 A female subject becomes pregnant; 
 Study termination by the Sponsor. 
All Subjects to be withdrawn from the study for medical reasons should be reviewed with the 
Clinical Monitor.  The reasons for withdrawal will be recorded on the eCRF and included in the 
final report along with any adverse events and any necessary medical treatment.   
6.14 Discontinued Subjects 
Notification of early subject discontinuation from the study and the reason for discontinuation 
will be made to the Clinical Monitor and will be clearly documented on the appropriate e CRF 
page.  If a subject is discontinued from the study early, all early termination evaluations should 
be performed at the time of discontinuation, if possible.   
6.15 Study Termination 
The study may be stopped at any time by the Sponsor, IEC/IRB, and/or regulatory agencies for 
any reason.  The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial at any time for any reason.  
Reasons will be provided in the event of this happening.  The Investigator reserves the right to 
discontinue the study for safety reasons at any time in collaboration with the Sponsor. 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Throughout the course of the study, all adverse events will be monitored and reported on an 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 65 adverse event case report form, including assessments of seriousness, severity, action taken and 
relationship to study drug.  If adverse events occur, the first concern will be the safety of the 
study participants.   
Adverse events will be recorded from the time of consent through the final study visit.  
Information about side effects already known about the investigational product(s) can be found 
in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and will be included in the subject informed consent form. 
The Investigator and site staff are responsible for detection, recording and reporting of events 
that meet the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE (listed below). 
7.1 Definitions 
7.1.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) therefore, can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or 
dose, including an overdose. 
Examples of an AE include: 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study. 
 Abnormal safety assessments if they lead to investigational product dose modification, 
investigational product discontinuation or to therapeutic intervention (e.g. low 
hemoglobin that requires transfusions). 
 Abnormal laboratory tests if they are associated with clinical signs, symptoms or if they 
lead to a diagnosis or therapeutic intervention. 
 Abnormal vital signs if they are clinically significant and lead to a diagnosis or 
therapeutic intervention.  
 Abnormal ECGs if they are clinically significant and lead to therapeutic intervention or 
diagnosis.  The clinical significance should be confirmed by a cardiologist. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication. 
Examples of an AE do not include: 
 A medical or surgical procedure (e.g. endoscopy); a condition that leads to the procedure 
is an AE. 
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 66 convenience admission to hospital) or scheduled elective procedures like cosmetic 
surgery are not AEs.  However, if the procedure results in an unexpected complication, 
the complication is an AE. 
 Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur or when signs are not 
expressing a medical problem but rather are expressing natural physiological responses 
(e.g., dyspnea after running, limb paresthesias due to awkward position). 
 Signs, symptoms, or laboratory results that reflect an improvement of a past medical 
condition (e.g. sleeping better). 
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
7.1.3 Adverse Reaction 
An adverse reaction means an adverse event that is caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug 
caused the event. 
7.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
7.1.5 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Results in death (i.e., the AE caused the death). 
 Is life-threatening.  The term life threatening in the definition of serious refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
 Requires inpatient overnight hospitalization or prolongation of an existing 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 67 hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: 
o Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition and has not 
worsened since signing the informed consent 
o Social reasons and/or respite care in the absence of any deterioration of the 
subject’s general condition.   
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained 
(involving at least an overnight stay of at least 24 hours) at the hospital or 
emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting.  Complications that 
occur during hospitalization are AEs.  If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious.   
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  The term disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This 
definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental 
trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but 
do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse finding in a child or fetus or a 
subject exposed to the study medication prior to conception or during pregnancy). 
 Is medically important, defined as an event that may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or 
result in urgent investigation.  Examples of such events are malignancies, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse. 
 If either the Sponsor or Investigator believes the event is serious, the event must be 
considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 
7.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
Whenever possible, a unifying diagnosis should be recorded in the eCRF as the AE rather than 
individual signs or symptoms.  Similarly, the unifying diagnosis should be recorded as the AE 
rather than the abnormal laboratory result (i.e. “anemia” instead of “low hemoglobin”).   
If the AE is a worsening of a past medical condition, the AE should clearly indicate that the past 
medical condition has worsened using words such as “worsening,” “aggravated,” or 
“exacerbation.”   
7.2.1 Recording of Non-Serious Adverse Events (AEs) 
Collection of AEs will begin immediately following signing of the ICF through the final study 
visit.  The Investigator will monitor each subject closely and record all observed or volunteered 
AEs.  Adverse findings detected at the Screening visit (e.g., abnormalities on clinical laboratory 
testing, ECGs, physical/neuro examination) will be recorded on the Medical History CRF and 
adverse events occurring after the Screening visit but before starting study treatment will be 
recorded on the AE CRF and considered non-treatment emergent. 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 68 7.2.2 Recording of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Collection of SAEs will begin immediately following signing of the ICF through the final study 
visit.  The Investigator will monitor each subject closely and record all observed or volunteered 
SAEs.  Serious adverse events occurring after signing the informed consent form but before 
starting study treatment will be considered non-treatment emergent. 
If a new SAE comes to the attention of the Investigator after the completion of the final study 
visit, information regarding the SAE should be collected and reported to the Sponsor only if 
assessed as reasonably possibly related to the study drug(s) by the Investigator. 
After the initial SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject and 
provide further information to the Sponsor (or designee) on the subject’s condition.  The 
Investigator will ensure that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations as may be 
indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the SAE.  This may include additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other 
health care professionals. 
SAEs that remain ongoing past the subject’s last protocol-specified follow-up visit will be 
evaluated by the Investigator and Sponsor. All SAEs will be followed: 
 until resolution, or 
 for 28 days after the subject’s last follow up visit, or 
 if, in the investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve, whichever comes 
first. If the Investigator and Sponsor agree the subject’s condition is unlikely to resolve, 
the Investigator and Sponsor will determine the follow-up requirement. 
Subjects experiencing an SAE should have a single blood sample collected as soon as possible 
after the SAE and within 48 hours for the pharmacokinetics of α- and β-HTBZ, if possible. The 
date and time of the last dose of study medication should be recorded along with the date and 
time of the sample collection. 
7.3 Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non-Serious) 
At each in-person visit and telephone contacts, occurrence of adverse events will be assessed by 
verbally asking subjects and caregivers if they have had any problems or symptoms since their 
last visit. 
If the subject or caregiver reports an adverse event, the investigator/coordinator will probe 
further to determine: 
 Time of onset and resolution 
 Frequency 
 Causality/relation to study treatment 
 Intensity 
 Action taken regarding study drug 
 Outcome 
7.3.1 Severity 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 69 The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study.  The assessment will be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment.  The intensity of 
each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
 Mild:  Awareness of sign or symptom that is easily tolerated. 
 Moderate: Sign or symptom intense enough to interfere with usual activity 
 Severe: Interferes significantly with ability to do work or usual activity 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-defined outcomes as described in 
“Definition of a SAE.” 
7.3.2 Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study drug and the occurrence of 
each AE.  The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  The investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship of each AE to study drug will be recorded it in the source documents and the eCRF.  
Alternative causes, such as medical history, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the 
temporal relationship of the event to the investigational product should be considered and 
investigated, if appropriate. The Clinical Monitor’s opinion may be sought in those cases in 
which the Site Investigator is unable to make an independent judgment.  The Clinical Monitor 
may in turn consult with the principal investigator as needed. The following definitions are 
general guidelines only to help assign grade of attribution:  
 Unrelated:  The Adverse event is clearly not related  to the investigational drug 
 Unlikely:  The Adverse event is doubtfully related  to the investigational drug   
 Possible:  The Adverse event may be related  to the investigational drug  
 Probable:  The Adverse event is likely related  to the investigational drug   
 Definite: The Adverse event is clearly related  to the investigational drug  
7.3.3 Action Taken with Study Treatment 
Action taken as a result of an adverse event will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as 
follows: 
 No change 
 Dose reduced 
 Drug Suspended (See Section 5.2.5 for guidance in contacting Clinical Monitor) 
 Drug permanently discontinued 
7.3.4 Treatment Required 
Treatment required as a result of an AE will be recorded in the subject’s source documents, and 
if medication is required, on the Concomitant medications log: 
 None 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 70  Medication Required (record on Concomitant Medications eCRF) 
 Hospitalization Required 
 Other (specify) 
If a diagnosis has been entered as an AE, the treatment(s) recorded may represent the 
treatment(s) given for one or more sign(s) or symptoms(s) (e.g. Naproxen for the AE “fracture”, 
without recording “pain due to fracture” or “inflammation due to fracture” as separate AEs).   
7.3.5 Outcome 
Outcome of an adverse event will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as follows: 
 Recovered / Resolved  
 Recovering / Resolving  
 Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae 
 Not Recovered / Not Resolving  
 Fatal 
 Unknown  
7.4 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All serious adverse events occurring during study participation must be reported to the Sponsor 
(or designee) and to the governing Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) as required by the IRB/IEC, local regulations, and the governing health 
authorities. 
7.4.1 Completion and Transmission of the SAE Report 
Once an Investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a study subject, she/he will 
report the information to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours.  The SAE form (provided in 
the study operations manual) will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all 
available details of the event, signed by the Investigator (or designee), and forwarded to the 
Sponsor (or designee) within the designated time frames.  If the Investigator does not have all 
information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive additional information before 
notifying the Sponsor (or designee) of the event and completing the form.  The form will be 
updated when additional information is received 
Whenever possible, the Investigator will provide an assessment of causality at the time of the 
initial report as described above. 
The Sponsor will provide a list of project contacts for SAE receipt.  Any event that in the opinion 
of the Investigator may be of immediate or potential concern for the subject’s health or well-
being will be reported to the Sponsor (or designee).    
7.4.2 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
The Investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the Sponsor in accordance with the 
procedures describe above.  Prompt notification of SAEs by the Investigator to the appropriate 
project contact for SAE receipt is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 71 towards the safety of other subjects are met.  The Investigator will be responsible for reporting 
SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) per local 
regulatory requirements.   
The Sponsor (or designee) is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) to the 
relevant regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulations.  That is, SAEs which are 
determined by the Sponsor to be “Unexpected” and classified as “Suspected Adverse Reactions” 
will be reported in an expedited manner.   
7.5 Procedures for Reporting Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events 
The Investigator must promptly report all pregnancies in  female study subjects to the Sponsor (or 
designee) in accordance with the Operations Manual.  While the pregnancy itself is not 
considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complications should be recorded as AEs or 
SAEs.  Any pregnancy will be followed through its conclusion for observation of any SAEs 
including congenital anomalies/birth defects. 
 
8 STATISTICAL  PROCEDURES  AND DATA ANALYSIS  
This section describes the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study.  Summary 
statistics will be provided by treatment.  Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative 
data and frequency counts and percentages will be provided for categorical data.  Details of the 
data analysis will be described in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan. 
8.1 Analysis Populations 
Safety Population:  The safety population will include all subjects who were administered any 
study drug.  Subjects who are assigned a subject number but withdrew prior to dosing will not be 
included in the safety population.  If relevant, details of their participation and reason for 
withdrawal will be listed separately in the study report.   
All summaries of safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively in the Safety Population.  
8.2 Demographics and Baseline Data

Safety data will be summarized descriptively for the overall population and based on prior 
treatment [ SD-809 ER or placebo (Rollover subjects) or tetrabenazine (Switch subjects)].  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative data and frequency counts and 
percentages will be provided for categorical data.  Descriptive statistics of change-from-baseline 
for Rollover subjects will utilize the Baseline from Study SD-809-C-15 (C -15 Baseline) and the 
Baseline from the present study (C-16 Baseline), as appropriate, and will be specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan. 
The nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events will be tabulated for all subjects combined 
and by treatment.  Baseline, within study, end of study, and change-from-baseline values for 
clinical laboratory evaluations and vital signs will be summarized as appropriate. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events and laboratory, vital sign, and ECG parameters will b e 
summarized.  In addition, change from baseline will be summarized for laboratory and vital sign 
parameters.  Shift tables will be provided for clinical laboratory results.  ECG results will be 
classified as normal and abnormal and summarized. 
8.4 Safety Endpoints 
The following safety endpoints will be assessed: 
 Incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, severe AEs, drug related AEs, AEs leading 
to withdrawal during the following periods: 
 Overall 
 During titration in Rollover subjects (up to 8 weeks) 
 During dose adjustment in Switch subjects (up to 4 weeks)  
 During long term treatment

8.5 Sample Size 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 73 Because this is an open label safety study, the sample size is not based on statistical 
considerations. 
8.6 Pharmacokinetics 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using data from all subjects switching 
from TBZ to SD- 809 in this study together with data obtained from subjects in Study SD -809-C-
15 to examine the pharmacokinetics of SD -809 and TBZ and to explore th e potential effect of 
various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of SD -809 and TBZ.  The population 
pharmacokinetic analysis will be discussed in detail in a prospective Statistical Analysis Plan.  
8.7 Protocol Deviations and Violations 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is conducted in accordance with the 
protocol.  No modifications to the protocol, other than those that are deemed necessary to protect 
the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects by the Investigator are to be made without prior, written 
approval by the Sponsor.  The nature and reasons for the protocol deviation will be recorded 
where appropriate and indicated.  The Sponsor must be notified of all protocol deviations.  
Significant protocol deviations (e.g. inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be reported to the Sponsor 
and to the IRB/IEC in accordance with its reporting policy. 
8.8 Data Recording 
Source data will be transcribed onto source document worksheets and will then be entered into 
an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system with eCRF s 
will be used for this trial.  Instructions for eCRF completion will be provided in a separate 
document.  Source d ata collection and entry into the eCRF will be completed by authori zed study 
site personnel designated by the investigator.  Appropriate training and security measures will be 
completed with the investigator and all authorized study site personnel prior to the study being 
initiated and before any data is entered into the e CRF system for any study subjects. 
8.9 Data Quality Assurance 
Steps to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified clinical 
investigators and appropriate study sties, review of protocol procedures with the clinical 
investigator and associated personnel prior to the study, and periodic monitoring visits by the 
Sponsor.  The Sponsor (or designee) will review data accuracy and completeness during and 
after the study, and any discrepancies will be resolved with the clinical investigator or designee 
as appropriate. 
8.10 Data Management 
The data will be entered into a validated FDA 21 CFR part 11 compliant database maintained by 
sponsor or designee. The data management group for the will be responsible for data processing, 
in accordance with agreed procedures. The Site Investigator will electronically sign and date the 
appropriate eCRF page when instructed to do so by the study CRA. This signature will indicate 
that the Site Investigator inspected or reviewed the data in the database, the data queries, and the 
site notifications, and agrees with the content. 
The standard procedures for handling and processing eCRF records will be followed per Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Sponsor’s (or designee’s) Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs).  
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16

Consent Forms and to the study by title and protocol number given on page one of the protocol.  
A copy of the signed and dated letter of approval will be provided to Auspex and designee prior 
to study commencement.  Any written information and/or advertisements to be used for 
volunteer recruitment will be approved by the IEC/IRB prior to use.    
9.1.2 Written Informed Consent 
Informed consent will be obtained before the subject can participate in the study.  If subject lacks 
the capacity to provide informed consent (as determined by an independent assessment by a 
qualified healthcare provider not directly involved in other study activities), a legally authorized 
representative must provide written informed consent and the subject must provide assent.  The 
contents and process of obtaining informed consent will be in accordance with all applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
It is the responsibility of the Site Investigator or designee to obtain written informed consent, 
using the most current informed consent form approved by the IRB/IEC and Sponsor, from each 
individual participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, 
and potential hazards of the study.  The Investigator or designee must also explain to the subject s 
that they are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time.  
Appropriate forms for documenting written consent will be provided by the Investigator or 
designee. 
For this study, each eligible subject will be required to provide written informed consent 
utilizing:  Consent to participation in the study (Information Form/Informed Consent Form). 
All eligible subject s and caregivers will have the study explained by the Site Investigator or 
designee.  They will receive a full explanation, in lay terms, of the aims of the study, the 
discomfort, risks, and benefits in taking part as well as of insurance and other procedures for 
compensation in case of injury.  It will be explained that the study is for research purposes only 
and is not expected to provide any therapeutic benefit to the individual.  It will be pointed out 
that they can withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice.  Each subject will 
acknowledge receipt of this information by giving written informed consent for participation in

Sponsor.  Protocol amendments, if any, will be formalized and submitted to the IRB/IEC, per 
local rules, for written approval before implementation.  The expedited review procedure for an 
amendment is appropriate only if subject safety is not an issue. 
9.3 Records Retention 
Following closure of the study, the Site Investigator must maintain all site study records in a safe 
and secure location.  The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when 
needed (e.g. audit or inspection) and whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data 
in conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems and staff.  The Sponsor will 
inform the Investigator of the time period for retaining these records to comply with all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  The minimum retention time will meet the strictest standard 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 76 applicable to that site for the study, as dictated by any institutional requirements or local laws or 
regulations, or the Sponsor’s standards/procedures; otherwise, the retention period will default to 
the time period specified in 21 CFR Part 312.57: Two years after a marketing application is 
approved for the drug; or, if an application is not approved for the drug, until 2 years after 
shipment and delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been so 
notified. 
9.4 Study Monitoring 
The Sponsor (or designee) is responsible for assuring the proper conduct of the study with regard 
to protocol adherence and validity of the data recorded on the eCRFs. Subject confidentiality will 
be maintained. 
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and Sponsor (or designee) procedures, the 
CTCC will contact the site prior to the subject enrollment to review the protocol and data 
collection procedures with site staff.  In addition, the monitor will periodically contact the site, 
including conducting on-site visits.  The extent, nature and frequency of on-site visits will be 
based on such considerations as the study objective and/or endpoints, the purpose of the study, 
study design complexity, and enrolment rate.  The visits will be conducted in accordance with 
the Sponsor’s (or designee’s) SOP and study monitoring plan. 
In general, the Investigator agrees to fully cooperate with the monitor, allow the monitor direct 
access to all relevant documents, to allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the 
monitor to discuss any findings and any relevant issues as needed. 
9.4.1 Steering Committee 
A Steering Committee (SC) has been established to provide overall supervision of the study and 
ensure that it is being conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practic e 
(GCP), Huntington Study Group constitutional bylaws, and the relevant regulations.  The SC has 
reviewed the protocol, and will review and approve any protocol amendments, and provide 
advice to the investigators on the conduct of the trial.  The SC members include representatives 
from Auspex, a biostatistician, the study PI and Co-PI, an experienced HD study coordinator, a 
psychiatrist and a HD patient advocate. 
9.4.2 Clinical Monitoring 
The Clinical Monitor for the study will review safety data on a monthly basis during study 
conduct, including aggregate laboratory and adverse event data, and laboratory alert values.  The 
Clinical Monitor will review all Serious Adverse Events as they are reported.  In addition, the 
Clinical Monitor will:  Authorize enrollment based on review of eligibility information; approve 
enrollment of subjects with possible Gilbert’s syndrome or two or more abnormal liver tests.   
The investigative sites are to contact the Clinical Monitor to: 
 Review drug suspensions and dose reductions,  according to the procedures outlined in 
Section 5.2.5;  
 Review all withdrawals from the study for medical reasons, as outlined in Section 6.14. 
9.5 Quality Assurance 
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor (or 
designee) may conduct a quality assurance audit.  Regulatory agencies may also conduct a 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol SD- 809-C-16 
Huntington Study Group ARC-HD 
Amendment 3 CONFIDENTIAL 77 regulatory inspection of this study.  Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after 
completion of the study.  If an audit or inspection is requested, the Investigator and institution 
agree to immediately notify the Sponsor, to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all 
relevant documents, and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector 
to discuss findings and any relevant issue s. 
10 INFORMATION DISCLOSUR E AND INVENTIONS  
10.1 Ownership 
All information provided by Auspex, and all data and information generated by a study site 
and/or by Auspex’s contractors and subcontractors as part of the study (other than a study 
subject’s medical records), are the sole property of Auspex. 
All rights, title and interests in any inventions, discoveries, know-how and other intellectual or 
industrial property rights which are conceived or reduced to practice during the course of or as a 
result of the study are the sole property of Auspex and are hereby assigned to Auspex. 
If any written contract is executed between Auspex and the study site for the conduct of the 
study, or between Auspex and a contractor for support of the study, and such contract includes 
ownership provisions that are inconsistent with or otherwise differ from the foregoing sentence, 
then with respect to such inconsistency or difference, that contract’s ownership provisions 
regarding inventions and other intellectual or industrial property rights shall control. 
10.2 Confidentiality 
All information provided by Auspex and all data and information generated by the site as part of 
the study, (other than a subject’s medical records), will be kept confidential by the Investigator 
and other site staff.  The Investigator or other site personnel will not use this information and 
data for any purpose other than conducting the study.  These restrictions do not apply to: (1) 
information which becomes publicly available through no fault of the Investigator or site staff; 
(2) information which it is necessary to disclose in confidence to an IEC solely for the evaluation 
of the study; (3) information which it is necessary to disclose in order to provide appropriate 
medical care to a study subject; or (4) study results which may be published as described in the 
next paragraph.  If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes confidentiality 
provisions inconsistent with this statement is executed, that contract’s confidentiality provisions 
shall apply rather than this statement. 
10.3 Publication 
Auspex recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data and therefore 
encourages publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals and at seminars or conferences.  The 
details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts and presentations based 
on the data from this trial are described in the Clinical Trial Agreement.

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   Methodology:  
Part A: 
Part A  is a multicenter, open -label, multiple -dose, dose -escalation study in patient s with advanced solid 
tumors  likely to harbor DNA damage repair deficiencies susceptible to treatment with poly (ADP -ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor or known to be responsive to programmed cell death -1 (PD-1) blocker. Five 
combination dose levels (DLs) are planned. The study will follow a 3+3 dose -escalation scheme. The dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT) assessments will be evaluated during the fir st cycle consisting of the first 21 days of 
treatment. The Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC), consisting of investigators, the sponsor’s medical 
delegate, safety delegate, and the contract research organization’s (CRO) medical monitor,  will evaluate 
safety  data after patient s have completed at least one cycle of treatment in order to make a decision on dose -
escalation, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) . 
The SMC may decide to evaluate an intermediate, n ot pre -defined, previously evaluated or not previously -
evaluated dose or a less frequent dosing schedule that will not exceed the MTD level, if evaluation of toxicity 
at such a dose or schedule is desired. If this approach is taken, up to 6 new patient s should be enrolled at that 
dose or schedule.  
Starting dose and dose -escalation rules  
In all dose levels, tislelizumab  will be administered as an intravenous ( IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 21 -day 
cycle, and pamiparib  will be taken orally twice daily  starting from Day 1. The starting dose for each agent 
and the starting DL of the combination was based on the doses evaluated in the on -going monotherapy dose -
escalation study for each agent and is significantly lower than the highest safe dose that has been identi fied 
to date. The study will follow a 3+3 dose -escalation scheme at the pre -defined DLs until MTD and/or RP2D 
is determined for the combination. At least 3  patient s will be enrolled into each cohort. Additional patient (s), 
up to a maximum of six (6)  patien ts in total, will be enrolled. The DLT assessment and dose -escalation scheme 
will follow the same principle as stipulated for a 3+3 dose escalation design . When a minimum of 2 patient s 
experience DLT at a given DL, this DL will be defined as intolerable. T he MTD is the DL at which 0/6 or 1/6 
patient s experience DLT with at least two patient s experiencing DLT at the next higher DL. 
Part B 
Part B will evaluate the safety and tolerability and anti -tumor activity of tislelizumab  + pamiparib  treatment 
in the arms of specific tumor types defined below . The  RP2D is tislelizumab  200 mg IV Q3W + pamiparib  
40 mg orally twice daily . Each arm will enroll approximately 20 patients. All p atients must have received 
standard of care in the primary treatment of their dise ase. Patients with platinum -refractory disease are 
excluded.  Platinum -refractory disease is defined as progressive disease at the time of the first tumor 
assessment while receiving a platinum -containing therapy. Enrollment into these disease -specific coho rts will 
occur simultaneously and independent of each other . 
Arm 1a: Patients with relapsed, platinum -sensitive high grade epithelial, non -mucinous, ovarian cancer, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC) with  either known germline or somatic 
BRCA1/2  mutations or with  homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Patients must have 
received at least 2 prior lines of platinum -containing  chemotherapy   
Arm 1b: Patients with relapsed, platinum -sensitive high grade EOC without  either known germline or 
somatic BRCA1/2  mutations and without  known HRD. Patients must have received at least 2 prior 
lines of platinum -containing chemotherapy.  
Arm 2: Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with either known  germline or somatic BRCA1/2  
mutations or with documented  HRD.  Patients can have been treated with at least  1 but not more 
than 3  prior lines of treatment .   
Arm 3: Patients with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with either known  germline 
or somatic BRCA1/2  mutations or with documented  HRD. Chemotherapy -naïve patients must have 
received prior abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment  
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 6 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   Arm 4: Patients with extensive -stage disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated at least 1 and not more 
than 2 prior lines of treatm ent; at least 1 regimen must include a platinum agent  
Arm 5: Patients with  HER2 -negative  gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer .  Patients with HER2 -
negative disease may be  treated with at least 1 but no more than 2 prior lines of treatment .  
Arm 6: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial (muscle invasive bladder, ureter, urethra or 
renal pelvis) cancer treated with at least 1 but no more than  2 prior lines of treatment , including a 
prior platinum -containing  chemotherapy  
Arm 7: Patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with at least 1 but no more 
than 2  prior lines of treatment . Any potential patient with a known deleterious germline or somatic 
BRCA  is eligible even if platinum -naïve  
Arm 8: Patients w ho may be expected to benefit from the combination of a PARP inhibitor and a PD -1 
inhibitor. This arm will include patients with recurrent non -ovarian gynecological cancers 
(endometrial cancer, cancer of the cervix and patients with tumors known to be mism atch repair 
deficient [MMR] or HRD positive ) that are not eligible for inclusion in any other arms of the trial. 
This is an exploratory signal seeking arm and is closed to enrollment.  
 
For Arm 1 (ovarian cancer), Arm 2 (TNBC), and Arm 3 (mCRPC), patients w ith known eligible mutation 
status can be enrolled into the study if otherwise eligible. Tissue/blood specimens will be collected for a 
confirmatory test. Patients who do not have known germline or somatic BRCA  mutation, or known HRD 
status must sign a separate pre -screening informed consent to evaluate HRD status prior to enrollment.  
For Arm 1 (EOC), Arm 1a may be analyzed independently of Arm 1b. All Arms will enroll up to 40  patients.  
Arm 8 is closed to enrollment . 
Fresh blood samples will be collected at baseline and at defined times as indicated for all patients in Part B 
for the evaluation of germline mutations, which may include BRCA  mutations and/or confirmation of prior 
BRCA  results  or other homolog ous recombination  deficiency mutations. All patients enrolled in Part B must 
submit archival tumor tissue, unless previously discussed with sponsor’s medical monitor or its designee. A 
fresh biopsy of an accessible tumor lesion is required at baseline (wit hin 12 weeks of starting treatment) in 
the absence of archival tumor tissue, unless previously discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor or its 
designee. Optional tumor biopsies will also be obtained in consenting  patients to evaluate the 
pharmacodynami c effects and resistance mechanisms .  
Part A and Part B  
Patient s will be monitored for safety, tolerability, anti -tislelizumab  antibodies, and anti -tumor activity 
throughout the study from the day of first adminis tration of study drugs up to 30 days following last study 
treatment or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first . Radiological assessment of tumor 
response should be performed approximately every 9  ± 1 weeks in the first year and approxi mately every 
12 ± 1 weeks thereafter.  
Tumor response will be assessed by investigators based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST ) Version 1.1. For  patient s with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, investigators 
may also incorporate GCIG CA-125 response criteria with RECIST Version 1.1 response criteria in assessing 
tumo r response. For patient s with prostate cancer, Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG 3) 
criteria  will also be used to evaluate prostate -specific antigen ( PSA) and modified R ECIST responses.  
Accumulating evidence indicates some patient s treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit 
despite initial evide nce of progressive disease (PD) . Patient s will be permitted to continue study treatment 
beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined PD for the time periods below and if they meet the following criteria:  
 Investigator -assessed clinical benefit  
 Patient  is tolerating study drug and agre es to continued study treatment  
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 7 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential    Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status  0 or 1  (Protocol Appendix  3) 
 Absence of rapid progression of  disease or of progressive tumo r at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord 
compression) that necessitates urgent alternativ e medical intervention  
 Patients must be  reconsented to continue study treatment beyond disease progression.  
For suspected pseudo -progression, treatment may continu e until confirmation of PD with repeat imaging at 
least 4 weeks later or at the next regularly scheduled imaging time point, but not more than 12 weeks from 
the initial documentation of pseudo -progression.  All decisions to continue treatment beyond initial  
progression must be documented in the medical record, and agreed to by the sponsor medical monitor .  
This study will be considered complete once all patient s have manifested disease progression; ceased study 
treatment  due to death; exhibit intolerance; wi thdrawn consent from the study; or completed a total of 2  years 
of treatment. Any patient  in this study who continues to demonstrate objective clinical benefit at the end of a 
2-year treatment duration may continue in the study or on treatment.  
Planned Nu mber 
of Patient s: Part A: Approximately 50 patient s for the dose escalation  until MTD and/or RP2D 
determination . 
Part B: Up to  approximately  200 patients  for expansion in arms of specific tumor 
types .  Each Arm will be evaluated independently for study endpoints and can either 
be closed due to suboptimal clinical anti -tumor activity  or expanded by enrolling an 
additional 20 patients if sufficient anti-tumor activity (eg, higher objective response 
rate [O RR] or longer progression -free survival [PFS] than expected) is observed .  
Statistical justification of such sample size expansion will be included in the final 
statistical analysis plan as applicable .

Test Product, Dose 
and Mode of 
Administration:  Drugs:  Combination of tislelizumab  and pamiparib  
Tislelizumab  will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 -60 minutes; once every 
3 weeks (Q3W) (see Protocol Section 6.2 for instructions).  
Pamiparib  will be administered orally, twice daily.  
In both Parts A and B of the study, tislelizumab  will be administered as an IV infusion 
on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle, and pamiparib  will be taken orally twice daily  starting 
from Day 1.  
Part A: Proposed Dose levels:  
Level  1: tislelizumab , 2 mg/kg IV Q3W, pamiparib , 20 mg orally twice daily  
Level  2: tislelizumab , 2 mg/kg IV Q3W, pamiparib , 40 mg orally twice daily  
Level  3: tislelizumab , 2 mg/kg IV Q3W, pamiparib , 60 mg orally twice daily  
Level  4: tislelizumab , 200 mg IV Q3W, pamiparib , 40 mg orally twice daily  
Level 5: tislelizumab , 200 mg IV Q3W, pamiparib , 60 mg orally twice daily  
The proposed DLs may be further modified and additional doses may be considered 
based on the safety, tolerability, and efficacy observed during dose escalation, ie, flat 
dose of tislelizumab  at 200 mg or 300  mg IV Q3W. An intermediate, not pre -defined, 
previously evaluated or not previously evaluated do se or a less frequent dosing

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   schedule that will not exceed the MTD level, if evaluation of toxicity at such a dose 
or schedule is desired.  
Part B:  
Tislelizumab : 200  mg IV Q3W  
Pamiparib : 40 mg orally twice daily  
This combination will be given until disease progression or other discontinuation 
criteria are met.  
Reference 
Therapy, Dose and 
Mode of 
Administration:  Not applicable  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Part  A: 
Primary Endpoints : 
 Safety and tolerability as assessed by the incidence and nature of AEs  
 Incidence and nature of DLTs  
 Determination of maximum tolerated dose of the combination of tislelizumab  and pamiparib  
Secondary Endpoints : 
 Pharmacokinetic parameters,  includ ing but not limited to C trough of tislelizumab  and C max, Tmax and 
Ctrough of pamiparib  
 Efficacy pa rameters including:  
o Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as a best overall response of complete response ( CR) and 
partial response  (PR) 
o Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as a best overall response of CR, PR and stable disease ( SD) 
o Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as a best overall response of CR, PR and SD lasting 
≥ 24 weeks  
o PFS is defined as the time from first dose of study med ication to the first documented objective 
disease progression or death due to an y cause, whichever occurs first  
o Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to death due 
to any cause  
 Immunogenicity of tislelizumab  
Exploratory Endpoints : 
 
Part  B:

BeiGene Ltd.  Page 15 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   Secondary Endpoints : 
 Safety and tolerability as assessed by the incidence and nature of AEs  
 Pharmacokinetic parameters,  includ ing but not limited to C trough of tislelizumab  and pamiparib  
 Immunogenicity of tislelizumab  
 
Statistical Methods:  
Data will be listed and summarized according to the sponsor -agreed reporting standards, where applicable.  
All patient s (both parts ) who are exposed to (or started receiving) the combination agents  will be included in 
the safety analysis set. All patient s for whom valid tislelizumab  or pamiparib  PK parameters can be estimated 
will be included in the PK analysis set on an a s-treated basis.  
As described in the objectives, the trial is designed to establish the safety and tolerability of tislelizumab  and 
pamiparib  combination and to assess the preliminary anti -tumor  activity of t he combination in selected tumo r 
types. No form al hypothesis testing is planned. Descriptive statistical analyses will be performed for all 
patient s in the safety analysis set . The safety and efficacy (eg , ORR, PFS, DOR, DCR, CBR and OS) data 
will be presented by part and arm.  
Sample Size:  
Number of patient s in Part A will depend on the incidence of DLT reported. Approximately 50 patient s are 
expected in Part A of the trial.  
Part B will include expansion arms of specific tumor types.  Up to  approximately  40 patients per cohort  may 
be enrolled .  The purpose of these expansion arms  is to explore signals of clinical efficacy as well as to 
confirm the safety and tolerability of the combination in each selected tumor type. Anti -tumor activity will be 
evaluated in Part B . A decision can be made to stop an arm early due to suboptimal clinical anti -tumor activity .  
Up to a total of 40  patient s may be enrolled in any disease cohort to evaluate the anti-tumor activity if evidence 
of activity is observed  in the first 20 patients enrolled . 
The probability of observing at least one responder is approximately 88% in an expansion arm (n  = 20) when 
the underlying ORR is as low as 10%.

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background and Pharmacology  
The i mmune check point -inhibitory receptor, programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) is mainly 
expressed in activated T -cells including cluster of differentiation  (CD) 8+ cytotoxic T -
lymphocytes and CD4+ T -helper lymphocytes . [1] It is believed that PD -1 plays an important 
role in immune modulation of tumor progressi on by regulating the key inhibitory signaling in 
the T -cells when engaged by its ligands.  The PD -1 signaling cascade negatively regulates T -
cell receptor (TCR) and attenuate s T-cell proliferation and functional activities, leading to T -
cell exhaustion.  PD-1 expression is markedly up -regulated in tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes  
(TILs) , whil e the expression of PD -1 ligand  (PD-L1) is significantly increased in tumor cells 
and tumor -associated immune cells in the presence of stimulating cytokines such as interfe ron 
gamma (IFN -γ) and interferon alpha (IFN -α) in the tumor microenvironment . [2] Furthermore, 
the increased PD -1 expression in TILs  and/or PD -L1 expression in tumor and tumor -associated 
stromal cells is observed in many types of solid human tumors including, but not limi ted to, 
melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), uveal melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), head and neck squamous  cell carcinoma (HNSCC), triple negative breast cancer 
(TNBC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, and prosta te cancer . 
[3-11] These findings provi de the basis for cancer immunotherapeutic intervention via the 
approach of antagonizing PD -1. 
Recent clinical trials utilizing anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated significant 
therapeutic efficacy in advanced melanoma, refractory NSCLC, and RCC. Ni volumab 
(OPDIVO) has 7 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indications: unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma, metastatic NSCLC, RCC, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and SCC of the 
head and neck, and advanced urothelial cancer. Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA) h as 4 FDA -
approved indications: unresectable or metastatic melanoma, metastatic NSCLC, recurrent or 
metastatic HNSCC, and refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both pediatric and adults. 
Atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ) has 2 FDA -approved indications: advanced  urothelial cancer 
and metastatic NSCLC . 
2.1.1 Tislelizumab  
Tislelizumab  is a humanized IgG4 -variant monoclonal antibody against PD -1. Tislelizumab  
has been manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) quality control systems.  
The clinical trial drug product is formulated in an aqueous buffer with pH 6.5 and isotonic 
osmolality.  The suggested administration route is intravenous (IV) infusion after the 
appropriate dilution in 0.9% sodium chloride solution.  
Tislelizumab  binds to the extracellular domain of human PD -1 with high specificity and 
affinity (K D = 0.15  nM) as demonstrated by the receptor -binding assays based on surface 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 29 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   plasmon resonance (SPR).  It competitively blocks the binding of both PD -L1 and PD -L2, 
inhibiting PD -1-mediated negative signalin g in T -cells.  In in vitro  cell-based assays, the 
humanized antibody consistently and dose -dependently enhances the functional activity of 
human T -cells and pre -activated, primary PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells).  In 
addition, tislelizumab  demonst rated anti -tumor activity in several human cancer allogeneic 
xenograft models, including A431 human epidermoid carcinoma, BCCO -028 colon cancer, 
and BCLU -054 NSCLC models, where the PBMCs were co -injected with the human cancer 
cells (A431) or the tumor fra gments (BCCO -028 and BCLU -054) into the 
immunocompromised mice.  
The IgG4 -variant antibody has very low binding affinity to Fcγ RIIIA and C1q by in vitro  
assays, suggesting a low or no antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement -
dependent cytoto xicity  (CDC) effect in humans.  Unlike  the natural IgG4 antibody, tislelizumab  
has no observable Fab -Arm Exchange activity by the in vitro  assay, predicting the antibody 
would be stable in vivo , unlikely forming a bispecific antibody.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more detailed information on the background of 
tislelizumab . [12] 
2.1.2 Pamiparib  
Poly (ADP -ribose) polymera se (PARP) proteins are involved in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
replication, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. DNA -bound PARP1/2 
catalyzes the synthesis of poly (ADP -ribose) (PAR) onto a range of DNA -associated proteins 
that mediate DNA rep air. PARP1 also undergoes auto -PARylation, a molecular change that 
ultimately leads to its release from DNA. Inhibition of PARP converts common single -strand 
DNA breaks (SSBs) into double -strand breaks during DNA replication. Small -molecule 
inhibitors of P ARP1/2 represent a class of anticancer agents that exert their cytotoxic effects 
by interfering with DNA repair mechanisms. Since the discovery of synthetic lethality of 
PARP inhibitors in BRCA -deficient cells and, more broadly, cells with homologous 
recom bination deficiency (HRD), accumulation of unrepaired SSBs resulting from catalytic 
PARP inhibition has been considered central to the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors. 
More recently, it has been demonstrated that PARP inhibitors also trap PARP1 - and PARP2 -
DNA complexes at DNA damage sites and that PARP trapping can be more cytotoxic than 
unrepaired SSBs . 
Recent data supports the evaluation of PARP inhibitors in solid tumors  carrying mutations in 
BRCA1  and BRCA2 . Mutations of BRCA1  and BRCA2 , two tumor suppressor genes, predispose 
cells to increased risk of malignancies, particularly breast and ovarian cancer. Mutations in 
BRCA1 and BRCA2  were identified in up to 10% of pancreas adenocarcinoma patients  with a 
higher incidence in those who had  a family history . [13, 14] Recent seque ncing data indicates 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 30 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   that approximately 20% of mCRPC have  homologous recombination (HR) defects due to 
germline and  /or somatic loss of function in key HR genes including BRCA2 , ATM , CHEK2 , 
NSBP1 , and FANCJ , that could potentially confer a ‘BRCA -like’ phenotype and susceptibility 
to PARP inhibition via synthetic lethality.  [15-18] 
In the clinic, PARP inhibitors  (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib ) have 
demonstrated sustained anti -tumor responses as a single agent in patients with BRCA1 - or 
BRCA2 -mutant tumors, with an acceptable  safety profile.   
Pamiparib  is a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 . Single agent pamiparib  
demonstrated excellent in vivo  anti-tumor activity, 16 -fold more po tent than olaparib, in 
MDA -MB-436 breast cancer ( BRCA1 mutation) xenograft model . In 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study, oral administrat ion of pamiparib  resulted in 
time-dependent and dose -dependent inhibition of PARylation in MDA -MB-436 breast cancer 
xenografts in mice. Inhibition of PARylation in the tumor tissues correlated well with tumor 
drug concentrations of pamiparib . 
In combination studies, pamiparib  and paclitaxel in combination showed better anti -tumor 
activity than either single agent in primary gastric cancer model. In  primary SCLC model, 
pamiparib  significantly enhanced  the anti -tumor activity of chemotherapy (etoposide plus 
carboplatin) during the concomitant treatment stage, and kept animals tumor -free throughout 
the maintenance treatment.   
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the background of pamiparib . [19]  
2.1.3 Tislelizumab  and Pamiparib  combination  
This study will investigate the safety, PK, and anti -tumor activity of the combination 
tislelizumab  and pamiparib  in patient s with tumors likely to harbor DNA damage repair 
deficiencies and which have already shown responsiveness to checkpoint inhibition . This trial 
will evaluate the hypothesis that pamiparib  treatment in these susceptible tumors may lead to  
the release of neo -antigens and increase the antigenicity of tumors, whic h may boost the 
efficacy of tislelizumab .   
There are several reports describing a direct link between DNA damage and immune response.  
[20, 21] The DNA damage response alerts the innate immune system by inducing the 
expres sion of ligands for activating the immune receptor NKG2D. NKG2D plays an important 
role in the natural killer (NK) and T -cell-mediated immune response to tumors. [22] In 
addition, the specific killing of BRCA  mutant or HRD tumor cells by PARP inhibitors can lead 
to release of neo -antigen and immune activation against the tumor, as demonstrated in 
preclinical experiments in both ovarian and breast cancers, supporting investigating the 
combination of a PARP inhibitor and a PD -1 inhibitor .  
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 31 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   An in vitro  study on murine epithelial ovarian cancer cell line reported that administration of 
modest amounts of talazoparib, a potent PARP -1 inhibitor belonging to the same class as 
pamiparib , significantly  improved the survival of mice bearing subcutaneo us or intraperitoneal 
tumors. [23] Talazoparib was found to have signiﬁcantly increased the number of peritoneal 
CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as their production of IFN -γ and tumor 
necrosis factor alpha  (TNF -α). The cell stress caused by talazoparib induced not only cancer 
cell-intrinsic apoptosis but also cancer cell -extrinsic anti -tumor immune effects in a syngeneic 
murine model of ovarian cancer . [23] These changes may enhance the anti -tumor immune 
response and lead to synergy of antitumor activity between a PARP inhibitor and anti -PD-1 
antibodies.  
Homologous recombination  deficient high grade s erous ovarian cancers, including BRCA1/2 -
mutated tumors, exhibit higher neo -antigen load compared to HR proficient tumors. In the 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, BRCA1/2 -mutated tumors were associated with a 
higher ratio of CD8+/CD4+ in tumor -infiltrat ing lymphocytes (TILs), higher peri -tumoral T -
cells, and increased PD -L1 expression.  [24] These characteristics have been associated with 
better responses to anti -PD-1/PD -L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, a recent 
study using breast cancer cell lines, xenograft and sy ngeneic tumors provided evidence for 
cross talk between PARP inhibition and tumor -associated immunosuppression. PARP 
inhibition upregulates tumor cell PD -L1 expression, which attenuates PARPi efficacy via PD -
1/PD -L1 signalin g associated immunosuppression . [25] The blockade of PD -L1 can restore 
the attenuated anti -tumor immunity and potentiate PARPi in tumor suppression. The efﬁcacy 
of PD -1 pathway bl ockade correlates with DNA repair pathway mutations and neo -antigen 
burden . [26] In conclusion, platinum -sensitive tumors that are known to respond  to PARP 
inhibitors are likely to show enhanced sensitivity to the combination of PARP inhibitor and 
anti-PD-1 therapy.  
Clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of a PARP inhibitor in combination with a 
PD-1 or a PD -L1 inhibitor are ongoing ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED];  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Results from a Phase 1 study of durvalumab 
combi ned with olaparib are available (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) . [27] 
Grade  3 or higher adverse events were reported as lymphopenia in 2 of 12 treated patient s and 
anemia in one patient . The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in this study was determined 
to be olaparib 300  mg twice daily with 1500  mg durvalumab IV every 28 days. The preliminary 
data from the BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study _001 and the data published by Lee, et al suggest 
that the checkpoint inhibitor + PARP inhibitor combination has an acceptable toxicity profile . 
[27] 
The selection of disease -specific cohorts in Phase 1B is based on pathologic subtypes that may 
be associated with endogenous  loss of DNA damage repair or exogenous DNA damage. 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 32 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   Endogenous mutational damage and exogenous DNA damage may limit cancer cells ’ capacity 
to carry out DNA repair  making cancer cells susceptible to PARP inhibition. Moreover, high 
somatic nonsynonymous muta tion burden has been associated with clinical efficacy of PD -1 
inhibition.  [28] The combination of pamiparib  and tislelizumab  may exploit the potential 
accumulation of DNA damage from PARP inhibition, which in turn may increase infiltration 
of immune cells into the tumo r microenvironment, thereby increasing cancer cell killing. 
Section  2.5.2  describes each pathology in detail.  
2.2 Overview of Clinical Pharmacology  
2.2.1 Tislelizumab  
The first-in-human study  BGB -A317 _001 is a 2 -part study: Part A is a dose escalation 
evaluation and Part 2  is a schedule expansion  evaluation . One hundred and three patient s 
received at least one dose of tislelizumab  in the Phase 1A part  of the  study, ranging from 
0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg Q2W (n  = 62) and from 2 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg Q3W (n  = 41). The 
maximum tolerated dose  (MTD) was not reached and 10 mg/kg Q2W was the maximum 
administered dose (MAD). The RP2D was determined to 200  mg IV Q3W for the Ph ase 1B 
(indication expansion) study.  
An interim PK analysis  (with a cutoff date of 08 October  2016 ) was conduct ed by non -
compartmental analysis methods , using serum concentrations from patients who received 
doses of 0.5, 2, 5 and 10  mg/kg Q2W and pa tients  who received doses of 2 and 5  mg/kg Q3W 
(Phase 1a Part  1 and Part 2) . The maximum observed plasma concentration  (Cmax) and the drug 
exposure (the area under the concentration -time curve [AUC]) increased in a nearly dose -
proportional manner from 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg /kg, both after single -dose administration and 
at steady state. Population PK analysis was conducted with a 2 -compartment model with first 
order elimination. Systemic clearance of tislelizumab  was 0.007 94 L/h, volume of distribution 
in the central  and peripheral compartment were 2.7 5 and 1. 65 L, respectively, and terminal 
elimination half -life was approximately  17 days. Clear drug accumulation was observed after 
multiple doses  
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the background of tislelizumab . [12] 
2.2.2 Pamiparib  
By 08 April 2016, the dose escalation phase of the BGB -290-AU-002 study had completed. 
Doses at 2.5, 5, 10 , 20, 40, 60, 80 and 120 mg twice daily  have been evaluated in 45 patient s. 
The MTD and RP2D were determined to be 80 mg twice daily  and 60 mg twice daily , 
respectively.  In the Phase  1 study, interim PK data of pamiparib  showed that pamiparib  is 
rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. The C max and the drug exposure 
(AUC) increased in a nearly dose -proportional manner from 2.5 mg twice daily  to 120 mg 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 33 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   twice daily  both after the single dose administration and at the steady state.  The terminal half -
life was determined to be approximately 13 h ours, with a range of 5. 5 to 34 hours. At the steady 
state, from 2.5 mg twice daily  to 120 mg twice daily , drug exposure was increased in dose -
dependent manner. At 80 mg twice daily  (MTD), mean steady state AUC 0-24h was 78,348  
ng/ml*h and mean C max was 4,881  ng/ml. Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the 
background of pamiparib . [19] 
2.3 Overview of Safety and Efficacy  
2.3.1 BGB-A317  Study -001 
2.3.1.1  Study BGB -A317_ Study_ 001 Phase 1a  
As of 13 January 2017, 111 patients with solid tumors have been treated with tislelizumab  in 
Study BGB -A317_ Study_ 001 for Parts 1, 2, and 3 combined. Patient s had received 
tislelizumab  treatment in Phase 1a at dose regimens including: 0.5 mg /kg, 2 mg /kg, 5 mg /kg, 
or 10 mg/kg  Q2W ; 2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg Q3W; and 200  mg Q3W. The median duration of 
treatment for the combi ned patient  population was 85 days (range: 1 to 471).  
As of 13 January 2017, an MTD has not been determined.  The RP2D was established as fixed 
dose of 200 mg IV Q3W.  
The fixed dose of 200 mg was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies and available 
clinical data. Simulations do not suggest any cli nically meaningful differences in exposure 
following fixed dose or dose adjusted for weight. On the basis of this analysis, a fixed dose of 
200 mg was selected (equivalent to a body weight−based dose of 3.3 mg/kg, calculated with 
60 kg). Selection of an ev ery-21-day dosing interval is both supported by this preliminary 
pharmacokinetics evaluation and allows for a convenient integration with common 
chemotherapeutic regimens. All available PK, sa fety, and efficacy data for tislelizumab  will 
continue to be eva luated to support the 200  mg fixed dose.  
Of the 111 patient s in the Safety Analysis set for Phas e 1a of Study BGB -A317_ Study_ 001, 
110 (99%) experienced at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). The most 
commonly occurring TEAEs for patient s trea ted with the tislelizumab  monotherapy in Study 
BGB -A317_ Study _ 001 were fatigue (42%), nausea (31%), diarrhoea (24%), abdominal pain 
(21%), constipation (21%), back pain (18%), and decreased appe tite (18%). TEAEs assessed 
as ≥ Grade 3 were experienced in 4 5 patient s (41%). Grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurring in 
more than 3 patient s included abdominal pain (6 patient s, 5%), anaemia (5 patient s, 5%), back 
pain (4 patient s, 4%) and fatigue (4 patient s, 4%).  
Treatment -emergent AEs assessed as related to tislelizu mab by the Investigator occurred in 
72% of patients across all parts of Phase 1a. Adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of 
patient s assessed as related to tislelizumab  included fatigue (23%), pruritus (13%), diarrhoea

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   (13%), rash (12%), and nausea ( 10%). Twelve patients (11%) had at least 1 TEAE  assessed as 
related to tislelizumab  that were ≥ Grade 3 in severity. These included colitis (n  = 1), 
autoimmune pancreatitis (n  = 1), fatigue (n  = 2), back pain (n  = 1), alanine aminotransferase 
increased (n  = 1), diabetes mellitus (n  = 1), diabetic ketoacidosis (n  = 2), hyperglycemia 
(n = 1), pneumonitis (n  = 1), hypotension (n  = 2). Some patients experienced more than one ≥ 
Grade 3 TEAE that was considered related to tislelizumab . 
Forty -six patient s (41%) ha d a treatment -emergent serious AE (TESAE). The most frequently 
occurring TESAEs included abdominal pain (5 patient s, 5%), colitis (4 patient s, 4%), and 
ascites, dyspnea, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism (3 patient s each, 3%).  
In the overall safety popu lation available for analysis, 14 patient s (13%) experienced a TEAE 
that led to treatment discontinuation. The most frequently occurring TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation included dyspnoea (2%), pneumonitis (2%), and anaemia (2%). All 
other TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation occurred in single patient s. Of these TEAEs 
that led to treatment discontinuation, 8 (7%) were Grade 3 or greater in severity. The only 
TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation ≥ Grade 3 in severi ty that occurred in m ore than 
1 patient  was dyspnoea (2 patient s, 2%).  
In the overall safety population, 22 patient s (20%) experienced a treatment -emergent  immune -
related adverse event (irAE) . The most frequently occurring irAEs  included colitis (4 patient s, 
4%), diarrhoea (3  patient s, 3%), hypothyroidism (3 patient s, 3%), and diabetes mellitus, 
diabetic ketoacidosis, and pneumonitis (2 patient s each, 2%). All other irAEs occurred in single 
patient s. 
Five patient s (5%) experienced a Grade 3 or Grade 4 irAE . These events  included colitis 
(n = 1), diarrhea  (n = 1), diabetes mellitus (n  = 1), diabetic ketoacidosis (n  = 2), pneumonitis 
(n = 1), autoimmune pancreatitis (n  = 1), type 1 diabetes mellitus (n  = 1). These toxicities are 
similar to those reported for other checkpoi nt inhibitors targeting PD -1 or PD -L1. 
As of 13 January 2017, there were 3 patients had a TEAE with a fatal outcome. The associated 
PTs for these events were fatigue, multi -organ failure, and dyspnoea. None of the TEAEs with 
a fatal outcome were considered  related to tislelizumab  treatment.  
Of the 111 patients enrolled to the Phase 1a study, 14 patient s (13%) achieved a partial 
response and 21 patient s had a best response of stable disease.  
2.3.1.2  Study BGB -A317_ Study_ 001 Phase 1b  
As of 13 January 2017, 189 patie nts with solid tumors had received tislelizumab  treatment in 
Phase 1b across 9  expansion cohorts in Study BGB -A317_ Study_ 001. The median duration of 
treatment for the combi ned patient  population was 64 days (range: 1 to 235). The most 
commonly occurring TEAEs were fatigue (22%), nausea (18%), decreased appetite (14%),

in more than 3 patient s included vomiting ( n = 5), pneumonia ( n = 5) anaemia ( n = 4), and 
ascites ( n = 4). 
Treatment -emergent AEs assessed as related to tislelizumab  reported ≥ 5% of patients included 
fatigue (9%), rash (5%), nausea (5%), and diarrhoea (5%). Eleven patients experienced 
≥ Grade 3  TEAEs related to tislelizumab . These events included nausea (n  = 1), diarrhea 
(n = 2), colitis (n  = 2), stomatitis (n  = 1), fatigue (n  = 1), mucosal inflammation (n  = 1), 
pneumonitis  (n = 3), and hyperthyroidism (n  = 1). Some patients experienced more than one 
≥ Grade 3 TEAE considere d related to tislelizumab .   
Twenty  patient s (11%) experienced a TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation ; Grade 3 or 
higher TEAE were reported in 18 of these 20 patient s. TEAE s leading to treatment 
discontinuation  reported in at least 2 patient s included pneumonitis ( n = 3) and vomiting 
(n = 2). All other TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation occurred in single patient s. 
Nineteen patient s (10%) experienced an irAE . The most frequently occurring irAEs included 
pneumonitis ( n = 4); aspartate aminotransferase increase d, hyperthyroidism, and rash 
(3 patient s each); and colitis, dermatitis, diarrhoea, and hypothyroidism (2 patient s each). All 
other irAEs occurred in single patient s. Eight  of these 19  patient s experienced a ≥  Grade 3 
irAE .  
Preliminary efficacy results indicate  6 patient s achieved  confirmed partial response to 
tislelizumab  monotherapy and 55 patient s had stable disease.  
2.3.2 Pamiparib  
Pamiparib  as a monotherapy  is being evaluated in two Phase 1a studies (BGB -290-AU-002 in 
Austral ia, n = 53 [as of 30 September 2016]  and BGB -290-102 in China, n  = 8 [as of 13  March  
2017 ]. The study data from BGB -290-AU-002 is the most mature and key interim results are 
summarized below.  
2.3.2.1  Clinical Safety and Preliminary Efficacy for BGB -290-AU-002 
BGB -290-AU-002 is a first -in-human trial evaluating pamiparib  to characterize the safety, the 
MTD, preliminary anti -tumor activity and the PK of pamiparib  given as a monotherapy in a 
3+3 dose escalation scheme. Pamiparib  was administered in doses ranging f rom 2.5 mg orally  
twice daily  up to 120 mg orally twice daily . 
The study is being conducted in 5 Australian study centers, and preliminary data for 45 patient s 
of Part 1A are available (cut -off date of 30 September 2016).  
The median age of enrolled patien ts was 58 years (range 37 to 74 years), 82% were female 
(n = 37) and 84% white (n  = 38). The baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 36 of 198

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   performance status score, available for 45 patient s, was 0 for 16 patient s, 1 for 28 patient s, and 
2 for one patient. The median of prior systemic anticancer therapies was 3 (range 1 to 9). Most 
common cancer types were gynecologic cancer (n  = 28; ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal), followed by breast cancer (n  = 4), lung cancer (n  = 4 [n = 3 small cell , n = 1 non -
small cell]), prostate cancer (n  = 2) and one each of adenocarcinoma (not otherwise specified), 
leiomyosarcoma, gastroesophageal junction cancer, and uterine cancer. The disease under 
study was not available for 4 patient s. 
The pharmacokineti c profile of pamiparib  indicates linear PK pa rameters with a half -life of 
13 hours. A dose -dependent trend in PAR inhibition in PBMCs was seen  from 2.5 mg to 10  mg 
twice daily , and was sustained at steady state at doses ≥ 10 mg twice daily . 
The preliminary  safety data indicates the most frequent AEs (≥ 10% of patient s) assessed as 
related to pamiparib  were nausea (51%, n  = 23), fatigue (29%, n  = 13), vomiting (18%, n  = 8), 
diarrhea (16%, n  = 7), and decreased appetite (11%, n  = 5). Twenty -six patient s exper ienced 
Grade 3 AEs (regardless of relatedness), and no Grade 4 AEs were reported. Eleven Grade 3 
AEs in 9 patient s (20%) were considered related to pamiparib : anemia (11%, n  = 5), 
neutropenia (7%, n  = 3), hypophosphatemia (2%, n  = 1), paresthesia (2%, n  = 1), nausea (2%, 
n = 1) and fatigue (2%, n  = 1).  
Hematologic AEs are of interest in this study. The most frequent hematologic AEs (≥ 10% of 
patient s) assessed as related to pamiparib  were anemia (22%, n  = 10) and neutropenia (11%, 
n = 5). Hematologic AEs, regardless of relatedness, were reported in 40% of patient s (n = 18). 
Anemia was most frequent (33%, n  = 15), followed by neutropenia (11%, n  = 5) and 
thrombocytopenia (2%, n  = 1). 
Serious AEs were reported in 25 patient s, and for 3 patien ts they were considered related to 
pamiparib : anemia (n  = 2) and nausea (n  = 1). Three patient s discontinued study drug because 
of an AE: vomiting (n  = 1), oral paresthesia (n  = 1), and right neck cutaneous metastases 
(n = 1). 
Four patient s experienced fatal AE s ≤ 28 days after the last pamiparib  dose. All deaths were 
due to complications of the underlying malignancy, and none  were considered related to 
pamiparib . 
Four patient s experienced AEs that were considered DLTs: experienced Grade 2 nausea that 
persisted despite optimal standard medical therapy in 2 patient s; Grade 2 anorexia and Grade  2 
nausea in one patient , and Grade 2 nausea and Grade 2 paresthesia in one patient . Based on the 
encountered DLTs and the overall safety profile of pamiparib , the maximum tolerated dose of 
pamiparib  was determined to be 80 mg orally  twice daily  (160 mg/day). The pamiparib  dose 
for further investigation in this study was determined to be 60  mg orally twice daily .

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are recognized adverse 
events in patient s receiving PARP inhibitors.  [29] To date, no cases of either MDS or AML 
have been observed in any study that includes pamiparib . 
Ten patient s achieved either a complete (n  = 2) or partial (n  = 8) response ; all responses were 
observed in patient s with gynecological cancers  in this ongoing study . 
2.3.2.2  Clinical Update of BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
As of 05 February 2018, a total of 49 patient s were treated in five dose level  (DL) , as detailed 
below :  
 DL 1:  tislelizumab  2 mg/kg IV Q3W  + pamiparib  20 mg orally twice daily  (n = 12) 
 DL 2: tislelizumab  2 mg/kg IV Q3W + pamiparib  40 mg orally twice daily  (n = 12) 
 DL 3: tislelizumab  2 mg/kg IV Q3W  + pamiparib  60 mg  orally twice daily  (n = 6) 
 DL 4: tislelizumab  200 mg IV Q3W  + pamiparib  40 mg orally twice daily  (n = 7)  
 DL 5: tislelizumab  200 mg IV Q3W + pamiparib  60 mg orally twice daily  (n = 4) 
Patient s enrolled in the study have a variety of solid tumors, including ovarian (n  = 20), 
fallopian tube (n  = 4), pancreatic (n  = 3), prostate (n  = 3), fallopian tube and ovarian (n  = 1), 
breast (n = 2), bile duct (n  = 1), bladder (n  = 1), cervical (n  = 1), lung (n  = 1), peripheral  nerve 
sheath tumor (n  = 1), peritoneal (n  = 1) and uterine cancer (n  = 1).  
Twenty -four patient s discontinued one or both study dru gs. Among these 24 patient s, 
20 patie nts discontinued the treatment due to either radiographic or  clinical disease 
progression. Four patient s discontinued tislelizumab  due to treatment related adverse events: 
autoimmune hepatitis or elevated liver function tests (n  = 3) and immune -related hyp ophysitis 
(n = 1). Of note, DLTs were defined only for the first cycle and, as these events occurred after 
the first cycle, they were not considered DLTs.   
2.3.2.3  Overview of Safety  
The most commonly reported (> 10 % of the patient s) treatment emergent adverse events 
regardless of the relationship were nausea (61%), fatigue (43.9%), vomiting (29.3%), diarrhea 
(26.8%), anemia (19.5%), headache (19.5%), constipation (17.1%), pyrexia (14.6%), urinary 
tract infection (14.6%), alanine aminotransferase increased (12.2 %), aspartate 
aminotransferase increased (12.2%), back pain (12.2%), cough (12.2%), gastro -oesophageal 
reflux disease (12.2%). Treatment emergent adverse events regardless of the relationship that 
were Grade ≥ 3 and reported in > 5% patient s were anemia (7 .3%), and gamma -glutamyl 
transferase increased (7.3%) . 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 38 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   The most commonly reported (>  10% of the patient s) treatment emergent adverse event that 
was considered related to both pamiparib  and tislelizumab  was fatigue (31.7% : 26.8% as Grade 
1, and 2.4% each fo r Grade 2 and Grade 3), and nausea (12.2% : 9.8% as Grade 1 and 2.4% as 
Grade 2).  
One dose limiting toxicity of Grade 2 persistent nausea was reported in a patient  treated in 
DL 4. Pamiparib  was dose reduced to 20 mg twice daily  and the patient continued combination 
treatment until radiographic disease progression  approximately 4 weeks  later. 
After  the data extraction, 2 additional dose-limiting toxicities were reported in DL 5. Dose -
limiting toxicities in DL 5 were  Grade 2 persistent nausea and Grade 4 auto -immune hepatitis . 
Study treatment was discontinued in both patient s. 
Pamiparib  60 mg twice daily /tislelizumab  200 mg Q3W was considered to be over MTD in 
this combination regimen. Dose L evel 4, pamiparib  40 mg twice daily /tislelizumab  200 mg 
Q3W, is being  further expanded.  
Immune -related adverse events were reported in 10 patient s (24.4%). Events that were reported 
in 2 or more patient s were elevated ALT (one each for Grade 1 and Grade 3), elevated AST 
(one each for Grade 1 and Grade 2), autoimmune hepatit is (one each for Grade 3 and Grade 
4), elevated GGT (one each for Grade 2 and Grade 3), and hypothyroidism (two for Grade  1 
and one for Grade 2). Immune -related adverse events that lead to tislelizumab  discontinuation 
occurred in 5 patient s: Grade 4 autoim mune hepatitis (n = 1), Grade 3 autoimmune hepatitis 
(n = 1), Grade 2 elevated AST and ALT (n = 1), Grade 3 hypophysitis  (n = 1) and Grade 3 
hepatitis  (n = 1). 
As of 10 April 2017, 12 of 43 patient s treated with the combination of tislelizumab  and 
pamiparib  experienced increases in liver function tests that were reported as adverse events of 
either elevated AST, ALT, hepatitis or auto -immune hepatitis. These events were clinically 
asymptomatic, and were characterized by a proportionally higher incre ase in alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) compared to aspartate aminotransferase (AST). No significant 
changes in bilirubin were observed. These hepatic adverse events were observed in all dosing 
cohorts. The median time to onset was 49 days (range 18 to 202 d ays).  The severity of these 
events was Grade 1 (n  = 1), Grade 2 (n  = 5), Grade 3 (n  = 4), and Grade 4 (n  = 2). Two patient s 
(one Grade 1 event, one Grade 2 event) did not receive corticosteroid treatment and continued 
study treatment with both agents with out consequence. For  the remaining 10  patient s, 
tislelizumab  was discontinued or held. Three of these 10 patient s had objective evidence of 
disease progression at the same time of the hepatic adverse events. Progressive disease did not 
seem to correlate wi th elevated liver function tests, and was not consistently associated with 
new liver metastases nor increases in existing liver metastases. tislelizumab  was discontinued 
in 6 out of the 12 patient s for hepatic adverse events and is  being held in one patien t. Pamiparib  
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 39 of 198

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   treatment was continued in 3 patient s, and permanently discontinued in 5 patient s for 
progressive disease (n  = 3) or th e hepatic adverse event (n  = 2). Four patient s were re -
challenged with pamiparib  (one patient  was re -challenged twice) following corticosteroid 
treatment and all 4 patient s experienced liver function tests ( LFT) increases with reinstatement 
of pamiparib . Of these 4 patient s, 2 discontinued treatment, and 2 were able to continue 
pamiparib  after add itional corticosteroid treatment at the same or a reduced dose of pamiparib .  
Fourteen patient s had at least one SAE reported , only auto -immune hepatitis and hypophysitis 
(one event each and as above) were considered related to treatment.  
There were 5  patients who died within 30  days of the last dose of study drug administration, 
all of which were associated with disease progression.  
2.3.2.4  Preliminary Anti -tumor activity  
Preliminary anti -tumor data suggests that the combination of pamiparib  +tislelizumab  results 
in tumor shrinkage. One complete response was reported in a patient  with ovarian cancer; 
7 patient s achieved a part ial response (ovarian cancer n  = 5; pancreatic cancer n  = 1; uterine 
cancer n  = 1). 
2.4 Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Tislelizumab  and pamiparib  are the investigational products with safety data gathered from 
non-clinical and Phase  1 clinical studies , as described above . The emerging data supports an 
acceptable safety profile of each agent given as monotherapy. The preliminary safety data 
generate d in the dose -escalation portion of this ongoi ng study indicates that the pamiparib  + 
tislelizumab  can be co -administered in the doses tested.  
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been reported in 
a small number (<  1%) of p atients treated with PARP inhibitors, especially in patients 
harboring a germline BRCA  mutation. [29] Patients who develop MDS and AML while on 
PARPi therapy typically had a history of extensive previous chemotherapy which is a 
recognized risk for MDS and AML . Patient s in this study will be monitored monthly for 
hematological toxicities and reports of MDS  and AML will be reported as serious adverse 
events (SAEs).  
Preliminary Phase 1 study data with durvalumab (MEDI4736 ) given concurrently with 
olaparib  supports the tolerability of a PARP + PD-L1 combination similar the treatment being 
investigated in this study.  [27] Patient s enrolled in clinical studies using the tislelizumab  and 
pamiparib  combination will continue to  be closely monitored by means of reporting AEs, 
recording vital signs and electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), and conducting clinical laboratory safety 
tests of blood and urine with particular attention paid to the safety profile of what is currently 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 40 of 198

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   known about both of these compounds  as well as what is known about the therapeutic classes 
of both checkpoint and PARP inhibitors.  
2.5 Study Rationale  
This is a 2-staged, Phase  1/1b study consisting of two parts, to evaluate the combined use of 
tislelizumab  and pamiparib . Part A of this study will evaluate safet y and  tolerability to 
determine the MTD and RP2D  for the combination  as well as whether the administration of 
pamiparib  given for 7 days prior to the initiation of tislelizumab  as a means to upregulate neo -
antigen an d PD -L1 production will be both tolerable and associated with anti -tumor activity . 
The PK profile, possibility of any potential drug-drug interaction  (DDI),  preliminary anti -
tumor activity of the combination, as well as host immunogenicity to tislelizumab  will also be 
studied.  Part B of this study will further evaluate the anti -tumor activity of the combination, its 
safety and PK profile, as well as host immunogenicity to tislelizumab . Preliminary biomarkers 
for efficacy will also be explored through both parts of the study.  
The study population used for both Parts  A and B of this study are patient s with tumors likely 
to harbor DNA damage repair deficiencies susceptible to treatment with PARP inhibitor  or in 
tumor types, which have already shown responsiven ess to PD -1 block ade. It is postulated that 
pamiparib  treatment in these susceptible tumors may lead to the release of neoantigens that 
could boost the efficacy of tislelizumab , as discussed in Section 2.1.3 . 
2.5.1 Rationale for Dose Selection  
Tislelizumab  and pamiparib  have demonstrated a n acceptable  toxicology and safety 
pharmacology profile individually, in clinical and non -clinical experiments. In  preclinical 
mouse MTD studies, the combination of pamiparib  and an anti -mouse  PD-1 antibody was very 
well-tolerated without any apparent toxicity compared to either single agent.  
The starting dose of pamiparib  was selected as 20  mg twice daily , 1/4 of the  monotherapy 
MTD dose (80  mg twice daily ) that has been deemed to be safe in the on -going Phase  1 dose -
escalation study. For  tislelizumab , 2 mg/kg Q3W was selected as starting dose  based on the 
efficacy and PK profile , which is significantly lower than the  MAD tested, 10 mg/kg Q2W, in 
the single agent dose -escalation study.  
The dose of each agent tested in the Phase 1B portion of the study was based on the totality of 
the safety data generated in the dose -escalation portion of the trial. The dose of pamipa rib 
chosen for the disease -specific expansion cohorts was based on the number of dose -limiting 
toxicities observed across the dosing cohorts.  Two dose -limiting toxicities (G rade 2 nausea 
that could not be managed with standard anti -emetic treatments, and Grade 4 auto -immune 
hepatitis ; occurring in one patient each) were reported in the Dose Level 5 cohort ( pamiparib  
60 mg orally twice daily  + tislelizumab  200 mg IV Q3W ). The fixed dose of tislelizumab  
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 41 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   200 mg Q3W was selected on the basis of available clinical data as outlined in Section 2.3.1.1 . 
Based on these findings, the Safety Monitoring Committee for this study recommended the 
pamiparib  40 mg orally twice daily  + tislelizumab  200 mg IV Q3W dosing be implemented 
for the disease -specific expansion cohorts  in Part B of the study . 
2.5.2 Rationale for Disease -Specific Cohorts (Phase 1B)  
2.5.2.1  Ovarian Cancer  
There are data to indicate that HRD status predicts response to PARP inhibition in patients 
with high grade epithelial, non -mucinous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer 
(EOC), which includes but may not be restricted to patient s with germ line or somatic BRCA1/2  
mutations. Published data with FDA -approved PARP inhibitors, olaparib, rucaparib, and 
niraparib , support the efficacy of this approach to treat selected patients with HRD tumors . 
The rationale to treat patient s with EOC whose cancer tests negative for BRCA1/2 mutation  or 
those without HRD is based on data generated in the NOVA study, which evaluated niraparib 
vs placebo when given in the maintenance setting to patients with platinum -sensitive, recurrent 
ovarian  cancer.  [30] In this study of 553 enrolled patient s, niraparib significantly improved the 
duration of progression -free survival over placebo in patients whose ovarian cancers tested 
positive for a germline BRCA  mutation ( median PFS 21 vs 5.5 months; HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.07 -
0.41), in those with HRD positive (median PFS 12.9 vs 3.8 months; HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.24 -
0.59) and in those with no germline BRCA  muta tion or HRD (median PFS 9.3 vs 3.9 months; 
HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.34 -0.61).  
There is a strong rationale to evaluate checkpoint inhibition in patient s with ovarian cancer.  
First, high expression of PD -L1 in ovarian cancer is associated with lower 5 -year surviva l rate 
(52.6%) relative to low PD -L1 expressing ovarian tumors (80.2%), suggesting that suppression 
of PD -1 pathway may be associated with clinical benefit. [4] Second, preclinical experiments 
in syngeneic ovarian cancer murine models show tumor regression with PD -1/PD -L1 
blockade. [31] Third, there are several immune checkpoint inhibitors being evaluated in 
clinical trials in ovarian cancer, many of which have reported disease stability and tumor 
shrinkage in patients with  recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. [32] There are ongoing clinical 
trials, including three Phase 3 trials, that are evaluating immune checkpoint  inhibitors across 
both platinum -sensitive and platinum -resistant epithelial ovarian cancer patients.  
The current data with the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial BGB -A317/BGB -290_ Study _001 has 
generated preliminary data supporting both the safety and anti -tumor activity of this 
combination. There are other ongoing clinical trials in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer 
in which a PARP inhibitor will be combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   2.5.2.2  Breast Cancer  
BRCA  mutations in TNBC are predictive for response to platinum  compounds, which has been 
demonstrated in both in vitro  experiments and in clinical trials . [33, 34] The TNT trial [35] 
reported that in unselected patient s with metastatic triple negative breast cancer,  the response 
rates were similar with either carboplatin or docetaxel. However, patient s with BRCA1/2  
mutat ions had a significantly higher response and a longer progression -free survival with 
carboplatin compared to docetaxel treatment. Additionally , a Phase 1 trial of olaparib 
combined with paclitaxel demonstrated clinical activity in patient s with TNBC, but w as 
complicated by higher than expected rates of neutropenia.  [36] 
BRCA  mutation status is also predictive for response to PARP inhibitors in TNBC . [36-39] 
Evidence of clinical activity has been observed in all PARP inhibitors (olapar ib, niraparib, 
veliparib , rucaparib, and talazoparib) in early phase clinical trials evidenced by overall 
response rates as high as 71% and clinical benefit rates as high as 86% in patient s with TNBC 
testing positive for BRCA1/2  mutation. Multiple clinical  studies investigating PARP inhibitors 
in patients with BRCA1/2  mutated breast cancer are on -going in both the adjuvant and 
metastatic treatment settings either as single agents or in combination with targeted agents or 
standard chemotherapy regimens.  [40] 
There are also preliminary data supporting the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in TNBC . 
[41] TNBC has a high mutational frequency and an increased concentration of tumor -
infiltrating lymphocytes, presence of CD8+ infiltrates, and high FOXP3 infiltrates, relative to 
other breast canc er subtypes, findings that support treatment with an immune -modulating 
agent. Two checkpoint inhibitors, pembrolizumab ( Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) and atezolizumab ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), have 
published data supportin g the efficacy of such an approach in women with heavily pretreated 
metastatic TNBC, with overall response rates of 18.5% and 24%, respectively.  
In summary, both PARP inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors when given as monotherapies 
have demonstrated prelim inary evidence of anti -tumor activity in patient s with advanced 
TNBC, thereby supporting the evaluation of the combination of pamiparib  with tislelizumab . 
2.5.2.3  Metastatic Castration -Resistant Prostate Cancer  
There is a strong rationale to target DNA repair deficiencies in patients with castration -resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC). The prevalence of germline or somatic mutations in genes key to 
DNA damage repair pathways is approximately 19% in patients with CRPC, suggesting that 
there is a population of patie nts who could be identified for targeted therapy, such as PARP 
inhibitors. The recently reported TOPARP trial showed that the incidence of DNA repair 
defects in unselected patients with mCRPC was 32%. Intriguingly , the incidence of BRCA2  
and ATM  mutations in this unselected cohort was 16% and the response rate in this subset that 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 43 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   was identified to have an underlying HR defect was more than  80% using a composite measure 
of response. [16] Others reported germline gene variants associated with increased risk of 
prostate cancer and underlying homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) include BRCA1 , 
MSH5 , MUTYH , PMS2 , RAD51B , and BRIP1 . [15, 17, 18, 42] Patients with germline BRCA1/2  
mutation carriers have a higher risk of nodal or distant metastases and poorer overall survival 
in prostate cancer than non -carriers. [43] 
Furthermore, the results of clinical trials evaluating oral PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, 
niraparib and rucaparib in patients with CRPC demonstrate significant activity and support 
further develop ment of agents targeting DNA repair pathways.  [44] 
Translational studies of T -cell infiltration in the prostate gland suggest a role for 
immunotherapy as a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer . [45] Tumor tissue from men 
treated with anti -androgen therapy was evaluated for lymphocyte markers and cytokines. Anti -
androgen therapy was associated with prominent T -cell infiltration in bo th epithelial tissue and 
at the tumor site, a finding that was hypothesized to be potentially synergistic with ipilimumab, 
a monoclonal antibody against CTLA -4. While early clinical trial results suggested promise 
with ipilimumab treatment for prostate can cer patients [46], a Phase 3 trial evaluating 
ipilimumab in men with CRPC who had failed docetaxel and were receiving bone -directed 
radiation therap y failed to demonstrate improvement in overall survival relative to a placebo 
control. [47] 
PD-L1 expression both at the tumor cell membrane and in the cytoplasm has been associated 
with poor prognosis in men with prostate cancer and may be an independent prognostic 
indicator of biochemical recurrence. [48] It follows that treatment with an immune checkpoint 
inhibitor combined with PARP inhibition may have therapeutic value in men with mCRPC.  
2.5.2.4  Small Cell Lung Cancer  
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC ) constitutes about 15% of newly diagnosed lung cancer cases 
and occurs predominantly in cigarette smokers.  [49] SCLC is an aggressive disease trea ted 
most commonly with platinum -based chemotherapy. Approximately 50% of SCLC patients 
have brain metastases at the time of postmortem examination. Overall survival is typically 
< 12 months.  [50]  
SCLC is characterized by its high mutational load, including defects in DNA repair genes. [51, 
52] Several lines of evidence support the evaluation of pamiparib  in SCLC. First, PARP 
inhibition with pamiparib  was shown to enhance DNA damaging effects of temozolomide  in 
both sensitive and resistant SCLC cell lines. Second, pamiparib  has demonstrated anti -tumor 
activity in several SCLC patient -derived xenograft (PDX) models when giv en with 
carboplatin/etoposide or as a maintenance treatment following the completion of 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 44 of 198

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   carboplatin/etoposide. Finall y, preclinical data support pamiparib  activity in intracranial 
models of central nervous system (CNS) metastases, a common metastatic site of SCLC.  
Preliminary data from Phase 1 studies has demonstrated some efficacy of PARP inhibitors in 
SCLC patients. In a Phase 1 study, talazoparib was administered as a single agent in patients 
with previously treated advanced SCLC. [53] In this study, 10% of patients treated with 
talazoparib had a partial response and 25% had a clinical benefit (complete response, partial 
response and stable disease ≥ 16 weeks) with a median duration or respo nse of 13.7 weeks 
(95% CI; 12.0, 15.3 weeks). The most common adverse events in this study were 
myelo -suppression, fatigue, nausea, and alopecia.  
A Phase 1 study of velaparib administered in combination wi th standard doses of cisplatin and 
etiposide  was conducted in treatment -naïve patients with extensive stage SCLC (n  = 9). [54] 
The recommended phas e 2 dose of velaparib was 100 mg . The preliminary efficacy in 
7 evaluable patients were: 1 complete response (14.3%), 4 partial response (57.1%), and 2 had 
stable disease (28.6%). Grade 3 -5 hematologic adverse events included neutropenia, 
leukopenia, lymph openia, and thrombocytopenia.  
The correlation of anti -tumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors with high mutational 
burden in solid tumors provides a rationale for investigating tislelizumab  in extensive stage 
SCLC. The reported rates of PD -L1 expres sion on SCLC range between 27% to 72%. [55, 56] 
Early phase clinical trials with pembrolizumab  and nivolumab have demonstrated  anti-tumor 
activity with overall response rates ranging between 13% with nivolumab and 35% with 
pembrolizumab; confirmatory trials are ongoing ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers:  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
2.5.2.5  Gastric Cancer (existing cohort)  
Genetic abnormalities in gastric cancer include alterations in the DNA damage response gene 
ATM. The loss of ATM has been demonstrated to be synthetically lethal with inhibition of 
PARP, supporting the use of platinum -based treatment as well as PARP inhibitors.  
Studies showed that gastric cancer cell lines, particularly those with a low expression level of 
ATM protein, are sensitive to olaparib . [57, 58] A randomized double -blind placebo -controlled 
Phase 2 study was conducted in 124 patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer treated 
with olaparib (100 mg twice daily ) in combination with paclitaxel  (80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 
15 of every 28 -day cycle) or placebo. [59] Results from this study showed the combination 
therapy significantly improved overall survival (OS) in both the overall population (median 
13.1 vs 8.3 months) and in those whose tumors contained low levels of ATM protein. However, 
there was no difference i n progression -free survival  (PFS) in either the overall population or 
in those with ATM -low tumors.  
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 45 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   A Phase 3 clinical study with paclitaxel with or without olaparib as a second line treatment 
recently reported results. [60] In this study, Asian patients with advanced, previously treated 
gastric cancer were treated with either paclitaxel or paclitaxel in combination with the PARP 
inhibitor olaparib . Eighteen percent  of 535 patients randomi zed were ATM -deficient.  Results 
of the study in the overall population demonstrated numerically higher overall survival for 
patients treated with olaparib plus paclitaxel (6.9 vs 8.8 months, HR 0.79, p  = 0.0262). 
How ever due to a statistical correction made due to inclusion of a co -primary endpoint of the 
ATM deficient subgroup, this did not reach statistical significance  (which would have required 
a p-value of <  0.025).  In the ATM deficient subgroup, radiological res ponse rates were 
significantly higher for patients treated with olaparib (37% vs 16%, p  = 0.03), and a non -
statistically significant trend towards improvement in overall survival was also noted (10 vs 
12 months, HR 0.73, p  = 0.2458).  Combination therapy wa s well -tolerated, with no new safety 
signals demonstrated.  A Phase 1 clinical study with veliparib is currently ongoing. [61] 
Several preclinical an d clinical studies support targeting the PD -1 pathway in gastric cancer. 
A comprehensive genomic characterization of gastric carcinoma identified a subset of gastric 
cancers that may have elevated PD -1/PD -L1 expression, which provides the rationale for 
treating patient s with gastric cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitors. [62] The incidence of 
PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer samples is approximately 40%, but the clinical relevance 
of this finding is inconsistently reported. [63, 64] The rationale to evaluate immune checkpoint 
inhibitors in gastric ca ncer is, therefore, based on the recognized immune -modulatory 
mechanisms of action of these molecules. As such, multiple agents targeting the PD -1/L-1 
system are currently in development for patients with gastro -esophageal cancer. Preliminary 
results of th ese trials support anti -tumor activity of these agents when given as monotherapy. 
[63, 65]  
To date, the preliminary data combining pamiparib  with tislelizumab  supports the safety of the 
combination when given to patien ts with advanced solid tumors. Given the unmet medical 
need in advanced gastric cancer, exploring the efficacy of this combination has merit.  
2.5.2.6  Urothelial  (muscle -invasive bladder, ureter, urethra, renal pelvis) Cancer   
The standard of care for patients who have muscle -invasive bladder cancer is platinum -based 
chemotherapy.  [66] The median overall survival in patients with metastatic disease is 
approximately 9 -15 months, an indication that more effective treatment is neede d for this 
patient population.   
Whole genome sequencing on bladder cell lines was performed as part of a TCGA 
collaboration to identify biologic and genomic profiles that may be predictive of platinum 
response in patients with bladder cancer.  [67] In this experiment, alterations in the BRCA  DNA 
repair pathway were identified in 44% of the cell lines tested, and in 32% of the tumors from 
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 46 of 198 
BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   patients in the TCGA database. Another collabora tion found a significant association between 
somatic mutations in DNA repair genes and improved clinical outcomes. [68] To date, there 
are no clinic al trials of PARP inhibition in the bladder cancer population.  
The recent data from the KEYNOTE -045 study ( Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) 
demonstrates an improved survival in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer with 
pembrolizumab treatm ent. Other checkpoint inhibitors, atezolizumab  and nivolumab, have 
demonstrated efficacy in advance d urothelial cancer  and are FDA -approved for this indication . 
[69, 70] Administering pamiparib  prior to tislelizumab  in advanced urothelial cancer will 
evaluate if upregulating neoantigens with pamiparib  will influence the response to checkp oint 
inhibition with  tislelizumab . Eligible patients will be required to have disease considered to be 
responsive to platinum -based chemotherapy to increase the chance of responding to PARP 
inhibition.  
2.5.2.7  Pancreatic Cancer  
Whole genome analysis of pancreatic tumors estimate 10%  to 12% of patients with pancreatic 
cancers have either germ -line or somatic mutations of BRCA2 -, BRCA1 - or PALB2 . [71] There 
are an additional 12% to 13% of patients who are characterized with ‘ BRCA ness’ and who 
might be sensitive to PARP inhibition. Platinum -containing regimens or PARP inhibitors have 
been used in patients with pancreatic cancer with known BRCA  mutations. [72, 73] Data from 
an open -label Phase 2 study of rucaparib suppo rts the use of PARP inhibitors in patient s with 
advanced BRCA1/2  mutated pancrea tic cancer. One complete and 2 partial responses were 
observed in the 19 patients en rolled. All responses were observed in patient s who had received 
only one prior treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. One retrospective report evaluating 
the clinical significance of BRCA1/2  mutations in pancreatic cancer reported an improvement 
in overall survival in patients with Stage 3 or 4 pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received 
platinum –based treatment  relative to historic reports. [74] This data supports the use of PARP 
inhibitors in patients with pancreatic cancer. Multiple trials with PARP inhibitors are ongoing 
with veliparib, talazoparib, neraparib , and olaparib.  
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently being evaluated in early phase  clinical trials in 
patients with pancreatic cancer in both the neo -adjuvant and palliative care settings.  
Historically, pancreatic cancer was considered a “non -immunogenic” tumor, with low 
PD-L1/PD -1 expression, low amounts of CD8+ T -cell infiltration an d a low tumor mutation 
burden. These characteristics were thought to be indicators of a relative unresponsiveness to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors as well as the poor prognosis associated with this disease. 
Recently, an investigation using murine models and  human tissue specimens detailed a 
mechanism to up -regula te PD -L1 in pancreatic cancer. MLL1, a human mixed lineage 
leukemia protein -1, was expressed in the majority (11 of 13) of the pancreatic tumor cell lines 
evaluated, and after binding to a promotor o f the CD274  gene, PD -L1 expression incre ased, as 
did the efficacy of anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies.

5.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a 2-part Phase  1, open label, multiple dose, dose -escalation and expansion study to 
investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of the anti -PD-1 monoclonal 
antibody  tislelizumab  in combination with the PARP inhibitor pamiparib  in patient s with 
advanced solid tumors.  
Part A consists of a dose -escalation and dose -finding component to establish the MTD  and/or 
RP2D to evaluate the safety, PK, preliminary anti -tumor activity of  tislelizumab  and pamiparib  
combination and immunogenicity of tislelizumab . Part B will evaluate the safety and 
tolerability, PK and preliminary anti -tumor activity of tislelizumab  200 mg IV Q3 W combined 
with pamiparib  40 mg orally twice daily  (see Section 6.2 for instructions).  
In Part A of the study  in all DLs, tislelizumab  will be given intravenously (IV) on Day  1 of 
each 21-day cycle, and pamiparib  will be taken orally twice daily  starting from Day 1.   
Part A of the study will follow a 3+3 dose -escalation scheme at pre -defined  DLs until MTD 
and/or RP2D is determined for the combination . Dose escalation continue s until 2 patient s 
experience DLT  at a DL, ie, 2 in 3 to 6 treated patient s. The DLT assessments will be eval uated 
during the first cycle consisting of the first 21 days of treatment.  However, if  during dose -
escalation , a MTD cannot be established after the evaluation of all planned doses, eg , because 
further increase in dose does not result in significant increa ses in exposure, then a RP2D will 
be determined after the evaluation of available data on safety, PK, and efficacy data.  The 
selection of the RP2D will be based on the safety  and preliminary anti -tumor activity observed 
in Part A, and other complementary data and made at the SMC meeting at the time that the 
dose for Part B  is decided.  
After the first patient  in the first DL receives Day 1 dose of the Cycle  1, subsequent patient s 
will not be dosed until the first patient  has been observed for at least 24  hours to exclude 
unexpected acute toxicity.  
An SMC (see Section  8.4.1  for committee composition) will determine the DLs to be 
administered and dose regimen during dose escalation and at the SMC meetings. The decision 
will depend on the available data on safety, PK and preliminary anti -tumor activity. The SMC 
will also decide  and select the RP2D . 
Part B will be to further evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of the combination of 
tislelizumab  and pamiparib  and to  assess the preliminary anti -tumor activity of the combination 
in patient s in the arms of specific tumor types defined in Section 5.1.2 .  The n umber of patient s 
planned in each arm is  listed in  Section 5.1.2 .

18 September 2018 , Version 4 Confidential   Baseline tumor tissue is mandatory for biomarker analysis, either from archived tumor tissue 
or fresh tumor biopsies unless it has been previously discussed with the sponsor ’s medical 
monitor  or its designee. Fresh blood samples at baseline for all patient s with ovarian, fallopian  
tube, primary peritoneal, or breast cancer in Part A and all patient s enrolled i n Part  B must be 
collected for evaluation of germline BRCA  mutations and/or confirmation of prior BRCA  
results .  
Patient s will be monitored for safety, tolerability, anti -tislelizumab  antibodies, and anti -tumor 
activity throughout the study from the day of first administration of study drugs up to  30 days 
after the last dose of pami parib and 90 days following last dose of tislelizumab  or initiation of 
new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first . The exception are irAEs, which will be 
recorded up to 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab, regardless of initiation of subsequent  
anticancer therapy . 
Radiological assessment of tumor response should be performed approximately every 
9 ± 1 weeks in the first year and approximately every 12  ± 1 weeks thereafter . 
If any subject has a confirmed CR, PR, or SD after 2 years of study treatm ent, either 
tislelizumab or pamiparib or both agents can be stopped provided the study assessments and 
procedures are performed every 12  weeks with every radiographic tumor assessment. If a 
subject has evidence of PD within 1 year of treatment interruption , the Investigator can 
consider restarting the combined study treatment after discussion with the Sponsor, contingent 
on the continued availability of study medications.  
The rationale for this change: a treatment hiatus for patients who have durable respon ses is 
allowed at the discretion of the treating investigator in consultation with the Sponsor.   The 
optimal duration of combined study treatment is not known, and a treatment hiatus may reduce 
patient burden. During the treatment hiatus, patients will be monitored with routine 
radiographic tumor assessments according to the protocol schedule and If there are indications 
of tumor progression, s tudy treatment can be resumed.  
This study will be considered complete once all patient s have manifested disease pro gression, 
ceased study treatment due to death, exhibited intolerance, withdrawn consent from the study, 
or completed a total of 2  years of treatment . Any patient  in this study who continues to 
demonstrate objective  clinical benefit at the end of a 2 -year t reatment duration may continue 
in the study or on treatment .

18 Sept ember 2018, Version 4 Confidential   5.1.1 Part  A: Dose E scalation  and Dose Finding  
Five DLs are planned , as shown in  Table 1. The starting dose for pamiparib  and tislelizumab  
was based on the doses evaluated in  the on -going monotherapy Phase 1 study of pamiparib  and 
tislelizumab  and is significantly lower than the highest safe dose that has been identified to 
date.  
The suggested dose -escalation scheme is presented in Table 1 below.  The proposed DLs may 
be further modified and additional doses may be considered based on the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy observed during dose escalation, ie , flat dose of tislelizumab  at 200 mg IV Q3W , 
an intermediate, not pre -defined or not previously evaluated do se or a less frequent dosing 
schedule that will not exceed the MTD level, if evaluation of toxicity at such a dose or schedule 
is desired.

1 The actual dose levels and dose regimens administered in each step will depend on the data available from the 
previous step, as determined by t he Safety Monitoring Committee . 
The evaluable patient s are those who have met the minimum treatment and safety evaluation 
requirements of the study and/or who experience a DLT during the first cycle (21 days). The 
minimum treatment and safety evaluation requirements include 1) treatment of > 90% of 
tislelizu mab infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 ( C1D1 ); 2) a minimum of total 16 days of pamiparib  
treatment (>  75% of the expected dose) during Cycle 1; and 3) observati on of ≥  21 days 
following C1D1 treatment and completion of the scheduled safety assessments.  If patient s do 
not meet these minimum treatment and safety evaluation requirements, they will be regarded 
as ineligible for inclusion for MTD evaluation and may be replaced , if needed, based on 3+3 
escalation scheme .  
5.1.1.1  Dose -Limiting Toxicity

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential   enrolled patient s/cohort  are planned to be included for expansion in Part  B of the study in the 
arms of specific tumor types defined below .  Each Arm will be evaluated independently for 
study endpoints . The purpose of these expansion  arms is to explore signals of clinical efficacy 
as well as to confirm the safety and tolerability of the combination in each selected tumor t ype. 
Anti-tumor act ivity will be evaluated in Part  B. Initially, 20 patients per cohort will be enrolled 
and evaluated for anti -tumor ac tivity. A decision can be made to stop an arm early due to 
suboptimal clinical anti -tumor activity  or to enroll an  additional 20 patients to evaluate further 
the anti -tumor activity.  Statistical justification of such sample size expansion will be included 
in the final statistical analysis plan as applicable.  
The RP2D is tislelizumab  200 mg IV Q3W + pamiparib  40 mg orally twice daily . This 
combination will be given until disease progression or other discontinuation criteria are met.  
All p atients must have received standard of care in the primary treatment of their disease.  
Patients with platinum -refractory disease are e xcluded.  Platinum -refractory disease is 
defined as progressive disease at the time of the first tumor assessment while receiving a 
platinum -containing therapy . Enrollment into these disease -specific cohorts will occur 
simultaneously and independent of eac h other.   For all disease -specific cohorts, a line of 
treatment begins with the administration of the first agent in a regimen  and ends at the time 
of disease progression.  Except as noted, at least 1 prior line of treatment  should have 
contained a platinum compound.  
Arm 1a: Patients with relapsed, platinum -sensitive high grade epithelial, non -mucinous, 
ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC) with  either known 
germline or somatic BRCA1/2  mutations or with  homologous recombination 
deficiency (HRD). Patients must have received at least 2 prior lines of 
platinum -containing chemotherapy  
Arm 1b: Patients with relapsed, platinum -sensitive high grade EOC without  either known 
germline or somatic BRCA1/2  muta tions and without  known HRD. Patients must 
have received at least 2 prior lines of platinum -containing chemotherapy . 
Arm 2: Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with either known  germline or 
somatic BRCA1/2  mutations or with documented  HRD.  Patients can have been 
treated with  at least 1 but no more than  3 prior lines of treatment .   
BeiGene Ltd.  Page 58 of 198

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential   Arm 3: Patients with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with either 
known  germline or somatic BRCA1/2  mutations or with documented  HRD. 
Chemotherapy -naïve patients must have received prior abiraterone acetate or 
enzalutamide treatment  
Arm 4: Patients with extensive -stage disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with at 
least 1 but no more than  2 prior lines of treatment , at least  1 must include a platinum 
agent  
Arm 5: Patients with  HER2 -negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.  Patients 
with HER2 -negative disease may be treated with at least 1 but no more than  2 prior 
lines of treatment   
Arm 6: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial (muscle invasive bladder, 
ureter, urethra or renal pelvis) cancer treated with at least 1 but no more than 2 prior 
lines of treatment , including a prior platinum -containing chemotherapy  
Arm 7: Patients with advanced or me tastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with at least 
one but no more than 2 prior lines of therapy . At least 1 prior treatment for advanced 
or metastatic disease must have contained a platinum agent. Any potential patient with 
a known deleterious germl ine or somatic BRCA  is eligible even if platinum -naïve  
Arm 8: (NOTE: CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT)  Patients who may be expected to benefit 
from the combination of a PARP inhibitor and a PD -1 inhibitor. This arm will include 
patients with recurrent non -ovarian gynecological cancers (endometrial cancer, cancer 
of the cervix and patients with tumors known to be mismatch repair deficient [ MMR ] 
or HRD positive) that are not eligible for inclusion in any other arms of the trial. This 
is an exploratory signal seeking arm   
For Arm 1 (ovarian cancer), Arm 2 (TNBC), and Arm 3 (mCRPC), patients with known 
eligible mutation status can be enrolled into the study if otherwise eligible. Tissue/blood 
specimens will be collected for a confirmatory test. Patients who do not have known germline 
or somatic BRCA  mutation, or known HRD status must sign a separate pre -screening  informed 
consent to evaluate HRD status prior to enrollment. Please see Section  8.1 for details.  
For Arm 1 (EOC), Arm 1a will be analyzed independently of Arm 1b. All Arms may enroll up 
to 40 patients . 
The Sponsor’s medical monitor will approve tumor types for Arm 8 prior to screening.  
The cycle length for tislelizumab  and pamiparib  combination treatm ent is 21 day s.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  1 If screening laboratory tests are completed within 14 days  prior to first dose, pre -dose samples on Day 1 of Cycle 1 will not be repeated.  
2 The mandatory Safety Follow -up Visits should be conducted 30 days ( ± 7 days) after the last dose of study therapy, or  before initiation of a new anticancer 
treatment. Patients who are discontinued from the study due to an unacceptable drug -related adverse event will be followed until the resolution of the AE to 
Grade 0 -1, baseline or stabilization or until beginning of a  new therapy for their cancer, whichever occurs first . 
3 Following completion or discontinuation of the treatment and/or Safety Follow -up phases of the study, every effort should be made to follow up all patient s 
for their survival status until patient  death . 
4 Written consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol -specific procedure. Results of a test performed as part of routine clinical management are 
acceptable in lieu of a screening test if performed within the specified time frame (eg, within 2 8 days prior to Cycle  1, Day  1). A patient -specific patient  
number will be assigned when the study informed consent is signed.  
5 Includes history of all prior systemic, radiation, and surgical treatment for the primary cancer diagnosis. Radiographic stud ies performed prior to study entry 
may be collected for review by the investigator. Report non -cancer treatment medication up to  30 days prior to the S creening visit. Date and response to last 
platinum -containing chemotherapy treatment and date of the progress ion must be documented unless no platinum -containing treatment has been received 
before.  
6 Vital signs to include temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure.  
7 Full physical examination includes the following items: 1. general appearance; 2. head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; 3. neck; 4. heart; 5. chest (including lungs); 
6. abdomen; 7. extremities; 8. skin; 9. lymph nodes; 10. cardio -vascular; 11 . neurological status . 
8 Ophthalmologic exam ination  include s visual acuity , funduscopic, and slit la mp microscopy. The exam will be performed during the screening period, on 
Cycle 2 Day 1  ± 2 days, Cycle 4 Day 1  ± 2 days , Safety Follow -up, and whenever  clinically indicated.  
9 Electrocardiogram assessments are to be per formed with the patient  in semi -recumbent supine position and rested for 5  minutes. Electrocardiogram (12 -lead 
ECG) should be performed at Screening within 14 days of Cycle  1 Day  1 as baseline , and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit s. Triplicate ECG recordings  
(3 readings in rapid s uccession and not more than 2 minutes apart) will be obtained locally at the site in conjunction with blood sampling for phar macokinetics 
as per Table 4. Additional ECGs may be obtained if clinically indicated (Section  8.3.4 ). 
10 Adverse Events and laboratory safety measurements will be graded per NCI -CTCAE version 4.03. All adverse experiences, whether gradable by CTCAE or 
not, will also be evaluated for seriousnes s and causality.  
11 Routine laboratory tests (eg, CBC with differential; comprehensive serum chemistry panel; urinalysis) will be performed by th e local study site laboratory or 
their contract laboratory. Serum chemistry and h ematology will be performed at S creening, prior to the first dose of pamiparib  if it was not done within 14 
days of Cycle 1 Day 1 , Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 through  3, and Day 1 of subsequent cycles and  more frequently  as clinically indicated.  CK and CK -MB 
will be performed at Screening, prior to the first dose on Day 1 of all treatment cycles , and Safety Follow -up Visit. If your laboratory does not perform CK -
MB testing, serum troponins (troponin I and/or T) measurements should be performed ins tead; if only either troponin is assessed per local standards the same 
should be evaluated throughout.  See Appendix  10 for management of immune -relate d adverse events corresponding to abnormalities based on laboratory 
testing.  
12 PT/INR and activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) should be collected at Screening  and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit s after discontinuation 
of study therapy. Coagulation parameters should be determined throughout the study when clinically indicated. PT/INR and aPTT  will be analyzed by the 
local study site laboratory.  
13 Women of childbearing potential must have a ne gative s erum pregnancy test at S creening (within 7  days of the first investigational product administration). 
A urine or serum pregnancy test must be performed if any woman suspects that she has become pregnant during the study . For subsequent pregnancy testing, 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 63 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  urine pregnancy tests, performed at a central or local laboratory, are allowed. If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a confi rmatory serum pregnancy test is 
required.  
14 T3, T4, thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH); will be collect ed at pre -dose of Day  1 of ever y cycle and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit s. Analysis of 
T3, T4 and TSH will be performed by the local study site laboratory. If feasible, early morning ACTH and cortisol will be obt ained as part of the screening 
assessments and only repeated duri ng the study if it is clinically indicated.  
15 Analysis of IgG and IgM will be performed at pre -dose of Day  1 every cycle in first 12  months, approximately every 2 months th ereafter, and at Safety 
Follow -up Visits . Analysis will be performed by the local stud y site laboratory.  
16 Blood for anti -tislelizumab  antibodies should be collected within 24  hours before the start of infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1, on  Day 8 of Cycle 1, and before 
the start of infusion on Day  1 of Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 9 and approximately every 8 cycles thereafter (ie, Cycle 17, Cycle 25 and Cycle 
33).  In patient s who discontinue study therapy before 6  months, every effort should be made to collect blood sample for analyzing anti -tislelizumab  antibodies 
approximately 6  months after the first dose. Corresponding tislelizumab  PK samples will be collected at the same time when the anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) 
samples are collected to assess the neutralizing capacity of ADA. Analysis will be performed  by a central laboratory.  
17 Cannulation for blood sampling for pharmacokinetics will be performed according to Table 4. In addition, corresponding tislelizumab  PK samples will be 
collected at the same time when the ADA samples are collected to assess the neutralizing capacity of ADA.  
18 Testing will be performed by the local laboratory at Screening. Include HCV antibody, HBsAg, HBcAb and HIV 1/2 antibodies , patient s who are HBsAg 
and/or HBcAb positive or HCV antibody positive at Screening must not be enrolled until further de finite testing with HBV DNA tit ers and HCV ribonucleic 
acid ( RNA ) tests can conclusively rule out presence of active infection requirin g therapy with Hepatitis B and C respectively.  
19  
 
 
 
20 Tumor imaging (either computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], with preference for CT) will be performe d within 28  days prior to 
enrollment, and while on study approximately every 9  ± 1 weeks in the first 12  months and approximately every 12  ± 1 weeks thereafter. The same imaging 
technique should be used in a patient  throughout the study. After first docume ntation of response (CR or PR), imaging performed at the next regularly 
scheduled time point will be used for response confirmation.  Progressive disease suspected as pseudo -progression needs to be confirmed in a subsequent 
imaging not less than 4  weeks lat er or at the next regularly scheduled time point but not more than 12 weeks, before discontinuation of study treatment. 
Patient s who stop treatment prior to documentation of progressive disease will undergo repeated imaging for tumor response assessmen ts as described in 
Section  5.2.5.1 . In patient s with prostate cancer, baseline bone scans will be performed during the Screening window, and repeat bone scans will be perf ormed 
approximately every 9 ± 1 weeks for the first 12 months and approximately every 12 ± 1 weeks thereafter.  
21 Both tislelizumab  and pamiparib  treatments start from Cycle 1 Day 1. On Day 1 of each cycle, tislelizumab  will be given intravenously after the morning 
dosing of pamiparib . See Section 6.2 for additional information regarding the administration of study drugs.  If any subject has a confirmed CR, PR, or SD 
after 2 years of study treatment, either tislelizumab or pamiparib or both agents can be stopped provided the study assessments and pr ocedures are performed 
every 12  weeks with every radiographic tumor assessment. If a subject has evidence of PD within 1 year of treatment interruption, the Investigator can 
consider restarting the combined study treatment after discussio n with the Sponsor, contingent on the continued availability of study medications.  The 
rationale for this change: a treatment hiatus for patients who have durable responses is allowed at the discretion of the tre ating investigator in consultation 
with the  Sponsor.   The optimal duration of combined study treatment is not known, and a treatment hiatus may reduce patient burden. During the t reatment

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  hiatus, patients will be monitored with routine radiographic tumor assessments according to the protocol schedu le and If there are indications of tumor 
progression, study treatment can be resumed . 
22 Collection of archival tumor tissue for purpose of biomarker analysis. This is a mandatory requirement for patient  enrollment  and should be specified in the 
consent form. Specific instructions for tissue collection and shipment are provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
23 Archival tumor tissue will be collected for evaluation of potential biomarkers , although a fresh baseline tumor bi opsy (within 12 weeks of starting treatment) 
is recommended. In the absence of archival tumor tissue, a fresh baseline biopsy of a n accessible  tumor lesion is mandatory , unless previously discussed with 
the sponsor’s medical monitor or its designee.  For th ose patient s who consent to fresh biopsy, an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis during the third week 
of the first cycle is recommended. For the patients who have confirmed disease progression, an optional biopsy may be taken at the Safety Follow -up vi sit.  
The purpose of this biopsy sample is to evaluate mechanisms of resistance  to the study treatment(s) . If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally taken 
from the same anatomical location as the baseline biopsy. Additional w ritten patient consen t is required for optional fresh tumor biopsies. Fresh biopsies 
should be limited to readily accessible tumor lesions (eg, skin; peripheral lymph nodes; lung, liver or internal lymph node m etastases which can be readily 
accessed using CT guidance). If perf ormed, a tissue cylinder should be obtained that has proper size for histological examination and biomarker analysis . If 
any subject has a confirmed CR, PR, or SD after 2 years of study treatment, either tislelizumab or pamiparib or both agents c an be stop ped provided the study 
assessments and pr ocedures are performed every 12  weeks with every radiographic tumor assessment. If a subject has evidence of PD within 1 year of 
treatment interruption, the Investigator can consider restarting the combined study treatment after discussion with the Sponsor, contingent on the continued 
availability of study medications.  The rationale for this change: a treatment hiatus for patients who have durable responses  is allowed at the discretion of the 
treating investigator  in consultation with the Sponsor.   The optimal duration of combined study treatment is not known, and a treatment hiatus may reduce 
patient burden. During the treatment hiatus, patients will be monitored with routine radiographic tumor assessments accordi ng to the protocol schedule and 
If there are indications of tumor progression, study treatment can be resumed . 
24 A blood sample must be collected at screening stage for ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, and breast cancer patient s for germline BRCA  and/or other 
mutations analysis.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Sample collection must be from  opposite arm to that used for study drug infusion. If drug was administered via a central venous catheter, sample collection for PK 
should be from a different site.  
1. In addition, corresponding tislelizumab  PK samples will be collected at the same time poin ts when the ADA samples are collected to assess the neutralizing 
capacity of ADA. General note: It is important that pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling occurs as close as possible to the scheduled time . In order to 
achieve this, some of the other assessments sc heduled at the same time need to be initiated prior to or after the time point to allow for completion of 
these measurements in enough time for the PK sampling to be taken at the designated time point . Thus, the sequence at a particular time point is: 1) 
scheduled ECG; 2 ) PK blood samples 3) vital sign measurements; and 4) any other scheduled or unscheduled measurements at that time point.  
2 Except for pre -dose PK, each PK/ADA sampling time point of tislelizumab  and pamiparib  will be in correspondence with the end of dosing of each agent, 
respectively.  
3 The time points of performing ECG and vital signs will be associated with the time of pamiparib  administration.  Triplicate ECG recordings (3 readings in rapid 
succession and n ot more than 2 minutes apart) will be obtained locally at the site.  
4 Within 2  hours prior to dosing.  
5 A window period of ±  5 minutes exists for all procedures occurring after the study drug is taken.  
6 A window period of ±  10 minutes exists for all procedures  occurring after the study drug is taken.  
7 A window period of ±  30 minutes exists for all procedures occurring after the study drug is taken.  
8 A window period of ±  1 hour exists for all procedures occurring after the study drug is taken.

1 Patients who do not have known germline or somatic BRCA  mutation or known HRD for Arm 1 (ovarian cancer), Arm 2 (TNBC), and Arm 3 (mCRPC) will 
have a HRD pre -screening period of up to  12 weeks prior to eligibility screening (see Section 8.1 for details). A separate pre -screening informed consent 
must be obtained. Any tissue taken during pre -screening period will not be re -collected during screening st age. 
2 If screening laboratory tests, physical examination are completed within 14 days  prior to first dose, pre -dose samples on Day 1 of Cycle 1 treatment will not 
be repeated.  
3 The mandatory Safety Follow -up Visits should be conducted 30 days ( ± 7 day s) after the last dose of pamiparib, 90 days (±  14 days ) after the last dose of 
tislelizumab  or before initiation of a new anticancer treatment. Patients who are discontinued from the study due to an unacceptable drug -related adverse

occurs first . 
4 Patient s will be followed for survival, cause of death, and additional cancer treatment, if available, every 3 months, or when reque sted by the sponsor . 
5 Written consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol -specific procedure. Results of a test performed as part of routine clinical management are 
acceptable in lieu of a screening test if performed within the specified time frame (eg, within 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day  1). Assign patient  number when 
the study informed consent is signed.  
6 Includes history of treatment for the primary cancer diagnosis, including prior systemic, radiation treatment and surgical tr eatment for the cancer. 
Radiographic studies performed prior to study entry may be collected for review by the investigator. Report non -cancer treatment medication up to  30 days 
prior to the S creening visit. Date and response to last platinum -containing chemotherapy treatment and date of the disease progression must be docum ented 
unless no platinum -containing treatment has been received before.  
7 Vital signs to include temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure.  
8 Full physical exam at the Screening and Safety Follow -up. At all other times, targeted or symptoms -directed physical examination, at the investigator’s 
discretion.  
9 Investigators should evaluate patients for changes in vision, visual disturbance, or ocular inflammation at each scheduled study visit during tislelizumab  
treatment. For any chang e in vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be made fo r further management guidance.  
10 Eye exam, visual acuity test, and optical coherence tomography (or equivalent diagnostic test for retinal examination) captur ed as standard of care prior to 
obtaining written informed consent and within 28 days of randomization may be used rather than repeating tests. Eye exam, vis ual acuity test, and optical 
coherence tomography (or equivalent diagnostic test) will be assessed at the Screening Visit. Patie nts will undergo repeat assessments approximately every 
15 weeks (± 7 days) and at the safety follow up visit. Investigators should evaluate patients for changes in vision, visual disturbance, or ocular inflammation 
at each scheduled study visit during tislelizumab  treatment. For any change in vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be made for further 
management guidance.  
11 The ophthalmologic assessments including eye exam, visual acuity test, and OCT (or equivalent diagnostic test) should be performed during safety follow 
up, within 30 days of study treatment end.   
12 Electrocardiogram assessments are to be performed with the patient in semi -recumbent supine position and rested for 5  minutes. Electrocardiogram (12 -lead 
ECG) should be performed at Screening within 14 days of Cycle  1 Day  1 as baseline, as clinically indic ated during the treatment period at the investigator’s 
judgement, and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visits. Additionally, triplicate ECG recordings (3 readings in rapid succession and not more than 2 
minutes apart) will be obtained locally at the site in conjunction with blood sampling for pharmacokinetics as per Table 6.  
13 Adverse Events and laboratory safety measurements will be graded per NCI CTCAE version 4.03. All adverse experiences, whether gradable by CTCAE or 
not, will also be evaluated for seriousness criteria and causality. No adverse events will be reported during the pre -screening stage. Only serious adverse 
events will be reported du ring the pre -screening stage if the serious adverse event is related to the pre -screening procedure. All AEs and SAEs, regardless of 
the relationship to the investigational product, will be collected throughout the study until 30 days after the last study treatment or initiation of new 
anticancer therapy. The exception  are irAE s, which will be recorded up to 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab , regardless of initiation of subsequent 
anticancer therapy . 
14 Routine laboratory tests (eg, CBC with differential, comprehensive serum chemistry panel,  and urinalysis ) will be performed by the local study site 
laboratory or their contract laboratory. Serum chemistry and h ematology will be performed at S creening, prior to the first dose of pamiparib  if it was n ot 
done within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 , Days 1 , 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 through  3, Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 4 through 6 , and Day 1 of subsequent cycles and 
more frequently as clinically indicated , and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visits . CK and CK -MB will be performed at Screening, prior to the first dose

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  on Day 1 , Day  8, and Day 15  of Cycles 1 through 3, prior to dosing on Day 1 for all remaining cycles , and Safety Follow -up Visit. If your laboratory does 
not perform CK -MB testing, serum tr oponins (troponin I and/or T) measurements should be performed instead; if only either troponin is assessed per local 
standards the same should be evaluated throughout. See Appendix  10 for management of immune -related adverse events corresponding to abnormalities 
based on laboratory testing.  
15 PT/INR and aPTT should be collected at Screening and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit s after discontin uation of study therapy. Coagulation 
parameters should be evaluated in the event of a Grade 2 or higher aminotransferase increases occur and as clinically necessary . Coagulation parameters will 
be analyzed by the local study site laboratory.  
16 Women of childbearing potential must have a ne gative serum pregnancy test at S creening (within 7 days of the first investigational product administration). 
A urine or serum pregnancy test must be performed on Day 1 of eac h cycle and at the Safety Follow -up and eval uated at the local site laboratory . 
17 T3, T4, thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH); will be collect ed at Screening, every 2 cycles, or more frequently as clinically indicated during treatment, and at 
the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit s. Analysis of T3, T4  and TSH will be performed by the local study site laboratory. If feasible, early morning ACTH 
and cortisol will be obtained prior to the first dose of tislelizumab  and only repeated during the study if it is clinically indicated.  
18 Blood for anti -tislel izumab  antibodies should be collected within 24 hours before the start of infusion on Day  1 and one sample between Day 7 through 10 of 
Cycle 1, and before the start of infusion on Day  1 of Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle  5, Cycle 9 and Cycle 17. Refer to Table 6 for details on timing of ADA  
sample collection. In patient s who discontinue study therapy before 6 months, every effort should be made to colle ct blood samples to analyze anti -
tislelizumab  antibodies approximately 6 months after the first dose. Corresponding tislelizumab  PK samples will be collected at the same time when the 
ADA samples are collected to assess the neutralizing capacity of ADA. An alysis will be performed by a central laboratory.  
19 Blood for pharmacokinetics will be collect ed in Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle  5, Cycle 9 and Cycle 17. Refer to Table 6 for details on timing of 
pharmacokinetics sample collection. In addition, corresponding tislelizumab  PK samples will be collected at the same time when the ADA samples are 
collected to assess the neutralizing capacity of ADA.  
20 Testing will be performed by the local laboratory at Screening. Include HCV antibody, HBsAg, HBcAb and HIV 1/2 antibodies , patients who are HBsAg 
and HBcAb positive or HCV antibody positive at Screening must not be enrolled until further definite testing with HBV DNA titers and HCV RNA tests can 
conclusively rule out presence of active infection requiring therapy with Hepatitis B  and C respectively.

  If any sub ject has a confirmed CR, PR, or SD after 2 years of study treatment, either tislelizumab or pamiparib or both agents can be s topped 
provided the study assessments and pr ocedures are performed every 12  weeks with every radiographic tumor assessment. If a subject has evidence of PD 
within 1 year of treatment interruption, the Investigator can consider restarting the combined study treatment after discussi on with the Sponsor, contingent 
on the continued availability of study medications.  The rationale for t his change: a treatment hiatus for patients who have durable responses is allowed at the 
discretion of the treating investigator in consultation with the Sponsor.   The optimal duration of combined study treatment is not known, and a treatment 
hiatus may re duce patient burden. During the treatment hiatus, patients will be monitored with routine radiographic tumor assessments acco rding to the 
protocol schedule and If there are indications of tumor progression, study treatment can be resumed . 
22 Tumor imaging  (either computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], with preference for CT with contrast of chest, abdomen and 
pelvis, including bone scan for patient s with bone metastasis) will be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment (bone scan s can be within 56 days), and 
while on study approximately every 9 ± 1 week  (calendar days)  in the first 12 months and approximately every 12 ± 1 weeks thereafter. The same imaging 
technique should be used in a patient  throughout the study. After the first  documentation of response (CR  or PR), imaging performed at the next regularly 

BeiGene Ltd. Page 73 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  scheduled time point will be used for response confirmation. Progressive disease suspected as pseudo -progression needs to be confirmed in a subsequent 
imaging at least 4  weeks l ater or at the next regularly scheduled time point but not to exceed 12  weeks, before discontinuation of study treatment. Patient s 
who stop treatment prior to documentation of progressive disease will undergo repeated imaging for tumor response assessments  as described in Section 
5.2.5.1 . For patient s with extensive -stage disease SCLC  or patient s with NSCLC , baseline brain MRI must  be obtained, and will be repeated if brain 
metastases are noted at baseline as part of the assessment of anti -tumor activity during study treatment.  
23 Both tislelizumab  and pamiparib  treatments start from Cycle 1 Day 1. On Day 1 of each cycle, tislelizu mab will be given intravenously after the morning 
dosing of pamiparib . See Section 6.2 for additional information regarding the administration of st udy drugs.  If any subject has a confirmed CR, PR, or SD 
after 2 years of study treatment, either tislelizumab or pamiparib or both agents can be stopped provided the study assessmen ts and pr ocedures are performed 
every 12  weeks with every radiographic tumor assessment. If a subject has evidence of PD within 1 year of treatment interruption, the Investigator can 
consider restarting the combined study treatment after discussion with the Sponsor, contingent on the continued availability of study medication s.  The 
rationale for this change: a treatment hiatus for patients who have durable responses is allowed at the discretion of the tre ating investigator in consultation 
with the Sponsor.   The optimal duration of combined study treatment is not known, and a treatment hiatus may reduce patient burden. During the treatment 
hiatus, patients will be monitored with routine radiographic tumor assessments according to the protocol schedule and If ther e are indications of tumor 
progression, study treatment can be res umed . 
24 Collection of archival tumor tissue for purpose of biomarker analysis. This is a mandatory requirement for patient  enrollment  and should be specified in the 
consent form. Specific instructions for tissue collection and shipment are provided in th e Laboratory Manual . If tumor samples have been collected at pre -
screening stage, there is no n eed to collect it again during S creening.  
25 Archival tumor tissue will be collected for evaluation of potential biomarkers , although a fresh baseline tumor bi opsy (within 12 weeks of starting treatment) 
is recommended. In the a bsence of archival tumor tissue , a fresh baseline biopsy of a n accessible  tumor lesion is mandatory , unless previously discussed 
with the sponsor’s medical monitor or its designee.  For th ose patient s who consent to fresh biopsy, an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis during the third 
week of the first cycle is recommended. For the patients who have confirmed disease progression, an optional biopsy may be taken at the Safety Follow -up 
visit.  The purpose of this biopsy sample is to evaluate mechanisms of resistance  to the study treatment(s) . If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally 
taken from the same anatomical location as the baseline biopsy. Additional w ritten patient consent is required for optional fresh tumor biopsies. Fresh 
biopsies should be limited to readily accessible tumor lesions (eg, skin; peripheral lymph nodes; and lung, liver or internal lymph node metastases which can 
be readily accessed us ing CT guidance). If performed, a tissue cylinder should be obtained that has proper size for histological examination and bi omarker 
analysis.  
26 A blood sample at S creening stage will be collected for all patient s in Part B, regardless of tumor type , for BRCA  and/or other mutational analysis, even if it 
has been previously tested.  
27  
 
 
28 Patients who are suspected or known to have serious/severe respiratory conditions or exhibit significant respiratory symptoms  unrelated to the underlying 
cancer will have pulmonary function testing which ma y include but is not limited to spirometry and assessment of diffusion capacity done during the 
Screening period to assist the determination of suitability on the study . These tests may include, but are not limited to, forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusing capacity (DLCO), and FEV 1/FVC.

5.1.4 Dose Modifications, Dose Delay , and Missing Dose  
There will be no dose reduction of tislelizumab  in this study. Dose delays of <  12 weeks will 
be permitted.  The Investigator should make every effort to maintain dose intensity in patients.  
Patients may temporarily suspend study treatment if they experience a toxicity that is 
considered related to tislelizumab  and requires that a dose be withheld. Patients should resume 
tislelizumab  treatment as soon as possible after the AE recovers to basel ine or Grade 1 severity 
(whichever is more severe) within 12 weeks after the last dose of tislelizumab . If the patient is 
unable to resume tislelizumab  in that timeframe, study tr eatment should be discontinued.  
If any subject has a confirmed CR, PR, or SD after 2 years of study treatment, either 
tislelizumab or pamiparib or both agents can be stopped provided the study assessments and 
procedures are performed every 12  weeks with every radiographic tumor assessment. If a 
subject has evidence of PD within 1 y ear of treatment interruption, the Investigator can 
consider restarting the combined study treatment after discussion with the Sponsor, contingent 
on the continued availability of study medications.  
The rationale for this change: a treatment hiatus for pat ients who have durable responses is 
allowed at the discretion of the treating investigator in consultation with the Sponsor.   The 
optimal duration of combined study treatment is not known, and a treatment hiatus may reduce 
patient burden. During the treatm ent hiatus, patients will be monitored with routine 
radiographic tumor assessments according to the protocol schedule and If there are indications 
of tumor progression, study treatment can be resumed . 
The Investigator should try his/her best to assess whet her an adverse event is possibly related 
to tislelizumab  only or pamiparib  only or both, and treat the patient  accordingly.   
In general dose delays for reasons other than management of AEs are discouraged. A dose 
delay of ≤ 21 consecutive days for pamipari b or a dose delay of ≤ 42 consecutive days for 
tislelizumab  is allowed under the following guidance  and at the discretion of the investigator 
after consultation with the sponsor or its designee . 
For tislelizumab , please  refer to  Appendix  10 for guidance for the management of irAEs  
including dose interruption and discontinuation.  
In case a patient is benefiting from the study treatment while meeting the discontinuation 
criteria, continuation  of study treatment may occur upon discussion and agreement with 
Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
If the timing of a protocol -mandated study visit coin cides with a holiday, weekend, or other 
event, the visit should be scheduled on the nearest feasible date (refer to the visit window in 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 77 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Table 3 and Table 5), with subsequent dosing continued on the 21 -day intervals afterward, with 
a minimum of 14 days between tislelizumab  dosing . 
For pamiparib , please refer to  Appendix  11 for dose interruption and/or modification of 
pamiparib . Pamiparib  may be dose -reduced or delayed to manage unacceptable tox icity. In 
Part B of this study, d ose reductions to pamiparib  20 mg orally twice daily  are allowed. If the 
patient  cannot tolerate pamiparib  20 mg orally twice daily , it should be discontinued. 
Pamiparib  treatment can be held during management of AEs, according to Appendix  11. Any 
dose increase after dose reduction should be agreed upon between and investigator and the 
spon sor or its designee.  
If a dose is missed on any day for any reason, then it should not be made up and the patient 
should remain on their normal schedule.   
If a dose is delayed for pamiparib , the patient  can continue tislelizumab  dosing  every 21 days 
and can resume pamiparib  at any time. If a dose is delayed for tislelizumab  for ≤ 10 days  for a 
planned dosing cycle (eg , Cycle 3 Day 1), tislelizumab  should be administer ed and all 
assessment s should be conducted  according to the original cycle (ie, C ycle 3); if the delay is 
more than  10 days, the patient  should  skip tislelizumab  dose, and tislelizumab  will be 
administered on  Day 1 of the next planned cycle (ie, C ycle 4 Day 1). Patient s who experience 
AE related to one investigational agent may continue treatment with the other investigational 
agent according to the protocol schedule after consultation with the sponsor or its designee.  
If tislelizumab  cannot be resumed within 42 consecutive days of last dose  due to tislelizumab  
treatment -related events , or if corticosteroid dose for an irAE  is not able to be reduced to 
≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day  by the end of 42 days’  dose interruption , the patient  
should be discontinue d from tislelizumab , and continue pamiparib  monotherapy  once  the irAE  
is resolved.  If pamiparib  cannot be resumed within 21 consecutive days of the last dose due to 
pamiparib  treatment -related  events, pamiparib  will be permanently discontinued and the 
patient  may continue tislelizumab  monotherapy  alone . Exemptions may be consid ered for 
those patient s who are determined by the investigator to have received clinical benefit  and it is 
considered safe and  to be in the best interest of the patient  to resume the treatment after 
consultation with the sponsor or its designee . 
Palliative  radiation to existing sites of metastatic disease to alleviate the tumor obstruction 
and/or pain  will be allowed provided tislelizumab  dosing does not occur within 1 -week pre - or 
post-radiation. Pamiparib  should be held 3 days before and resume 3 days after completion of 
radiation. Patient s who require palliative radiotherapy to manage the symptoms of progressive 
disease should be discontinued. Any exception will need to be discussed with and agreed by 
the sponsor ’s medical monitors.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  5.1.5 Treatment beyond Progression  
In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue with administrations of the 
combination of tislelizumab  and pamiparib  at the same dose unless a dose interruption or 
modification is r equired based on the guidance described below, or at the discretion of the 
investigator after consultation with the sponsor or its designee. The patients with disease 
progression that the investigator considers to be consistent with “pseudo -progression” wi ll be 
allowed to continue the study drug treatment of pamiparib  alone or tislelizumab  alone or the 
combination of tislelizumab  and pamiparib  if the patient is benefiting from the treatment in the 
judgment of the investigator after consultation and agreemen t with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor or its designee.  The criteria for pseudo progression will not be met if the only change 
is reflected in tumor markers, such as CA -125 or PSA.  
If pseudo -progression is suspected, the patient will be allowed to continue  study treatment if 
they meet all of the following criteria:

5.2.5 Patient  Discontinuation  and Withdrawal  
Patient s may withdraw at any time or be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the 
investigator should any untoward adverse effects occur.  In addition, a patient  may be 
withdrawn by the investigator or the sponsor if he/she violates the study plan or for 
administrative and/or other safety reasons.  The investigator or st udy coordinator must notify 
the sponsor immediately when a patient  has been discontinued/withdrawn due to an adverse 
event . When a patient  discontinues/withdraws, all applicable evaluations scheduled for the 
final study visit should be performed at the tim e of discontinuation.  Any adverse event which 
is present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the 
safety requirements outlined in  Section  8.4. 
In the event that a patient  is prematurely discontinued from the study at any time due to an AE 
(as defined in  Section  10.3), the procedures stated in Section  8.5 must be  followed.  
In addition to the post -study assessments, if a DLT occurs, the investigator will obtain, when 
possible, a blood sample for analysis of serum tislelizumab  and plasma pamiparib  
concentration.  
Patient s who discontinue  or are withdrawn for any reason other than DLT during Cycle 1 of 
any DL will be considered for replacement after due consideration by the sponsor and /or SMC 
if the minimum number of patient s needed for the evaluation of MTD is not met . 
Premature discontin uation of tislelizumab  and pamiparib  would be any time when a patient  is 
discontinued for reasons other than unacceptable toxicity. The reason for discontinuation of 
the study drugs will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  These reasons may 
include:  
 Withdrawal of consent by the patient ; 
 Discontinuation of tislelizumab /pamiparib  by the sponsor ; 
 Pregnancy ; 
 Any significant AE that compromises the patient ’s ability to participate in the study ;

 Death ;  
 Lost to follow up ; 
 Confirmed progression of disease at any time during the study (refer to  Section  8.8.1 ); 
 Significant deviation from the protocol by the investigator without the consent of the 
sponsor.  
5.2.5.1  Patient s Withdraw Prior to Documentation of  Progressive Disease  
Patient s who stop treatment prior to documentation of progressive disease ( PD) will undergo 
repeated imaging for tumor response assessments during the study approximately every 
9 ± 1 weeks in the first 12  months and approximately every  12 ± 1 weeks  thereafter until 
unequivocal PD is documented or the patient  starts new anti cancer  therapies or patient  
withdraws consent from the trial.  This imaging schedule will be maintained and will never be 
adjusted regardless of any intermediate unsch eduled scans.  Patient s who withdraw from the 
study for clinical or symptomatic deterioration before objective documentation of PD will be 
requested to undergo appropriate imaging to confirm PD.  Every effort will be made to confirm 
a clinical diagnosis of P D by imaging.

use vial (20R glass, USP type I) containing a total of 100  mg antibody in 10  mL of isotonic 
solution.  See Section  6.5 below for handling and product storage conditions.  
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the product description for tislelizumab . [12] 
The patient s will receive pamiparib  as 10 mg or 40 mg  capsules, depending on dose 
level and availability (  capsules for  mg dose and s  
 caps ules for  mg dose).   BGB -290 drug product is also supplied as a mg strength 
in capsules (  capsule shells).  
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the product description for pamiparib . [19]  
6.2 Dosage and Administration  
The treatments to be administered during the study  are: 
 Tislelizumab  10 mL s ingle -use vial for IV infusion  
 Pamiparib  10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg capsules for oral use  
Tislelizumab  will be administered as an IV infusion, every 3  weeks . Pamiparib  will be 
administered orally  twice daily , once in the morning and once in the evening 12 hours apart . 
The starting dose of each agent will not exceed the highest DL at which no DLT was reported 
during the first -in-human ongoing trials.  
In both Parts A and B of the study, tislelizumab  will be administered as an IV infusion on Day 
1 of a 21-day cycle, and pamiparib  will be taken orally twice daily  startin g from Day 1.  
On the first d ay where both study drugs are administered,  the morning dose of pamiparib  
should be given at least 30 minutes prior to the IV infusion of tislelizumab . Subsequently in 
the evening, pamiparib  administration is repeated.  On subse quent days  of each cycle, twice 
daily dosing of pamiparib  will continue in the morning and evening (at approx imately the same 
time), as a 20 -day period of continuous drug administration . During subsequent cycles, the 
treatment repeats every 21  days for 34  cycles (2 years ) from Day  1 to Day  21.  
If a dose of pamiparib  is not taken at the scheduled time, it can be taken ASAP  within 2  hours 
of the scheduled time and return to the normal schedule for the next dose.  Extra dose of 
pamiparib  should not be taken to make up for the missed dose.   Patients will be instructed to 
swallow the capsules whole, in rapid succession, with water. Pamiparib  can be administered 
with or without food.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Tislelizumab  will be administered by IV infusion through a n intravenous line containing a 
sterile, non -pyrogenic, low -protein binding 0.2  micron in -line or add -on filter.  Specific 
instructions for product preparation and administration are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
As a routine precaution, after infusion o f tislelizumab  on day 1 of cycle 1 and cycle 2, 
patients must be monitored for at least 1 hour afterwards in an area with resuscitation 
equipment and emergency agents.  From cycle  3 onward, at least a 30 -minute monitoring 
period is required in an area with  resuscitation equipment and emergency agents.  
The initial infusion (cycle 1, day 1) will be delivered over 60 minutes; if this is well 
tolerated, then the subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes, which is the 
shortest time period permissi ble for infusion.  Tislelizumab  must not be concurrently  
administered with any other drug (refer to Section  7.0). 
Guidelines for dose modification, treatment interruption, or discontinuation and for the 
management of irAEs and infusion -related reactions are provided in detail in Section  10.13.4

THERAPIES  
7.1 Permitted Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a patient ’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care.  All concomitant medications taken during the study will be r ecorded on the case 
report form (CRF) including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal medicines , 
mushroom -containing products, dietary supplements  and IV medications and fluids.  If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug dos age, frequency, route, and date will 
also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within 30  days before the first dose of study medi cation 
and 30  days after the last dose of study medication should be recorded.  
The eCRF entry must include the dose, regimen , route, tumor type , and start and stop dates of 
use of the prior and concomitant medication.  
7.2 Prohibited Medications  
Patient s may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary, 
with the specific exception of non -protocol specified chemotherapy, therapeutic radiotherapy, 
immunotherapy, anti -neoplastic biological therapy or invest igational agents other than 
tislelizumab  and pamiparib . External beam radiation therapy is allowed only  for those patient s 
who require radiation therapy for the treatment of pain secondary to bone metastases. Radiation 
therapy provided for therapeutic intent will be considered anticancer treatment. Patient s who 
in the assessment by the investigator require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments 
for clinical management should be removed from the study. Bisphosphonate or denosumab use 
is permitted if the patient  has already been on it for 3 or more months and on a stable dose.  
Patient s with active aut oimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, or 
who require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be 
excluded . These include but are not limited to patient s with a history of immune -related 
neurologic  disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain -
Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus , connective tissue diseases, 
scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s , ulcerative colitis, hepatitis, TEN , Stevens -
Johnson syndrome, or anti-phospholipid syndrome.  
Patient s are prohibited from receiving any live vaccines within 4  weeks (28  days) of initiation 
of study therapy .  Patients are eligible if 28 days have elapsed since receipt of vaccine and

vaccines and are allowed.  Intranasal vaccines are live vaccines; and are not allowed .) 
The primary metabolic pathway for pamiparib  involves the cytochrome P450 ( CYP )3A 
isoform.  The compounds/substances presented in Appendix  12 are associated with possible 
interactions with pamiparib  through the CYP3A metabolic pathway as well as other various 
metabolic interactions and are prohibited . [85] 
Preliminary in vitro  screening assays revealed pamiparib  is not a strong inhibitor of human 
CYP isoenzymes tested. It is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (IC 50 = 6.48 M). Patient s taking 
the medications presented in Appendix  13 need to be closely monitored for AEs . [85] 
In addition to CYP3A  and CYP2C9 , pamiparib  can also be metabolized by CYP2C8 in human 
liver microsomes, but to a lesser extent.  The compounds/substances presented in Appendix  14 
are associated with possible interactions with pamiparib  through the CYP2C8 metabolic 
pathway and should also be used with caution . [85] The following website can be used as an 
alternate reference: medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis  
The potential for drug -drug interaction between tislelizumab  and small -molecule drug products 
is very low, given tislelizumab  is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody.  Because tislelizumab  is 
expected to be degraded into amino aci ds and recycle into other proteins, it is unlikely to have 
an effect on drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters.  
Section 5.2.2  of the protocol (Exclusion Criteria) describes other medications which are 
prohibited in this study.  
7.2.1 Other Study Considerations  
The following nondrug therapies must not be administered durin g the study (within 28  days 
before the start of study treatment):  
 Major surgery (exc luding prior diagnostic biopsy)  
 Herbal remedies with immune -stimulating properties (ie, mistletoe extract) or known 
to potentially interfere with major o rgan function (ie, hypericin) . Alternative medicines 
for cancer therapy or for altering the immune system.  
 Drugs that are known to cause prolongation in QT/QTc interval and/or induce Torsades 
des Pointes (Appendix 17).  
 Patients should avoid alcohol consumption and should avoid any other drugs or 
supplements during the study not prescribed by the attending physician .

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  8.0 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 Prescreening  (Part B Only)  
Patients in Arm 1 (ovarian cancer), Arm 2 (TNBC), and Arm 3 (mCRPC) in Part B of the study 
who have unknown biomarker status will be permitted to have a pre -screening period for HRD 
status. A separate pre -screening informed consent must be obtained for patients in these arms.  
An archival tumor sample will be obtained for pre -screening purpose for patient s in Arm 1 
(ovarian cancer), Arm 2 (TNBC), and Arm 3 (mCRPC). If an archival tumor sample is not 
available, a fresh tumor biopsy of an accessible tumor lesion will be obtained for the pre -
screening purpose.  
The following will be performed during pre -scree ning tumor sample collection:  
 Obtain written informed consent from the patient or the patient’s legal representative 
to perform a tumor biopsy if it is required for the purpose of meeting the eligibility 
criteria of the study  
 Prepare tumor samples and ship  to the qualified central laboratory for mutation 
analysis as specified in the Laboratory Manual  
Patients in Arm  1 (ovarian cancer) will proceed to the screening phase once they have signed 
the pre -screening informed consent and submitted their tumor tissu e sample.  Their biomarker 
status does not preclude their eligibility  while both Arm 1a and Arm 1b remain open and 
enrolling. When either Arm 1a or Arm 1b is 50% enrolled , then biomarker status must be 
determined prior to patients proceeding to the screeni ng phase  to avoid over -enrollment to the 
cohort . 
Patients in Arm 2 (TNBC) and Arm 3 (mCRPC) who submit archival tissue  with proven 
mutational positivity  are eligible for enrollment in Arm 2 or Arm 3.  If a  diagnostic test result 
on submitted archival tissue is HRD negative or is a failure, then the patient is  not eligible for 
enrollment.   
For patients in Arm 2 (TNBC) and Arm 3 (mCRPC) who submit a fresh tumor biopsy , their 
biomarker status will determine whether they will be eligible for enrollment in  Arm 2 or Arm 
3, respectively.  If the pre -screening biopsy demonstrates germline or somatic BRCA1/2  
mutation or HRD positivity, then the patient would be eligible for enrollment in Arm 2 or Arm 
3.  If the results of the mutational test on the pre -screenin g biopsy is HRD negative or is a 
failure, then the patient is  not eligible for enrollment . 
8.2 Screening  
A signed, written informed consent must be obtained prior to screening assessments and before 
any study -specific assessments are initiated.  The study -specific assessments and procedures

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  are shown in the study assessments and procedures schedule in  Table 3 and Table 5. The PK 
sampling time points are presented in Table 4 and Table 6. 
The screening assessments are the same for Part A and Part B of the study.   
Re-screening of laboratory parameters which do not meet the specif ied inclusion criteria will 
be allowed once per patient within the screening period window (Day -28 to Day -1). 
Patients who are suspected or known to have serious/severe respiratory conditions or exhibit 
significant respiratory symptoms unrelated to the u nderlying cancer will undergo pulmonary 
function testing which may include but is not limited to spirometry and assessment of diffusion 
capacity done during the Screening period to assist the determination of suitability on the study  
(see Table 5). 
8.2.1 Demographic and Baseline Assessments  
Demographic and baseline assessments are the same for Part A and Part B.  
Demographic data will include gender, age or date of birth, race, and ethnicity. This data will 
be captured in the eCRF.  
Having given consent, patient s will be required to undergo a medical screen to determine 
whether they are eligible to participate in th e study according to  the criteria listed in  
Section  5.2. Screening  assessm ents will be completed within 28  days prior to the first dose of 
the investigational product.  If screening laboratory tests are completed within 14 days  prior to 
first dose, pre -dose samples on Day 1 of Cycle 1 will not be repeated. The screening 
assessments will include:

investigational product .  
o Bone scans will be performed within 56 days prior to the administration of 
investigational product . 
o Any patient with a history of CNS metastases will be required to undergo CT/MRI 
at baseline to ensure all sites of disease are evaluated per RECIST v1.1 criteria . 
Patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases on screening CT/MRI will be 
required to be treated for brain metastasis with standard of care treatments and be 
off corticosteroids prior to study entry.  
o All patients with SCLC are required to have CT/MRI of the brain at baseline  
 A blood sample must be collected at screening stage for ovarian, fallopian  tube, primary 
peritoneal, and breast cancer patient s for germline BRCA  and/or other mutations analysis 
for patient s enrolled in Part A. All patient s in Part B, regardless of tumor type , will have 
blood drawn for BRCA  and/or other mutatio nal analysis, even if it has been previously 
tested . 
 Collection of archival tumor specimen or fresh tumor biopsy . If tumor samples have been

outside the normal range will be repeated at the discretion of the investigator.  
8.2.2 Females of Chi ldbearing Potential and Contraception  
See Appendix  17 for The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to 
contraception and pregnancy te sting in clinical trials including  the use of highly effective forms 
of birth control.  
8.3 Assessments During Treatment  
Safety assessments should be performed at all visits to the study center and throughout the 
study.  The list of events and the time when they will be performed are presented in  Table 3 for 
Part A  and in Table 5 for Part B  (if appropriate) . 
8.3.1 Laboratory Evaluation  
Local or central laboratory assessments on serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and 
urinalysis will be conducted, of which certain elem ents will be collected as specified in 
Appendix  2. Laboratory assessments need not be repeated on Day  1 if these assessments were 
completed for screening within  14 days  of the first administration of the investigational 
product.   
Routine laboratory tests (eg, CBC with differential; comprehensive serum chemistry panel; 
PT/INR and aPTT; immunoglobulins; urinalys is; urine and serum β -HCG) will be performed 
by the local study site laboratory or their contract laboratory. Patient  treatment and overall 
management decisions will be based on local laboratory data. Details regarding the amount of 
blood drawn for laborat ory testing are provided in a laboratory reference document .   
Clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be performed  up to 14 days  prior to Cycle 
1 Day  1 and at the time points specified in Table 3 and Table 5 (for Parts A and B, 
respectively),  and a lso at mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit s.  
PT/INR and aPTT should be collected at Screening and if a Grade 2 or higher hepatic AE 
occurs, as specified in Table 5.  Coagulation parameters should be evaluated more frequently 
during  the study when clinically indicated. PT/INR and aPTT will be anal yzed by the local 
study site laboratory.  
In the event of neutropenia (ANC <  1000/mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelets <  50,000/mm3), 
or Grade  3 clinical chemistry toxicity, the relevant assessments will be conducted as frequent 
as the physician feels needed u ntil toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade  2. If warranted, additional 

BeiGene Ltd. Page 98 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  testing can also be done, or the relevant tests done more frequently in accordance with 
institutional guidelines. All patient s, who have any Grade  3 or Grade  4 laboratory 
abnormalities at the Sa fety Follow -up Visits, must be followed up until they have returned to 
≤ Grade  2 or baseline, unless these are not likely to improve due to the underlying disease.  
Thyroid function which includes T3, T4, and TSH will be assessed  at pre -dose of Day  1 of 
every cycle and at the mandator y Safety Follow -up Visit s. If feasible, early morning 
adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) and cortisol will be obtained as part of the screening 
assessments and only repeated during the study if it is clinically indicated. Analysis will be 
performed by the local study site laboratory.  
For Part B, thyroid function will be collect ed at screening, every 2 cycles, or more frequently 
as clinically indicated during treatment, and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visits.  
Analysis of IgG and IgM will be performed  at pre-dose of Day  1 every cycle in first 12  months, 
approximately every 2 months th ereafter, and at Safety Follow -up Visit s in Part A only . 
Analysis will be performed by the local study site lab oratory.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
A central laboratory may be used in this study.  Investigators may use results from local 
laboratories for assessing eligibility, safety mon itoring and dosing decision.  
8.3.2 Physical Examination , Ophthalmologic Examinations  and Vital Signs  
A complete physical examination,  vital signs , and weight as well as ophthalmologic 
examin ation will be performed at the time points specified in Table 3 and in Table 5. In Part  B, 
a full physical examination will be performed at the Screening and S afety Follow -up visits, at 
all other times targeted or symptoms -directed physical examination, at the investigators 
discretion is permitted. A full physical examination includes:  examin ation of general 
appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; neck; heart; chest (including lungs); abdomen; 
extremities; skin; lymph nodes; cardio -vascular; and neurological status.  
ECOG performance status will be evaluated at time points specified in Table 3 and in Table 5. 
Vital signs will include body temperature, heart rate , respiratory rate, and blood pressure.  To 
the extent feasible, blood pressure will be taken on the same arm throughout the study.  A large 

BeiGene Ltd. Page 99 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  cuff should be used for obese patient s. Patient s must be resting  in a sitting position for 
10 minutes prior to obtaining vital signs.  If blood pressure is >  150/100 in a patient  without a 
history of hypertension, or increased >  20 mmHg (diastolic) from baseline measurement in a 
patient  with a previous history of hypert ension, the assessment should be repeated in 
10 minutes for confirmation.  
Ophthalmologic Examination  
Eye exam, visual acuity test, and optical coherence tomography (or equivalent diagnostic test) 
will be assessed at the Screening Visit. Eye exam, visual ac uity test, and optical coherence 
tomography (or equivalent diagnostic test for retinal examination) captured as standard of care 
prior to obtaining written informed consent and within 28 days of study entry  may be used for 
the Screening evaluation. Patient s will undergo repeat assessments approximately every 
15 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment and a final assessment < 30 days after the last dose 
of tislelizumab  study treatment.   
In addition, Investigators should solicit patients regarding changes in  vision, visual 
disturbance, or ocular inflammation at each scheduled study visit during tislelizumab  
treatment. For any change in vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be made for further 
management guidance (see Appendix  10). 
8.3.3 Medical History/ Prior Medications  
The medical history and prior medications assessments are the same for Part A and Part B.  
The medical history and current/ relevant prior medications (wit hin the past 12 months)  are 
recorded at Screening.  
History of treatment for the primary diagnosis, including prior systemic, radiation treatment , 
and surgical treatment will be recorded.  Radiographic studies performed prior to study entry 
may be collected for review by the investigator.  Date and response to last platinum -containing 
chemotherapy treatment must be documented unless no platinum -containing treatment has 
been received.  Date of disease progression after completing platinum -containing regimen must  
be documented.  
8.3.4 Electrocardiogram  
Part A:  
Electrocardiograms will be obtained at the time points specified in Table 3 and Table 4 at 
Screening within 14  days of Cycle  1 Day  1 as baseline, and at the mand atory Safety Follow -
up Visits. Additional ECGs may be obtained if clinically indicated.  
Part B:  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 100 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Electrocardiograms will be obtained at the time points specified in Table 5 and Table 6 at 
Screening within 14  days of Day 1 of study treatment  as baseline, as clinically indicated during 
the treatment period, and at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit s. 
For both Part A and Part B:  
Triplicate ECG recordings (3 readings in rapid succession and not more than 2 minutes apart) 
will be obtained locally at the site in  conjunction with blood sampling for pamiparib  
pharmacokinetics  at the times specified in Table 4 and Table 6.   ECGs required at timepoints 
that do not include a PK sample do not need to be triplicate assessments.  
Significant QTc prolongation will  be defined as an interval  ≥ 500 msec or an inter val which 
increases by  ≥ 60 msec over baseline.  Either of these conditions should be documented on two 
or more ECG t racings separated by at least 5  minutes.  The ECG tracing should be examined 
and a manual measurement by a trained physician should be performed to assess the accuracy 
of the equipment being used.  
If a patient  has significant QTc prolongation ： 
 He/she will be withdrawn from the investigational product administration if the 
investigator and/or the medical monitor determine the patient  is at risk.  
 The patient  will be monitored, treated appropriately, and closely followed (ECGs at least 
three times per week) until the QT and QTc interval return to within 30  msec of baseline.  
 The medical monitor will be consulted prior to ad ministering further doses or r e-
challenging  with pamiparib . 
 The medical monitor will be consulted prior to administering further pamiparib . 
8.3.5 Serum Tumor Markers  
The serum tumor marker collection is to occur  for Part A and Part B as per Table 3 and Table 5. 
Standard tumor markers (as appropriate for a given tumor type) will be c ollected at  
 
 
 
 
. Analysis will be performed by the local study site laboratory where 
feasible. If not feasible, tests will be performed by a certified central laboratory.  

BeiGene Ltd. Page 101 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  For both Part A and Part B:  
PSA Meas urements  
Increases and decreases in PSA will be tracked to assess PSA responses by the PCWG 3 criteria 
(refer to  Appendix  6). PSA changes from baseline (either increment or decline) and maximal 
change in PSA will be recorded and responses assigned by PCWG 3 criteria. PSA responses 
and progression must be confirmed 28 days later.  
Although serial PSA will be measured on this study and PSA progression documented by the 
PCWG 3 criteria, the PSA value on its own is not considered a reliable measure of clinical 
benefit and does not correlate tightly with survival. PSA flares may occur early in the treatment 
and may  therefore confound response assessment. Additionally, there is emerging data that 
PARP -1 is implicated in multiple other essential cellular functions separate from DNA repair 
including ETS gene -mediated transcription regulation which may have a bearing on  the 
response assessments by PSA. PSA reading should not be applied as the sole criteria to 
consider treatment discontinuation. In absence of evidence of radiological or clinical evidence 
of disease progression, patient s with mCRPC should continue in the s tudy despite an increment 
in PSA. Overall, therefore patient s will not be taken off trial purely for rising PSA levels in the 
absence of worsening scans and symptoms since PARP inhibitors may impact tumor growth 
without impacting PSA secretion. PSA respons e and PSA progression will be defined 
according to the consensus guidelines of the PCWG 3 criteria ( refer to Appendix  6). 
8.3.6 Computed Tomography  
Tumor imaging is  the same for Part A and Part B as per Table 3 and Table 5. 
Tumor imaging ( CT or MRI, with preference for CT) will be performed within 28  days prior 
to enrollment, and while on study approximately every 9 ± 1 weeks  in the first 12  months and 
approxim ately every 12  ± 1 weeks  thereafter  and at the Safety Follow -up. Positron emission 
tomography (PET) imaging scans for treatment response evaluation are not allowed in this 
study.  
A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis plus other relevant evaluations as appropriate, 
including bone scan for patient s with bone metastasis, will be performed to assess all known 
disease.  All known disease must be documented at baseline as target or non -target lesions using 
RECIST v1.1. The CT scan will be used for the evaluation of RECIST v1.1 by the investigator 
at each study center.  
A baseline brain MRI is required for all patients in the SCLC cohort.  Patients in other cohorts 
with a known history of brain metastases must have an MRI to document the status of existing, 
previously treated brain metastases .  Brain metastases should be evaluated throughout the study 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 102 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  as part of the assessment of anti -tumor activity from the combination of tislelizumab and 
pamiparib.  
Unless contraindicated , intravenous contrast product must be used to maximize visualization 
of all lesions.  Five millimeter (mm) contiguous scans at baseline and subsequent scanning 
approximately every 9 ± 1 weeks  in the first 12  months and approximately every 12  ± 1 weeks  
thereafter until progression, as calculated by the date of the first administration of the 
investigational product) until progression, with mandatory imaging coverage from thoracic 
inlet to symphysis pubis should be performed.  Patient s who are at increased ris k of allergic 
reaction to iodinated contrast media should not have enhanced CT, but should instead be 
provided magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement patient  to local 
protocol, with mandatory imaging coverage from thoracic inlet to sy mphysis pubis plus 
unenhanced CT scanning with coverage from the thoracic inlet to the inferior costophrenic 
recess. Patient s with bone pain or biochemical changes suggestive of bony disease without 
other clear explanation should have a bone scan at baseli ne and if bone metastases are 
documented should then have bone scans or other appropriate imaging examination s as 
clinically indicated . New lesions on a bone scan should be assessed with caution and, unless 
otherwise explained, should be imaged by CT or fo cal radiographs.   
The same imaging technique should be used in a patient  throughout the study.  After first 
documentation of response (CR or PR), imaging performed at the next regularly scheduled 
time point will be used for response confirmation.  PD suspected as pseudo -progression needs 
to be confirmed in a subsequent imaging at least 4  weeks later or at the next regularly scheduled 
time point before discontinuation of study treatment  as described in  Section  8.8.1 .  
Technetium bone scans will be used to assess bone lesions. In patient s with prostate cancer 
baseline bone scans will be performed during the screening window, and repeat bone scans 
will be performed approximately every 9 ± 1 weeks in the first 12 months and approximately 
every 12 ± 1 weeks thereafter until progression to keep with the schedule of the CT scans . Bone 
scan results will be reported as either no lesions or lesions present  along with the number of 
bone lesions. Disease progression by bone scan will be defined per the PCWG 3 (refer to 
Appendix  6); progression is defined as 2 new bone lesions at the first ‘progression’ scan, 
confirmed by a subsequent scan at least 6  weeks later with the presence of 2 additional lesions.  
Patient s who s top treatment prior to documentation of PD will undergo repeated imaging for 
tumor response assessments during the study approximately every 9 ± 1 weeks  in the first 
12 months and approximately every 12  ± 1 weeks  thereafter until unequivocal PD is 
document ed or the patient  starts new anti cancer  therapies or patient  withdraws consent from 
the trial.  This imaging schedule will be maintained and will never be adjusted regardless of 
any intermediate unscheduled scans.  Patient s who withdraw from the study for clinical or 
symptomatic deterioration before objective documentation of PD will be requested to undergo 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 103 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  appropriate imaging to confirm PD.  Every effort will be made to confirm a clinical diagnosis 
of PD by imaging.  
8.3.7 Optional Tumor Biopsy  
PART A  and B :  
For those patient s who consent to fresh biopsy, an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis 
during the third week of the first cycle is recommended in order to assess pharmacodynamics 
effects and resistance mechanisms  (Section 8.11). For the patients who have confirmed disease 
progression, an optional biopsy may be taken at the Safety Follow -up visit  only if the lesion to 
be biopsied is at low risk for complications and the patient can safely undergo the procedure .  
The purpose of this biopsy sample is to evaluate mechanisms of resistance to study treatment 
(s). If feasible, any follow up biopsy shoul d be ideally taken from the same anatomical location 
as the baseline biopsy. Additional written patient consent is required for optional fresh tumor 
biopsies . 
8.3.8 Adverse Events  
Adverse event collection is the same for Part A and Part B as per Table 3 and Table 5. 
All AEs and SAEs, regardless of the rela tionship to the investigational product, will be 
collected from signing the informed consent form (ICF) and throughout the study  until 30 days 
after the last study treatment or initiation of new anticancer therapy . The exception are irAE s, 
which will be recorded up to 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab , regardless of initiation 
of subsequent anticancer therapy . 
8.4 Safety  Assessments  
Overall safety assessment is the same for Part A and Part B as per Table 3 and Table 5. 
Vital signs, weight, physical examinations, ophthalmologic examina tions,  ECOG performance 
status, ECGs and laboratory safety tests (eg, PT/aPTT, urinalysis, CBC, serum chemistries, 
autoantibodies, thyroid function, viral antigen reactions) will be obtained and assessed at 
designated intervals throughout the study (see  Table 3 and Table 5). Special attention will be 
given to irAEs  (eg, gut, skin, lung, liver, k idney , endocrine organs, others).  If irAE of the liver 
occurs, a biopsy of the liver is strongly encouraged . 
Adverse events will be graded and recorded throughout the study according to NCI -CTCAE, 
version 4.03 . [86] Characterization of toxicities will include severity, duration, and time to 
onset.  Safety endpoints will include all types of AEs, in addition to laboratory safety 
assessments, ECOG perfor mance scale status, ECGs, and vital signs.

BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  8.4.1 Safety Evaluation  
The continuous safety evaluation will be performed by the sponsor, the coordinating 
investigator, and investigators.  In Part A, a SMC is established for the determination of DLs 
to be administere d during dose escalation phase and dose regimens in this study.  Details of the 
safety monitoring process will be specified in a dedicated study management  plan. 
The SMC consists of the coordinating investigator, selected recruiting investigators, the 
spons or’s medical monitor, and the contract research organization’s  (CRO)  medical monitor . 
Ad hoc members will be consulted as needed and may include, but are not restricted to the 
biostatistician and pharmacokinetic scientist . 
The SMC will decide on DLTs relevant for the treatment and will decide by consensus on dose 
escalation, dose de -escalation, or suspension of enrollment  based on safety and/or on PK data.   
Before moving to the next dose level, the SMC will review all safety  data available to 
determine whether recruitment to the next cohort should be initiated.  The SMC will determine 
when no further dose escalation is appropriate and whether the MTD will be defined as a 
preceding dose or an intermediate dose.  
The SMC will mee t for cohort safety reviews after all patient s in a dosing cohort have 
completed the first treatment cycle.  All available safety data will also be provided for patient s 
who discontinue prior to this time.  Safety data from prior cohorts may also be presente d. The 
decision to escalate dose and the determination of the MTD will be based on the cohort safety 
reviews.  The SMC will review any protocol violations that may have impacted evaluation of 
potential DLT.  The SMC may weigh collective evidence and may dete rmine a DLT for reasons 
in addition to those explicitly stated in the final protocol.  
Response from all SMC members, or their designees, shall be required for each 
escalation/review.  
Adequate time for review of results will be given to SMC members (approxi mately 1 to 
2 business days).  Enrollment in subsequent DLs will be put “on hold” during each review 
period, pending the decision of the SMC.  
The SMC decision points may fall into one of the categories detailed below:  
 Escalate to a higher dose  
 Recruit addit ional patient s into existing dose level  or expansion cohort  
 Explore  any other DLs; ie, an intermediate, not pre -defined , previously evaluated or  
not previously  evaluated  dose level  below MTD  
 Stop escalation and investigate lower dose(s)  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 105 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential   End part of the study  
 End the overall study  
Decisions will be made using the criteria defined within the protocol (see Section 5.1.1 ). The 
SMC will make the dose es calation decisions.  
The SMC may decide to evaluate an intermediate, not pre -defined, previously evaluated or not 
previously -evaluated dose or a less frequent dosing schedule that will not exceed the MTD 
level, if evaluation of toxicity at such a dose or sc hedule is desired. If this approach is taken, 
up to 6 new patient s should be enrolled at that dose or schedule.  
In Part  B of the study,  the sponsor and its designees will review the safety (eg, related 
procedure adverse events and serious adverse events; disease related events do not need to be 
reported) on a routine basis and will discuss any significant safety findings with the 
investigators immediately . If necessary, an SMC including  investigators treating patients in 
each disease -specific cohort may be convened for review of safety data  and/or assessment of 
benefit/risk . 
8.5 Follow -up Assessments  
Generally, the overall follow -up strategy is the same for Part A and Part B as per Table 3 and 
Table 5. 
All patient s must  be followed for at least 30  days after their last dose of study drug or until 
initiation of a new anti cancer  treatment, whichever occurs first.  
Patient s who are discontinued from the study due to an unacceptable drug-related AE will be 
followed until the resolution of the AE to ≤ Grade  1 or stabilization or non-laboratory toxicities 
to allow  for re -treatment  agreed by investigators and medical monitor  or until beginning of a 
new therapy for their cancer, whichever occurs first.   
In Part A, a mandatory Safe ty Follow -up Visit should be conducted 30 days ( ± 7 days) after 
the last  dose of study drug administration  or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever 
occurs first . Following completion or discontinuation of the treatment and/or Safety Follow -
up pha ses of the study, every effort should be made to follow up all patient s for their survival 
status until patient  death.  
In Part B, a mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit should be conducted 30 days ( ± 7 days) after 
the last dose of pamiparib  administration  and 90 days (± 14 days) after the last dose of 
tislelizumab or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. With the exception 
of all irAE s, which  will be recorded up to 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab , regardless 
of initiation  of subsequent anticancer therapy . Patient s who have not demonstrated disease

approximately every 12  ± 1 weeks thereafter until unequivocal PD is documented or the patient  
starts new anticancer therapies or patient  withdraws consent from the trial. The same 
methodology should be used throughout the study.  
Patient s who stop tre atment prior to documentation of PD will undergo repeated imaging for 
tumor response assessments during the study approximately every 9 ± 1 weeks  in the first  
12 months and approximately every 12  ± 1 weeks  thereafter until unequivocal PD is 
documented or t he patient  starts new anti cancer  therapies or patient  withdraws consent from 
the trial.  This imaging schedule will be maintained and will never be adjusted regardless of 
any intermediate unscheduled scans.  Patient s who withdraw from the study for clinical or 
symptomatic deterioration before objective documentation of PD will be requested to undergo 
appropriate imaging to confirm PD.  Every effort will be made to confirm a clinical diagnosis 
of PD by imaging.  
Following completion of the treatment and safety f ollow -up periods, a ll patient s will be 
followed for survival and subsequent anticancer therapy information after the treatment 
termination. Survival follow -up and subsequent anticancer therapy information will be 
collected during telephone calls, through patient s’ medical records, and/or at clinic visit every 
3 months until death, loss to follow -up or study termination by the sponsor. No other data (eg, 
subsequent therapies, performance status, etc.) beyond survival will be collected during these 
calls/visi ts. The study staff may use a public information source (eg, county records) to obtain 
information about survival status only.  
8.6 Visit Windows  
All visits must occur within the windows specified in Table 3 and Table 5.  All assessments 
will be performed on the day of the specified visit unless an accep table visit window is 
specified.  Assessments scheduled on the day of s tudy treatment administration (D ay 1) of each 
cycle should be performed prior to study treatment infusion/dose unless otherwise noted.  
Laboratory results are required to be reviewed prior to dosing.  
If the timing of a protocol -mandated study visit coincides with a holiday, weekend, or other 
events, the visit should be scheduled on the nearest feasible date (the visit window is provided 
in Table 3 and Table 5), with subsequent dosing continued on the 21 -day intervals accordingly,  
with a minimum of 14 days between tislelizumab  dosing.  
8.7 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time at the patient’s or investigator’s request and 
may include vital signs/focused physical examination; ECOG performance status; AE revi ew; 
concomitant medications and procedures review; radiographic assessments; physical

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  examination of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; disease -related constitutional symptoms; and 
hematology and chemistry laboratory assessments.  The date and reason for the unscheduled 
visit must be recorded in the source documentation.   
If an unscheduled visit is necessary to assess toxicity or for suspected disease progression, then 
diagnostic tests may be performed based on investigator assessment as appropriate, and the 
results of these tests should be entered on the unscheduled visit eCRF.  
8.8 Efficacy  Assessment  
This study includes preliminary assessments of efficacy (anti-tumor activity) as outlined in the 
sections below  for both Part A and Part B . 
Disease assessment by radiographic imaging (CT or MRI, with a preference for CT) will be 
performed and recorded at screening within 28  days before enrollment and while on study 
approximately every 9± 1 weeks  in the first 12  months and approximately every 1 2 ± 1 weeks  
thereafter according to the RECIST  v1.1 Guidelines as shown in Appendix  8. The same 
imaging technique a s used at baseline must  be used throughout the study. If any study patient  
discontinues study treatment for clinical progression, every attempt should be made to confirm 
PD using standard radiologic methods.  
After first documentation of CR or PR, imaging performed at the next regularly scheduled time 
point will be used for response confirmation.  
For patient s with ovarian, fallopian  tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, investigators may also 
incorporate GCIG CA -125 response criteria with RECIST Version 1.1 response criteria in 
assessing tumor response (refer to Appendix  4).  
For patient s with prostate cancer, PCW G3 criteria will also be used to evaluate PSA and 
modified RECIST responses.  
8.8.1 Disease Progression and Treatment beyond  Disease Progression  
There is evidence that some  patient s treated with anti -PD-1 therapies such as tislelizumab  may 
derive clinical benefit despite initial documentation of PD by RECIST Version  1.1. Pseudo -
progression may occur due to immune cell infiltration and other mechanisms as manifested by 
apparent increase of existing tumor masses or appearance of new tumor  lesions.  [87] For PD 
suspected by the Investigator as pseudo -progression, treatment may continue until 
confirmation of PD with repeat imaging at least 4 weeks later or at the next regularly scheduled 
imaging time point, but not more than 12 weeks from the initial docume ntation of pseudo -
progression.  The criteria for pseudo -progression will not be satisfied if the only disease -
specific  finding is a change in tumor markers (eg , CA-125, PSA increases). It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to determine if the patien t should be considered for treatment 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 108 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  beyond progression due to clinical benefit. This decision should be considered carefully so as 
to permit patient s who are likely to be benefiting to continue treatment while at the same time 
preventing prolonged exposur e of a futile therapy in patient s who may not be benefit ing. The 
assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the patient  is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatment. All decisions to 
continue treatment beyond initial progression must be documented in the medical record, and 
agreed to by the sponsor medical monitor .   
Patient s will be permitted to continue study treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined PD 
for the time periods below and if they meet the following criteria:  
 Investigator -assessed clinical benefit  
 Patient  is tolerating study drug and agrees to continued study treatment.  
 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status  0 or 1  
 Absence of rapid progression of disea se or of progressive tumo r at critical anatomical 
sites (eg , cord compression) that necessitates urgent alternative medical intervention  
 Patient agrees to continued treatment and is re -consented to continue study treatment  
For mCRPC patient s with only bone lesion(s), if there is ambiguity about the appearance of 
the bony lesions such as traumatic in nature or concern about the possibility of healing bone 
having the appearance of sclerosis (flare reaction), and the investigators assess that t hose 
patient s could receive further clinical benefit from the treatment and should also meet the 
criteria listed above for treatment beyond PD defined by initial RECIST v1.1. Those patient s 
will be permitted to continue study treatment beyond second confir med PD by bone scan. 
These cases should be discussed with the sponsor or its designee.  
8.9 Pharmacokinetics  
Blood will be collected to characterize the PK of tislelizumab  and pamiparib . In Part  A of the 
study , PK parameters such as C max, C trough  and T max for pamiparib  may be derived  for each 
cycle at which pharmacokinetics are to be measured; C trough may be derived for tislelizumab . 
In Part B of the study , PK parameters such as C trough may be derived for  both pamiparib  and 
tislelizumab  for each cycle at which pharmacokinetics are to be measured.  Additional PK 
analyses will be conducted as appropriate in all patient s for whom valid tislelizumab  and 
pamiparib  PK parameters can be estimated.  
Blood taken for the PK analysis will be collected at the time points pres ented in Table 4 and 
Table 6. In addition, tislelizumab  PK samples at pre -dose will be collected at the same time 
points as the ADA samples to assess the neutralizing capacity of ADA.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Details concerning handling of the P K serum and plasma samples, including labeling  and 
shipping instructio ns will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  The actual time each sample 
was collected will be captured to the nearest minute in the eCRF and recorded in the database.  
Samples will be s hipped to the central laboratory where all samples will be analyzed for serum 
tislelizumab  and plasma pamiparib  concentrations using a validated method.  
8.9.1 Blood Sample Collection and Handling  
Cannulation for blood sampling for PK will be performed.  PK samples should not be drawn 
from the infusion line or from the same arm of infusion.  Blood will be collected via the 
intravenous cannula pre -dose and at the time points specified in Table 4 and Table 6. The actual 
time each sample was collected will be captured to the nearest minute in the eCRF.  
Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected according to the Laboratory Manual.  Plasma 
(for pamiparib ) and serum (for tislelizumab ) will be separated and immediately frozen.  
Samples must remain frozen . Temperatures  and tissue handling during shipment  are specified 
in the Laboratory Manual . 
Samples will be shipped to a central laboratory where they will be anal yzed for serum 
tislelizumab  and plasma pamiparib  concentrations using a validated method.  
Other Blood Samples  
Blood samples should be obtained, when possible, for analysis of serum tislelizumab  and 
plasma pamiparib  per time -point, in the event of a DLT.  The investigator must record the time  
points  the blood samples obtained and the time of the previous administration in the eCRF.  
Should a DDI between tislelizumab  and/or pamiparib , and a concomitant medication be 
suspected, further blood samples for PK analyses may be taken to characterize the extent of 
the potential interaction.  
8.10 Anti -Drug Antibody  
Immunogenic responses to tislelizumab  will be assessed to determine occurrence of ant i-
tislelizumab  antibody.  For Part A, a s specified in Table 4, blood for anti -tislelizumab  
antibodies should be collected within 24 hours before the st art of infusion on Day  1 and one 
sample between Day 7 through 10 of Cycle 1, and before the start of infusion on Day  1 of 
Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 9 in the first 6  months, approximately every 8 cycles 
thereafter (Cycle  17). For Part B, a s specified in Table 6, blood for anti -tislelizumab  antibodies 
should be collected within 24 hours before the start of infusion on Day  1 and one sampl e 
between Day 7 through 10 of Cycle 1, and before the start of infusion on Day  1 of Cycle 2,

In patient s who discontinue study therapy before 6 months, every effort should be made to 
analyze anti -tislelizumab  antibodies approximately 6  months after the first dose.  tislelizumab  
PK samples at pre -dose will be collected at the same time points as the ADA samples to assess 
the neutralizing capacity of ADA. Samples will be processed according to the Laboratory 
Manual and shipped to a central laboratory for analysis using a validated method.  
8.11 Biomarker  Assessments  
A blood sample at screening stage will be collected for ovarian, fallopian  tube, primary 
peritoneal, and breast cancer patient s enrolled in Part A and in a ll patient s in Part B for 
germline  BRCA  and/or other mutations analysis, even if it has been tested previously. Blood 
samples will be prepared as indicated in the Lab oratory  Manual .

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  9.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
According to the Good Clinical Practice  (GCP ) guidelines  [88], the sponsor is responsible for 
implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems with written 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling.  
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
 Investigator meeting(s)  
 Certified local  laboratories for laboratory measurements and E CGs 
 Study center initiation visit  
 Early study center visits post -enrollment  
 Routine study center monitoring  
 Ongoing study center communication and training  
 Data management quality control checks  
 Continuous data acquisition and cleaning  
 Internal review of d ata 
 Quality control check of the final clinical study report  
In addition, the sponsor and/or the CRO ’s clinical quality assurance department may conduct 
periodic audits of the study processes, including, but not limited to the study center, study 
center vi sits, PK laboratories, local laboratories, vendors, clinical database, and the final 
clinical study report s. When audits are conducted, access must be authorized for all 
study -related documents including medical history and concomitant medication 
documenta tion to authorized sponsor’s representatives and regulatory authorities.  
9.1 Monitoring  
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor procedures, the sponsor has 
engaged the services of a CRO to perform all monitoring functions within this clinic al study.  
Monitors will work in accordance with the sponsor or CRO SOPs and have the same rights 
and responsibilities as monitors from the sponsor’s organization.  Monitors will establish and 
maintain regular contact between the investigator and the sponsor . 
During these contacts, the monitor will:  
 Check the progress of the study.  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 113 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential   Review study data collected.  
 Conduct source document verification.  
 Identify any issues and address their resolution.  
This will be done to verify that the:  
 Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.  
 Safety and rights of patient s are being protected.  
 Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol (and any 
amendments), GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
The investigator agrees to allow the mon itor direct access to all relevant documents and to 
allocate his/her time and the time of his/her personnel to the monitor to discuss findings and 
any relevant issues.  
At study closure, monitors will also conduct all activities described in  Section  13.1. 
9.2 Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of the 
data management and bio statistics departments of the sponsor or the delegated CRO . 
An electronic data capture (EDC) system will be used for this study, meaning that all eCRF 
data will be entered in electronic forms at the study center.  Data collection will be completed 
by author ized study center personnel designated by the investigator.  Appropriate training and 
security measures will be completed with the investigator and all authorized study center 
personnel prior to the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any 
patient s. 
The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations on the patient s participating in the 
study.  Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed ASAP  during or after the patient ’s visit.  To 
avoid inter -observer variability, every effor t should be made to ensure that the same individual 
who made the initial baseline determinations completes all safety evaluations.  The investigator 
must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct.  If some assessments are 
not done, o r if certain information is not available or not applicable or unknown, the 
investigator should indicate this in the eCRF.  The investigator will be required to electronically 
sign off on the clinical data.  
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluate the m for completeness and consistency.  The 
eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies 
between critical data.  All entries, corrections, and alterations are to be made by the responsible 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 114 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  investigator or his/her des ignee.  The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs.  Once clinical 
data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the data fields will 
be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person who performed the 
change, together with time and date will be logged.  Roles and rights of the study center 
personnel responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in 
advance.  If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or data  manager will 
raise a query in the EDC application.  The appropriate study center personnel will answer 
queries sent to the investigator.  
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original (or 
source) medical records  unless otherwise specified.  Source documents are all documents used 
by the investigator or hospital that relate to the patient ’s medical history, that verify the 
existence of the patient , the inclusion and exclusion criteria and all records covering the 
patient ’s participation in the study.  They include laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, 
pharmacy dispensing records, patient  files, etc.  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents.  These will be made 
available for inspection by the study monitor at each monitoring visit.  The investigator must 
submit a completed eCRF for each patient  who receives the investigational product, regardless 
of the duration.  All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or 
hospital records, should be clearly identified with the study and patient  number.  Any personal 
information, including patient  name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve 
individual confidentiality.  
Electronic CRF records will be automatically ap pended with the identification of the creator, 
by means of their unique UserID.  Specified records will be electronically signed by the 
investigator to document his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are 
accurate.  This will be facilita ted by means of the investigator’s unique UserID and password; 
date and time stamps will be added automatically at the time of the electronic signature.  If an 
entry on an eCRF requires change, the correction should be made in accordance with the 
relevant s oftware procedures.  All changes will be fully recorded in a protected audit trail, and 
a reason for the change will be required.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities 
(MedDRA) Version 17 .0 or higher versions . Concomitant medications will be coded using the 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary  Enhanced  (WHO -DD).  Concomitant 
diseases/medical history will be coded using the MedDRA Version 17.0 or higher versions . 
9.3 Quality Assurance  Audit  
To ensure compliance wi th GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor may 
conduct a quality assurance audit.  Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory

completion of th e study.  If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and institution agree 
to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her 
time and the time of his/her personnel to the auditor/inspector to discuss find ings and any 
relevant issues.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  10.0 SAFETY  MONITORING  AND  REPORTING  
The investigator is responsible for the monitoring and documentation of events that meet the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  
10.1 Risks Associated with Tislelizumab  
Tislelizumab  is an investigational agent that is currently in clinical development. Limited 
safety data are available in patients and the full safety profile has not been characterized. The 
following information is based on results from nonclin ical and clinical studies with 
tislelizumab  and published data on other molecules within the same biologic class.  
The PD -L1/PD -1 pathway is involved in peripheral tolerance; therefore, such therapy may 
increase the risk of irAEs, specifically the induction  or enhancement of autoimmune 
conditions. Immune -related AEs commonly associated with anti -PD-1 therapy are presented 
in Table  9.   
Although most irAE s observed with immunomodulatory agents have been mild and 
self-limiting, such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential 
major complications. Guidance for evaluation and management for suspected irAEs are 
provided in Section  10.13.4  and Appendix  10. 
10.2 General Plan to Manage Safety Concerns  
10.2.1  Eligibility Criteria  
Eligibility criteria were selected to guard the safety of patients in this trial. Results from the 
nonclinical toxicology studies and clinical data with tislelizumab  and pamiparib , as well as the 
nonclinical/clin ical data from other PD -L1/PD -1/PARP inhibitors, were taken into account. 
Specifically, patients at risk for study -emergent active autoimmune diseases or history of 
autoimmune diseases that may relapse, and patients who have received a live viral vaccine 
within 28 days before study entry  are excluded from the study.  
10.2.2  Safety Monitoring Plan  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and non -serious 
adverse events, defined and graded according to NCI -CTCAE v4.03. Patients wil l be assessed 
for safety (including laboratory values) according to the schedule in Table 3 and Table 5. 
Clinical laboratory results must be reviewed prior to the start of each cycle.  
In this study, all enrolled patients will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests 
before and at re gular intervals during their participation in this study. Safety evaluations will 
consist of medical interviews, recording of AEs, physical examinations, laboratory 
measurements ( eg, hematology, chemistry) and other assessments. In addition, patients will be 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 117 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  closely monitored for the development of any signs or symptoms of autoimmune conditions 
and infection.  
Serum samples will be drawn from patients for the determination of ADAs to tislelizumab . 
Administration of tislelizumab  will be performed in a setting  where emergency medical 
equipment and staff who are trained to respond to medical emergencies are available.  
All AEs will be recorded during the trial (AEs from the time of the first dose and SAEs from 
the time of signing of i nformed consent) and for up to 30 days after last dose of pamiparib and 
up to 90 days after tislelizumab study treatment  or initiation of new anticancer therapy, 
whichever occurs first . At the end of treatment, ongoing AEs considered related to study 
treatment will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline or ≤ Grade 1, the event is 
assessed by the Investigator as stable, the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws 
consent.  
All irAE s will be recorded up to 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab , regardless of 
initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy . All drug -related SAEs will be recorded by the 
Investigator after treatment discontinuation until patient death or loss to follow -up, whichever 
occurs first.  
Investigators are instructed to report a ll events ( including AEs and pregnancy -related AEs). 
The potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid or 
minimize such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections.  
10.3 Adverse Events  
10.3.1  Definition and Reporting of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a 
study drug, whether considered related to study drug or not.  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Worsening of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an increase in 
severity, frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a signif icantly worse 
outcome   
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y drug administration even though it 
may have been presen t before the start of the study   
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequ elae of a suspected interaction   
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug 
or a conc urrent medication (overdose per se should n ot be reported as an AE or SAE)   
BeiGene Ltd. Page 118 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory results and diagnostics reports) relativ e 
to the AE or SAE. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE 
or SAE in the eCRF. However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for 
certain cases are requested by the sponsor. In this instance, all patient  identifiers will be blinded 
on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to the sponsor.  
For the purposes of this study, all events of MDS and AML that occur while on study should 
be reported as an SAE because these events are clinically signi ficant (see Section  0). 
10.3.1.1  Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study. AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI)  CTCAE v4.03 . 
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
 Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnosti c observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
 Grade 2: moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
 Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately l ife-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL  
 Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5: death related to AE  
NOTE: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity (for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2], severe 
[Grade 3], or life -threatening [Grade 4]), whereas seriousness is classified by the criteria based 
on the regulatory def initions.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations from the sponsor  to applicable regulatory authorities as described in  Section  10.4. 
10.3.1.2  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the 
occurrence of each AE or SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study drug 
will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Prod uct 
Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 119 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very importan t that 
the investigator always makes assessment of causality for every SAE prior to transmission of 
the SAE report/eCRF to the sponsor since the causality assessment is one of the criteria used 
when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The invest igator may change his/her 
opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE report/eCRF 
accordingly.  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related” or 
“not related”.  An AE is considered related  if there is “a  reasonable possibility” that the AE 
may have been caused by the study drug (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest 
possible causation).  A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment, 
including:  
 Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study 
procedure  
 Whether an alternative etiology has been identified  
 Mechanism of action of the study drug  
 Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered ‘related’ to study drug if any of the following are met:  
 There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing 
factors can be ruled out.  
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely.  
 There is s ome evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the AE occurred within a 
reasonable time after admi nistration of the study drug). However, the influence of other 
factors may have contributed to the AE (eg, the patient ’s clinical condition or other 
conco mitant AEs).  
10.3.1.3  Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
patient  and provide further information to the sponsor on the patient ’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previou s visit/contact and designated as ongoing will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered 
chronic, the AE or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient  is lost to fo llow-up, the patient  
withdraws consent , or starts a new anticancer therapy . Once resolved, the appropriate AE or 
SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated. The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  AE or SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perfo rm or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. If a patient  dies 
during participation in the study or du ring a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be 
provided with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE report/eCRF, 
with all changes signed and dated b y the investigator. The updated SAE report/eCRF should 
be resent to the sponsor within the time frames outlined in  Section  10.8.1 . 
10.3.1.4  Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, CBC, coagulation, or urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (eg, ECGs, X -rays, or vital signs) that are judged by the investigator as 
clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or S AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (as 
defined in Section  10.3.1 ) or an SAE (as defined in  Section  10.4). Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are detected during the study 
or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study will be 
reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other 
abnormal assessments that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the 
investigator as more severe than expecte d for the patient ’s condition, or that are present or 
detected at the start of the study and  do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs. They 
should be reported as AEs or SAEs if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, need active 
intervention, nee d dose interruption or discontinuation or are clinically significant in the 
opinion of the investigator.  
Abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) that are Grade 3 or 
higher need to be reported to the sponsor  with 24 hours of occurrence. Repeat LFT 
testing should be performed according to the schedule in Appendix  10. 
The investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
other abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant . 
10.4 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 Results in dea th  
 Is life -threatening  
NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in 
which the patient  was at risk of death at the time of the AE. It does not refer to an AE, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 121 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential   Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizat ion  
NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient  was admitted (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the AE is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
 Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life func tions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may 
interfere or prevent everyd ay life functions, but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is considered a significant medical AE by the investigator based on medical judgement 
(eg, may jeopardize the patient  or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above)   
The following are NOT  considered SAEs:  
 Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline  
 Hospitalization for soci al/convenience considerations  
 Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience  
10.5 Timing, Frequency, and Method of Capturing Adverse Events 
and Serious Adverse Events  
10.5.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
During the pre -screening stage, no adverse events will be reported. Only serious adverse events 
will be reported during the pre -screening stage if the serious adverse event is related to the 
pre-screening procedure.  
After informed consent has been s igned but prior to the administration of the study drug, only 
SAEs should be reported.  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 122 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will 
be reported until 30 days after the last study treatment or initiation o f new anticancer therapy. 
After this period, the investigator should report any SAEs that are believed to be related to 
prior study drug treatment.  Immune -related adverse events should be reported if they occur 
within 90 days after the last dose of tisleli zumab , regardless of initiation of subsequent 
anticancer therapy . 
10.5.2  Eliciting Adverse Events  
The investigator or designee will ask about AEs by asking the following standard questions:  
 How are you feeling?  
 Have you had any medical problems since your last v isit?  
 Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
10.6 Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
10.6.1  Disease Progression  
Disease progression (including fatal disease progression), which is expected in this study 
population and measured as an efficacy endpoint, should not be reported as an AE term.  
Instead, the symptoms, signs or clinical sequelae that result from disease progression should 
be reported as the AE term(s).   
For instance, a patient presents with pleura l effusion resulting from disease progression of 
metastasis to lungs. The event term should be reported as “pleural effusion” instead of disease 
progression. If a patient experienced a fatal multi -organ failure due to disease progression, the 
term “multi -organ failure” should be reported as the SAE with death as outcome instead of 
reporting “fatal disease progression” or “death due to disease progression” . 
10.6.2  Death  
Death is an outcome and not usually considered an event. If the only information available is 
death and the cause of death is unknown, then the death is reported as an event, eg , “death”, 
“death of unknow cause”, or “death unexplained”.  
10.7 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is a serious adverse reaction that is 
both unexpected (ie, not present in the product’s Reference Safety Information [RSI]) and 
meets the definition of a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR), the spec ificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with those noted in the Investigator’s Brochure.

10.8.1  Timeframes for Submitting Serious Adverse Events  
As soon as the investigator determines that an AE meets the protoco l definition of an SAE, the 
event must be reported promptly to the sponsor or designee as described in Table 7.

Abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) that are Grade 3 or higher 
need to be reported to the sponsor with 24 hours of occurrence. Repeat LFT testing should be 
performed according to the schedule in Appendix  10. 
10.8.2  Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a patient , he/she will report 
the informa tion to the sponsor within 24  hours as outlined in  Section 10.8.1 . The SAE Report  
will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the SAE, and 
forwarded to the sponsor or designee within the designated time frames.  
If the i nvestigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the sponsor or designee of the SAE and 
completing the form. The form will be updated when additional information is received . 
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report 
as described in Section 10.3.1.2 . 
The sponsor wi ll provide contact information for SAE receipt.  
10.8.3  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the 
procedures detailed in Section 10.8.2 . The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as 
appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety 
of a product un der clinical investigation.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory 
authorities and the Institutional Review Boar d (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 124 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  This protocol is being conducted under an Investigational New Drug (IND) with the US FDA.  
All IND safety reports submitted to the FDA will also be sent to all investigators conducting 
studies under this IND.  
Whe n a study center receives an initial or follow -up safety report or other safety information 
(eg, revised Investigator’s Brochure) from the sponsor, the investigator or designated 
responsible person is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
10.9 Pregnan cy Reporting  
If a female patient  or the partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant while receiving 
investigational therapy or within 6 months  after the completion of the last dose of study drug, 
a pregnancy report form should be completed and expeditiously  submitted to the sponsor to 
facilitate outcome follow -up. Information on the status of the mother and child will be 
forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following 
the estimated delivery date. Any premature ter mination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
An abortion, whether accidental , therapeutic, or spontaneous should be always reported as an 
SAE.  Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a patient  exposed to the 
study drug should be recorded and reported as an SAE.  
10.10  Post-study Adverse Event  
A post -study AE or  SAE is defined as any AE that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting 
period, defined in Section 10.5.1 . 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former patient s. However, if 
the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient  has been 
discharged from the study, and he/she considers the SAE related to the study drug, the 
investigator will notify the sponsor.  
10.11  Assessing and Recording Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Since treatment with anti -PD-1 therapy can cause autoimmune disorders, AEs considered by 
the investigator to be immune -related (see Section  10.13.4 ) should be classified as irAEs and 
identified as such in the eCRF AE page until up to 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab , 
regardless of initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy . 
Investigators should consult the guidance on diagnostic evaluation and management of irAEs, 
which are commonly seen with immune checkpoint inhibitors, in Appendix  10. 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 125 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  An extensive list of potential irAEs appears in Section  10.13.4 , Table  8.  All conditions similar 
to those listed should be evaluated to determine whether they are irAEs, based on a similar 
diagnostic process to thos e reactions that are presented in more detail in  Appendix  10. 
10.12  Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Ethics Committees and 
Investigators  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs against cumulative study drug experience to 
identify and expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory authorities, 
investigators, IRBs and IECs based on applicable legislation.  
To determine the repo rting requirements for individual SAEs, the sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of the SAEs using the following reference documents:  
 Pamiparib  Investigator’s Brochure  
 Tislelizumab  Investigator’s Brochure  
10.13  Special Precautions  
As a routine precaution, after infusion of tislelizumab  on day 1 of cycle 1 and cycle 2, patients 
must be monitored for at least 1 hour afterwards in an area with resuscitation equipment and 
emergency agents.  From cycle 3 onward, a minimum of a 30 -minute monitoring period is 
required in an area with resuscitation equipment and emergency agents.  
The management for tumor lysis syndrome, infusion -related reactions, severe hypersensitivity 
reactions, irAEs , and renal function abnormalities according to the NC I-CTCAE criteria are 
outlined in Sections 10.13.1 , 10.13.2 , 10.13.3 , 10.13.4 , and 10.13.5  respectively.  
10.13.1  Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
A potential risk of tumor lysis sy ndrome (TLS) exists since tislelizumab  can induce 
cytotoxicity. As recommended by Howard et al. [89], once TLS occurs, patients should be 
treated a s per the local guidelines and the management algorithm ( Figure 3).

The symptoms of infusion -related reactions include fever, chills/rigor, nausea, pruritus, 
angioedema, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, 
dizziness or hypertension.  Severe reactions may include acute respiratory distre ss syndrome, 
myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock.  Patients should be 
closely monitored for such reactions. Immediate access to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or 
equivalent environment and appropriate medical therapy (inclu ding epinephrine, 
corticosteroids, IV antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen) must be available to treat 
infusion -related reactions.   
Treatment modification for symptoms of infusion -related reactions due to study drug(s) is 
provided in Table  8.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Once the tislelizumab  infusion rate has been decreased by 50% or suspended due to an 
infus ion-related reaction, it must remain decreased for all subsequent infusions with 
premedication.  If the patient has a secon d infusion -related reaction (≥ G rade 2) on the slower 
infusion r ate, infusion should be discontinued and the patient should be withdr awn from 
tislelizumab  treatment.  
CTCAE G rade  1 or 2 infusion reaction:  Proper medical management should be instituted, 
as indicated per type of the reaction.  This includes but is not limited to an anti -histamine ( eg, 
diphenhydramine or equivalent), anti -pyretic ( eg, paracetamol or equivalent), and if considered 
indicated or al or IV glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators , and oxygen.  In the next 
cycle, patients should receive oral premedication with an antihistamine ( eg, diphenhydramine 
or equivalent) and an antipyretic ( eg, paracetamol or equivalent), and they should  be closely 
monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction.  
CTCAE G rade  3 or 4 infusion reaction:  Proper medical management should be instituted 
immediately, as indicated per type and severity of the reaction.  This includes but is not limited 
to oral or IV antihistamine, anti -pyretic, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, and 
oxygen.  
10.13.3  Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu -Like Symptoms  
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient must be treated according to the best ava ilable 
medical practice as described in the complete guideline for emergency treatment of 
anaphylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council (UK) . 
[90, 91]  Patients should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the investigator 
immediately.  
In the event  of a systemic anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction (typically manifested within 
minutes following administration of the drug/antigen, and characterized by: respiratory 
distress; laryngeal edema; and/or intense bronchospasm; and often followed by vascular 
collapse or shock without antecedent respiratory difficulty; cutaneous manifestations such as 
pruritus and urticaria with/without edema; and gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, 
vomiting, crampy abdominal pain, and diarrhea), the infusion must be  immediately stopped 
and the patient discontinued from the study.  
The patients will be administered epinephrine injection and dexamethasone infusion if 
hypersensitivity reaction is observed and then the patient should be placed on monitor 
immediately and I CU should be alerted for possible transfer if needed.  
For prophylaxis of flu -like symptoms, a dose of 25  mg indomethacin or a comparable dose of 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( ie, 600 mg ibuprofen, 500  mg naproxen sodium) may 
be administered 2  h bef ore and 8  h after the start of each dose of study drugs(s) infusion.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Alternative treatments for fever ( ie, paracetamol) may be given to patients at the discretion of 
the investigator.  
10.13.4  Immune -Related Adverse Events (irAE)  
Immune -related AEs are of special interest in this study.  If the events listed below or similar 
events occur, the investigator should exclude alternative explanations ( eg, combination drugs, 
infectious disease, metabolic, toxin, disease progression or other neoplastic causes) with 
appropr iate diagnostic tests, which may include but is not limited to serologic, immunologic, 
and histologic (biopsy) data.  If alterna tive causes have been ruled out,  the AE required the use 
of systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, or endocrine therapy an d is consistent with 
an immune mediated mechanism of action, the irAE indicator in the eCRF AE page should be 
checked.  
A list of potential irAEs is shown below in Table  9.  All conditions similar to those listed 
should be evaluated in patients receiving tislelizumab  to determine whether they are immune -
related.   
Recommendation for diagnostic evaluation and management of irAEs is based on a recent 
ESMO guideline [92] and common immune -related toxicities are d etailed in Appendix  10.  For 
any adverse events not included in Appendix  10, please refer to the recent ESMO guideline 
[92] for further guidance on diagnostic evaluation and management of immune -related 
toxicities.

10.13.5  Renal Function Abnormalities  
Patients with moderate renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min 
and < 60 mL/min by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) may be 
enrolled into the study.  The following algorithm is proposed for the use of steroid treatment 
in the management of irAEs:  
 If the serum creatinine is normal at baseline, please see Section  10.13.4  and refer to 
Appendix  10 for diagnosis and management of patients with abnormal renal 
laboratory values.  
 If the serum creatinine is Grade 1 at baseline and increase in serum creatinine meets 
criteria for  serum creatinine increase ≥ Grade 2 af ter starting treatment with 
tislelizumab , refer to Appendix  10 for diagnosis and management of patients with 
abnormal renal laboratory values.  Check the estimated GFR using Appendix  18 and 
the eGFR calculator link.  In the setting of a Grade 2 serum creatinine increase only, 
study treatment can continue unless the serum creatinine increases by at least 50% 
from the baseline value OR the eGFR falls bel ow 20 mL/min.  
 If the serum creatinine is Grade 2 at baseline and increase in serum creatinine meets 
criteria for serum creatinine increase ≥ Grade 3 after starting treatment with 
tislelizumab , refer to Appendix  10 for diagnosis and management of patients with 
abnormal renal laboratory values.  In the setting of a Grade 3 serum creatinine 
increase only, study treatment will be held until serum creatinine improves to baseline 
and treatment may resume only after discussion with the sponsor medical monitor.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  11.0 DATA ANALYSIS AND STA TISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Sample Size Con siderations  
In Part  A, the number of DLs examined and the emerging tislelizumab  and pamiparib  toxicities 
will determine the sample size.  Five DLs are planned, and it is anticipated that up to  50 patient s 
will be required to establish the RP2D of the combin ation .  
Part B will include expansion arms  of specific tumor types . Up to  approximately  200 patients  
may be enrolled.  The purpose of these expansion arms is to explore signals of clinical efficacy 
as well as to confirm the safety and tolerability of the combination in each selected tumor type. 
Anti-tumor activity will be evaluated in Part B.  A decision can be made to stop an arm early 
due to suboptimal clinical anti -tumor activity.  All Arms will enroll approximately 20 patients.  
The sample size (n  = 20) is determined such that  the probability of observing at least one 
responder is approximately 88% in an expansion arm (n  = 20) when the underlying ORR is as 
low as 10%. Each arm in Part B: 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5,  6, 7, 8, and 9 will be analyzed independently.   
All Arms will enroll approximately 20 patients  with an option to increase each cohort to 40 
patients to confirm outcomes observed in the first 20 patients . 
Twenty additional patients may be enrolled in any disease cohort to evaluate further the anti -
tumor  activity if evidence of activity is observed  in the first 20 patients . Since a  precise estimate 
of objective response rate is difficult to predict due to  the heterogeneity of pa tients enrolled 
within each arm,  a Bayesian predict ive probability, which evaluates  the statistical strength of 
the pamiparib  plus tislelizumab  combination regimen vs the standard chemotherapy , will be 
used to provide a guidance to decide whether to enroll additional 20 patients. For example, for 
an arm with historical response rate 10%, within the initial 20 patients, at least 2 responders 
should be observed to have a predictive probability of >  10% superiority over the 10% 
historical rate in a total of 50 patients; however, for an arm with higher response rate expected 
(eg, > 30% OR R in arm 1a), at least 6 responders  are required to have a >  10% predictive 
probability in order to expand the arm beyond the initial 20 patients.  
11.2 General Considerations for Data Analysis  
Data will be listed and summarized using SAS® Version 9. 3 or hi gher (SAS Institute, Inc., 
Cary, North Carolina) according to sponsor agreed reporting standards, where applicable.  
Complete details will be documented in the reporting and analysis plan.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  11.2.2  Data Analysis  
This study is a dose escalation and  schedule expansion study. Safety, PK and 
pharmacodynamic , and efficacy  data will be evaluated on an ongoing basis.   
11.2.3  Patient  Disposition  
The number of patient s enrolled, treated, discontinued from study drug and those with major 
protocol deviations will be  counted. The primary reason for study drug discontinued will be 
summarized according to the categories in the eCRF. The end of study status (alive, dead, 
withdrew consent or lost to follow -up) at the data cutoff date will be summarized using the 
data from  the eCRF.  
Major protocol deviations will be summarized and listed by each category (major or minor) . 
11.2.4  Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized in the safety analysis set 
using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables include age, weight, vital signs and time since 
initial and metastatic cancer diagnosis; categorical variables i nclude, gender, ECOG, race, 
smoking status, TNM staging, metastatic site, and site of primary tumor.  
11.2.5  Prior and Concomitant Medication  
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11 -digit code using the WHO Drug Dictionary 
drug codes. Concomitant medication s will be further coded to the appropriate Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic classification. Prior and concomitant 
medications will be summarized and listed by drug and drug class in the Clinical Study Report 
(CSR) for this protocol. Prior medications will be defined as medications that stopped before 
the first dose of study drug. Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that (1) 
started before the first dose of study drug and were continuing at the time of the first dose of 
study drug, or (2) started on or after the date of the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after 
the patient ’s last dose. A listing of prior and concomitant medications will be included in the 
CSR of this protocol.  
11.3 Efficacy Analyses  
Respon se based on investigators’ judgment will be collected at screening and while on study 
approximately every 9 ± 1 weeks  in the first 12  months and approximately 12  ± 1 weeks

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  thereafter in the simple form of four categories:  PD, SD, CR, a nd PR (according to 
RECIST  v1.1). 
For patient s with ovarian, fallopian  tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, investigators may also 
incorporate GCIG CA -125 response criteria  [93], with RECIST Version 1.1 response criteria 
in assessing tumor response (refer to Appendix  4).  
For patient s with prostate cancer, PCWG 3 criteria  [94] will also be used to evaluate PSA and 
modified RECIST responses (refer to Appendix  6). 
Anti-tumor activity of th e combination therapy will be evaluated separately in each part in the 
safety analysis set . In Part B, efficacy variables (ie , ORR, DCR, CBR, PFS, DOR and OS) will 
be summarized by expansion arm using RECIST v1.1 when applicable. ORR, along with its 
95% co nfidence interval using exact method will be summarized. PFS will be summarized 
using Kaplan -Meier method. Kaplan -Meier curves will be shown by expansion arm. A 
waterfall plot of maximum tumor shrinkage  from baseline will also be displayed.  
DCR, CBR, DOR a nd OS will be summarized using the methods as described above in the 
SAF. Efficacy endpoints will also be summarized in the efficacy evaluable set.  
To limit the number of patient s who might be exposed to a less efficacious treatment, 
continuous monitoring of efficacy and safety will be implemented whenever possible during 
the trial. ORR in each arm will be calculated and compared to a historical rate. The enrollment 
of an expansion arm will be stopped early in case of low ORR such that any improvement over 
historical rate of single agent is unlikely. Due to the exploratory nature of the efficacy analysis, 
any early futility boundaries/criteria are advisory; and are to be used to aid the data 
interpretation only. Any decision made towards a  particular arm dur ing the P art B enrollment 
will be based on the totality of the data.  
11.4 Safety Analyses  
All patient s who are exposed to (or started receiving) tislelizumab  and/or pamiparib  will be 
evaluated for safety.  Safety data will be summarized by dose level.  
11.4.1  Dose Limited Toxicity  
For Part A, the number and proportion of patient s experiencing DLTs will be reported by dose 
level, based on DLT observations during the first cycle.  The DLT Analysis Set will be used 
for this analysis.  There is no DLT analysis in Part B.  
11.4.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The MTD is defined as the dose that produces an “acceptable” level of toxicity or that, if 
exceeded, would put patient s at “unacceptable” risk for toxicity.  The MTD for this study is 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 135 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  defined as the highest dose studied at which more t han 2 in 3 to 6 patient s has experienced a 
DLT in Cycle  1. If a MTD is identified, a dose level lower than MTD will be selected by SMC.  
11.4.3  Adverse Event s 
In this protocol, a TEAE is defined as any AE or SAE with either an onset date or a date of 
worsening in severity from baseline ( ie, pretreatment) occurring after first dose of study drug 
and up to either 30  days following discontinuation from study drugs or start of new anticancer 
therapy, whichever occurs first. The TEAE classification also applies to irAEs  that are recorded 
up to 90 days after discontinuation from tislelizumab , regardless of initiation of subsequent 
anticancer therapy . Only those AEs that were treatment -emergent will be included in summary 
tables. All AEs, treatment -emergent or otherwise, will be presented in patient data listings.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of patients with TEAEs  
by system organ class (SOC) and Preferred Term. A patient will be counted only once by the 
highest severity grade per NCI -CTCAE v4.03 [86] within a n SOC and Preferred Term, even 
if the patient experienced more than 1  TEAE within a specific SOC and Preferred Term. The 
number (percentage) of patients with TEAEs will also be summarized by relationship to the 
study drug.  
Treatment -related AEs include tho se events considered by the Investigator to be related to 
study treatment or with missing assessment of the causal relationship. The SAEs, deaths, 
TEAEs with ≥ Grade 3 severity, irAE s, treatment -related TEAEs, and TEAEs that led to 
treatment discontinuatio n, dose interruption, dose reduction, or dose delay will be summarized.  
11.4.4  Laboratory Assessments  
Clinical laboratory ( eg, hematology, serum chemistry) values will be evaluated for each 
laboratory parameter as appropriate. Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged as high or 
low relative to the normal range, where applicable . Descriptive summary statistics ( eg, n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for 
categorical variables) for laboratory parameters and their c hanges from baseline will be 
calculated. Laboratory values will be summarized by visit and by worst post -baseline visit.  
Laboratory parameters that are graded in CTCAE v.4.03 will be summarized by CTCAE grade. 
In the summary of laboratory parameters by CTC AE grade, parameters with CTCAE grading 
in both high and low directions (eg , calcium, glucose, magnesium, potassium, sodium) will be 
summarized separately.  
11.4.5  Electrocardiogram  
All ECG parameters including the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) will be listed for 
each patient  and summarized by dose level and assessment time.  If sufficient data are available,

changes may be explored by graphs. QTc will be calculated using Fridericia’s formulae.  
11.4.6  Vital Signs  
Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory, temperature and weight will be summarized and listed.  The 
change from baseline will also be display ed. 
11.4.7  Extent of Exposure  
Extent of exposure to each study drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of cycles 
received (number and percentage of patient s), duration of exposure (days), cumulative total 
dose received per patient  (mg), dose intensity , and relative dose intensity.  
The number (percentage) of patient s requiring dose reduction, interruption, dose delay, and 
drug discontinuation due to AEs will be summarized for each study drug. Frequency of the 
above dose adjustments and discontinuation w ill be summarized by category.  
11.4.8  Physical Examination  
Physical examination results will be listed and summarized.  
11.4.9  Ophthalmologic Examination  
Ophthalmologic examination results will be listed and summarized.  
11.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
In Part  A of the study , PK parameters such as C max, C trough  and T max for pamiparib  may be 
derived  for each cycle at which pharmacokinetics are to be measured; C trough may be derived 
for tislelizumab , where applicable  (as specified in Table 4). In Part B of the study , PK 
parameters such as C trough may be derived for  both pamiparib  and tislelizumab  for each cycle 
at which pharmacokinetics are to be measured , where applicable  (as specified in Table 6). 
Additional PK analyses will be conducted as appropriate  in all patient s for whom valid 
tislelizumab  and pamiparib  PK parameters can be estimated.  Nominal sampling times will be 
used for interim PK parameter calculations, while actual sampling times will be used in the

Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki or the laws and regulations of the 
country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the  greater protection to the 
individual.  The study will comply with the requirements of the ICH E2A guideline (Clinical 
Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting).  
This protocol, the ICFs, any information to be given to the p atient, and relevant supporting 
information must be submitted to the IRB/IEC by the principal investigator and reviewed and 
approved by the IRB/IEC before the study is initiated.  In addition, any patient recruitment 
materials must be approved by the IRB/I EC.  
The principal investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of the 
study to the IRB/IEC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, 
policies, and procedures established by the IRB/IEC.  Investigators ar e also responsible for 
promptly informing the IRB/IEC of any protocol amendments.  In addition to the requirements 
for reporting all AEs to the sponsor, investigators must comply with requirements for reporting 
SAEs to the local health authority and IRB/IE C.  Investigators may receive written IND safety 
reports or other safety -related communications from the sponsor.  Investigators are responsible 
for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with health authority 
requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/IEC and archived in the 
site’s study file.  
12.3 Informed Consent  
The sponsor’s sample Informed consent(s) (ICF) will be provided to each site.  If applicable, 
it will be provided in a certified translation o f the local language.  The final IRB/IEC -approved 
ICFs must be provided to the sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to 
local requirements.  
The ICFs must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally authorized 
represent ative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history or clinical records

mutation which confers an increased risk of developing disease) will be verified but the central 
laboratory and these results will be conveyed back to the treating investigator . The treating 
investigator  will then contact the patient . The patient  will not be informed of the result 
specifically but encouraged to contact the Familial Cancer Centre (FCC) for formal genetic 
counseling. The cancer genetics counseling service will facilitate a discussion regarding the 
potential implications  of such genetic results to both participants and their families, allowing 
participants to make an informed choice to either (a) receive the results or (b) to opt not to 
receive any further information.  The FCC will manage the participants with confirmed 
mutations and their families as per established clinical guidelines, or as deemed appropriate by 
the involved staff. If there are any areas which require additional clarification, the principle 
investigator, will approach the central Human Research Ethics C ommittee (HREC) to seek 
further guidance.  
Participants will be asked at the time of informed consent to nominate a next of kin to receive 
information regarding clinically meaningful results  in the instance that the participant is no 
longer contactable, or deceased. Only germline research results that may be significant for 
family members will be returned to the next of kin.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  APPENDIX  4: EVALUATION OF RESPONS E ACCORDING 
TO CA-125 
The text below was obtained from the following reference: Rustin  GJ, Vergote I, Eisenhauer 
E, et al. Definitions for Response and Progression in Ovarian Cancer Clinical Trials 
Incorporating RECIST 1.1 and CA 125 Agreed by the Gynecological Cancer  Intergroup 
(GCIG). Int J Gynecology  Cancer . 2011 ; 21(2): 419 -423. [93] 
Definition of Response:  
A CA -125 response is defined as at least a 50% reduction in CA -125 levels from a pretreatment 
sample. The response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 2 8 days. Subjects can be 
evaluated according to CA -125 only if they have a pretreatment sample that is at least twice 
the upper limit of the reference range and within 2 weeks before starting the treatment.  
To calculate CA -125 responses accurately, the foll owing rules apply:  
- Intervening samples and the 28 -day confirmatory sample must be less than or equal to 
(within an assay variability of 10%) the previous sample.  
- Variations within the reference range of CA -125 levels will not interfere with the 
response de finition.  
- For each subject, the same assay method must be used, and the assay must be tested in a 
quality control scheme.  
- Subjects are not evaluable by CA -125 if they have received mouse antibodies (unless the 
assay used has been shown not to be influenced  by human anti -mouse  antibody4, 5) or if 
there has been medical and/or surgical interference with their peritoneum or pleura during 
the previous 28 days ( eg, paracentesis). If assessing therapy that includes 2 treatment 
modalities for relapse ( eg, surgery and chemotherapy), any CA -125 response results from 
both treatment modalities. CA -125 cannot distinguish between the effects of the 2 
treatments.  
The date when the CA -125 level is first reduced by 50% is the date of the CA -125 response. 
To calculate respon se, an intent -to-treat analysis should be used that includes all subjects with 
an initial CA -125 level of at least twice the upper limit of the reference range as eligible and 
evaluable. In addition, as a separate analysis, those subjects who have a CA -125 response and 
whose CA -125 level falls to within the reference range can be classified as CA -125 complete 
responders. In Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 where CA -125 is stated as normalized or 
normal, this refers to being  within the reference range. Subj ects who have a decrease in CA -125 
to within the reference range , but whose initial CA -125 was less than twice the upper limit of 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 157 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  the reference range , are not considered to have  had a CA -125 response and cannot therefore 
be classified as a CA -125 complete responder.  
Reporting of Response According to Both RECIST v1.1 and CA -125 Criteria  
Responses should be reported separately for both RECIST v1.1 and CA -125 response , as 
shown in the hypothetical example in below table:  
Example  of Reporting  RECIST,  CA-125, and Combined  Response

Total  CA-125 13 26 6 Total  entered  = 45 
1. *RECIST v1.1 includes normalization of CA -125 to achieve CR (Table 4 of this reference).  
2. In the above  example, the REC IST v1.1 response rate is 9 (25.7%) of 35 RECIST  v1.1 evaluable subject s, 
the CA-125 response rate is 13 (33%) of 39 CA125 evaluable subject s, and the co mbined overall  respons e 
rate (either RECIST  or CA-125 response) is 15 (35%) of 43.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  APPENDIX  5: EVIDENCE OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE TO 
DETERMINE TRIAL ENTRY ELIG IBILITY  IN 
PATIENT S WITH PROSTATE CANCER  
Patient s being considered for trial entry should have evidence of disease progression by PSA, 
modified RECIST or bone scan to be eligible.  
PSA:  PSA evidence of disease progression based on the prostate cancer working group 
(PCWG) 3 criteria consist of a minimum PSA level 2.0 ng/ ml that has risen on at least 
2 successive occasions, at least 1 weeks apart. As shown in Figure below, t he reference value 
# 1 is the last value before the rise in PSA was observed. If the confirmator y PSA value (#  3A) 
is greater than the screening value then progression by PSA is met and the patient  is eligible 
for trial enrollment  on the basis of PSA alone. I f the confirmatory PSA ( #3B) value is less 
than the screening PSA (#2) value, then an additional test for rising PSA (#4) will be required 
to document progression before the patient  can be enrolled.  
 
 
Figure 1: Eligibility Based on PSA  
Target lesion/measurable disease:  Patient s are not required to have evidence of disease 
progression by measurable disease if they meet the criteria for disease progression on the basis 
of PSA or bone scan. Evidence of nodal or visceral disease progress ion however is sufficient 
for trial entry independent of PSA readings. Because lymph nodes may be enlarged due to 
benign pathology, only lymph nodes that are ≥ 2  cm should be used for disease evaluation.  
Bone scan : Evidence of disease progression based on bone scan appearance is sufficient for 
trial entry independent of PSA readings. If the appearance of the bone scan is the only 
indicator of progression then there must be ≥ 2 new bone lesions compared with the prior

in nature or secondary to a flare reaction then it is recommended that an alternative imaging 
modality such as MRI or fine -cut CT be used to evaluate these lesions further.

PSA On this study serial PSA measurements will be done every 9 
weeks on day 1 of every 4th cycle. Increases and decreases will 
be tracked in order to assess disease response. The PSA 
readings on its own will not be used to define progression in 
this protocol. PSA response and PSA progression will be 
defined according to the consensus guidelin es of the PCWG 3:  
 PSA partial response is defined as a ≥ 50% decline in PSA 
from Cycle1 Day1 (baseline) PSA value. This PSA decline 
much be confirmed to be sustained by a second PSA value 
obtained 4 or more weeks later.  
 PSA progression date is defined as t he date that a ≥ 25% 
increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the 
nadir is documented, which is confirmed by a second 
consecutive value obtained four or more weeks later. The 
first PSA reading will be obtained at week 12.  
Duration of PSA Respon se: 
Duration of PSA response is calculated from the time the PSA 
value first declines by at least 50% of the Cycle 1 Day 1 
(baseline) value that has been confirmed by a second value 
until the time there is an increase of 25% of PSA nadir, 
provided the abso lute increase is at least 2 ng/mL. The increase 
must be confirmed by a second consecutive measurement that 
is at least 25% above the nadir. If the PSA never shows a 25% 
increase over the nadir value, then the subject will be assessed 
at the last PSA measur ement.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  APPENDIX  8: THE RESPONSE EVALUAT ION CRITERIA IN 
SOLID TUMORS (RECIST ) GUIDELINES  
The text below was obtained from the following reference:  Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, 
Bogaerts J, et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumo rs: revised RECIST guideline 
(Version 1.1). Eur J Cancer  2009;45:  228-247. [96]  
DEFINITIONS  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this trial using the international criteria proposed 
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee (Versio n 1.1).  
Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are 
used in the RECIST criteria.  Note: Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the 
criteria provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to me asurability will not be used 
because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
Measurable Disease  
Tumor lesions:  Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum s ize of:  
 10 mm by CT scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the slice 
thickness and a minimum of 10  mm).  
 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when superficial).  
 20 mm by chest X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aera ted lung).  
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be  ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5  mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter  ≥ 10 to <  15 mm 
with conventional techniques or < 10  mm using spiral CT scan), are considered non-
measurable disease.  Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measura ble by 
reproducible imaging techniques are all non -measurable.  
Bone lesions:  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 164 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential   Bone scan, positron emission tomography ( PET) scan, or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can 
be used to  confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
or MRI can be considered as measurab le lesions if the soft tissue component meets the 
definition of measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as mal ignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above . However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional  therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Trial protocols should detail the conditions 
under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total should 
be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all  
involved organ, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  Pathol ogical nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of  
≥ 15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  
The short axis of the node is the di ameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as 2 dimensions in the  plane in which 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 165 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisi tion may be axial, saggital, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  
For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20  mm× 30 mm has a short axis 
of 20  mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis  ≥ 10 mm 
but <  15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis <  10 mm 
are considered non -pathological and should not be recor ded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, o nly the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression 
in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) inc luding pathological lymph nodes should be identified 
as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required 
and these lesions should be followed as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression” (more details to follow).  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, “multiple 
enlarged pelvic lymph node” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF  MEASURABLE DISEASE  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging based evaluation 
should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed 
cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical examination.  
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and P10  mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules).  For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested.  As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical examination and 
imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken  since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the trial.  
Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying ne w

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
CT, MRI:  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5  mm or less.  When CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body scans).  
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study,  confirmation by 
CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used 
instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy:  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following CR or 
surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a subject 
to be considered in CR. Because tumor markers are disease specific, instructions for their 
measurement should be incorporated  into protocols on a disease specific basis.  Specific 
guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in 
recurrent prostate cancer), have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer 
Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective 
tumor assessment for use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer.  
Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if 
required by protocol (for example,  residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  When effusions are known to be a potential 
adverse effect of treatment (eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors) . 
RESPONSE CRITE RIA 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -
target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10  mm. 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 167 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of ta rget lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest  on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an abs olute increase of at least 5  mm. 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference  the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Lymph nodes:  Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short 
axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the nodes regress t o below 10  mm on study.  This means that when lymph 
nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even if CR criteria 
are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10  mm. Case report 
recorded in a sep arate section where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a short 
axis <  10 mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be 
included in the sum of target lesions.  
Target lesions that become “too small to measure ”: While on study, all lesions (nodal and non -
nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2  mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes 
which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist 
may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being “too small 
to measure”.  When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF.  If it is the  
opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be 
recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will 
be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are 
frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is 
believed to be present and is faintly seen but too  small to measure, a default value of 5  mm 
should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default value is derived from the 5  mm 
CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).  The 
measurement of these lesions is pot entially non -reproducible;  therefore providing this default 
value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error.  To reiterate, 
however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even 
if it is below 5  mm. 
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non -nodal lesions “fragment”, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 168 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between th em may be maintained that would aid 
in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have 
truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion”.  
Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol . 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<  10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintena nce of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non -
target lesions.  
When the subject  also has measurable disease:  In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on  the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the 
overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of t herapy.  A modest 
“increase” in the size of one or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of 
change in non -target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be 
extremely rare.  
When the subject  has only non -measurable disease:  This circumstance arises in some P hase 3 
trials when it is not a criterion of trial entry to have measurable disease.  The same general 
concept apply  here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease 
assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non -measurable disease burden.  
Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition:  if all 
lesions are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subject s for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitud e to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an 
additional 73% increase in “volume” (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large”, 
an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy”.  If “unequivocal progression” is seen, 
the subject sho uld be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While it would be ideal 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 169 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the very nature of that disease 
makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be substantial.  
New Les ions 
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new l esion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some 
“new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -exist ing lesions).  This is particularly 
important when the subject ’s baseline lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver 
lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this 
is the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study  has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered which revea ls metastases.  The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will cl arify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
While FDG -PET (PET scanning with the tracer fluorine -18 [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose [FD G]) 
response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use 
of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible “new” disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified 
according to the following algorithm:  
 Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up: If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as 
a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if 
there is truly progression occurring at that  site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of 
the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis 
of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
Evalu ation of Best Overall Response  
BeiGene Ltd. Page 170 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study drug 
treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  On 
occasion a response may not be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols should 
be clear if post -treatment assessments are to be considered in determination of best overall 
response.  Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced before progression will 
affect best response des ignation.  The subject’s best overall response assignment will depend 
on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into consideration the 
appearance of new lesions.  Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study  and the protoc ol 
requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.  Specifically, in non -randomized 
trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is needed to deem 
either one the “best overall response”.  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject  is known.  Best 
response determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT 
required: Best response in these trials is defined as the best response acro ss all time points (for 
example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last 
assessment has a best overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be best response, it 
must also meet the protocol specified minimum time  from baseline.  If the minimum time is 
not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the subject’s best response depends 
on the subsequent assessments.  For example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PD at 
second and does not meet minim um duration for SD, will have a best response of PD.  The 
same subject lost to follow -up after the first SD assessment would be considered unevaluable.

BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Note:  When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size (<  10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate 
progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means 
that subjects with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.  
In trials where confirmation of respon se is required, repeated ‘NE’ time point assessments may 
complicate best response determination.  The analysis plan for the trial must address how 
missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progression.  For 
example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a subject with time point responses of PR -
NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Subject s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at t hat time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for st opping trial therapy.  
Conditions that define “early progression, early death, and inevaluability” are trial specific and 
should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment 
periodicity).  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the 
residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before assigning a status of CR. 
FDG -PET may b e used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases 
where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use 
of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and 
supported by disease specific medical literature for the indication.  However, it must be 
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -
PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.  
For equivocal findings of progres sion (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes, or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be t he earlier date when progression was suspected.  
CONFIRMATORY MEASUREMENT/DURATION OF RESPONSE  
Confirmation  
In non -randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR 
is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error.  This will also 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 172 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has 
traditionally required confirmation in such trials.  However, in all other circumstances, ie , in 
randomized trials (Phase  2 or 3) or trials where stable disease or progression are the primary 
endpoints, confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the 
interpretation of trial results.  However, elimination of the requirement for response 
confir mation may increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, in particular 
in trials which are not blinded.  
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after trial entry at 
a minimum interval (in general not  less than 6  weeks).  
Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively 
documented (tak ing as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded on study).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable D isease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized  trials, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum 
on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the  reference for calculation of PD).  
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in different studies and diseases.  
If the proportion of subjects achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time is an 
endpoint of importance in a particular trial, the protocol should specify the minimal time 
interval required between two measurements for determination of stable disease.  
Note: The DOR  and stable disease as well as the progression -free survival are influenced by 
the frequency of foll ow-up after baseline evaluation.  It is not in the scope of this guideline to 
define a standard follow -up frequency.  The frequency should take into account many 
parameters including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity, and standard practice.  
How ever, these limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint should be taken into 
account if comparisons between studies are to be made.

as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In symptomatic subject s, 
infectious etiologies should be ruled out, and if symptoms are persistent and/or sever, 
endoscopic evalu ation should be considered.  
o In subject s with severe enterocolitis, BGB -A317 will be permanently 
discontinued and treatment with systemic corticosteroids should be initiated 
at a dose of 1 to 2  mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent.  When symptoms 
improve to  Grade  1 or less, corticosteroid taper should be started and 
continued over at least 1  month.  
o In subject s with moderate enterocolitis, BGB -A317 should be withheld and 
antidiarrheal treatment should be started. If symptoms are persistent for more 
than one w eek, systemic corticosteroids should be initiated (eg, 
0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent).  When symptoms improve to 
Grade  1 or less, corticosteroid taper should be started and continued over at 
least 1  month.  Regarding guidelines fo r continuing tre atment with 
BGB -A317  see Protocol Section 5.1.4 . 
 All subject s who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of 
clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should 
be substitu ted via IV infusion.  
 Nausea/vomiting:  Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of 
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice.  Subject s 
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake.  
 Anemia:  Transfusions and/or erythropoietin may be utilized as clinically indicated for 
the treatment of anemia, but should be clearly noted as concurrent medications.  
 Neutropenia:  Prophy lactic use of colony -stimulating factors including granulocyte 
colony -stimulating factor (G-CSF), pegylated G -CSF or Granulocyte Macrophage 
Colony -Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is not allowed in this study.  Therapeutic use of 
G-CSF is allowed in subject s wit h Grade  3-4 febrile neutropenia.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential   Thrombocytopenia:  Transfusion of platelets may be used if clinically indicated. 
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP) should be ruled out before initiation of 
platelet transfusion.  
 Anti-infective : Subject s with a docume nted infectious complication should receive oral 
or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by the treating  
investigator for a given infectious condition, according to standard institutional 
practice.  
 Immune -related AEs: Subject s who develop a G rade 2 or higher irAE s (eg, colitis, skin 
rash, hepatitis, uveitis, hypo - or hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, or any other), should 
be discussed immediately with the sponsor . Depending on the type and severity of an 
irAE, oral or intr avenous treatment with a corticosteroid should be considered, in 
addition to appropriate symptomatic treatment of a given condition.  
 Infusion reaction:  Infusion reactions may consist of fever, chills/rigor, nausea, pruritus, 
angioedema, hypotension, headac he, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, 
dizziness or hypertension. Severe reactions may include acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock.  
Subject s should be closely monitored for an infusion reaction during and immediately 
following drug infusion.  
o In the event of a Grade  1 or 2 infusion reaction, reduce the infusion rate by 
50% for the entire remaining duration of that infusion.  Proper medical 
management should be instituted, a s indicated per type of the reaction.  This 
includes but is not limited to an anti -histamine  (eg, diphenhydramine or 
equivalent), anti -pyretic (eg, paracetamol or equivalent), and if considered 
indicated oral or IV glucocorticoids, epinephrine, brochodilato rs, and 
oxygen.  
o In the event of a Grade  3 or 4 infusion reaction, immediately stop the 
infusion.  Proper medical management should be instituted immediately, as 
indicated per type and severity of the reaction.  This includes but is not 
limited to oral or IV antihistamine , anti -pyretic, glucocorticoids, 
epinephrine, bro nchodilators, and oxygen.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  APPENDIX  10: IMMUNE -RELATED ADVERSE EVENT S 
MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE FOR INVESTIGATORS  
The recommendations below for the diagnosis and management of any irAE  are intended as a 
guidance.  This document should be used in conjunction with expert clinical judgement (by 
specialist physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer using immunological agents), and 
individual institutional guidelines or policies.  
Criteria used to diagnose irAEs include blood tests, diagnostic imaging, histopathology, and 
microbiology assessments to exclude alternative causes such as infection, disease progression, 
and adverse effects of concomitant drugs.  In addition to the results of thes e tests, the following 
factors should be considered when making an irAE diagnosis:  
 What was the temporal relationship between initiation of BGB -A317 and the adverse 
event?  
 How did the patient respond to withdrawal of BGB -A317?  
 Did the event recur when BGB -A317 was reintroduced?  
 Was there a clinical response to corticosteroids?  
 Is the event an autoimmune endocrinopathy?  
 Is disease progression or an alternative diagnosis a more likely explanation?  
When alternative explanations to autoimmune toxicity have bee n excluded, the irAE field, 
associated with the AE in the eCRF should be checked.  
Recommended Diagnostic Tests in the Management of Possible Immune -related 
Adverse Events  
Immune -related 
Toxicity  Diagnostic Evaluation Guideline  
Thyroid Disorders  Scheduled and repeat thyroid function tests (TSH and T4).  
Hypophysitis  Check visual fields and consider pituitary endocrine axis blood profile.  
Perform pituitary and whole brain MRI in patients with headache, 
visual disturbance, unexplained fatigue, asthenia, weight loss and 
unexplained constitutional symptoms.  
Consider consultation with an endocrinologist if an abnormality is 
detected.  
Pneumonitis  All patients presenting with new or worsened pulmonary symptoms or 
signs, such as an upper respiratory infection, new cough, shortness of 
breath or hypoxia should be assessed by high -resolution CT.  Consider 
pulmonary function test including DLCO .

Radiographic appearance is often nonspecific.  Depending on the 
location of the abnormality, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage 
or lung biopsy may be considered.  Consult with a respiratory 
medicine physician for cases of uncertain cause.  
Neurological Toxicity  Perform a comprehensive neurological examination and brain MRI for 
all CNS symptoms; review alcoho l history and other medications.  
Conduct a diabetic screen, and assess blood B12/folate, HIV status, 
TFTs, and consider autoimmune serology.  Consider the need for 
brain/spine MRI/MRA and nerve conduction study for peripheral 
neuropathy.  Consult with a n eurologist if there are abnormal findings.  
Colitis  Review dietary intake and exclude steatorrhea.  Consider 
comprehensive testing, including the following: FBC, UEC, LFTs, 
CRP, TFTs, stool microscopy and culture, viral PCR, Clostridium 
difficile  toxin, cr yptosporidia (drug -resistant organism).  
In case of abdominal discomfort, consider imaging, eg, X-ray, CT 
scan.  If a patient experiences bleeding, pain or distension, consider 
colonoscopy with biopsy and surgical intervention, as appropriate.  
Eye Disord ers If patients experience new onset, acute or worsening eye 
inflammation, blurred vision or other visual disturbance, refer the 
patient urgently to an ophthalmologist for evaluation and management .  
Hepatitis  Check ALT/AST/total bilirubin, INR/albumin; t he frequency will 
depend on severity of the AE ( eg, daily if Grade 3 -4; every 2 -3 days if 
Grade 2, until recovering).  Review medications ( eg, statins, 
antibiotics) and alcohol and drug history.  Perform liver screen 
including Hepatitis A/B/C serology, Hep atitis E PCR and assess anti -
ANA/SMA/LKM/SLA/LP/LCI, iron studies.  Consider imaging, eg, 
ultrasound scan for metastases or thromboembolism.  Consult with a 
hepatologist . A liver biopsy is strongly encouraged  for patient with 
Grade 3 or higher events .  
Renal toxicity  Review hydration status, and medication history.  Test and culture 
urine.  Consider renal ultrasound scan, protein assessment 
(dipstick/24 -hour urine collection), or phase -contrast microscopy.  
Refer to nephrology for further management assi stance.  
Dermatology  Consider other causes by conducting a physical examination, consider 
dermatology referral for skin biopsy . 
Rheumatology  Conduct musculoskeletal history and perform complete rheumatology 
examination. Consider joint X -ray and other ima ging as required to 
exclude metastatic disease. Perform autoimmune serology and refer to 
rheumatology for further management assistance.

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  Treatment of Immune -related Adverse Events  
 Immune -related AEs can escalate quickly; study treatment interruption, close 
monitoring, timely diagnostic work -up and treatment intervention, as appropriate, 
with patients is required  
 Immune -related AEs should improve promptly after introduction of 
immunosuppressive therapy.  If this does not occur, review the diagnosis, seek further 
specialist advi ce and contact the study medical monitor  
 For some G rade 3 toxicities that resolve quickly, rechallenge with study drug may be 
considered if there is evidence of a clinical response to study treatment, after 
consultation with the study medical monitor  
 Stero id dosages in the table below are for oral or intravenous (methyl)prednisolone.  
Equivalent dosages of other corticosteroids can be substituted.  For steroid -refractory 
irAEs, consider use of steroid -sparing agents ( eg, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF])  
 Budeson ide may be substituted for prednisolone if considered standard of care.  
Prednisolone is preferred over prednisone, in the event that hepatic metabolic activity 
may be affected by the adverse event.  
 Consider prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infec tions if the patient is 
receiving long -term immunosuppressive therapy

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  APPENDIX  11: CRITERIA FOR INTER RUPTION AND RE -
INITIATION OF PAMIPARIB  
Criteria for treatment modifications and suggested guidelines for the management of some 
toxicities related to pamiparib  are summarized below. These general guidelines may be 
modified at the discretion of the investigator based on best clinical judgment at that time. 
Any toxicities related to pamiparib  should be managed according to standard medical 
practice.  
Dosing of pami parib  can be withheld for up to 28 days consecutively. If drug is planned to be 
held >  28 days, the medical monitor should be contacted before permanent patient 
discontinuation from the study drug.  
Criteria for treatment modifications and suggested guideli nes for the management of some 
toxicities related to pamiparib  are summarized below. These general guidelines may be 
modified at the discretion of the investigator based on discussions with the medical monitor 
and the best clinical judgment at that time; a ny decisions should be documented. Any 
toxicities related to pamiparib  should be managed according to standard medical practice.  
A maximum of one dose reduction is allowed before the patient  is permanently withdrawn 
from pamiparib  administration. Dose leve ls for pamiparib  are in 20 mg increments and are 
summarized in the Table below.  
Dose Levels for Pamiparib  
Dose Level  Pamiparib  
1 40 mg orally twice daily  or  60 mg orally twice daily  
-1 20 mg orally twice daily  40 mg orally twice daily  
After discussions with the medical monitor, pamiparib  may be dose -reduced for a maximum of 2 dose reductions.  
 
A dose reduction will be made in a 20 mg increment.  For example, pamiparib  40 mg orally 
twice daily  will be dose reduced to 20  mg orally twice daily  for any NCI CTCAE Grade  ≥2 
hematologic toxicity. If pamiparib  20 mg orally twice daily  is not tolerable, then pamiparib  
should be discontinued.  
Specific guidance for the treatment of anemia includes:  
Adverse events of anemia with NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 (Hb ≥ 8 g/d L) should be 
investigated and managed as deemed appropriate by the investigator with or without 
interruption of study drug or change in dose, taking into account previous history of anemia. 
Common treatable causes of anemia (eg, iron, vitamin B12 , or folate deficiencies , and 
BeiGene Ltd. Page 188 of 198 
BGB -A317 /BGB -290_Study_001  
18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  hypothyroidism) should be investigated and appropriately managed. In some cases , 
management of anemia may require blood transfusions.  
If a patient  develops anemia with CTC AE Grade 3 (Hb < 8g/d L) or worse, study treatment 
should be interrupted for up to maximum of 3 weeks.  
Study treatment can be restarted at the same dose if Hb has recovered to  Grade 2 or better, ie, 
≥ 8 g/dL . Any subsequently required anemia -related interr uptions, considered likely to be 
dose related, or coexistent with newly developed neutropenia, and or thrombocytopenia, will  
require pamiparib  dose reductions to 20 mg orally twice daily . 
If a patient  has been treated for anemia with multiple blood transfu sions and becomes blood 
transfusion dependent as judged by investigator, pamiparib  study treatment should be 
discontinued.  
Pamiparib  will be dose -modified as outlined in the Table below.

DEFINITIONS OF “WOME N OF CHILDBEARING 
POTENTIAL”, “NO CHIL DBEARING POTENTIAL”  
 
Contraception Guide lines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to contraception and 
pregnancy testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control. 
These methods include the following:  
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
o Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, or implantable)  
 Intrauter ine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized male partner  
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of exposure associated with the study treatment ). 
NOTE:  Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is in 
line with the patient’s usual and preferred lifestyle. Periodic abstinence ( eg, calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence  for the 
duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
Of note, barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without 
spermicide) is not considered a highly effective method of contracept ion and if used, this 
method must be combined with another acceptable method listed above.  
 
Definitions of “Women of Childbearing Potential,” “Women of No Childbearing Potential”  
As defined in this protocol, “women of childbearing potential” are female pat ients who are 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant.  
Conversely, “women of no childbearing potential” are defined as female patients meeting 
any of the following criteria:  
 Surgically sterile ( ie, through bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorect omy, or 
hysterectomy)  
 Postmenopausal, defined as:  
o ≥ 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months OR  
o < 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12  months AND with 
postmenopausal follicle -stimulating hormone concentration > 30 IU/mL

18 September  2018, Version 4 Confidential  APPENDIX  18: CHRONIC KIDNEY DIS EASE 
EPIDEMIOLOGY COLLABO RATION EQUA TION  
In adults, the most widely -used equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
from serum creatinine are the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology C ollaboration (CKD -
EPI) equation  and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equ ation. The 
National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) calculators rely on creatinine 
determinations which are isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) traceable.  All 
laboratories should be using creatinine methods calibrated to be IDMS traceable.  Read more 
about creatinine standardization.  
This CKD -EPI equation calculator should be used when S Cr reported in mg/dL.  This 
equation is recommended when eGFR values above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 are desired.  
The source of the equation shown below is as follow s: 
 Levey AS, Stevens LA, Schmid CH, et al. A new equation to estimate glomerular 
filtration rate. Ann Intern Med. 2009;150(9):604 -612. 
 
eGFR =  
141 × min(S Cr/κ, 1)α × 
max(S Cr /κ, 1)-1.209 × 
0.993Age × 
1.018 [if female] ×  
1.159 [if Black]  
where:  
Scr is serum  creatinine in mg/dL,  
κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males,  
α is -0.329 for females and -0.411 for males,  
min indicates the minimum of SCr /κ or 1, and  
max indicates the maximum of SCr /κ or 1.  
Abbreviations: eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; SCr = standardized serum creatinine; max 
= indicates the maximum of S Cr/κ or 1min = indicates the minimum of S Cr/κ or 1.  
 
The equation does not require weight because the results are reported normalized to 1.73 m2 
body surface area, which is an accepted average adult surface area.

The study will co nsist of a Baseline visit  (Week  0) which will be the same as Week  52 of the parent study  
12-week ly visits (from Week  8) up to approximately 2 years from the start of the extension study, followed by 
24-weekly visits ther eafter (from Week  104) up until approximately 4  years after t he star t of the study 
(approximately 5  years from the start of the parent study).   
The parent Phase 2 stud y will retain a blind status at the time of the initiation of the extension study 
(double -blind for the PsA study, i.e., only the Sponsor and designa ted contract research organization [ CRO ] 
team members not directly related to the clinical conduct of the study will have been unblinded).  Safety 
assessments will be conducted at the 12 weekly or 24-weekly visits in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments.   
All scheduled visits will occur at the study site.  However, s hould unusual circumstances such as public health 
emergency (i.e. pandemic with an infectious agent ) or natural disasters  arise , video conference or 
teleconference between the subject and site investigator will be permitted as deemed appropriate by the Sponsor 
provided no physical examination is needed for the visit.   In this unusual circumstance, self -injection  made by 
the subject at subject’s home is allowed in order to guarantee treatm ent continuity.  
When all subjects have  completed the PsA parent Phase 2 study, the blind will no longe r need to be maintained 
for the  cohort, and this long- term extension study will have the option to become    open -label for those subjects.  
Note: the timi ng of switch to an open -label design may differ across the cohorts of  subjects entered, depending  
on the parent study.  If other studies are also included in the long -term extension study, similar considerations 
for maintenance of blind will be necessary.  Those subjects will be entered as separate cohorts and procedures 
such as continued double -dummy dosing regimens will be utilized , even after other parent Phase 2 cohorts 
have the option to switch to open -label.  
Subjects not deriving sufficient clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator at any time after the initiation 
of this long- term extension study should be discontinued from investigational medicinal product ( IMP), and 
receive clinical care as determined by the Investigator.  
With the exceptio n of those who withdraw informed consent, subjects who withdraw from IMP during the 
long-term extension study  will undergo the E oT assessments approximately 4  weeks after their last 
administration of IMP.  Subjects  who complete treatment to Week  200 will r eturn for a Follow -up assessment 
at Week  208 (4 years).  
No independent assessor is needed to assess efficacy measurements.  There will be no efficacy assessments during the LTE study. The Principal Investigator (PI)/designee will be responsible for perform
ing safety 
evaluations.  
Clinic al Adjudication Committee will be established to evaluate cardiovascular events.  
End of study is def ined as the last visit of the 4 -year treatment period (Week  208, EoT/Follow -up) for the last 
global subject.

Number of Subject s: 
Up to 286 subject s with PsA could be enrolled from the parent Phase 2 stud y.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
Inclusion Criteria : 
Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Subject has provided written informed consent for this long- term extension study.  
2. Subjects with PsA who met the inclusion criteria  of the parent stud y and completed the parent study 
treatment period (e.g., up to Week  48 for the parent Phase 2 stud y, with return for the EoT assessment at 
Week 52).  
3. PsA subjects who achieved a 20% reduction from Baseline in American College of Rheumatol ogy 
(ACR) 20 response criteria at Week  52, AND the subject has received sufficient clinical benefit, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, to support continued treatment with tildrakizumab.  
This criterion  using response criteria at Week  52 will apply to all s ubjects, including those subjects who 
enter the study from the wash -out phase of  their parent study (after Week  52) due to the timing of study 
site activation of the long -term extension study.   
4. No concomitant use of both leflunomide and methotrexate  simul taneously. 
5. No history of active tuberculosis (TB) or symptoms of TB.  
Exclusion Criteria : 
Subjects should be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:  
1. New onset during the parent study of arthritic conditions other than the subject's original condition.  
2. Female subjects of childbearing potential who do not agree to abstain from heterosexual activity or practice 
a dual method of contraception, for example, a combination of the following: (1) oral contraceptive, depo- progesterone, or intrauterine device; and (2) a barrier method (condom or diaphragm).  Male subjects 
with female partners of childbearing potential who are not using birth control as described above must use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., condom) if not surgically sterile (i.e., vasectomy).  Contraceptive 
methods must be practiced upon entering the study and through 16 weeks after the last dose of IMP.  If a 
subject discontinues prematurely, the contraceptive method must be practiced for 16 weeks following final 
administration of IMP.  
3. 
Female is pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant or initiate breastfeeding while 
enrolled in the study or up to 16  weeks after the last dose of IMP.  
4. Subject has previously been enrolled in this long- term extension study.  
5. Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator represents an obstacle for study conduct and/or represents a potential unacceptable risk for the subject.  
6. Subject has an active infection or history of infections as follows:  
− a serious infection, defined as requiring hospitalization  or intravenous  anti-infectives within 8  weeks 
prior to the first IMP dose of the extension study, with the last dos e having been received within 7  days 
of start of the extension study,  
− recurrent or chro nic infections, e.g., chronic pyelonephritis, chronic osteomyelitis, bronchiectasis, or 
other active infection that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might cause this extension study to be detrimental to the subject.

 human exposures obtained from the Phase  1 studies.   
.  The human exposure at steady -state  for the 
Phas e 2/3 dosing paradigm (once Q12  weeks) was estimated by the observed exposure of 
AUC0 -∞ (1130 and 1280 µg*day/mL) following a SC single -dose of 200 mg in Phase 1 clinical 
studies (P05776 and P06303), respectively.   
  
  
 
 
  
 
To da
te, tildrakizumab has been we ll tolerated at doses  up to 200 mg Q12 weeks and no 
dose - related toxicities have been observed.  T he available accrued safety data from Phase 1 to 
Phase 3 studies in subjects with PsO supports the continued conduct of the long -term extension 
studies in PsO, and further study of tildrakizumab in subjects with moderate -to-severe chronic 
plaque PsO  at doses up to and including 200 mg SC.  In PsA Phase 2 study, there was no 
statistical advantage of therapeutic efficacy observed in a higher dose of tildra kizumab 200 mg 
over tildra kizumab  100 mg.  Therefore, the dose regimen of tildrakizumab 100 mg, Q12  weeks 
was chosen for the long -term extension study.  The current data also support the conduct of 
clinical studies in -patient populations where IL -23 is anticipated to play a pathogenic role in 
inflammatory disease such as PsA, AS, and related conditions.  
7.2.2 Rationale for Study 
The parent Phase 2 study  is the first to be conducted with tildrakizumab in subjects exclusively 
with PsA, and the first to include a dosing regimen of 200 mg SC Q4 weeks .  As tildrak izumab 
is in development for the PsO indication (Phase  3 completed, long- term safety studies 
ongoing), and substantial pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics data exist  that can 
inform dose selection  used in the parent studies, evaluation of long- term safety , tolerability, 
and efficacy  is necessary in these disease areas where suppression of the IL-23 pathway  is 
relevant , and where patients may require life -long treatment options .  The study will include 
subjects with PsA  from the Phase 2 study  evaluating these subject population (e.g., future 
Phase 3 studies).  The study will  provide this patient population with the opportunity for 
continued use of a treatment that has afforded clinical benefit across an approximate 52 ˗week 
period during their parent study.

 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
9.1.1 Description  
This is a long- term extension study of tildrakizumab in  subjects with PsA who have previously 
completed the treatment period of studies with tildrakizumab.  E ligible PsA subjects who have 
previously completed the treatment period of Phase 2b study (CLR_16_23) will be entered into 
this long- term extension study .   
The study will be multinational and conduct ed in approximately 70 study sites.  All study sites 
used in the parent study can enter subjects to this long -term extension study, based on subject 
eligibility.  Up to 286 subjects with PsA could be enrolled from the parent Phase 2 study .  
Treatment allocation will be based upon the dose regimen assigned at the end of the treatment 
period in the parent study , with all subjects receiving tildrakizumab in the long -term extension 
study .  All subjects who meet the inclusion criteria  and have  complete d the parent study 
treatment period  (up to Week  48 for the parent Phase 2 study will return for the End of 
Treatment [EoT] visit at Week  52 of the parent study ). The eligible subjects will continue to 
be administered one of the following dose regimens  – 200 mg Q4W, 200 mg Q12W or 100 mg 
Q12W to maintain the blind of the ongoing parent study to at least Week 52 of the parent study .  
Thereafter, all subjects began migrating to receive 100 mg tildrakizumab SC injection Q12 
weeks in an open -label fashion for up to an additional 4 years provided that they meet clinical 
response criteria (as defined in Section  9.3.1).   
Note: eligibility for the long- term extension study will b e based on response criteria at  Week 
52 of the parent study [using Week  48 laboratory data from the parent study where relevant for 
calculations] regardless of timing of subject entry.  Subject eligibility for continuation to the long- term extension study based on the clinical response  criterion will be determined by the 
interactive voice response service ( IVRS ).  A flow diagram of the study design is presented in 
Figure  9-1 below.  
The study will consist of a Baseline visit (Week  0) which will be the same as Week  52 of the 
parent study , 12- weekly  visits (from Week  12) up to approximately 2 years f rom the  start of 
the extension study, followed by 24- weekly visits thereafter  (from Week  108) up until 
approximately 4 years after  the start of the study (approximately 5 years from the start of the 
parent study). 
The parent Phase 2 study blind status will  be retained  at the time of the initiation of the 
extension study ).  The eligible subjects will continue to be administered one of the following 
dose regimens – 200 mg Q4W, 200 mg Q12W or 100 mg Q12W to maintain the blind of the 
ongoing parent study to at least W eek 52  of the parent study .  Thereafter, all subjects beg in 
migrating to receive 100 mg tildrakizumab SC injection Q12 weeks in an open- label fashion

 4 weeks after their last administration of IMP .  Subjects who complete treatment to Week  200 
will return for a F ollow- up assessment at Week  208 (4 years).  
The primary safety objective s of this study include  assessment of  the long -term safety of 
tildrakizumab by evaluation of incidence and intensi ty of AEs, and changes in vital signs, 
laboratory assessments, ECGs, C- SSRS, and immunogenicity data. 
No independent assessor is needed to assess efficacy measuremen ts.  There will be no efficacy 
assessments during the LTE study.  The Principal Investigator (PI)/designee will be responsible 
for performing safety evaluations.  
Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC) will be established to evaluate cardiovascular events 
(Section 13.3.6).  
End of study  is defined as the last visit of the 4- year treatment period ( Week  208, 
EoT/Follow ˗up) for the last global subject.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for  Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

9.2 Discussion of Study Design  
Subjects with PsA  will be eligible for this long -term extension study if they have completed 
approximately 1  year of treatment in the parent study .  At the time of the first subjects en tering 
the long -term extension study, other subjects may  still be continuing in the parent Phase 2 
study. 
The study has been developed based on design features used in the ongoing parent Phase 2 
study for PsA  subj ects as well as ong oing Phase  3 studies for subjects with psoriasis .  No  
efficacy endpoint s will be assessed for the study.  
The study has been designed to provide an immediate entry into the long- term phase from the 
end of the parent study with the last assessment from the parent study  becoming the Baseline

Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 32 of 74 
 assessment of the l ong-term extension.  This enables scientific evaluation of safety at all 
measured time points beyond completion of treatment in the parent study and comparison back 
to the original Baseline of the parent study.  Su bjects who entered the wash -out phase of their 
parent study prior to study site activation of this long- term extension protocol will also be 
eligible for inclusion and will re -initiate  the tildrakizumab dose last received in the parent 
study.  The duration of time in the wash -out phase of the parent study prior to entry to the long-
term extension is anticipated to be short, thus enabling continued efficacy assessment across  
the long- term extension study.  
All safety measures are consistent with evaluations used in clinical studies and previous studies with tildrakizumab.  
9.2.1 Risk/Benefit and Ethical Assessment  
This extension study will provide subjects from parent Phase  2 stud y who receive clinical 
benefit from treatment after approximately 1  year, as determined  by eligibility criteria and 
Investigator opinion, opportunity to receive continued long- term tildrakizumab treatment for 
up to a further 4 years .  Subjects from other studies may also be eligible for entry to this 
long- term extension study, hence offering  extended use of effective dosing regimens.  
Subjects will only be eligible for continuation into this long -term extension study if they 
complete  the treatment period of the parent study ( Week  48 for parent Phase  2 studies , with 
return for the EoT assessmen t at Week  52), meet defined clinical response criteria and, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, would gain clinical benefit from long- term continuation of 
tildrakizumab.  
The study has also been designed to minimize potential risks to subjects; all subjects will 
undergo Screening procedures at the start  of their parent study aimed at reducing the likelihood 
and impact of any such risks.  In addition, regular safety monitori ng during the treatment period 
of the parent study and this long -term extension study for all subjects will ensure that any 
unanticipated effects of study participation are identified promptly and managed appropriately.  
The design also allows withdrawal o f subjects from tildrakizumab  at the end of the parent study 
(in accordance with the current parent protocol wash -out phase ) and at any time thereafter 
during the extension study if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is no longer obtaining sufficient clinical benefit, thus enabling subjects to receive other treatment in accordance with local clinical practice.  
Overall, based on data from non- clinical and clinical studies of tildrakizumab to date and the 
risk minimization strategies discussed a bove, the risk:benefit profile of the current study is 
considered acceptable.

 9.2.2 Early Termination 
This study may be terminated at any time by the Sponsor if serious side effects should occur, 
if the Investigator does not adhere to the protocol or if, in the Sponsor's judg ment, there are no 
further benefits to be achieved from the study.  In this event, the Sponsor will inform the study 
Investigators, institutions and all regulatory authorities.  
9.3 Selection of Study Population 
9.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Subject has provided written informed consent for this long- term extension study . 
2. Subjects with PsA who met  the inclusion criteria of the parent  stud y and completed the 
parent study treatment period (e.g., up to Week  48 for the parent Phase  2 stud y, with return 
for the EoT assessment at Week  52). 
3. PsA subjects  who achieved a 20% reduction from Baseline in American College of 
Rheumatology ( ACR )20 response criteria at Week  52 (for detail s see Appendix 22.2) , 
AND the subject has received sufficient clinical benefit, in the opinion of the Investigator, to support continue d treatment with tildrakizumab.  
Note: This criterion using response criteria at Week  52 of the parent study will apply to all 
subjects, including those subjects who enter the study from the wash -out phase of their 
parent study (after Week  52) due to the timing of study site activation of the long -term 
extension study.  
4. No concomitant use of both leflunomide and methotrexate, 
5. No history of active tuberculosis ( TB) or symptoms of TB. 
9.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects should be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria: 
1. New onset during the parent study of arthritic conditions  other than the subject ’s original 
condition. 
2. Female subjects of childbearing potential who do not agree to abstain from heterosexual 
activity or practice a dual method of contraception, for example,  a combination of the 
following: (1 ) oral contraceptive, depo -progesterone, or intrauterine device; and (2) a 
barrier method (condom or diaphragm).  Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential who are not using birth control as described above must use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., condom) if not surgically sterile (i.e., vasectomy).  Contraceptive 
methods must be practiced upon entering the study and through 16 weeks after the last dose

investigational biologic therapies (other than tildrakizumab) for PsO and/or PsA  (see 
Section  10.6).  
General  
18. Subjects who have been placed in an institution on official or judicial orders. 
19. Subjects who are related to or dependent on the Investigator, Sponsor, or study site such 
that a conflict of interest may arise.  
9.3.3 Strategies for Subject Recruitment and Retention  
Subject recruitment will be according to satisfaction of eligibility criteria at the end of parent study .  The protocol requirements will be approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
or Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to implementation.  
Regular study monitoring will enable identification of any potential issues related to subject retention. 
9.3.4 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the long- term extension study for 
any reason at any time.  
Withdrawal of consent occurs when a subject does not want to participate in the study anymore 
and does not want to attend any further visits or assessments, have further study  -related 
contact, or allow analysis of already obtained biologic material.  
If a subject withdraws consent, the Investigator must make every effort to determine the 
primary reason for this decision and record this information on the treatment disposition eCRF 
page.  If the subject decides to completely withdraw from the study (refuses any further study 
participation or contact), all study participation for that subject will cease and data to be colle cted at subsequent visits will be considered missing.  The IMP must be discontinued and 
no further assessments conducted.  Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety findings requ ire communication or f ollow -up. 
For safety reasons , and particularly following an AE, Week  208 (EoT /Follow -up) assessments 
should be conducted if the withdrawn subject is willing to undergo the a ssessments.   Subjects 
who discontinue the study due to an AE considered related to study drug should be followe d 
as described in Section  12.1.1.1.

Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 36 of 74 
 The appropriate personnel from the study site and designated CRO  will assess whether IMP 
should be discontinued for any subject whose treatment code has been broken inadvertently. 
The Invest igator must also contact the IVRS  to register the subject’s discontinuation from IMP. 
9.3.5 Investigational Medicinal Product Discontinuation 
Subjects may voluntarily discontinue IMP for any reason at any time, or completely withdraw 
from the study (see Section  9.3.4).  Subjects who consent will undergo the EoT/Follow-up 
assessment approximately  4 weeks after administration of the last dose of IMP.  
At any time during this long -term extension study , subjects not deriving sufficient clinical 
benefit in the opinion of the Investigator should be discontinued from IMP.  Investigators 
should monitor the clinical benefit of each subject in an ongoing manner throughout the study 
in order to make the determination as to whether it is appropriate for them to continue to 
participate . 
IMP must be discontinued under the following circumstances and further steps need to be 
discussed with the medical monitor: 
• A serious adverse event ( SAE ), drug reaction or complication, or an unacceptable AE, 
whether attributed to IMP or not, that precludes continuation of  treatment with IMP .  This 
includes the development of allergic reactions or the development of other potentially  
serious drug reactions to medication required by the protocol, 
• Diagnosis of malignancy (except basal or squamous cell carcinoma) during study 
(treatment may be continued at the discretion of the subject and Investigator, and in 
consultation with the medical monitor ), 
• Subjects who develop suicidal behavior ( Section  12.4), 
• Evidence of pregnancy, 
• Withdrawal of informed consent, 
• Lost to follow-up, 
• Significant non-compliance of the subject with study procedures, 
• Decision of the Sponsor to terminate the subject, site, or the study. 
The derivation of clinical response (at Week  52 for the Phase  2 parent study ) will be made 
within the IVRS system using information provided by the study site.  The IVRS system will 
determine the subject's eligibility to continue into the long -term extension study .  Subjects who 
fail to meet eligibility criteria at the end of their parent study will not be eligible to continue to 
the long- term extension study  in accordance with the IVRS instruction, and would continue in 
the Follow-up period of their parent study.

 Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Investigational Medicinal Product  
Investigational medicinal product may be temporarily suspended in the event of: 
• Clinically important laboratory abnormalities , 
• Subjects who develop sui cidal ideation  (Section  12.4), 
• Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery , 
• Use of prohibited treatment  (according to inclusion criteria of the parent study , 
Section  9.3.1 and Section  9.3.2), 
• Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the subject's safety , 
• Sponsor decision. 
After a laboratory abnormality leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, IMP 
may resume at the discretion of the PI  in consultation with the medical monitor.  Similarly, 
IMP may resume after a prohibited medication leading to suspension of dosing is discontinued.  
A decision to discontinue IMP and/or to reinstitute IMP should be discussed with the medical 
monitor.  The Investigator may suspend IMP at any time, even without consultation with the 
medical monitor if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action and if this is 
determined to be in the subject's best interest.  However, the medical monitor should be 
contacted as soon as possible  in any case of IMP discontinuation.  Resumption of IMP after 
temporary discontinuation should always be discussed with the medical monitor. 
9.3.6 Lost to Follow- Up 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the subject.  Lost to follow -up is 
defined by the inability to reach t he subject after a minimum of 3  documented phone calls, 
faxes or emails (not performed on the same day), as well as a lack of resp onse by the subject 
to a registered mail letter.  All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records.  
If it is determined that the subject has died, the study site will use permissible local methods to 
obtain the date and cause of death an d as much other information as can be obtained, including 
post mortem reports. 
Data to be collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing.  
9.3.7 Discontinuation of Study Sites  
Study site participation may be discontinued if Sun Pharma Global FZE or designee, the 
Investigator or IRB/IEC of the study site judges it necessary for medical or safety reasons 
consistent with applicable laws, regulations and GCP.  Sun Pharma Global FZE or designee 
may also discontinue the study site or study country should there be a change in the personnel (or structure) of the site or political (or economic) environment of the country such that

 10 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
10.1 Identity of Investigatio nal Medicinal product  
10.1.1 Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product 
Investigational medicinal product  will be supplied as  and 
administered SC.  All subjects will be dosed at the same time points to maintain the study blind 
of the parent study where applicable  (see Section  10.2.4).  All subjects will be receiving 
tildrakizumab in accordance with their parent study dose regimen until at least Week 52 in the 
parent study and will transition to tildrakizumab 100 mg Q12 w eeks thereafter  there will be no 
placebo comparator group in this study.   
If a subject misses a visit and/or a scheduled dose of IMP, the study site must reschedule a visit 
to ensure the dose of IMP is taken as soon as possible within the visit window.  I f afte r 
2 attempts to reschedule or the visit window was missed and the subject still is not able to take 
the dose, the Sponsor should be contacted to determine if the subject should be discontinued 
from the study. 
10.2 Investigational Medicinal Product Packagi ng and Label ing 
10.2.1 Packaging 
Each of IMP contains 1 mL of solution.  A  of tildrakizumab contains 100 mg 
(100 mg/mL) of active drug. 
10.2.2 Label ing 
Medication labels will comply with the legal requirements of each country and be printed in 
the local language.  They will supply no information about the subjects. 
10.2.3 Storage 
All drug supplies for this study must be stored under refrigerated conditions (2ºC to 8ºC) and 
according to labeled storage conditions.  Until dispensed for administration to subjects, the IMP will be stored in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized personnel only .  If a study 
nurse is selected to administer IMP in a home setting ( Section  9.1.3.3), the study IMP should 
be stored and transported in accordance with the study recommendations.  T he IMP should not 
be stored at t he subject’ s home and should accompany the study nurse on the day of the 
scheduled visit. 
10.2.4 Blinding and Randomization of Investigational Medicinal Product  
Subjects will be not be randomized and will enter the long- term extension study with one fixed 
dose regimen  of tildrakizumab , 100 mg at Week 52 of the parent study.  However, subject 
numbers based on allocation from an IVRS system will remain in place from the parent study 
until such time the blind is no longer required to be maintained. 

 
Sun Pharma Global FZE   22 Jul 2020  
Tildrakizumab    
 
Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 40 of 74 
 A copy of the r andomization code with true treatment allocations will be held by the designated 
CRO  during the study.  Another randomization list (containing kit number and treatment) will 
be provided to clinical supplies.  The randomization codes associated with each subject will be 
disclosed to PK analysts who will keep PK results confidential until treatment completion  of 
the parent study (for Phase 2 parent study , this will be following completion and database lock 
of all PsA subjects ). 
The long- term extension study is designed initially to maintain as last dosing regimen in the 
parent study followed by a regimen of 100 mg Q12 week, in an open- label fashion as  blinding 
of IMP is no longer necessary to maintain .  If a subject does not receive the scheduled dose, 
every effort should be made to administer the dose as soon as possible (see Section  10.1.1).  
All safety  assessments will be administered  by the study coordinator or PI /designee.  
Should a situation arise where unblinding is required, the Investigator at that study site may 
perform immediate unblinding via the IVRS without the need for communication with the 
Sponsor.  This can only occur in emergency situatio ns (Section  10.3).  
At the time of the first IA for this extension study , the Phase 2 parent study will h ave been 
unblinded and hence no considerations of maintenance of blind will be necessary  for those 
cohorts of subjects. 
10.3 Procedure for Breaking the Randomization Code  
Subjects, study site  personnel , persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will 
remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until such time the 
long-term study can become open- label for the relevant cohort of subjects ( Section  9.1.1). 
Emergency treatment code breaks should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the 
subject safely and efficaciously.  Most often, IMP discontinuation and knowledge of the 
possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition.  Emergency code breaks are performed using the IVRS.  When the 
Investigator contacts the system to break a treatment c ode for a subject, he/she must provide 
the requested subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment 
code for the subject.  The Investigator will then receive details of the IMP for the specified 
subject and a fax or email confirming this information.  The system will automatically inform 
the designated site monitor, medical monitor, and the project m anager that the code has been 
broken, but no treatment assignment will be communicated. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibilit y to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access 
to the IVRS in case of emergency.  The Investigator will inform the subject how to contact 
his/her backup in case  of emergency when he/she is unavailable.  The Investigator will provide 
the protocol number, IMP name if available, subject number, and instructions for contacting 
the local entity which has responsibility for emergency code breaks to the subject in case an

Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 41 of 74 
 emergency treatment code break is required at a time when the Investigator and backup are 
unavailable.  
10.4 Subject Compliance  
The dosage, timing and mode of administration of IMP may not be changed.  Any departures 
from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRF. 
Investigational medicinal product  accountability and subject compliance will be documented 
throughout the treatm ent period using study- specific IMP  dispensing record forms.  If a subject 
does not receive the scheduled dose, every effort should be made to administer the dose as soon 
as pos sible ( Section  10.1.1).  
Deviations from the intended regimen could occur due to: 
• Receiving u nscheduled IMP injections, 
• Missing an injection , 
• Receiving the incorrect IMP dose.  
10.5 Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of  the delivery of IMP  to the study site s, the inventory at the study 
sites, the use of each subject and the return to the Sponsor. 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates , and the unique code 
numbers assigned to the IMP and to the study subjects. 
The Investigator shall be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the subjects were provided the doses specified in the protocol and that all IMP received from 
the Sponsor is r econciled.  All IMP  must be returned to the Sponsor at the end of the study. 
10.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Subjects should abide by inclus ion and exclusion restrictions for this long -term extension 
study.  
Permitted medications include: 
• Acetaminop hen, except within 24 hours before a scheduled study efficacy evaluation, 
• Non- steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs  or low potency opioids (e.g., tramadol) ,  
• Methotrexate or leflunomide,  
• Oral corticosteroids (no more than daily 10 mg for maintenance dose), 
• Non- drug therapy (including but not limited to physical therapy, mass age, diet, exercise, 
emollients,  and joint taping)..

 Use of and a djustment of permitted  medication is permitted throughout  the study per 
Investigator discretion and therapeutic needs of the subject.  
In accordance with the parent study , subjects are prohibited from use of the following at the 
time of written informed consent for and during the long-term extension study: 
• High potency opioid analgesics (e.g., methadone, hydromorphone, or morphine)  for the 
treatment of arthritis (allowed for treatment of other co nditions for periods of up to 
2 weeks) , 
• Sulfasalazine,  
• Systemically administered calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclos porine, t acrolimus ), 
• Azathioprine, 
• Parenteral corticosteroids including intramuscular or intra -articular administration ( topical, 
ophthalmic, intra -nasal, and inhaled corticosteroids are permitted)  for the treatment of 
arthritis (allowed for treatment of o ther co nditions for periods of up to 2 weeks) ,  
• Live vaccines.  
Any prohibited treatments must be discontinued prior to IMP initiation for the long -term 
extension study. During this long -term extension study , subjects must not use  systemic immunosuppressive 
therapies including commercially available or investigational therapies for PsO  or PsA such 
as: 
• Use of all anti -tumor necrosis factor agents, including etanercept, 
• Use of B -cell and T -cell depleting/inhibiting agents,  
• Use of any other commercially available or investigational biologic therapies (other than 
tildrakizumab) for PsO and/or PsA within 3 months or 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) 
prior to or during IMP in the long- term extension study,  
• Use of apremilast, or other approved or investigati onal medications for the treatment of 
current condition which are not identified as permitted therapies, 
• Use of secukinumab, ustekinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab, or any drug targeting 
interleukin (IL) 17, IL 23, or the IL-12/IL-23-shared p40 molecule.

 11 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section  9.1.2 and 
Section  9.1.3. 
11.1 Adverse Events  
The definitions for AEs  and SAEs are provided in Section  11.1.1.  The PI is responsible for 
ensuring all  personnel involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. 
11.1.1 Definitions  
11.1.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigation) product , 
whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product”. 
Any relevant observations made at the Baseline visit (including laboratory test results, and until 
the ICF is signed ) are to be recorded on the AE eCRF, but will not be considered treatm ent-
emergent AEs (TEAEs) for the long -term extension study, and will be reported separately from 
TEAEs.  A TEAE includes a ny relevant observations  following signing of the ICF  for the 
long˗term extension study , and  will be recorded as an AE in the subject’ s AE eCRF; this 
includes physical examination findings, clinically relevant abnormal vital signs, clinically 
relevant laboratory abnormalities, and clinically relevant ECG findings.  An AE relating to a 
pre˗existing condition or ongoing at the start of the  long- term extension study will only be 
recorded as a TEAE if there is a worsening of the pre -existing condition during the long -term 
study conduct with regard to nature, intens ity or frequency.  
An adverse drug reaction is an “untoward and unintended response to an IMP related to any dose administered”.  
All AEs judged by either the reporting Investigator or the Sponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse drug reactions.  The expression of “reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are facts or arguments 
which suggest a causal relationship.   Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE 
considered related to study drug should be followed until the event is resolved, conside red 
stable, or the I nvestigator determines the event is no longer clinically significant. 
11.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as, but is not limited to, an event that: 
• Results in death , 

 
Sun Pharma Global FZE   22 Jul 2020  
Tildrakizumab    
 
Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 44 of 74 
 Death is not an AE in itself, but an outcome.  The cause of the death is the AE which 
resulted in death. 
• Is life -threatening , 
Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been 
more severe.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization , 
Hospitalization is defined as  at least 1 o vernight formal admission into hospital, usually in 
order to perform additional tests, provide treatment which it is not possible to provide at 
home and/or due to an unstable medical condition which requires specific monitoring of 
the subject.  Pre -planned hospitalizations (known already prior to signing the ICF) will not 
be considered an SAE, unless any of the above criteria are fulfilled over  the course of the 
hospitalization due to unplanned complications.  "Social" hospitalization whereby it is 
administratively impossible to release the subject home is not necessarily an SAE.  
Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs unless they would qualify as an 
SAE for any of the above criteria.  If the complication delays subject release from hospital 
then the AE becomes an SAE.  Hospitalizations which are not performed due to an AE are 
not regarded as SAEs.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , 
The term significant disability refers to any condition that impairs physical/physiological well-being to the extent that the subject is unable to function normally.  Physical disability 
may include, but is not limited to, permanent disability of locomotion or motility, but also 
systemic permanent dysfunction including heart failure, liver insufficiency or pulmonary 
fibrosis.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect , 
• Is an important medical event. 
Important medical events that ma y not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospitalization may be considered as an SAE when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or the subject may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
11.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The events of severe infections  (defined as any infection meeting the regulatory definition of a 
SAE or requiring intravenous antibiotics whether or not reported as a serious event) , 
malignancies (including non- melanoma and melanoma skin cancer), confirmed Major Adverse 
Cardiovascular Events (MACE), and drug -related hypersen sitivity reactions) will each be 

 
Sun Pharma Global FZE   22 Jul 2020  
Tildrakizumab    
 
Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 45 of 74 
 identified a priori as an AE of special interest ( AESI ) for summari zing in this study .  Major 
Adverse Cardiovascular Events include non- fatal stroke, non- fatal myocardial infarction , and 
cardiovascular death.  All MACE events will be evaluated and adjudicated by a CAC 
(Section  12.3.4).  An AESI must be reporte d as if it were an SAE (Section  11.1.2) 
11.1.1.4 Overdose  
A drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of a drug or medicine or an administration error in an amount that is higher than is normally used.  Every overdose must 
be reported to the designated pharmacovigilance/s afety services within 24 hours of awareness, 
irrespective of whether the overdose was associated with an AE/SAE.  
Overdose in this study is specifically defined as any dose greater than the intended protocol 
dose ( Section  10.1.1).  In case of overdose, it is recommended that the subject be monitored 
for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment be instituted immediately.  
11.1.1.5 Prod uct Quality Complaint  
A product quality complaint (PQC) is related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage , or distribution of the product or 
delivery system.  In addition, it includes any reports in which a suspicion of counterfeit/tampering exists.  It is important to note that not all PQCs involve a subject.  A PQC should be reported within 24 hours, using the details provided in Section  11.1.2. 
11.1.1.6 Planned Hospitalization  
A hospitalization planned by the subject prior to signing the ICF is considered a therapeutic interv ention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as medical history.  If the 
planned hospitalization or procedure is executed as planned, the record in the subject's medical history is considered complete.  However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must be reported as an AE. 
11.1.1.7 Incident  
A device -related incident is any product complaint that led to or might have led to death or 
serious deterioration of health/serious injury/serious illness for the user of the product or any 
other person.  Note that "device" refers to the for this study.  The incident should be 
reported within 24 hours , using the details provided in Section  11.1.2. 
11.1.1.8 Recording of Adverse Events  
Any relevant observations made before the end of the Baseline visit (prior to signing the ICF  
for this long -term extension study) are to be recorded on the AE eCRF, but will not be 
considered TEAEs and will be reported separatel y from TEAEs.  Any relevant observations

Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 46 of 74 
 made after signing the ICF  will be recorded as an AE in the subject's AE eCRF (see 
Section  11.1.1.1).  
For the purposes of this study, any detrimental change in the subject's condition, after the first 
dose of IMP for the long -term extension study and up to completion of the EoT /Follow -up 
visit, should be considered an AE. 
The following variables  will be recorded for each AE: verbatim/AE description and date for 
AE start and stop, intens ity, seriousness, causality rating, whether or not the AE caused the 
subject to discontinue, and the outcome.  A new AE must be recorded if the intens ity of the AE  
changes.  
All AEs/SAEs have to be reported to the Sponsor, whether or not considered causally related 
to the IMP or to the study procedure(s). 
All ongoing AEs/SAEs should be followed up until resolution or stabilization or the last visit 
if in the Investig ator's opinion, the AE is unlikely to resolve due to the subject's underlying 
disease.  
At any time after the subject has taken the first dose of IMP, if an Investigator learns of an SAE that can be reasonably related to IMP, he/she should promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The Investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated), 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) , 
• Severe (incapacitati ng, with inability to perform normal activities) . 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is def ined by the criteria in Section  11.1.1.2. 
An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea 
that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke 
but would be an SAE. 
For an AE to be a suspected drug -related event, there should be at least a reasonable possibility 
of a causal relationship between the IMP  and the AE. 
11.1.1.9 Causal Assessment  
The relationship of AEs to IMP will be assessed by the Investigator (Global Introspection 
assessment), and will be a clinical decision based on all available information.

 Term  Definition  Clarification 
Unrelated  Those AEs which, after careful consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc.)  
Unlikely  A clinical event, including 
laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, 
chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  1. It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
(Improbable temporal relationship) from administration 
of the drug.  
2. It could also be explained by  subject's concurrent 
disease, environmental factors, medical history , and 
other concomitant drugs or chemicals including food- drug interactions . 
Possibly  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to  administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals.  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 1. It follows a reasonable  temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug.  
2. It could also be explained by subject's concurrent 
disease, environmental factors, medical history , and 
other concomitant drugs or chemicals (including food-drug interactions).  
3. There is no information or uncertainty with regard to 
what has happened after  stopping the drug.  
Probably  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the drug, 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response 
on withdrawal (de -challenge ).  
Re-challenge  information is not 
required to fulfil this definition.  1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug.

must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory re -challenge  
procedure if necessary.  1. It follows a plausible time sequence to drug intake; this 
means that there is a positive argument in sufficient 
detail to support the view that the drug is causally 
involved, pharmacologically or pathologically e.g., 
pharmacokinetics and type of reactio n.   
2. It could not be explained by subject 's concurrent 
disease, environmental factors, medical history , and

 11.1.1.11 Anaphylaxis 
The clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis are as follows:  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, or swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING : 
a) Respiratory compromise (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced P EF, or hypoxemia) , 
b) Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e.g. hypotonia [collapse], syncope, or 
incontinence) . 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely  allerge n for that subject  (minutes 
to several hours):  
a) Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, or swollen lips -tongue -
uvula) , 
b) Respiratory compromise (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, or hypoxemia) , 
c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hypotonia [collapse], syncope, or incontinence) , 
d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. crampy abdominal pain, or vomiting) . 
3. Reduced  BP after exposure to  known allergen for that subjec t (minutes to several hours):  
a) Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or > 30% decrease in systolic BP , 
b) Adults: systolic BP of <90  mm Hg or > 30% decrease from that person’s B aseline.

11.1.1.12 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the IMP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  If a pregnancy is reported for 
a subject, no further IMP will be administered to this subject and the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , or congenital abnormality) must 
be followed up and documented.  Follow -up should be performed up to delivery and 
examination of the new -born, after which a follow -up report should be sent with any new 
information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome of the birth. 
All congenital abnormalities/birth defects should be classified as SAEs.  Spontaneous 
miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as SAEs, but should be reported as a follow -up report for 
the pregnancy.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor on a Pregnancy Outcomes Report Form.

Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 51 of 74 
 Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took IMP in 
this study.  Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be 
obtained from the fem ale partner.  
Pregnancies must be reported to the designated p harmacovigilance/s afety services using the 
reporting details provided in Section  11.1.2 within 24 hours of awareness. 
11.1.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported according to ICH GCP or local regulations, applying the regulation 
with the stricter requirements.  
Investigators and other site personnel must inform the designated pharmacovigilance/s afety 
services of any SAE that occurs during the course of the study (from the time of written 
informed consent until 30 days after the last EoT /Follow -up visit), whether or not it is 
considered causally related to the IMP or to the st udy procedure(s), and within 24 hours of 
when he/ she becomes aware of it.  An SAE wi th an onset day greater than 30 days from the 
EoT/Follow -up visit will be recorded only for fatal SAEs and those deeme d by the Investigator 
to be drug- related or AESIs ( Section  11.1.1.3).  The Investigator should make every effort to 
obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the event is considered resolved, chr onic 
and/or stable. 
If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up information must als o 
be provided to the designated CRO within 24 hours as described above.  The start date of the SAE is not the start date, but the date when the AE becomes serious; analogously, the stop date 
is the date when any seriousness criterion is no longer applicable, not the date when the AE is resolved. 
All SAEs will also be recorded in the eCRF.  The Investigator is responsible for informing the 
Ethics Committee of the SAE as per local requirements.  
Paper SAE forms should be completed at the site and faxed/emailed to the designated 
pharmacovigilance/s afety services or emailed to the global em ail distribution list within 
24 hours of awareness of the event. 
SAE and AESI reports should be sent or faxed to the designated pharmacovigilance/safety 
services  provided in Section  3. 
There may be sit uations when an SAE (or AESI ) has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial SAE report.  However, it is very important that the Investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of 
the SAE Report Form.  Minimum criteria are identifiable subject (number), a suspect product (i.e., IMP or concomitant medication), an identifiable reporting source (Investigator/study site 
identification), and an event or outcome that can be identified as serious.  The Investigator may

11.2 Safety Endpoints 
All safety endpoints are listed in Section  12.3.1. 
11.3 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory measurements for blood chemistry, hematology , and urinalysis will be performed 
according to Table 9-1.  Specific details not mentioned in this section (including shipping 
requirements) are included  in the laboratory manual. 
For visits where lipid panel laboratory parameters will be assessed (see Table 9-1) , blood 
samples are to be collected (pre -dose where applicable) after 12 hours fasting, and after ECG 
and vital sign measurements.  
11.3.1 Clinical Laboratory Tests

a Urine pregnancy tests and ESR will be performed at the study site using materials supplied by  the central 
laboratory.  
11.3.2 Pregnancy Testing  
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at the 
Screening visit  of the parent study only.  Urine pregnancy test with sensitivity of at least 
25 mIU/mL, will be perfor med according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 9-1) .  If at 
any point during the study there is a case of a positive urine human chorionic gonadot ropin 
test, the subject will have IMP stopped and will be withdrawn from the study. 
Pregnancy tests will also be performed whenever 1  menstrual cycle is missed during the 
treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), to confirm the  subject 
has not become pregnant during the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request 
of IECs / IRBs  or if required by local regulations. 
11.4 Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior  
Subjects will be assessed for suicidal ideation and behavior at Baseline ( Section  9.1.1) and each 
subsequent visit using the C -SSRS s ince L ast Visit version.  There are 5  questions relating to 
levels of suicidal ideation which prompt questioning about suicidal behavior or intensity of 
ideation, depending on response.  Subjects acknowledging active thoughts of self -harm but 
lacking an articulated plan f or doing so are classified at the intermediate risk level; those 
presenting a defined self -harm plan or lacking needed impulse control are judged to be at the 
high-risk level.  Subjects  who develop suicidal ideation during the study rated as high- risk 
according to the above classification must be temporarily discontinued from receiving IMP and 
referred promptly for psychiatric evaluation.  Subjects rated as displaying the intermediate level of suicidal ideation should receive psychological support and be assessed on an individual 
basis.  All individuals assessed as exhibiting suicidal behavior, except preparatory acts, must discontinue IMP permanently.  The presence of non- suicidal self -injurious behavior should be 
assessed on an individual basis. 
11.5 Electrocardiogram Assessments  
Computerized 12- lead ECG recordings will be obtained at scheduled study visits after the 
subject has rested for at least 5 minutes in the supine position.  ECG data will be submitted to 
a central laboratory for measurement.  The Investi gator will document the occurrence of any 
clinically significant 12 -lead ECG abnormalities within the eCRF (AE module) based on

 correlation between the central reading report and clinical findings.  Repeat measurements will 
be performed if needed. 
The following ECG parameters will be obtained directly from the computerized 12 -lead ECG 
recordings: rhythm, ventricular rate, P -R interval (the portion of the  ECG between the onset of 
the P -wave and the Q RS-complex), QRS duration and QT/QTcF where, according to the 
Fridericia formula  (QTcF) , is the observed QT interval (the time from the beginning of the 
Q-wave to the end of the T-wave) divided by the cubed root of the R- R interval (interval from 
the peak of a QRS -complex to the peak of the next) in seconds: 
𝑄𝑄𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 =  𝑄𝑄𝑇𝑇
√𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅3�  
   
QTcB (QT  corrected according to Bazett ’s formula ) will also be recorded, where:  
𝑄𝑄𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑄𝑄=  𝑄𝑄𝑇𝑇
√𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅�  
   11.6 Physical Examination 
A standard complete physical examination will be performed at the weeks specified in 
Table 9-1.  The following parameters and body systems will be examined and any 
abnormalities described: height, weight, general appearance, skin (presence of rash), head, ears, 
eyes, nose, throat, lungs (auscultation), heart (auscultation for presence of murmurs, gallops, or rubs), lower extremity exam ination , abdomen (palpation and auscultation), neurologic 
(mental status, station, gait, reflexes, motor and sensory function, and coordination), and lymp h 
nodes.  Any clinically significant changes from Baseline  (after signing of the ICF for the long -
term extension study ) should be recorded as AEs. 
11.7 Vital Signs  
Body temperature (oral /tympanic or axillary ), systolic and diastolic cuff blood pres sure 
(measured after at least 5  minutes in the supine position) , and pulse rate  (measured after at least 
5 minutes in the supine position) will be recorded according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 9-1 ).  Automatic or manual devices may be used, but the same device will be used for 
any given subject throughout the study.  The same method of measuring body temperature will 
be used throughout  the study.  The same arm will be used for all measurements.  All devices 
must hold valid calibration at the time of use.  
11.8 Anti -Drug Antibodies  
The presence of ADA for tildrakizumab will be assessed at the time points specified in 
Table 9-1.  Samples will be c ollected as detailed in Section  9.1.2.1.  Sample testing will be 
conducted as specified in the laboratory manual.

 12 STATISTICAL EVALUATION 
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
The sample size of this study is determined by the number of subjects who rollover from the 
parent PsA stud y.  No power is calculated because the primary objective is to assess the long -
term safety of tildrakizumab.  
12.2 Statistical Methods  
The All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) population consists of all subjects who entered the 
extension study.  The ASaT is the primary populat ion for safety/tolerability, efficacy , and PK  
analyses .  The analysis will be based on the treatment  subjects actually received.  
All endpoints will be present ed for the measured time points provided in Table  9-1.  In addition, 
all data collected for s ubjects who enter ed the wash -out period of the parent study (whilst 
awaiting  start of the long -term extension study at their study site) will be valid for data 
presentation.  This includes data collected at visits beyond Week 52 of the parent study and 
prior to the Baseline visit of the long- term extension study.  
12.2.1 Study Subject Data  
Subject disposition and demographic data for subjects in the extension study will be 
summarized descriptively.  
Exposure and compliance with IMP will be summarized descriptively. 
Incidence of concomitant medication use will be summarized by World Health Organiz ation 
Drug dictionary coded terms - Anatomic al Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and 
preferred name. 
12.2.2 Efficacy Endpoints 
No efficacy endpoints will be measured. 12.2.3 Safety Endpoints

12.3 Description of Statistical Analyses 
All the safety and efficacy data will be summarized descriptively through appropriate data 
tabulations and descriptive statistics.  For continuous variables, unless otherwise stated, the 
number of available observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and range will 
be provided.  For categorical variables, the number and percentage in each category will be 
displayed. 
The last value of a variable taken before the first dose of IMP in parent study will be used as 
the original Baseline value.   The last value before the first dose of IMP in the long -term 
extension study will be used as the LTE Baseline value.   Unless otherwise specified, missing 
or dropout data will not be imputed for the purpose of data analysis. A more detailed description of stud y analyses will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
12.3.1 Safety Analysis 
The subjects in this long -term extension study will be summarized separately according to 
parent PsA  studies and indication .  Any additional summaries including pooling of  indications, 
common dosing regimens, or studies will be provided in the S AP. 
The subjects will be summarized based on the  actual treatment received at specific time points 
when applicable.  
Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the most recent version ava ilable of the Medical Diction ary for 
Regulatory Activities  (Me dDRA) . 
Due to the various durations of exposure to a treatment, the exposure -adjusted AE incidence 
rate (per 100  subject -years) will be summarized by treatment group .  The incidence of AEs will 
be summarized by system organ class and PT.  If a subject experiences the same PT  multiple 
times then the event will be counted only once for the greatest intens ity during a treatment 
period.  Separate tables will be presented by intens ity; AEs considered to be related to IMP by 
the Investigator  will be summarized similarly.  
AEs of special interest will be summarized descriptively.  
All AEs will be presented in full in a comprehensive listing including subject number, treatment 
(or sequence) received, intens ity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, relationship to treatment, 
treatment received at AE onset, onset/stop and duration.  Details of SAEs and AEs leading to

 withdrawal will be listed separately.  A more detailed description regarding presentation of AE  
data will be provided in the SAP. 
Clinical Laboratory  
Clinical laboratory parameters will have observed values and changes from Baseline 
summarized at each scheduled visit by treatment group. 
Values outside the normal range will be categorized as above the normal range (H) or below 
the normal range (L ) based on the laboratory's reference range and these will be flagged in the 
listings of individual subject data.  
Vital Signs  
Vital sign observed values and changes from Baseline will be summarized at each s cheduled 
visit by treatment group.  
ECG  
The overall ECG interpretation will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage 
of subjects with "Normal" "Abnormal, not clinically significant" , and "Abnormal, clinically 
significant".  
ECG parameter s (e.g.,  QTcF) will have observed values and changes from Baseline 
summarized at each scheduled visit by treatment group. 
Physical Examination  
Physical examination results will be summarized with incidence of "Normal" and "Abnormal" 
by body system at each scheduled visit by treatment group.  
Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
Subjects will be assessed for suicidal ideation and behavior using C- SSRS.  
The C -SSRS consists of 2 major aspects: Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior.  T he 
following endpoints wi ll be used to analyze C -SSRS data:

 • Presence of Suicidal Ideation:  Set to 1 if any idea tion is present and 0 otherwise, 
• Presence of Suicidal Behavior:  Set to 1 if any type of suicidal behavior is present  and 
0 otherwise,  
• Suicidal ideation score: Defined as the maximum suicidal ideation category (1 -5) present 
on the C- SSRS at the assessment.  A score of 0 is assigned if no ideation is present.  
The number (%) of subjects with presence of suicidal ideation and behavior will be summarized 
at each assessment time.  The C -SSRS data will be summarized  using worst -case shift  from 
baseline tables.  
ADA to Tildrakizumab  
For each subject, tildrakizumab serum concentrations and ADA sample results are matched to 
actual sampling times and treatment.  Subjects are grouped based on the actual treatment 
received.  The anti -tildrakizumab immunogenicity status of evaluable subjects, along with titer 
will be summarized by dose level.  
 
 
12.3.2 Pharmacokinetic  Analysis 
Serum  tildrakizumab concentration data will be listed by individual subject and summarized 
by visi t.  The subjects will be summarized based on the ASaT population with the actual 
treatment received at a specific visit.   All samples for PK and ADA studies will also be saved 
for future safety or biomarkers analysis as deemed appropriate by Sun Pharmaceuticals.  A list 
of biomarkers is provided in Appendix 22.3. 
PK parameters may be used to refine previous PK models.

 16 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
16.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
All required study data must be entered in the eCRF created for the study.  This data collection 
tool is a validated electronic data capture (EDC) system that contains a system generated audit 
trail.  Data required acc ording to this protocol are recorded by investigational study site 
personnel via data entry into the internet based EDC software system.  The Investigator shall 
ensure that all data from subject visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with  
the specific instructions given.  The Investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data recorded.  All internal designated CRO  and external investigational study site 
personnel seeking access to the eCRF are supported by a Service Desk (if applicable).  At the 
end of the study all data captured electronically will be pro vided to the Investigator on 
CD-ROM for archiving at the investigational study site. 
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of t he 
documentation to be collated prior to study start.  It is essential that all samples be analyzed at 
the central  laboratory, unless otherwise specified (e.g., ESR). 
The Investigator must maintain source documents, such as laboratory reports, X -rays, ECGs, 
consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports.  All 
information in the eCRF must be traceable to the source documents in the subject’s file. 
16.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
The Investigator/institution should ma intain the study documents as specified in the ICH 
guidelines on GCP and as required by the applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
Investigator/institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents. 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2  years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2  years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP.  These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an 
agreement with the Sponsor.  It is the responsibility of the Sponsor  to inform the 
Investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

improvement from Baseline in both tender joints (68) and swollen joints (66) along with 
associated percentage improvements in 3 of 5 other items: 1) the PGA of disease a ctivity (as 
measured using a Visual Analog Scale [ VAS ]), 2) the Patient Global Assessment ( PtGA) of 
disease activit y (as measured using a VAS), 3)  patient pain assessment (as measured using a 
VAS), 4) patient self -assessed disability (as measured using the HAQ- DI), and 5) acute -phase 
C-reactive protein ( CRP )5.  A sensitivity analysis will be performed by evaluating 
ACR20/50/70 response calculated usin g ESR .

 22.2.1 Joint Counts 
In accordance with the parent studies, the measure used is the ACR joint count initially 
developed for th e assessment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis .  The ACR joint count of 
68 tender and 66 swollen joints count will continue to be used in this long -term study and 
includes the maj ority of joints affected in PsA subjects .  It includes the temporomandibular, 
sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, shoulder, elbow, wrist (including the carpometacarpal and 
intercarpal joints as 1 unit), metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal , distal 
interphalangeal , hip, knee, talotibial, midtarsal (including subtalar), metatarsophalangeal, and 
interphalangeal joints of the toes (proximal and distal joints of each toe is counted as 1 unit). 
22.2.2 Physici an Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
The treating physician will evaluate the status of the subject's disease  by means of a VAS.  The 
subject will be assessed according to how their current disease is.  The VAS will be anchored 
with verbal descriptors of "very good" to "very poor". 
22.2.3 Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity  
The subject will assess their current global status of PsA  by means of a VAS ("Conside ring all 
the ways your disease affects you, on average, how have you been doing today?"), anchored 
with verbal descriptors of "very well" to "very poorly". 
22.2.4 Patient Pain Assessment  
The subject will assess their level of present pain ("How much pain due to your arthritis are 
you currently experiencing?") using a VAS.  The subject will be asked to rate their pain at that 
time on the scale that is anchored with verbal descriptors of "no pain" to "worst possible pain".  
22.2.5 Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index  (HAQ -DI) 
The subject will assess their general disability over the past week using th e HAQ -DI 
questionnaire. 
The HAQ- DI is designed to assess subject s’ usual abilities using their usual equipment.  
Subject s usually find the HAQ -DI self -explanatory, and clarifications are seldo m required.  
There are 8 categories assessed by the HAQ -DI: 1) dressing and grooming, 2) arising, 3) eating, 
4) walking, 5) hygiene, 6) reach, 7) grip, and 8) common daily activities.  For each of these 
categories, subject s report the amount of difficulty they have in performing 2 or 3 specific 
activities.  The time frame for the disability questions is the PAST WEEK and each question 
can be scored as 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty) 
or 3 (unable to do).  The us e of aids and devices for these activities is also recorded.  Use of 
any device or aid will result in a minimum score of 2 for that category.  The score for the 
disability index is the mean of the 8 category scores.  If >2 of the categories, or 25%, are

 missing, the scal e is not scored.  If < 2 of the categories are missing, the sum of the categories 
is divided by the number of answered categories.  A higher score indicates greater disability. 
22.3 Biomarkers  
The Sponsor, SUN Pharma Global FZE (SUN) would like to perform additional analysis on 
the following remaining blood samples: • Samples collected to measure anti -drug antibodies (ADA) 
• Samples collected to measure how much study medicine is in your blood 
(pharmacokinetics, PK) 
Upon completion of ADA and PK analysis, samples will be used to analyze additional 
biomarkers  
Taking part in this optional biomarkers research is voluntary and subjects who sign amended informed consent will participate in Biomarker research. Samples will be destroyed once all 
the biomarkers tests have been completed.

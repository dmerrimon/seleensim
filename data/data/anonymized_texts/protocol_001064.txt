≥3 years old at screening in Study  115B who consent/assent to the optional LCI 
Substudy in Study  115B and Study  116) 
Observational Cohort  
Safety: Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
  
Statistical Analyses  Approximately 56  subjects are potentially eligible to be enrolled. Assuming a 
10% dropout rate in Study  115B, 50 subjects are expected to be enrolled in 
Study 116. 
Treatment Cohort  
The analysis will be performed over the Cumulative Study Period.  
Safety Analysis  
All treatment -emergent A E (TEAE) summaries will be described using the 
incidence of TEAEs and number of events per 100 patient -years (number of 
events adjusted for the total duration of exposure) for the Cumulative Study 
Period. 
Continuous safety endpoints will be summarized desc riptively at each visit during 
the Cumulative Study Period.  
For the categorical laboratory, vital, and ECG variables, the number and percentage of subjects in each category during the Treatment -emergent Period of 
the Cumulative Study Period will be summar ized. 
The safety analysis for the Cumulative Study Period will be based on the Safety Set, which will include all subjects who received at least 1  dose of study drug in 
Study 115B. 
Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
For all continuous PD endpoints, raw values and absolute change from 
Cumulative Study Baseline at each visit in the Cumulative Study Period will be summarized based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which includes all subjects who were enrolled and exposed to any amount of study drug in Study  115B. 
Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method based on the FAS for the Cumulative Study Period.  
The number of pulmonary exacerbations  starting during the Cumulative Study 
Period normalized by the time spent in the Cumulati ve Study Period will be 
summarized.  
The number of CF -related hospitalizations through last visit will be summarized 
similarly.  
Observational Cohort  
Listings will be provided for SAEs in Study 116 based on all subjects enrolled in the Observational Cohort.  
  
IDMC Reviews  An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be formed using the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Data Safety Monitoring Board. The IDMC objectives and operational details will be defined in a separate document (IDMC Charter), which will be finalized before the first subject is enrolled. The IDMC will conduct 
regular planned reviews of study data for the purpose of safety monitoring as outlined in the IDMC Charter.

a Assessments will be performed before LUM/IVA dosing unless noted otherwise.  
b If the ETT Visit occurs 10  days or later after the last dose of LUM/IVA, the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required (Section  9.1.2.3). Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue LUM/IVA treatment for AEs should be followed until the AE is considered resolved.  
c The Safety Follow-up Visit is required for 1)  subjects who complete their ETT Visit <10  days after the last dose of LUM/IVA (footnote  b and Section  9.1.2.3); and 2) subjects 
who interrupt LUM/IVA treatment and complete their Week  96 Visit <10 days after the last dose of LUM/IVA; it is not required for su bjects who continue onto 
commercially -available, physician -prescribed LUM/IVA  within 2 weeks (± 4 days) of completing LUM/IVA treatment at the Week 96 or ETT Visit.  
d For subjects at sites activated by the time of their Study  115B Safety Follow -up Visit, t heir Study  116 Day 1 Visit will be on the same day as their Study  115B Safety 
Follow-up Visit, and  any Study 116 Day 1 assessments that were specified to be performed at the Study  115B Safety Follow -up Visit do not need to be repeated. If the 
Study 116 Day 1 Visit does not coincide with the subject’s Study  115B Safety Follow -up Visit,  the subject will complete all Study  116 Day 1 assessments (except the OE if it 
was performed within the last 3 months before the visit). See Section  9.1.1 for details.  
e Telephone contacts will be made to assess the subject's status, any AEs, medications, treatments, and procedures.  
f If subjects can stand unassisted and follow directions, stature should be measured as height; otherwise, stature will be measured as length. Stature and weight must be 
measured with shoes off and while wearing light clothing. BMI will be derived from this assessment. See Section  11.4.3 for details.  
g The subject should rest for at least 5  minutes before having vital signs and pulse oximetry measured. See Section  11.6.4 for details.  
h  Vital signs will be measured predose and at 1  hour (± 15 minutes), 2  hours (± 15 minutes), and 4 hours (± 15 minutes) postdose on Day  1. 
i An OE will be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist. Subjects with documentation of bilateral lens removal do not need the OE. See Section 11.6.6 for details.  
j  Subjects may complete the OE within ± 1 week of the scheduled visit.  
k  An OE will be conducted at the Week  96 Visit (or the ETT Visit if the subject does not have a Week  96 Visit, unless the discontinuation is d ue to initiation of treatment 
 with commercially -available LUM/IVA), or the Safety Follow -up Visit. 
l Symptom-directed PEs will occur at any time during the study if triggered by AEs or if deemed necessary by the investigator . See Section  11.6.4 for details.  
m  An abbreviated PE will be performed 4 hours (± 30 minutes) postdose on Day  1. See Section  11.6.4 for details.

n A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed. The subject will be instructed to rest in the supine position for at least 5  minutes, if possible, before having an ECG performed. The  
ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as blood draws. See Section  11.6.5 for details.  
o See Section  11.6.2 for details.  
p See Section  11.4.7 for details.  
q Samples will be co llected at the study center during the study visit; however, samples may be collected by the subject up to 24 hours before the study visit (e.g.,  at home) and 
brought to the study visit (Section  11.4.5). The sample may be collected pre- or postdose.  
r The sweat chloride test will be conducted at approximately the same time as predose blood collections. At each time point, 2  samples will be collected,  1 sample from each arm 
(left and right). See Section  11.4.1 for details.  
s The LCI assessment (only subjects who are ≥3  years of age at Study  115B screening who consent/assent to the optional LCI Substudy in Study  115B and Study  116) should be 
performed pre -bronchodilator. See Sections  11.1 and 11.4.2 for details. The assessment will be performed in multiple replicates and before the spirometry assessment.  
t Spirometry (only subjects who are ≥3 years of age at Study  115B screening) should be performed pre -bronchodilator. See Sections  11.1 and 11.6.7 for details.  
u  Day 1 spirometry will be performed before LUM/IVA dosing and at 2 hours (± 30 minutes) and 4  hours (± 30 minutes) postdose.  
v Other events related to outcome include assessments relating to pulmonary exacerbations, administration of antibiotic therapy for sinopulmonary signs or symptoms,  and 
hospitalizations (Section  11.4.4). 
w LUM/IVA will be administered q12h (±  2 hours) within 30  minutes of consuming fat containing food (Section 9.6). On days of scheduled visits, the dose will be administered 
at the site after predose assessments have been completed. The last dose will be the dose administered before the Week  96 Visit. S ee Section  9.6 for dose determination details.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating 
morbidities and high premature mortality and at present, t here is no cure. CF affects 
approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide,1 with approximately 30,000 individuals in the 
US.1,2 Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted 
median age of survival for a person with CF is approximately 40 years.2-4 Although the disease 
affects mu ltiple organs, progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality.5 
CF is caused by a defect in the gene encoding CFTR, an epithelial chloride (Cl-) ion channel that 
is responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues.
6 This function is defective in patients with CF due to a loss of cell surface expression 
and/or function of CFTR. 
Lumacaftor (LUM; VX -809)/ivacaftor (IVA; VX-770) combination therapy (Orkambi™) is the 
first medicine designed to treat the underlying molecular defect and enhance the function of 
CFTR in patients homozygous for F508del . Orkambi is approved in the US for patients 6 years 
and older who are homozygous for F508del , and in the EU, Canada, Australia, and Switzerland 
for patients 12 years and older who are homozygous for F508del . The LUM/IVA development 
program is designed to support the hypothesis that an oral chronic treatment restoring CFTR function can lead to improved pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations of CF, prevent progressive lung damage, and ultimately prolong survival. 
Details about the LUM/IVA development program can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
7 
5.2 Study Rationale  
Approximately half of the total CF patient population is <18 years of age.8 Even before the 
widespread adoption of newborn screening, the majority of patients with CF were diagnosed in 
infancy or early childhood due to manifestations of the disease. Pancreatic destruction leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency begins in utero, and lung involvement is manifest by pulmonary inflammation and infection that begins shortly after birth.  
The primary objectives of St udy VX15 -809-115 (Study 115) are to obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and safety information to support a proposed indication expansion of LUM/IVA in subjects aged 
2 through 5 years, homozygous for F508del . The primary objective of Study VX16-809-116 
(Study 116) is to evaluate the long -term safety of LUM/IVA in subjects aged 2 years and older 
with CF, homozygous for F508del , who participated in Study 115.  
6 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
6.1 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the long -term safety of LUM/IVA combination therapy in subjec ts aged 2 years and 
older with CF, homozygous for F508del  
6.2 Secondary Objective  
To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of long- term LUM/IVA combination therapy in 
subjects aged 2  years and older with CF, homozygous for F508del

9 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
9.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase  3, open-label, multicenter study with a Treatment Cohort and an Observational 
Cohort (Figure 9-1).  
Procedural details are described in Sections  9.1.1 and 9.1.3. 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 20 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.1.1.2 Treatment Cohort  
Subjects at sites activated by the time of their applicable Study  115B visit (Section  9.1.1.1) may 
return within 1 calendar day to complete the remaining Day  1 assessments specific to Study  116 
(including administration of the Day  1 dose). Predose vital sign and spirometry assessments must 
be repeated before dosing on the following calendar day.  
Subjects who were enrolled but had Day 1 LUM/IVA administration procedures (Section 9.6) 
delayed more than 1  calendar day will repeat all assessments that were specified to be performed 
at the Day  1 visit before receiving their first dose of LUM/IVA ( except for the OE if it was 
performed within the last 3  months before the visit). 
9.1.2 Treatment Cohort  
9.1.2.1 Treatment Period  
To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions (Section 9.4). 
Treatment Period assessments are listed in  Table 3-1. Subjects will be outpatients during the 
Treatment Period. All visits should occur within the win dows specified. 
The Treatment Period is 96 weeks; LUM/IVA will be administered every 12  hours (q12h) from 
Day 1 through Week 96. The dose before the Week 96 Visit will be the last dose. Administration 
and management details are provided in Sections  9.6 and 10. 
Procedures for subjects who premat urely discontinue LUM/IVA treatment are described in 
Section 9.1.2.3. 
9.1.2.2 Follow-up  
The Safety Follow -up Visit is required for 1) subjects who complete their Early Termination of 
Treatment  (ETT) Visit <10  days after the last dose of LUM/IVA (Section  9.1.2.3); and 
2) subjects who interrupt LUM/IVA treatment and complete their Week  96 Visit <10 days after 
the last dose of LUM/IVA; it is not required for subjects who continue onto commercially -available, physician -prescribed  LUM/IVA within 2  weeks (±  4 days) of 
completing LUM/IVA treatment at the Week  96 or ETT Visit.  
The Safety Follow -up Visit is scheduled to occur 2 weeks (±  4 days) after the last dose of 
LUM/IVA. Safety Follow- up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-1.  
9.1.2.3 Early Termination of Treatment   
Subjects who prematurely discontinue LUM/IVA treatment will be asked to complete the ETT Visit as soon as possible after the last dose of LUM/IVA . The assessments to be completed are 
listed in Table 3-1. If the ETT Visit occurs 10 days or later following the last dose of LUM/IVA, 
then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, (i.e., the assessments performed will 
be those specif ied for the ETT Visit), and a Safety Follow-up Visit will not be required.  

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 21 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.1.3 Observational Cohort  
Observational Cohort assessments are listed in Table  3-2. The Observational Cohort will include 
the following: 
• Day 1 Visit  
• Long-term follow-up telephone c ontacts at Weeks  48 and 96 
Subjects who become eligible to receive commercially -available, physician -prescribed  
LUM/IVA, and who choose to continue onto commercially- available LUM/IVA, must have an 
Early Termination Telephone Contact to terminate their participation in the study.  
9.1.4 Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if both of the follow ing occur:  
• Subject misses 2  consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is 
subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3 documented attempts by telephone 
within 2 weeks following the second missed visit) 
• Subject does not respond within 2 weeks to a registered letter sent after the 3  attempted 
telephone contacts 
9.1.5 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be formed using the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Data Safety Monitoring Board. The IDMC objectives and operational details will be defined in a separate document (IDMC Charter), which will be finalized before the first subject is enrolled. The IDMC will conduct regular planned reviews of study data for the purpose of safety monitorin g as outlined in the IDMC Charter. 
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is an open-label study. Randomization is not required. Subjects in the Treatment Cohort will be treated with LUM/IVA based on their weight and age. Subjects in the Observational Cohort will not receive LUM/IVA.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
9.3.1 Study Design 
Vertex has established efficacy, safety, and PK profiles for LUM/IVA in subjects 12 years of age 
and older, homozygous for F508del  (Studies VX12 -809-103 [Study 103] and VX12-809-104 
[Study 104]). Because the underlying genetic and molecular etiology of the disease is identical between younger and older patients, and the outcome of therapy is likely to be comparable, extrapolation of efficacy from older to younger patients is appropriate and PK studies in younger patients, together with safety studies, can provide adequate information for use.
9  
Safety and PK profiles for LUM/IVA have been established in subjects 6 through 11 years of 
age, homozygous for F508del  (Study VX13 -809-011 [Study 011]). Study 115, a Phase 3, 2-part, 
open-label study, which includes a 24- week Treatment Period in Part  B, is designed to obtain PK 
and safety information to support a proposed indication expansion of LUM/IVA in subjects aged 2 through 5 years, homozygous for F508del . 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 22 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Study 116 is a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study in subjects aged 2 years and older with CF, 
homozygous for F508del, who participated in Study 115B. This study, which includes a 96- week 
Treatment Period, is designed to evaluate the long -term safety of LUM/IVA in subjects aged 
2 years and older with CF, homozygous for F508del . 
9.3.2 Study Drug Dose and Durat ion 
Dose of LUM/IVA  
Study 115A is designed to characterize the safety and PK of LUM and IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of age. The plasma concentration versus time data from Study  115A is intended to 
inform the appropriateness or necessary adjustment of planned doses for Study 115B and Study 116. As data from Study 115B become available, the doses may be modified for subjects <6 years of age in Study 116. A population PK model with allometric scaling of clearance and 
volume of distribution as a function of weight was used to project exposures of LUM and IVA for comparison with clinical experiences with both drugs and to select doses to be evaluated in this study population. No safety issues were identified in prior clinical or nonclinical studies that would preclude the dosing regimen proposed for Study 116.  
Duration of Dosing 
Subjects who receive LUM/IVA in Study 115B as well as Study 116 may receive treatment for up to approximately 2.5 years, thus providing information on the long- term safety of LUM/IVA 
in subjects aged 2 years and older with CF, homozygous for F508del . 
9.3.3 Rationale for Study Assessments  
The safety and PK assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug development and are generally recognized as reliab le, accurate, and relevant to the study of subjects with CF. 
OEs and spirometry assessments were added as part of safety monitoring. Assessments were added to evaluate the PD effects of LUM/IVA. The following PD assessments are standard assessments used in  studies in the LUM/IVA development program: weight, stature, BMI, sweat 
chloride, and other events related to outcome, e.g., pulmonary exacerbations. Rationale is provided below for the following PD assessments: LCI, exocrine pancreatic function, and microbiology. 
OEs: A juvenile rat toxicity study performed to support dosing of IVA in subjects <2 years of 
age demonstrated lens opacities in some animals.7 Prior studies in rats and dogs of older age did 
not demonstrate similar findings. Given substantial differences between human and rat lens development, the finding is of unlikely relevance to humans. Periodic OEs for pediatric subjec ts 
receiving IVA or IVA in combination with a CFTR corrector are being performed to confirm this interpretation. The overall data acquired to -date does not suggest an association between IVA 
treatment and cataract development; however, a potential associat ion has not been fully 
excluded.  
Spirometry: Spirometry is included as part of standard safety monitoring. Because the 
quantitative assessment of pulmonary function in young children is difficult, spirometry testing will be performed only on subjects who were ≥3 years of age at screening in Study 115B. Even with this age stipulation, it is anticipated that reproducible spirometry will be obtained in a minority of the study population. 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 23 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Optional LCI Assessment: LCI is a measure of ventilation  inhomogeneity that is based on tidal 
breathing techniques that have been evaluated in patients as young as infants.10,11 LCI correlates 
with FEV 1 in its ability to measure airway disease in patients with mild to moderate lung disease 
but can also detect lung disease at an earlier stage than spirometry.12,13 Data from 
Study VX10-770-106 in subjects with CF with an FEV 1 >90% showed LCI to be a more 
sensitive outcome measure than FEV 1. Given the potential advantages of a more sensitive 
measurement during the early stages of disease progression, LCI will be used  in this study. As 
with spirometry testing, performing LCI assessments in young children can be difficult.14 
Therefore, only subjects who were ≥3 years of age at screening in Study  115B and who 
consent/assent to the optional LCI Substudy will undergo the LCI assessments. LCI will be done 
only at selected sites that have the capability to perform these assessments.  
Exocrine Pancreatic Function: The pancreas is one of the earliest and most seriously affected 
organs in patients with CF who are homozygous for F508del , a high fraction of which develop 
pancreatic insufficiency.  
• FE-1: FE-1 is a diagnostic measure of pancreatic exocrine sufficiency, with a lack of elastase 
output in stool being considered indicative of CF (<200 µg/g). The increasing use of FE -1 in 
the clinic is a result of the ease of collecting samples for its assessment and the establishment of diagnostic cut-offs for pancreatic exocrine function.
15 FE-1 represents a feasible measure 
to evaluate exocrine pancreatic function durin g the study, with the hypothesis that rescue of 
pancreatic function will result in an increase in FE -1 levels. 
• IRT: Trypsinogen is a protein produced by the pancreas that can be detected in the blood via 
the IRT assay and is used in clinical practice for neonatal screening test for CF, wherein elevated levels are associated with disease. Blood samples for IRT testing will be collected at multiple time points to evaluate potential changes in exocrine pancreatic function during the Treatment Period.  
Microbiol ogy: Microbiological endpoints, such as bacterial colony counts and selection of 
resistant bacterial strains, are well -established endpoints used to evaluate antimicrobial therapies 
in CF. Because compounds, such as IVA , that restore CFTR function may incr ease hydration of 
airway secretions and lead to a decrease in acquisition of bacteria in the CF airway, acquisition of bacteria is included as another secondary endpoint in this study. Because the majority of subjects in this study will not expectorate spo ntaneously, oropharyngeal swabs will be used to 
obtain airway cultures. 
9.4 Study Restrictions  
See Section  9.5 for guidance for concomitant medications. 
A nonexhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for food and medication will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
9.5 Medications (Treatment Cohort Only)  
9.5.1 Prohibited Medications and Medications to Use With Caution 
Prohibited medications and certain foods are not allowed as summarized in  Table 9-1. 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 24 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table 9-1 Study Restrictions  
Restricted Medication/Food  Treatment Period  
Strong CYP3A inducers  None allowed  
Strong CYP3A inhibitors  Use with caution 
CYP: cytochrome P450  
Note: The use of restricted medication in subjects with a medical need will be addressed on a case- by-case basis 
with the medical monitor or authorized designee.  
Use of CYP3A substrates is not prohibited, but investigators need to be aware that LUM appears 
to be a strong inducer of CYP3A. Therefore, the efficacy of drugs extensively metabolized by CYP3A may be affected.  
Use of CYP2C and 2B6 substrates is not prohibited, but investigators need to be aware that LUM has been shown in vitro to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro . Additionally, in vitro studies suggest that 
IVA may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of LUM/IVA with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates.  
Each investigator should evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of using CYP3A, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates wi th LUM and IVA and discuss their use with the medical 
monitor or authorized designee. 
9.5.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
It is recommended that subjects remain on a stable medication regimen for their CF from 
Study 115B through the Safety Follow- up Visit in  Study 116. Stable medication regimen is 
defined as the current medication regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 
28 days before Day  1 of Study 115B.  
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator should have their LCI and spirometry asses sments 
performed according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.6.7. 
Information regarding all prior and concomitant medications, including the subject’s CF 
medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies administered at, or after, 
the Safety Follow -up Visit in Study  115B through the Safety Follow- up Visit of this study will 
be recorded in each subject ’s source documents. In addition, concomitant medication dose(s) 
may be collected.  
9.6 Administration  
LUM/IVA will be administered orally as shown in Table 9-2. Subjects in the Observational 
Cohort will not receive LUM/IVA. 
At each study visit the LUM/IVA dose for each subject will be reassessed based on age and body 
weight and adjusted upward if necessary.

a No downward dose adjustments will be made if a subject’s weight decreases. Doses may be adjusted upward as follows:  
• If a subject who is <6 years of age at enrollment enters weighing <14 kg and subsequently weighs ≥14 kg at 2 consecutive 
visits without becoming ≥6 years of age at these visits, the dose will be adjusted to LUM  150 mg/IVA 188 mg q12h, at the 
second visit where weight ≥14 kg.  
• If a subject who is <6 years of age at enrollment becomes 6 years of age during the study, the dose and formulation will be 
adjusted to LUM 200 mg/IVA 250 mg q12h administered as tablets for oral administration, regardless of weight, at the 
next scheduled visit.  
b Doses are those planned for Study  115B. Based on results from Study  115A and 115B, doses for subjects <6 years of age in 
Study 116 may be modified.  
LUM/IVA will be administered within 30  minutes from the start of consuming fat-containing 
food such as a standard “CF” high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack according to the following 
guidelines: 
1. LUM/IVA will be administered approximately q12h (± 2 hours) on each dosing occasion 
(e.g., if the morning dose is administered at 0800 on Day 1, the evening dose on Day 1 
should be administered between 1800 and 2200 and all subsequent morning doses should be 
administered between 0600 and 1000). 
2. The granule formulation will be dispensed by opening the stick packs containing the granules and mixing the granules with the approved foods and liquids listed in the S tudy Reference 
Manual. Each dose will be comprised of the approved food or liquids into which the granules from the stick packs are mixed. Details on preparing LUM/IVA will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
3. On the Day  1 Visit, all subjects will be observed for 4 hours after the first dose of LUM/IVA.  
4. On days of scheduled visits ( Table 3-1), with the exception of afternoon visits addressed 
below, the morning LUM/IVA dose will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been  completed.  
5. If a subject ’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used for administering either the morning or evening dose: 
• If the dose in the clinic will be within 6  hours of the subject’s scheduled morning 
LUM/IVA  dose, the subject should withhold their morning dose and the morning dose 
will be administered in the clinic.  
• If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6  hours after the subject’s scheduled morning 
LUM/IVA dose, the subject should take the morning dose at home and the evening dose 
will be administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected relative to the evening dose. 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 26 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   6. For visits after the Day  1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused 
LUM/IVA  materials to the site; LUM/IVA will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 
7. At the Week  96 Visit, the LUM/IVA dose will NOT be administered. The last LUM/IVA 
dose will be the dose administered before the Week  96 Visit.  
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
Modifications of the LUM/IVA dose are prohibited. Should any unacceptable toxicity arise, 
individual subjects will be withdrawn from the study treatment.  
9.8 Removal of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request or at the request of thei r 
legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian). Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed as noted in Sections  9.1.2.2 and 9.1.2.3, provided the subject /caregiver  has not withdrawn consent.   
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject’s parent or legal guardian. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject’s parent or legal guardian return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety Follow- up Visit, if applicable (see 
Sections 9.1.2.2 and 9.1.2.3), and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs. 
If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations will be performed and no additional data will be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 
9.9 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn during the Treatment Period will not be replaced. 
10 STUDY DRUG INFORMATION AND MANAG EMENT

10.4 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information regarding the dates and 
amounts of (1) study drug received; (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects; and (3) study drug returned by the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee until inventoried by the study monitor. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the study. 
10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug 
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until 
the study monitor has performed drug accountability. At the end of the study, the study monitor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. If the study monitor authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. 
10.6 Compliance  
To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing 
that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject/caregiver of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count. 
If a subject/caregiver demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite 
educational efforts, the investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss 
discontinuation of the subject from the study treatment while remaining in the study.  

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 28 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   10.7 Blinding and Unblinding 
This will be an open-label study. However, subjects and their legally appointed and authorized 
representative (e.g., parent or legal gu ardian) should not be informed of their study- related 
spirometry, sweat chloride, and LCI results during the study even if the subject permanently discontinued treatment.  
11 ASSESSMENTS 
11.1 Timing of Assessments  
The timing of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2.  
Additional timing notes for LCI  and spirometry 
LCI assessments derived from N 2-multiple-breath washout (MBW) testing (Section  11.4.2) 
should be performed before the spirometry assessment (Section 11.6.7). MBW and spi rometry 
testing should be performed pre-bronchodilator, which is defined as testing performed for subjects who have 
• withheld their short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g., Atrovent
®) 
for more than 4 hours before the testing; 
• withheld their long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) more than 12 hours before the 
testing; and  
• withheld their once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) 
for more than 24 hours before the testing.  
If a subject forg ets to withhold bronchodilator(s), testing should be performed as follows: 
• If a subject ’s Day 1 testing is pre-bronchodilator, but on a subsequent visit, the subject 
forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, post-bronchodilator testing will be obtained for t hat 
visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled. 
• If on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold their dose of bronchodilator, testing should be performed post-bronchodilator and all subsequent testing should be performed 
post-bronchodilator. 
• Each test will be recorded in the source documents as pre-bronchodilator or 
post-bronchodilator. 
11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics  
Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, stature, and weight. Select demographic and  baseline characteristic data and medical history will be 
derived from the previous study. 
Age, sex, race, and ethnicity will be derived from the previous study because these data are 
required for the normalization of spirometry values using the Global Lun g Function Initiative  
(GLI) method (Section 11.6.7).  
11.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Not applicable 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 29 of 55

11.4.1 Sweat Chloride  
Collection of sweat samples will be performed using an approved collection device. Sweat 
samples will be sent to a central laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Individual sweat chloride test results will not be disclosed to the study sites . Specific instructions for 
collection, handling, processing, and shipping of sweat chloride samples to the central laboratory will be provided separately. The sweat chloride test will be conducted at approximately the same time as predose blood collections. At each time point, 2  samples will be collected, 1  sample from 
each arm (left and right).  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study- related sweat chloride 
results during the study even if the subject prematurely discontinued treatment.  
11.4.2 Lung Clearance Index  
LCI assessments derived from N
2-MBW testing  will be performed only on subjects who are 
≥3 years of age at Study  115B screening and who consent/assent to the optional LCI Substudy in 
Study 115B and Study 116.  
MBW should be performed “pre- bronchodilator.” See Section  11.1 for pre-bronchodilator 
definitions and instructions if a subject forgets to withhold bronchodil ator(s).  
Each MBW will be performed in multiple replicates  at each visit, and the final LCI value will be 
calculated from the technically acceptable washout replicates.  
Detailed LCI procedures will be supplied in the S tudy Reference Manual. 
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study- related LCI results 
during the study even if the subject prematurely discontinued treatment. 
11.4.3 Weight, Stature, and BMI  
See Section  11.6.4. 
11.4.4 Other Events Related to Outcome  
11.4.4.1 Antibiotic Therapy for Sinopulmonary Sign/Symptoms  
Given the absence of a consensus definition for pulmonary exacerbation in clinical studies in this 
population, the definition below will be applied to signs and symptoms for the analysis of pulmonary exacerbations.  
Definition: New or changed treatment with oral, inhaled, or intravenous ( IV) antibiotics AND 
fulfillment of 1  criterion from List A (below) or 2  criteria from List B (below) , within the period 
3 days before antibiotic start date through antibiotic stop date.16 
The occurrence of any new or changed antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, oral) and the presence of the following signs and symptoms will be recorded in the source documents:  
List A:  
• Decrease in FEV
1 ≥10% change from highest value in the past 6 months before the first dose, 
unresponsive to albuterol (if applicable)  
• Oxygen saturation <90% on room air or  ≥5% decrease from baseline  

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 30 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • New lobar infiltrate(s) or atelectasis on chest x -ray 
• Hemoptysis (more than streaks on more than 1 occasion in past week)  
List B: 
• Increased work of breathing or respiratory rate (duration ≥3 days) 
• New or increased adventitial sounds on lung examination (duration ≥3 days) 
• Weight loss ≥5% decrease from highest value or decrease across 1 major percentile for age in 
past 6 months  
• Increased cough (duration ≥3 days)  
• Worked harder to breathe during physical activity (duration ≥3 days)  
• Increased chest congestion or change in sputum (duration ≥3 days)  
It is recommended that LUM/IVA should not be interrupted during a pulmonary exacerbation 
unless, in the opinion of the investigator, it would be in the best interest of the subject. 
The following information will be determined for protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations: 
• Number of pulmonary exacerbations 
• Number of days with pulmonary exacerbations 
• Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation  
• Number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalizations 
• Number of days hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbations 
• Time-to-first hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation 
• Number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotic therapy  
• Number of days on IV antibiotic therapy for pulmonary exacerbations 
• Time-to-first IV antibiotic therapy for pulmonary exacerbations 
11.4.4.2 Hospitalization for CF 
Subjects will be queried about planned and unplanned hospitalizations lasting ≥24 hours. The 
dates for hospitalizations and the reasons for hospitalizations will be documented. 
If the hospitalization is unplanned, the procedures for safety reporting should also be followed 
(Section 13.1.2.3).  
The following information will be determined:  
• Number of planned hospitalizations for CF (i.e., prophylactic antibiotic therapy) 
• Number of all unplanned hospitalizations 
• Number of days of all unplanned hospitalizations 
• Time-to-first unplanned hospitalization

11.4.8 Spirometry  
See Section  11.6.7. 
11.5 Efficacy  
All efficacy -related assessments are listed in Section  11.4, Pharmacodyna mics. 
11.6 Safety 
Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry, coagulation studies, and urinalysis) , clinical evaluation of vital signs, pulse oximetry,  ECGs, 
PEs, spirometry, and OEs. 
11.6.1 Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. 
Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for 
documenting, grading, and reporting AEs. A separate document that details AE case report form (CRF) completion guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided.  
11.6.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The safety laboratory test panels are shown in  Table 11-1. Additional clinical laboratory 
evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate. Laboratory 
test results that are abnormal and considered clinically significant will be reported as AEs (see Section 13.1).

a If urinalysis results are positive for  leukocyte esterase, nitrite, protein, or blood, microscopic examination of 
urine will be performed and results will be provided for leukocytes, erythrocytes, crystals, bacteria, and casts.  
For purposes of study conduct and data analysis, blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a 
central laboratory. However, at the discretion of the local investigator, samples may be analyzed at a local laboratory for management of urgent medical issues, including if a subject cannot return to the clinical study site f or the mandatory liver function testing (Section 11.6.3). If a local 
laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject 
was hospitalized elsewhere), the invest igator may base the assessment of an AE on the local 
laboratory value. 
11.6.3 Elevation of Liver Function Test Parameters  
Mandatory Liver Function Testing 
Liver function testing ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [ AST], 
gamma-glutamyl tra nsferase [ GGT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP] , and total bilirubin) must be 
performed while subjects are receiving LUM/IVA treatment (see Table 3-1 and Section 11.6.2). 
These blood samples should be processed and shipped immediately per the L aboratory Manual. 
Subjects with new ALT or AST elevations of ≥3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and clinical 
symptoms will be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by the 
central laboratory within 48  to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of 
ALT and AST levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject cannot return to t he site for liver 
function testing, a local laboratory may be used. Elevations in LFTs (ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN) at the local laboratory must be reported immediately to the medical monitor AND the subject must 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 33 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 
72 hours). 
Study Drug Interruption  
LUM/IVA administration must be interrupted immediately, and the Vertex medical monitor or 
designee must be notified if any of the following criteria is met:  
• ALT or AST ≥8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN in association with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression.  
Resumption of Study Drug 
If a convincing alternative etiology is identified for the elevated liver tests (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin), LUM/IVA  may be resumed when levels return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, 
whichever is higher. Approval of the Vertex medical monitor or designee is required before resumption of LUM/IVA . Upon resumption of LUM/IVA , transaminases should be assessed 
weekly for 4  weeks. If a protocol-defined liver test elevation occurs within 4 weeks of 
rechallenge with LUM/IVA, then LUM/IVA must be discontinued, regardless of the presumed 
etiology. 
Discontinuation of Study Drug 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol ingestion) for the elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels have improved, LUM/IVA  treatment must be discontinued, after consul ting with the Vertex 
medical monitor or authorized designee. Subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases should have their transaminases monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline.  
11.6.4 Physical Examinations and Vit al Signs  
A physical examination (PE) of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at select study visits (see  Table 3-1). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom- directed 
vital sign assessments can be performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider
. 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head , neck, and thyroid; eyes , ears, nose, and 
throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as 
AEs. 
An abbreviated PE will be performed at some visits (see Table 3-1). The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: head/neck/thyroid, EENT, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, skin, and abdomen. 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, 
respiration rate, and pulse oximetry. The subject should rest for at least 5 minutes before having 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 34 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   vital signs measured; additional instructions will be included in a separate Study Reference 
Manual. 
Weight and stature will be assessed and BMI will be derived. If subjects can stand unassisted and follow directions, stature should be measured as height; otherwise, stature will be measured as length. Stature and weight must be measured with shoes off and while wearing light clothing. BMI will be calculated using the following equation:  
BMI (kg/m
2) = body weight ( kg) ÷ stature2 (m2) 
11.6.5 Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout. Standard 12- lead ECGs 
will be performed with central over-reading. All sites will be provided with ECG machine(s) and associated materials by the central ECG diagnostic service.   
Additional standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. 
The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supine positio n for at least 5  minutes, if possible, 
before having an ECG performed. 
• The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as 
blood draws. 
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator an d maintained 
with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through the end of study participation will be recorded as AEs.  
A hard copy of the ECG will be printed and signed by the investigator at the site. To ensure the 
safety of the subjects, the investigator or designee at the investigator site will make comparisons to the predose measurement at Day  1 (baseline). If the QTcF is increased by >45  msec from the 
shortest baseline QTcF or the absolute QTcF valu e is >500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 
2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original 
measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from baselin e or >500  msec), a single ECG must be repeated at least 
hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.  
If the QTc value remains above the threshold value (>45  msec from baseline or >500 msec) on 
repeated measurement or is noted on 2 or more occasions with no identified alternative etiology for the increased QTc, then discontinuation from LUM/IVA treatment may be required after discussion with the Vertex medical monitor or designee. Subje cts who have treatment 
discontinued for increased QTcF should have their QTcF monitored closely until it normalizes or returns to baseline. 
ECG data will be transmitted via modem to the central ECG diagnostic service. A cardiologist at 
the central ECG diagnostic service will review each ECG to confirm if intervals were calculated correctly and to provide an interpretation including a suggested clinical significance, as applicable. A report containing this information will be provided to the site for review and signature by the investigator. This report will be filed with the machine ECG report for each time point in the subject’s source documents. The values reported by the central ECG diagnostic service will be used for data analysis.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   11.6.6 Ophthalmologic Examina tion 
The OE includes 
• measurement of best corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and  
• pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp . 
OEs must be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist. Subjects with documentation of bilateral 
lens removal do not need the OE. 
If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and determined to be clinically significant by a licensed ophthalmologist at the Day  1 OE, the subject/caregiver will be notified. After discussion with the 
site principal investigator, and in collaboration with the Vertex medical monitor, the subject/caregiver may elect to participate or not to participate in the study. If the subject continues in the study, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered. 
If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and determined to be clinically significant by a licensed 
ophthalmologist after dosing, the subject/caregiver will be notified. After discussion with the site principal investigator and in collaboration with the Vertex medical monitor, the subject/caregiver may elect to continue or discontinue LUM/IVA. If the subject discontinues LUM/IVA, the subject will be asked to remain in the study and complete the study assessments as noted in Section 9.1.2.3. If the subject continues, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be 
considered. 
Additional OEs may be conducted at the discretion of the investigator. The Vertex medical 
monitor or designee should be notified of any additional OEs. 
11.6.7 Spirometry  
Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines.
17 
Spirometry will be performed only on subjects who are ≥3 years of a ge at screening of 
Study 115B.  
Spirometry should be performed “pre-bronchodilator.” See Section  11.1 for pre -bronchodilator 
definitions and instructions if  a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s). 
The parameters listed below will be normalized using the standards of GLI.18 
• FEV1 (L) 
• Forced vital capacity (FVC) (L)  
• FEV1/FVC (ratio)  
• Forced expiratory flow (FEF 25%-75%) (L/s) 
The central spirometry  service will provide all sites with spirometers and associated materials to 
be used for all study assessments. Spirometry data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry 
service for quality review.  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be in formed of their study- related spirometry 
results during the study even if the subject prematurely discontinued treatment.

For the Treatment Cohort, all individual subject data will be presented in data listings based on All Subjects Set.  
For the Observational Cohort, listings will be provided only for disposition, demographics, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Listings will be provided based on all subjects enrolled in the Observational Cohort.  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using descriptive summary statistics: number of 
subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), median, minimum value, and 
maximum value.  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline value:  
• Baseline of Cumulative Study Period:  
The baseline value is defined as the most recent non -missing measurement before intake of 
the first dose of study drug in Study 115B. 
o For LCI-related parameters, the values at each visit will be calculated from the 
technically acceptable washout replicates. The baseline of LCI will be the most recent 
non-missing value calculated from the technically acceptable replicates before the initial 
administration of study drug of Study 115B. 
o For sweat chloride, the values at each visit will be based on the averaged measurements from left and right arms. The baseline will be defined as the average of the values at screening and the pretreatment measurement on Day  1 of Study 115B. If only 1 pre- first 
dose measurement of sweat chloride is av ailable, that measurement will be considered the 
baseline. 
Change (Absolute Change) from baseline  will be calculated as post baseline value − baseline 
value. 
Relative change from baseline will be calculated and presented in percentage as 100  × (post 
baseline value − baseline value)/baseline value.

13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
13.1.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed.  

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 45 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  13.1.2.1.  
13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In  the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Gr ade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value 
will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the following time points: 
• Withdrawal of consent 
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up Visit 
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow- up Visit, the earliest of  
o 18 days after the last dose of study drug, or 
o the ETT Visit, if that visit is 10  days or later following the last dose of study drug (see 
Section 9.1.2.3) 
NOTE: Only SAEs will be collected for the Observational Cohort. 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 46 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
September  2016). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life- threatening.” In 
considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, t he investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
13.1.1.5 Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 
Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality 
Classification  Definition  
Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re- exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 47 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to th e AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  
Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/Resolved With 
Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
13.1.1.8 Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospitalization, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 48 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of 
the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’ s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF , the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex 
Global Patient Safety  (GPS). In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow- up Visit 
and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours. 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 49 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not 
resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 
13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, 
regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to r eport follow-up information on previously 
reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email:  (preferred choice)  
Fax:   
Contact Telephone:  
13.1.2.4 Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities and participating investigators in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements, as applicable. In addition, Vertex, or authorized designee, will be responsible for the submission of safety letters to central independent ethics committees (IECs).  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to promptly notify the local institutional review board ( IRB)/local IEC of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to 
human subjects. 
13.2 Administrative Requirements  
13.2.1 Ethical Considerations 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current ICH GCP Guidelines, which are 
consistent with the e thical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki, and in accordance 
with local applicable laws and regulations. The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study documentation to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of the subjects. The study w ill only 
be conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’ s 
Brochure, sample ICF, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the subjects (including diary cards), safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC by the investigator or Vertex, as allowable by local applicable laws and regulations. 
13.2.2 Subject Information and Informed Consent  
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject or legal representative or guardian (if applicable), and assent will be obtained from the subject (if applicable), before study participation. The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and assent (if applicable) and the contents of the consent will comply with 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 50 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   ICH GCP and all applicable laws and regulations and will be subject to approval by Vertex or its 
designee. 
13.2.3 Investigator Compliance  
No modifications to the protocol will be made without the approval of both the investigator and 
Vertex. Changes that significantly affect the safety of the subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (i.e.,  efficacy assessments) will require IRB/IEC notification 
before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the required regulatory authorities. 
When circumstances require an immediate departure f rom procedures set forth in the protocol, 
the investigator will contact Vertex to discuss the planned course of action. If possible, contact 
will be made before the implementation of any changes. Any departures from the protocol will be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log.  
13.2.4 Access to Records  
The investigator will make the office and/or hospital records of subjects enrolled in this study 
available for inspection by Vertex or its representative at the time of each monitoring visit and for audits. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copying, as required by applicable laws and regulations, by officials of the regulatory health authorities (FDA and others). The investigator will comply with applicable privacy and security laws for use and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol.  
13.2.5 Subject Privacy  
To maintain subject confidentiality and to comply with applicable data protection and privacy 
laws and r egulations, all CRFs, study reports, and communications relating to the study will 
identify subjects by assigned subject numbers and access to subject names linked to such numbers shall be limited to the site and the study physician and shall not be disclo sed to Vertex. 
As required by applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which the study is being conducted, the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the CRFs/SAE forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including the IRB/IEC, may also request access to all study records, including source documentation, for inspection. 
For sites participating in the study in the US, and in accordance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and associated regulations an executed HIPAA 
authorization shall be obtained by the site from each subject (or the legal representative of the subject) before research activities may begin. Each HIPAA authorization shall comply with all HIPAA requirements including authorization allowing the site access to and use of the subject’s personally identifiable health information, authorization for the site to disclose such information to Vertex, the FDA, and other parties requiring access under the protocol, and statements as to the purpose for which such information may be used and for how long. 
13.2.6 Record Retention  
The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH  GCP guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical 

Protocol VX16-809-116, Version 1.1 Page 51 of 55 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of  keeping the study 
records, custody will be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and Vertex 
will be notified.  
13.2.7 Study Termination 
At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this study at any particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRBs/IECs may 
terminate the study at their center.  
Conditions that may lead to reasonable cause and warrant termination include, but are not limited 
to: 
• Subject or investigator noncompliance 
• Unsatisfactory subject enrollment 
• Lack of adherence to protocol procedures 
• Lack of evaluable and/or complete data  
• Potentially unacceptable risk to study subjects  
• Decision to modify drug development plan 
• Decision by the FDA or other regulatory authority 
Written notification that includes the reason for the clinical study termination is required.  
13.3 Data Quality Assurance  
Vertex or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the qualifications 
of each investigator, inspe ct clinical study site facilities, and inform the investigator of 
responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation. 
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into a CRF by study site personnel using a secure, validated, web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application.  Vertex 
will have read -only access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database.  
13.4 Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to comply with GCP guidelines. On- site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for co mpleteness and 
clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be 
performed.  
The study will be monitored by Vertex or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal visits from a representative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13.5 Electronic Data Capture  
Vertex will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC application 
sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct information in the CRFs on the 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
A CRF will be completed for each enrolled study subject. It is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject ’s 
CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’ s participation in 
the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information and the date and time of any correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, including any changes made to the CRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival CRF 
in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator ’s study file. 
13.6 Publications and Clinical Study Report  
13.6.2 Clinical Study Report

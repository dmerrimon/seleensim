Original protocol 02 July  2021
This amendment incorporates all revisions to date, including amendments made at the 
request of country  health authorities and IRBs/ECs and any  protocol administrative 
clarification letter.
Amendment 2 ( 25-January - 2022)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment: 
Considering the high anti -SARS -CoV -2 antibody  seropositivity  rate observed in 
Study C4671006 participants recruited to date, the lower -than
-expected event rate 
(symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR), efficacy  data from 
Study C4671005, and emerging data on the Omicron variant of the SARS -CoV -2 virus, this 
amendment includes updates to the definition for the primary endpoint events, the timing of 
the interim anal ysis and associated statistica l considerations, assumptions for sample size 
estimation, and a provision to permit enrollment of previousl y vaccinated participants.

Updated the secondary objective 
and secondary endpoint to assess 
viral titers in participants with a 
positive RT -PCR result at baseline.Updated to reduce the possibility 
of missing a laboratory 
confirmed SARS -CoV -2 
infection (and therefore a 
potential primary endpoint 
event) possibly related to 
participant swab collect ion 
methodology.

antivirals that have received EUA 
in the US and EU.
Updated benefit assessment. To describe treatment options 
for COVID -19 in patients at 
high risk of progression to 
severe COVID -19.
To support the potential 
benefit of treatment and 
postexposure prophylaxis. 
Section 5.2. Exclusion 
CriteriaUpdated Exclusion Criteria #1 to 
exclude participants with a prior 
documented infection within 
6months of the screening visit. 
Also updated Exclusion Criterion 
# 14 to exclude participants who 
received any SARS -CoV -2 
vaccine within 6 months prior to 
screening or were expected to 
receive a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine, 
or other approved, authorized, or 
investigational postexposure 
prophylaxis treatment through 
Day 38.
For Exclusion Criterion #13, 
specified that participants who 
have received app roved, 
authorized, or investigational 
anti-SARS -CoV -2 mAb, 
convalescent plasma, other drugs 
for treatment of COVID -19, or

products within 6 months of 
screening would be excluded.
Added clarification to Exclusion 
Criterion #7 to align with the 
exclusion criterion in Appendix 
11. Updated Exclusion 
Criterion #1 because emerging 
data related to the omicron 
variant suggest a higher risk 
for reinfection with 
SARS -COV -2 and that 
protection afforded by current 
vaccines against sympto matic 
infection due to the omicron 
variant wanes after several 
months. Exclusion Criterion 
#14 has been updated to allow 
participants who have been 
previously vaccinated to be 
enrolled because they may 
benefit from postexposure 
prophylaxis.
T
o facilitate i nclusion of 
previously infected 
participants who may have 
been treated with a product 
that could confound efficacy 
assessments.
Updated Exclusion Criterion 
#7 to reflect changes from the

Evaluate The Safet y And Efficacy  Of 2 Regimens Of Orall y Administered 
PF-07321332/Ritonavir In Preventing S ymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 Infection I n Adult 
Household Contacts Of An Individual With Sy mptomatic COVID -19.
Brief Title: A Phase 2/3 Postexposure Prophy laxis Study  of PF -07321332/Ritonavir in Adult 
Household Contacts of an I ndividual with Sy mptomatic COVID -19
Rationale
The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of PF -07321332/ritonavir as 
postexposure prophy laxis for adult household contacts of an individual with sy mptomatic 
COVID -19.
Objectives, Endpoints, and Estimands
Objectives Endpoints Estimands
Primary: Primary: Primary: 
To compare the efficacy of 5 -day 
and 10 -day regimens of 
PF-07321332/ritonavir versus 
placebo in preventing 
symptomatic RT -PCR or rapid 
antigen test -confirmed 
SARS -CoV -2 infection in adult 
participants who have a negative 
RT-PCR result at baseline and 
who are household contacts of an 
individual with symptomatic 
COVID -19. Of theparticipants who have a negative 
RT-PCR result at baseline:
Proportion of participants wh o 
develop a symptomatic, RT-PCR or 
rapid antigen test -confirmed 
SARS -CoV -2 infection through 
Day 14.The risk reduction between 5-day 
and 10 -day regimens of 
PF-07321332/ritonavir versus 
placebo in the proportion of 
individuals who develop 
symptomatic RT -PCR or rapid 
antigen test -confirmed 
SARS -CoV -2 infection through 
Day 14 in adults who have a 
negative RT -PCR result at 
baseline and are household 
contacts of an individual with 
symptomatic COVID -19. This 
will be estimated without regard 
to adherence to ran domized 
treatment.
Secondary: Secondary: Secondary: 
To describe the safety and

Overall Design
Brief Summary
This Phase 2/3, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , placebo- controlled study  in 
approximately  2880 participants who have a negative screening SARS- CoV -2 rapid antigen 
test result and who are asymptomatic household contacts of individuals who are s ymptomatic 
and recently  tested positive for SARS -CoV -2 (index case: defined as patient with 
symptomatic COVID -19) will compare the efficacy
 of 2 regimens of PF -07321332/ritonavir 
versus placebo. Index cases may  be participants in Phase 2/3 safet y and efficacy s tudies of 
PF-07321332/ritonavir (C4671002 and C4671005), but this is not required. Eligible 
participants for this study will be randomly  assigned (1:1:1) within 96 hours after collection 
of the index case’s first positive SARS -CoV -2 test to treatment in 1 of 3 intervention groups. 
Randomization will be stratified based on the presence of risk factors associated with severe 
COVID -19 illness and geographic region at screening.

Page 17Number of Participants
Assuming approximately 5% of participants will have a positive RT-PCR result at baseline, 
and assuming an approximately  10% dropout rate, the total sample size for this study  will be 
approximately  2880 participants . 
Note: "Enrolled" means a participant's, or his or her legally  authorized representative’s, 
agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent 
process and screening. A participant will be considered enrolled if the informed consent is 
not withdrawn prior to participating in an y study activity  after screening. Potential 
participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility  for the study , but do 
not participate in the study, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified b y the 
protocol. 
Intervention Grou ps and Duration
Eligible participants for this study  (C4671006) will be randomly  assigned (1:1:1) within 
96hours after collection of the index case’s first positive SARS -CoV -2 test to receive: 
PF-07321332/ritonavir q12h for 5 day s followed by  matching pl acebo q12h for 
5days; or
PF-07321332/ritonavir q12h for 10 day s; or 
Matching placebo for PF -07321332/ritonavir q12h for 10 day s.
Participants will be screened within 24 hours before randomization. The total duration of the 
study  is up to 42 day s and incl udes screening, study  intervention through Day 10, efficacy  
assessments through Day 14, and a safet y follow- up period through Day 38[±3days].
Data Monitoring Committee or Other Independent Oversight Committee: Yes
An independent E -DMC will review unblinded data to ensure the safet y of participants on an 
ongoing basis throughout the duration of the study. I n addition to up to weekly  reviews of 
safet y data, the E -DMC will review the following:
Sentinel cohort safet y review : The E -DMC will review unbl inded safet y data after 
approximately  the first 150 participants have completed Day 10 of the study , at which 
point enrollment will be paused pending E -DMC review of the safety data. After 
review of the sentinel cohort, the frequency  of safety  reviews may  be reduced 
subsequently  based on E -DMC recommendations.
Interim anal ysis: An interim analy sis will be conducted for efficacy , futility , and 
sample size re- estimation and reviewed b y the E -DMC after a prespecified accrual of 
participants (ie, before or at a pproximately  70% overall participants have completed

Statistical Methods
For the primary  efficacy  anal ysis, GEE will be used to anal yze the proportion of participants 
with a negative RT -PCR result at baseline who develop a s ymptomatic RT -PCR or rapid 
antigen test -confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection through Day  14 for each treatment group. 
Comparisons between 5 -day regimen of PF -07321332/ritonavir ve rsus placebo group and 10-
day regimen of PF -07321332/ritonavir versus placebo group will be presented as risk 
reduction with 95% CIs based on GEE anal ysis.
Based on the results from Study  C4671005, which showed PF -07321332/ritonavir treatment 
significantl y reduced the risk of hospitalization or death from an y cause b y 89% compared 
with placebo in nonhospitalized sy mptomatic adult participants with COVID -19 who were at 
increased risk of progression to severe disease when they  were treated within 3 day s of 
symptom onset, and the high relative risk reduction (approximately  80%) observed in 
Regeneron REGEN -COV post -exposure proph ylaxisstudy , the risk reduction between 
PF-07321332/ritonavir group versus placebo group is assumed to be 70%. The sy mptomatic 
infecti on rate assumption in the placebo group is adjusted to 4% based on the observed 
seropositivity  rate in this study  and the impact of seropositivity  on the incidence of primary  
endpoint events in the REGEN -COV post- exposure proph ylaxis study  where the incide nce of 
symptomatic infection was 2% in participants who were seropositive and 8% in those who 
were seronegative .2
Among baseline RT -PCR negative participants, assuming an 4% s ymptomatic infection rate 
in the placebo group, a 70% reduction in s ymptomatic infection ( 1.2% s ymptomatic infection 
rate) in the PF -07321332/ritonavir group (5
-day and 10 -day regimen), a sample size of 
821participants per group ( 2463 participants total) will provide approximately  90% power 
for each comparison between 5 -day and 10- day regimens of PF -07321332/ritonavir group 
versus placebo group under a 2 -sided t ype-1 error rate of 5%. Assuming ap proximately  5% 
of participants with negative rapid antigen test at screening will have a positive RT- PCR 
result at baseline, and assuming an approximately  10% dropout rate, the total sample size for 
this study  will be approximately  2880 participants.
An interim anal ysis will be conducted for efficacy, futility , and sample size re - estimation and 
reviewed b y an independent E- DMC after a prespecified accrual of participants (ie, before or 
at approximately  70% overall participants have completed the Day 14 asse ssments with a 
minimum number of 24 participants having s ymptomatic infection [mITT anal ysis set] ).

Page 302.INTRODUCTION
PF-07321332, a potent and selective SARS- CoV -2 3CL  protease inhibitor, is being 
investigated as oral antiviral postexposure prophy laxis for adult household contacts of an 
individual with sy mptomatic COVID -19.
2.1.Study Rationale 
The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of PF -07321332/ritonavir as 
postexposure prophy laxis for adult household contacts of an individual with sy mptomatic 
COVID -19.
2.2.Back ground 
In December 2019, COVID -19 was identified as a new, potentially  fatal, respiratory  infection 
caused b y the novel coronavirus, SARS -CoV -2. The WHO declared COVID -19 a Public 
Health Emergency  of International Concern3on 30 January 2020 and further characterized 
the disease outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.4As of 12January  2022, at least , 
315million cases have been confirmed worldwide, and at least 5.5 million deaths have 
occurred.5
COVID -19 manifests as a wide range of illness, from asy mptomatic infection to severe 
pneumonia, ARDS, and death. Although most (approximately  80%) cases are as ymptomatic 
or mild,6patients who are hospitalized with COVID -19 may  have significant morbidity  and 
mortality ,7,8COVI D-19 manifests as a wide range of illness, from as ymptomatic infection to 
severe pneumonia, ARDS, and death. Although most (approximately  80%) cases are 
asymptomatic or mild,6patients who are hospitalized with COVID -19 may  have significant 
morbidity  and mortality ,7,8and are at increased risk of developing complications such as 
severe inflammation ass ociated with elevations in proinflammatory  cytokines, ARDS, acute 
cardiac injury , thromboembolic events, hy percoagulability , and/or kidney  injury .9-12
Moreover, other comorbidities, such as hy pertension, obesity , and diabetes, as well as older 
age and male sex increase the risk for worse outcomes.7
Although there are s ymptomatic and/or supportive treatments for COVID -19, few antiviral 
drugs are available or in late-stage development to help treat COVID- 19 in patients with mild 
to moderate COVID -19. Existing compounds, such as hy droxy chloroquine and 
lopinavir/ritonavir, have been evaluated as potential treatment options for COVID -19, but
have not demonstrated benefit or efficacy  beyond the SoC.13-15The FDA has approved IV 
remdesivir,16an antiviral drug with activity  against SARS -CoV -2, for hospitalized patients 
with COVI D-19. However, remdesivir monotherapy  may  not be sufficient in all subsets of 
patients17across the COVID -19 spectrum or has shown modest effects.18,19Favipiravir is 
currentl y under investigation for its activity  against SARS -CoV -2 due to its broad- spectrum 
activity  against various RNA viruses20,21and has been approved in India and Russia to treat 
mild to moderate COVID -19.22Although fa vipiravir has been generall y well tolerated in 
clinical studies primarily  for the treatment of the influenza virus, teratogenic findings in 
multiple animal species at exposures comparable to those achieved with the dosage regimen 
to treat influenza have li mited its clinical use.20

Page 31Among contacts of persons with COVI D-19, the percentage in whom new cases develop 
(secondary  attack rate) has been estimated at 10 to 15%.23-26The primary infection -control 
strategy  currentl y employed relies on basic h ygiene measures such as hand washing, use of 
personal protective equipment such face masks, social distancing, and isolation of case 
patients and their contacts.27The effectiveness of isolation depends on the promptness of the 
intervention, the level of contact tracing, and the level of isolation adherence28. 
Implement ation of these measures however, has not been fully  effective and spread of 
SARS -CoV -2 in many  countries continues to occur. Furthermore, modeling of SARS- CoV -2 
viral shedding d ynamics suggests that up to 44% of transmission occurs prior to sy mptom 
onset of the index case (pres ymptomatic transmission) and that start and peak infectiousness 
can be up to 2 day s before sy mptom onset.29
There are large efforts in progress to develop vaccines30with several now authorized for 
emergency  use or conditionally  approved b y Health Authorities for those aged 12 years and 
older.31These vaccines will take time to deploy and may not be taken b y everyone. Also, the 
duration of potential protection is not known leading to continued efforts to identify  effective 
antiviral treatments. Moreover, currentl y authorized/approved vaccines may not be as 
effective against potential outbreaks from new coronavi rus variants.32,33Emergence of the 
Omicron variant in late 2021 provides an example of the potential impact emerging variants 
of SARS -CoV -2 may  have on vaccine efficacy . More specificall y, gene mutations in the 
Omicron variant appear to result in vaccine efficacy  against sy mptomatic disease that is 
significantl y lower than against the Delta variant.34Regarding protection afforded b y prior 
infection with SARS -CoV -2, the Omicron variant appears to be associated with a 3- to 8-fold 
increased risk of reinfection relative to other variants that have been observed.35
Postexposure prophy laxis for healthy  contacts is among the measures used for outbreak 
control of several infectious diseases (eg, pandemic influenza).36No oral agents are known to 
be effective in preventing SARS- CoV -2 infection or COVID -19, but aminoquinolines 
(hydroxy chloroquine and chloroquine) and antiretrovirals (eg, lopinavir/ritonavir) have been 
or are in the process of being assessed for potential utility  in the postexposure, preemptive 
treatment/proph ylaxis outpatient settings.37The direct reduction of viral replication, through 
inhibition of other critical viral enzy mes, offers an important mechanism to achieve greater 
patient benefit and perhaps aid in control of the COVID -19 pandemic. The US FDA has 
granted EUA for an IV-or SC -administered mAb regimen as postexposure prophy laxis for 
COVID -19 in adults and adolescents who are at high risk for progressing to se vere COVID -
19.38As of January  2022, no orally  administered therapeutic intervention has been approved 
or authorized for use in postexposure/preemptive treatment/proph ylaxis.
The cor onavirus 3CL  protease is a virall y encoded enzy me that is critical to the 
SARS -CoV -2 replication cycle, analogous to other obligatory virally encoded proteases 
(eg,HIV Protease, HCV Protease).39Mutagenesis experiments with other coronaviruses and 
picornaviruses that are related to SARS -CoV -2 (picornavirus- like supercluster) have 
demonstrated that the activity  of the 3CL protease (or the corresponding picornaviral 
3Cenzyme) is essential for viral replication. No close human analogs of coronavirus 3CL

Page 32enzy mes are known, suggesting that appropriate 3CL  inhibitors may  function as selective 
inhibitors of SARS -CoV -2 and other coronaviruses as therapeutic agents.
PF-07321332, a potent and selective inhibitor of the SARS- CoV -2 3CL  protease, is being 
developed as an oral treatment and/or postexposure prophy laxis in patients with COVI D-19.
In this stud y, PF -07321332 will be coadministered with ritonavir. Ritonavir is a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor and is being used a s a PK enhancer in this study  to inhibit the metabolism 
of PF -07321332 in order to increase plasma concentrations of PF -07321332 to values that are 
anticipated to be efficacious. Ritonavir, at the dose administered in this study , is not expected 
to have an y antiviral activity  on the SARS -CoV -2 virus and is being used only  as a PK 
enhancing agent .
2.2.1. Nonclinical Studies of PF-07321332
Data from nonclinical studies support the planned clinical trials with PF -07321332; these 
studies are described in the IB.40
PF-07321332 exhibits a broad- spectrum activit y across the Coronaviridae family of 3CL 
proteases demonstrating its potential for antiviral efficacy .
In vitro, PF -07321332 inhibited SARS -CoV -2 viral -induced cy topathic effect in monkey  
kidney  Vero cell assay s. PF -07321332 exhibited antiviral activity  against SARS -CoV -2 in 
dNHBE cells. Furthermore, PF-07321332 inhibited HCoV229E viral -induced cy topathic 
effect in human MRC- 5 cells with no detectable cy totoxicity  at the highest compound 
concentration tested.
Test article -related findings identified in the safety pharmacology studies included changes in 
locomotor activity  and transient higher respiratory rate and minute volume in rats at the high 
dose, as well as minor and transient hemod ynamic changes (increased blood pressure and 
decreased heart rate) at the high dose in cy nomolgus monkey s. The potential effects on safet y 
pharmacology  parameters are monitorable in the clinic, and no correlated clinical signs or 
histopathological findings in the relevant organs were observed in the 14 -day or 15 -day 
repeat dose GLP toxicity  studies in rats or monkeys. ECG data were also collected in the 
15-day GLP monkey  study  and there were no test article -related changes in ECG parameters 
(HR, RR -, PR-, QRS -, QT- , QTc -intervals) or ECG morphology  in that study .
2.2.2. Clinical Overview
C4671001 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is an ongoing FIH single and multiple dose escalation study  to 
evaluate the safet y, tolerability , and PK of PF -07321332 in healthy  adult participants. 
Preliminary  data from this study  collected as of 07 April 2021 (SAD) and 14 April 2021 
(MAD) in a total of 31 participants who were randomized and treated with PF -07321332 or 
placebo, the clinical safety profile of PF 07321332 appears to be acceptable at single doses 
up to 1500 mg alone and up to 750 mg administered with ritonavir (100 mg at -12h, 0h, 12h), 
and at repeated da ily doses administered orally  for 10 day s of up to 500 mgPF-07321332 
BID with 100 mg ritonavir BID.

Page 33Preliminary  PK data on Day  1, Day  5 and Day  10 following multiple oral administration of 
PF-07321332/ritonavir 75/100 mg, 250/100 mg, and 500/100 mg BID su ggest less than 
proportional increase in exposures at steady  state. Multiple dosing over 10 day s achieved 
steady  state on Day  2 with approximately  2-fold accumulation. Day  5 and Day  10 exposure 
was similar at all doses.
Following single doses of PF
-07321332 with and without ritonavir, all AEs were mild and 
none were considered treatment related. There were no obvious trends in, or association of, 
TEAEs with dose level of PF -07321332. Following multiple doses, the most commonly  
observed AEs b y SOC were Gastr ointestinal disorders and Nervous s ystem disorders. 
Diarrhea was the most common reported AE, occurring in 4 participants across treatment 
groups. A total of 5 treatment related TEAEs were observed in Part -2:MAD.
Across treatment groups, blood TSH increase d in 3 participants, and 2 participants reported 
dysgeusia. The 3 participants with elevated TSH results did not experience related clinical 
symptoms and the free T4 results remained within reference range. No SAEs or deaths were 
reported based on these pr eliminary  safety  data as of 07 April 2021 and 14 April 2021.
Current evidence indicates the clinical safet y profile of PF 07321332 is acceptable at single 
doses up to 1500 mg alone and up to 750 mg administered with ritonavir (100 mg at -
12h, 0h, 
12h), and at repeated daily  doses administered orally  for 10 day s of up to 500 mg 
PF-07321332 BID with 100 mg ritonavir BID.
C4671005 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a Phase 2/3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  
in nonhospitalized sy mptomatic adult participants wi th a laboratory -confirmed diagnosis of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection, included participants 18 years of age and older with at least 1 risk 
factor for progression to severe disease and with a COVID
-19 s ymptom onset of 
≤5days.The study  excluded individuals with a history  of prior COVID -19 infection or 
SARS -CoV -2 vaccination before the Day  34 visit. The primary  efficacy  endpoint was the 
proportion of participants with COVI D-19 related hospitalization or death from any  cause 
through Day 28. 
In the anal ysis of the pr imary  endpoint from all participants enrolled in Study  C4671005, an 
89% reduction in COVID-19- related hospitalization or death from an y cause compared with 
placebo in participants treated within 3 day s of s
ymptom onset was observed. 0.7% of 
participants wh o received PF -07321332/ritonavir were hospitalized through Day  28 
following randomization (5 of 697 hospitalized with no deaths), compared to 6.5% of 
participants who received placebo and were hospitalized or died (44 of 682 hospitalized with 
9 subsequent deaths) (p<0.0001). In a secondary  endpoint, PF -07321332/ritonavir reduced 
the risk of hospitalization or death for an y cause by 88% compared with placebo in 
participants treated within 5 day s of sy mptom onset; 0.8% of patients who received 
PF-07321332/rit onavir were hospitalized or died through Day  28 following randomization 
(8of 1039 hospitalized with no deaths) compared with 6.3% of patients who received 
placebo (66 of 1046 hospitalized with 12 subsequent deaths) (p<0.0001). Treatment with 
PF-07321332/r itonavir was safe and well tolerated.

Page 34Results from a protocol -specified interim analy sis of Study  C4671002 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 
which included 45% of the study ’s planned enrollment, showed that the novel primary  
endpoint of self -reported, sustained alleviation of all sy mptoms for 4 consecutive day s, as 
compared with placebo, was not met. However, the key  secondary  endpoint of 
COVID -19-related hospitalization or death from any  cause through Day  28 was also 
examined at the interim analy sis, showing 0.6% of those w ho received 
PF-07321332/ritonavir were hospitalized following randomization (2 of 333 hospitalized 
with no deaths), compared to 2.4% of participants who received placebo and were 
hospitalized (8 of 329 hospitalized with no deaths).

Page 372.3.2. Benefit Assessment
As of January  2022, no orally  administered therapeutic intervention has been approved or 
received an EUA in the US for use in postexposure/preemptive treatment/prophy laxis , but 2 
orally  
administered antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients at high risk of 
progression to severe COVID- 19 (eg, Paxlovid42and molnupiravir43) have begun receiving 
EUAs (or equivalent) in various regions. Additionally , the emergence of variants such as the 
omicron variant that may be associated with reduced protection afforded b y vaccine and 
monoclonal antibodies further emphasizes the need for additional treatment and postexposure 
prophy laxis options.34,35On this basis, the potential benefit to individual study  participants 
who receive the study  intervention may include preventing development of sy mptomatic 
SARS -CoV -2 infection following exposure to a household contact (an index patient) with 
symptomatic COVID -19. By  virtue of participating in the study  and ongoing evaluation and 
assessm ent for SARS -CoV -2 infection, there is the potential benefit of early detection and 
subsequent medical management should infection with SARS -CoV -2 be detected.
2.3.3. Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion
Taking into account the seriousness of COVID -19, the lack of rea dily available postexposure 
prophy lactic treatment options and the measures taken to minimize risk to participants in this 
study , the potential risks identified in association with PF -07321332 are justified by  the 
anticipated benefits that may  be afforded to study participants by  preventing development of 
symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection. An independent E -DMC will be responsible for 
monitoring the safety of participants at regularl y scheduled intervals throughout the duration 
of the study  and for assessing efficacy , futility , and sample size re -estimation at the time of 
the interim anal ysis according to the E -DMC charter.

4.STUDY DESIGN
4.1.Overall Design
This Phase 2/3, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , placebo- controlled study  will 
compare the efficacy  of 2 regimens of PF -07321332/ritonavir versus placebo in 
approximately  2880 participants who have a negative screening SARS -CoV -2 rapid antigen 
test result and are as ymptomatic household contacts of individuals who are sy mptomatic and 
recentl y tested positive for SARS -CoV -2 (index case: defined as patient with symptomatic 

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 40COVID -19). Index cases may  be participants in Phase 2/3 safet y and efficacy  studies of 
PF-07321332/ritonavir (C4671002 and C4671005), but this is not required. Eligible 
participants for this study will be randomly  assigned (1:1:1) within 96 hours after collection 
of the index case’s first positive SARS -CoV -2 test to receive: 
PF-07321332/ritonavir q12h for 5 day s followed by  matching placebo q12h for 
5days; or
PF-07321332/ritonavir q12h for 10 day s; or 
Matching placebo for PF -07321332/ritonavir q12h for 10 day s.
Randomization will be stratified based on the presence of risk factors associated with severe 
COVID -19 illness (see Appendix 11 ) and geographic region at screening. Throughout the 
study  period, provision will be made to allow study visits to be conducted at a participant’s 
home or at another nonclinic location approved b y the investigator where possible when 
participants are unwilling or unable to attend a clinic visit at the investigational site. 
Participants will be screened within 24h before randomization. The total duration of the study  
is up to 42 day s and includes screening, study  intervention through Day  10, efficacy  
assessments through Day 14, and a safet y follow- up period through Day 38[±3 day s]. 
An independent E -DMC will review unblinded data to ensure the safet y of participants on an 
ongoing basis throughout the duration of the study. I n addition to up to weekly  reviews of 
safet y data, the E -DMC will review the following:
Sentinel cohort safet y review : The E- DMC will review unblinded safet y data after 
approximately  the first 150 participants have completed Day 10 of the study , at which 
point enrollment will be paused pending E -DMC review of the safety data. After 
review of the sentinel cohort, the frequency  of safety  reviews may  be reduced 
subsequently  based on E -DMC recommendations.
Interim anal ysis: An interim analy sis will be conducted for efficacy , futility , and 
sample size re- estimation and reviewed by an E -DMC after a prespecified accrual of 
participant s (ie, before or at approximately  70% participants have complete dthe 
Day 14 assessments with a minimum number of 24 participants having s ymptomatic 
infection [mITT anal ysis set] ).
Subsequent to the planned interim analy sis, there will be a single anal ysis for reporting the 
results of this study  after all participants have had their last study  visit. 
4.2.Scientific Rationale for Study Design
This study  evaluates safety  and the potential efficacy  of an investigational agent on 
preventing s ymptomatic SARS -CoV -
2infection (postexposure prophy laxis) in household 
contacts of individuals who recentl y tested positive for SARS -CoV -2 and are s ymptomatic 

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 41(ie, index case: patient with sy mptomatic COVID -19). Prior studies of antiviral, mAb, and 
antimalarial agents have ev aluated the efficacy of these agents as postexposure prophy laxis 
and/or preemptive treatment for s ymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection. Studies with mAb 
suggest that post -exposure treatment of as ymptomatic patients may  reduce sy mptomatic 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.37,44-49
Efficacy  assessments (including coll ection of nasal swabs and participant- reported 
COVID -19 s ymptoms) will be collected through Day  14 and 28, respectively . The sy mptom 
endpoint includes those recommended b y FDA and relies on s ymptoms that have been 
associated with COVID -19, and which are ex pected to be d ynamic and improve with 
effective anti -SARS -CoV -2 therap y. Nasal swabs will be collected dail y through Day  14 to 
determine if and when participants become RT -PCR positive. Participants who develop signs 
or sy mptoms consistent with COVI D-19 during the study  will undergo an in -person medical 
assessment including a rapid antigen test to confirm SARS -CoV -2 infection so that the 
participants may  receive SoC therapy  as described in Section 6.8. Additional testing may  be 
performed in accordance with local medical practice. 
This study  uses a randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , placebo
-controlled design, 
which is a well -accepte d approach for evaluating efficacy  in a clinical research setting.
4.2.1. Diversity of Study Population
Reasonable attempts will be made to enroll participants to ensure the stud y population is 
representative of the patient population that will be treated with PF -07321332/ritonavir in 
clinical practice.
4.2.2. Choice of Contraception/Barrier Requirements
Studies to evaluate the developmental toxicity  of PF -07321332 have not been conducted. 
Therefore, the use of a highly effective method of contraception is required (see Appendix 4 ).
4.2.3. Collection of Retained Research Samples
Retained Research Samples will be collected and stored for further anal yses which may , for 
example, provide greater understanding of the study  intervention.
4.3.Justification for Dose
Dosing regimens of 300 mg PF- 07321332 coadministered with 100 mg ritonavir q12h 
administered orall y for 5 days or 10 days will be evaluated in this study. Dose selection for 
this study  included consideration of all relevant available preclinical and clinical data, 
including repeat -dose toxicology  studies, clinical safet y, and PK data from the Phase 1 study 
(C4671001), and in vitro pharmacology  studies with PF -07321332.
A preliminary  population PK model was developed from the Phase 1 (C4671001) PK data. 
Following a first dose of 300 mg PF -
07321332 coadministered with 100 mg ritonavir q12h, 
median C trough of unbound (free) PF -07321332 is predicted to be approximately 289 ng/mL 
(equivalent to 933 ng/mL total), ie, approximately  3-fold hi gher than the in vitro EC 90of 

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 4290.4 ng/mL determined in dNHBE cells (equivalent to 181 nM, f u, human=0.310). At this 
dose, for a h ypothetical intersubject variability  of 60%, more than 95% of the participants are 
predicted to maintain free PF -07321332 conc entrations above the in vitro EC 90over the 
12-hour dosing interval.
Based upon epidemiological characteristics of SARS -CoV -229and assuming a range of 
different scenarios related to the timing of initiation of treatmen t for the household contact 
relative to the timing of exposure to the index case or relative to the onset of sy mptoms for 
the index case, simulations using a previously  published QSP model50were performed to 
advise on the potential impact of d ifferent treatment durations on the viral load for household 
contacts.   
Based upon these simulations, initiation of treatment for household contact nearer to the 
timing of exposure or onset of sy mptoms for the index case suggest some possibility  for 
shorter treatment durations to be associated with an increase of the viral load of household 
contacts after completion of the treatment regimen. Although modeling simulations suggest 
some potential for an increase of the viral load of household contacts after completion of the 
treatment regimen, there is supportive evidence that a shorter treatment may be effective in 
the setting of post -exposure proph ylaxis. More specificall y, the viral epidemiology 
characteristics of SARS -CoV -
2 are considered to be similar to the characteristics of influenza 
and recently , a 5-day treatment regimen of oseltamivir was shown to be non -inferior to a 
10-day treatment regimen in post -exposure prophylactic treatment of hospitalized patients 
exposed to influenza and not immediately  isolated from the index case.51
Considering the uncertainty  of the potential impact of treatment duration on providing 
effective post -exposure prophy laxis in household contacts exposed to persons with 
COVID -19, the efficacy  and safet y of 5-and 10 -day treatment durations will be assessed in 
this study .
Preliminary  safet y data from study  C4671001, collected up to 07 April 2021 for PART- 1 and 
14 April 2021 for PART -2, showed an acceptable safet y profile for single doses of 
PF-07321332 ran ging from 150 mg to 1500 mg dosed alone and of 250 mg and 750 mg 
dosed with ritonavir (100 mg administered at - 12h, 0h, 12h) and for 10 day  repeated doses 
ranging from 75 mg BID to 500 mg BID with 100 mg ritonavir BID.
The proposed dosing regimens of 300 m g PF-07321332 coadministered with 
100mgritonavir q12h administered orally  for 5 or 10 day s is thus expected to be safe and 
efficacious.
4.4.End of Study Definition
The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the s tudy 
shown in the SoA for the last participant in the trial globall y.
A participant is considered to have completed the study  if he/she has completed all periods of 
the study , including the last visit shown in the SoA .

5.3.Lifestyle Considerations
5.3.1. Contraception
The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that 
the participant has selected an appropriate method of contraception for the individual 
participant and his or her partner(s) from the permitted list of contraception methods 
(seeAppendix 4 Section 
10.4.4) and will confirm that the participant has been instructed in 
its con
sistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the SoA, the investigator or 
designee will inform the participant of the need to use highl y effective contraception 
consistently  and correctly  and document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in 
the participant’s chart (participants need to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 
of the selected methods of contraception) considering that their risk for pregnancy  may  have 
changed since the last visit. I n addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the 
participant to call immediately  if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if 
pregnancy  is known or suspected in the participant or partner.
5.4.Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined a s participants who consent to participate in the clinical study  but 
are not subsequently  randomly  assigned to study  intervention. A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet

6.1.1. Administration
PF-07321332 150 mg tablet or placebo for PF -07321332 will be administered with ritonavir 
100 mg or placebo for ritonavir capsule for 10 days. Participants will be dispensed:
2 tablets of PF- 07321332 150 mg or placebo for PF -07321332 (single tablet from 
each blister cell, one at a time) q12h
1 capsule of ritonavir 100 mg or placebo for ritonavir q12h.
Participants should take the first dose of stud y intervention on Day  1, preferably  during the 
in-person visit; that is, participants should take 2 tablets of PF-07321332 150 mg or placebo 
and 1 capsule of ritonavir 100 mg or placebo at the same time and no more than 10 minutes 
apart . To allow the participant to select a convenient 12 -hour dosing schedule, timing of 
dosing for the second dose may  be adjusted slig htly, but should be taken at least 4 hours but 
no later than 12 hours after the first dose. The remaining doses should be taken every  12 
hours [±30 minutes]. Participants will swallow the study  intervention whole and will not

Page 49manipulate or chew the study  intervention prior to swallowing. Participants may  take the 
study  intervention with or without food. Taking study  intervention with food may  improve 
tolerability . Refer to the IP Manual for additional dosing and administration instructions.
If a dose is delay ed, it should be taken as soon as possible, but no later than 4 hours before 
the next scheduled dose. Participants should not double up the next dose of study  
intervention in order to “make up” what had been missed. Dosing should be stopped at the 
endof the treatment period. Any  remaining tablets and/or capsules at the end of 10 day s (or 
11 day s if onl y one dose was administered on Day 1) should be returned.
6.2.Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability
1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all study  interventions received and any  
discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study  intervention. 
2.Only  participants e nrolled in the study  may  receive study  intervention and only  
authorized site staff may  supply  or administer study  intervention. All study  
interventions must be stored in a secure, environmentally  controlled, and monitored 
(manual or automated recording) ar ea in accordance with the labeled storage 
conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. At a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations 
must be documented and available upon request. Data for nonworking day s must 
indicate the minimum and maximum temperatures since previousl y documented for 
all site storage locations upon return to business. Study  intervention may  be shipped 
by courier to study  participants if permitted by  local regulations and in accordance 
with storage and transportation requirements for study  intervention. Pfizer does not 
permit the shipment of study  intervention by  mail. The tracking record of shipments 
and the chain of custod y of study  intervention must be kept in the pa rticipant’s source 
documents/medical records. For investigational sites using ground transportation to 
deliver study  intervention to participants, stability data reveal that if the total duration 
of transit is less than 24 hours, temperature monitoring is not required.
3.Any excursions from the study  intervention label storage conditions should be 
reported to Pfizer upon discovery  along with an y actions taken. The site should 
activel y pursue options for returning the stud y intervention to the storage conditio ns 
described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Once an excursion is identified, the 
study  intervention must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission 
to use the study  intervention. Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion 
and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site 
in the I P manual.
4.Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded by  the storage 
conditions stated on the label.

study  intervention.
7.The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) 
is responsible for stud y intervention accountability , reconciliation, and record 
maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records), such as the 
IPAL or sponsor -approved equivalent. All study  interventions will be accounted for 
using a stud y intervention accountab ility form/record. All study  intervention that is 
taken home b y the participant, both used and unused, must be returned to the 
investigator b y the participant. Returned study intervention must not be redispensed 
to the participants.
8.Further guidance and in formation for the final disposition of unused study  
interventions are provided in the I P manual. All destruction must be adequately  
documented. If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigator must ensure that the mater ials are destroy ed in compliance with 
applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions 
provided b y Pfizer.
Upon identification of a product complaint, notify the sponsor within 1 business day  of 
discovery  as describe d in the I P manual.
6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing
A qualified staff member will dispense the study  intervention using the IRT system via 
unique container numbers in the bottles and blister cards provided, in quantities appropriate 
according to the SoA . A second staff member will verify  the dispensing. The participant 
should be instructed to maintain the product in the bottle and blister cards, as appropriate 
provided throughout the course of dosing and return the bottle and blister cards , as 
appropriate to the site at the next study  visit.
Study  intervention and placebo will be dispensed by  qualified blinded site personnel 
according to the IP manual. The study  intervention will be administered in a blinded fashion 
to the participants.
Study intervention will be dispensed as noted in the SoA .
6.3.Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1. Allocation to Study Intervention
Allocation of participants to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an IRT s ystem 
(IWR). The site personnel (study  coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter 
or select information including but not limited to the user’s ID and password, the protocol 
number, and the participant number. The site personnel will then be provided with a 
treatment assignment, randomization number, and DU or container number when stud y 
intervention is being supplied via the I RT s ystem. The I RT sy stem will provide a 

PF-07321332

Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 51confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and DU or 
container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. 
Study  intervention will be dispensed at the study  visit summarized in the SoA. 
Returned study  intervention must not be redispensed to the participants.
The study -specific I RT reference manual and I P manual will provide the contact information 
and further details on the use of the IRT s ystem.
6.3.2. Blinding of the Sponsor
The majority of sponsor staff will be blinded to study intervention allocation. There will be 
an unblinded team supporting the interactions with, and the anal yses for, the E -DMC while 
the study  is ongoing. The team will consist of clinicians, statistician(s), and programmer(s) 
and will be separate from the blinded members of the study  team.
The study  will be unblinded at the group and participant level after all participants complete 
the Day  38 visit (or ET prior to Day  38 visit). However, if efficacy  is demonstrated at the 
interim analysis, an unblinded submissions team ma y be assembled to prepare unblinded 
analyses and documents to support regulatory  activities that may  be required while the study  
is ongoing.
Details of the unblinded sponsor staff supporting the E -DMC and the timing of unblinding 
will be outlined in the U nblinding Plan.
6.3.3. Breaking the Blind 
The I RT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. I n case of an emergency , the 
investigator has the sole responsibility  for determining if unblinding of a participant’s 
treatment assignment is warranted. Parti cipant safety  must alway s be the first consideration 
in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the 
investigator should make every  effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a 
participant’s treatment as signment unless this could delay  further management of the 
participant. If a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified 
within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must 
be recor ded in the source documentation and CRF.
The study -specific I RT reference manual and I P manual will provide the contact information 
and further details on the use of the IRT s ystem.
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Participants will be issued an electronic study  intervention diary  (ie, participant -completed 
study  intervention log) or may  use an application installed on their device and will be 
educated to record the date and time of their stud y intervention dosing preferabl y at the time 
of first dose.

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 52Compliance with study  intervention will be assessed by  delegated site personnel through the 
accounting of unused study  intervention returned by  the participant at the study  visits, review 
of the electronic study  intervention diary , and discussion with the partic ipant.
Study  intervention administration, including any  deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage 
regimen, should be recorded in the CRF.
A record of the number of study  intervention tablets/capsules dispensed to and taken by  each 
participant must be maintai ned and reconciled with study  intervention and compliance 
records. Intervention start and stop dates, including dates for intervention delay s and/or dose 
reductions, will also be recorded in the CRF.
The following noncompliance cases will be considered med ication errors 
(See Section 8.3.10):
Participants interrupting study  intervention for 2 consecutive doses;
Participants taking either PF-07321332 or ritonavir alone for 2 consecutive doses.
Participants who have an overall study  intervention compliance of <80% or >115%. 
In addition to the above -listed medication errors, any  deviation from protocol -specified 
dosing (eg, missed single dose or partial dose) should be recorded as a protocol deviation and 
the investigator or designee is to counsel the participant and ensure steps are taken to 
improve compliance.
6.5.Dose Modification 
Dose modification for PF -
07321332/ritonavir is not allowed.
6.6.Continued Access to Study Intervention After the End of the Study
No intervention will be provided to study  participants at the end of their study  participation.
6.7.Treatment of Overdose
For this study , any  dose of PF -07321332 greater than 900 mg or ritonavir greater than 
300mg within a 24 -hour time period will be considered an overdose.
There is no specific treatment for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:
1.Contact the medical monitor within 24 hours.
2.Closely  monitor the particip ant for an y AEs/SAEs and laboratory  abnormalities for at 
least 5 half -lives or 28 calendar day s after the overdose of study  intervention 
(whichever is longer).

5.Obtain a blood sample for PK anal ysis within 1 day  from the date of the last dose of 
study  intervention if requested by  the medical monitor (determined on a case -by-case 
basis).
Decisi ons regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by  the investigator in 
consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.   
6.8.Concomitant Therapy
Hormonal contraceptives that meet the requirements of thi s study  are allowed to be used in 
participants who are WOCBP (see Appendix 4 ).
Permitted During the Study
All participants who develop confirmed COVID -19 may  continue study  intervention and 
may receive SoC therapy including 
products authorized under an Emergency  Use 
Authorization (or equivalent in countries where the study  is being conducted) where 
appropriate , in addition to study  intervention, unless listed as prohibited medication (see 
below and Appendix 8 ). Discontinuation of study  intervention is at the investigator’s 
discretion. However, if the investigator de cides to administer SoC therapy  for COVID
-19 
that is prohibited for DDI reasons, the participant must discontinue study  intervention but 
should continue in the study . SoC therap y is defined as an y therap y that is approved and used 
as indicated b y the local regulatory  authorities (including approvals for emergency  use, 
compassionate use, or through similar regulatory  guidance), or any  therapy  as recommended 
by a relevant national (or a reputable international) scientific body  (eg, WHO, ECDC, CDC, 
NIH). Sites should consult with the sponsor if a new SoC option becomes available after 
study  initiation. The investigator should ensure that an y recommended SoC therap y is not a 
strong inducer of CYP3A4 or highl y dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance if it is planned to
be administered concomitantly  with study  intervention.
In countries in which therapiesare are authorized or approved forthe treatment of 
COVID -
19,all participants who develop confirmed COVID -19 disease will be referred 
locally  for treatment as deemed appropriate by the investigator (see above) and local 
guidelines. This referral should be documented. Notwithstanding, this treatment is not 
mandatory  for participation in this study .
Prohibited During the Study
Participants may  not receive therapeutics, drugs, or vaccines described in the exclusion 
criteria (see Section 5.2), antiviral treatment for COVID -19 (eg, molnupiravir, Paxlovid) or 
listed as prohibited medications (see Appendix 8 ) during the stud y period with the exceptions
described above for participants who develop confirmed COVID -
19.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 54PF-07321332 and ritonavir are both primarily  metab olized by  cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. 
Therefore, concomitant use of an y medications or substances that are strong inducers of 
CYP3A4 are prohibited within 28 day s prior to dosing of study  intervention and during study  
treatment.
Additionally , PF-07321332 and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A4. Therefore, medications 
highl y dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations 
may be associated with serious and/or life- threatening events are not permitted during dosing 
of PF -07321332/ ritonavir and for 4 day s after the last dose of PF -07321332/ritonavir. 
Because ritonavir 100 mg every  12 hours is being used to boost the exposure of 
PF-07321332, no additional DDIs are expected other than those associated with ritonavir 
100mg q12h based on in vitro assessments.
A nonexhaustive list of prohibited and precautionary  medications is provided in Appendix 8 . 
If a medication is not listed, it should not automatically  be assumed it is safe to coadminister . 
Appropriatel y qualified site staff will review all concomitant medications to determine if they 
are strong inducers of CYP3A4 or highl y dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance, and thus 
prohibited.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 55Miss more than 2 consecutive doses of study  intervention.
Note that discontinuatio n of study  intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study .
If study  intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant will remain in the study  to 
be evaluated for all subsequent scheduled assessments. See the SoA for data to be collected 
at the time of discontinuation of study  intervention and follow -up for any  further evaluations 
that need to be completed.
In the event of discontinuation of study  intervention, it must be documented on the 
appropriate CRF/in the medical records whether the participant is discontinuing further 
receipt of stud y intervention or also from study  procedures, posttreatment study  follow -up, 
and/or future collection of additional information.
7.1.1. Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR
If postcreening eGFR is <45 mL /min/1.73m2, the participant will be instructed to discontinue 
any remaining study  intervention doses as soon as study  staff become aware of laboratory  
results.
7.2.Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study 
A participant may withdraw from the stud y at an y time at his/her own request. Reasons for 
discontinuation from the study  include the following:
Refused further stud y procedures;
Lost to follow -up;
Death;
Study  terminated by  sponsor;
At the time of discontinuing from the stud y, if p ossible, an earl y discontinuation visit should 
be conducted. See the SoA for assessments to be collected at the time of study  
discontinuation and follow up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 
The early  discont inuation visit applies only  to participants who are enrolled/randomized and 
then are prematurely  withdrawn from the study . Participants should be questioned regarding 
their reason for withdrawal.  
If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may  requ est destruction of an y remaining 
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document any  such requests in the 
site study  records and notify  the sponsor accordingly .
If the participant withdraws from the study  and also withdraws consent (see Se ction 7.2.1) 
for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 56additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any  data 
collected before such withdrawal of consent.
7.2.1. Withdrawal of Consent 
Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study  intervention will remain in the study  
and must continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures. The onl y 
exception to this is when a participant specificall y withdraws consent for any further contact 
with him or her or persons previously  authorized by  the participant to provide this 
information. Participants s hould notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw 
consent from future follow up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be 
explained in detail in the medical records b y the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is 
only from further receipt of study  intervention or also from study  procedures and/or 
posttreatment study  follow up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that 
vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  available 
information should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
7.3.Lost to Follow -Up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow
-up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study  site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to be available for a required stud y 
visit:
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible. Couns el the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule, and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study ;
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must 
make e very effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented 
in the par ticipant’s medical record;
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
8.STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and 
dated ICD before performing an y stud y-specific procedures.
Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 57Safety  issues should be discussed with the sponsor im mediately  upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine whether the participant should continue or discontinue study  
intervention.
Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential 
and require d for stud y conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility  or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICD may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA.
In the event a participant is hospitalized, study  assessments should be performed as feasible. 
Procedures not per formed due to hospitalizations would not be considered protocol 
deviations.
Every  effort should be made to ensure that protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circums tances outside the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to perform 
the test. I n these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary  to ensure the safet y and 
well-being of the participant. When a protocol-required test cannot be p erformed, the 
investigator will document the reason for the missed test and an y corrective and preventive 
actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as 
possible. The study  team must be informed of these incide nts in a timely  manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior 
to initiation of the study .
The total blood sampling volume for individual participants in this study  is approximately  
183 mL . There will be an additional optional 1 mL of blood collected for a subset of 
participants who agree to self collect an optional PK sample (Tasso device). The actual 
collection times of blood sampling may  change. Additional blood samples may  be taken for 
safet y assessments at times specified b y Pfizer, provided the total volume taken during the 
study  does not exceed 550 mL during an y period of 56 consecutive da ys.
8.1.Efficacy Assessments
8.1.1. Participant Diary
Participants will be provided an electronic handheld device or application to use on their own 
device to record daily  COVID -19 signs and s ymptoms, study  intervention administration, 
and PRO assessments in the stud y diar y.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 58Participants will receive daily  reminders to complete entries on their own as specified in the 
SoA. The diary  should be completed at approximately  the same time every day . Staff will 
review the participant’s study  diary  online as specified in the SoA.
The diary  allows recording of these assessments only  within a fixed time window (eg, 24h), 
thus providing an accurate representation of the participant’s experience at that time. The 
participant is able t o make revisions to incorrect entries before pressing the save or submit 
button. I n the event that a participant becomes aware of an error in data after the entry  is 
saved, a change to the diary  data may  only be made by  the investigator submitting a data 
clarification form. Data reported in the participant diary  will be transferred electronically  to a 
third- party vendor, where they will be available for review b y investigators and the sponsor 
or delegate at all times via an internet -based portal.
8.1.2. Daily Sign s and Symptoms of COVID -19
On Day  1, participants will complete the study  diary  before receiving study intervention. 
Participant assessment of COVID -19-related s ymptoms should be recorded at approximately  
the same time each day  as specified in the SoA and as described in 
Section 8.1.1.
COVID -19-related s ymptoms will be evaluated in accordance with FDA guidelines 
(Appendix 9 ).53Participants w ill record a dail y severity rating of their s ymptoms  over the 
past 24 hours based on a 4
-point scale in which 0 is reported if no s ymptoms were present; 1 
if mild; 2 if moderate; and 3 if severe. 
Vomiting and diarrhea will each be rated on a 4 -point frequency  scale where 0 is reported for 
no occurrence, 1 for 1 to 2 times, 2 for 3 to 4 times, and 3 for 5 or greater. 
Sense of smell and sense of taste will each be rated on a 3- point L ikert scale where 0 is 
reported if the sense of smell/taste was the same as usual, 1 if the sense of smell/taste was 
less than usual, and 2 for no sense of smell/taste. Investigators will instruct participants to 
contact them if they  develop signs/sy mptoms of COVID-19 – to inform them of their 
symptoms and to schedule a COVID
-19 Signs/S ymptoms Onset visit as soon as possible, but 
no later than 2 day s after sy mptom onset, as specified in the SoA. Investigators will instruct 
symptomatic participants to follow local public health measures to reduce the spread of 
COVID -
19.
8.1.3. COVID -19 Related Medical Visit Details
Details of participants’ COVID -19-related medical visits (ie, hospitalization, practitioner’s
office, home healthcare services, telemedicine, urgent care, emergency  room ≤24h, 
extended care facility  stay) will be collected during study  visits, including level of care 
(ICUstatus) and dates of utilization, including admission and discharge, as applicable. 
If the participant has a COVID -19 Signs/Sy mptoms Onset visit, this must be reported as a 
COVID -19 rel ated medical visit.

including Emergency  Rooms or temporary  facilities instituted to address medical needs of 
those with severe COVID -19 during the COVID -19 pandemic. This includes specialized 
acute medical care unit within an assisted living facility  or nursing home. This does not 
include hospitalization for the purpose of public health or clinical trial execution.
8.1.4. Oxygen Support Details
Type of oxy gen support (e g, ox ygen supplementation received at home, mechanical 
ventilation received in hospital) will be collected.
8.1.5. Index Case Characteristics
Index cases will be determined through interview with the C4671006 study  participant. The 
index case may  be a participant in the C4671002 or C4671005 studies, but this is not 
required. However, minimum data as outlined below must be collected for confirmation of 
the C4671006 study  participant’s status as a household contact and the exposure period.
The following information about the index case will be collected through interview with the 
study  participant: 
Date of index case SARS -CoV -2 infection diagnosis (sample collection date of first 
positive test);
Date of onset of COVID -19 sy mptoms.
The following information about the index case will be collected through interview with the 
study  participant to characterize the exposure period. For index cases who are participants in 
the C4671002 or C4671005 study , this information will be collected in those studies. If the 
index case i s not a participant in the C4671002 or C4671005 study , this information will only  
be collected if available and permitted by  local laws and regulations:
Age; 
Whether the index case received vaccination or treatment for COVID -19 prior to or 
during the expo sure period;
Whether the index case was isolated from the study  participant after the initial 
exposure;
Relationship of the index case to the stud y participant (spouse, parent, son/daughter, 
etc);
Does the index case sleep in the same room as the study  participant.

8.2.Safety Assessments
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are provided in the 
SoA.Unscheduled clinical 
laboratory  measurements may  be obtained at any  time during the stud y to assess any 
perceived safety  issues.
8.2.1. Medical History
Medical history  (including prior documented infection) and demographics will be collected 
at screening. Smoking status will be collected. Complete medication history  of all 
prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vaccinations), and dietary  and herbal 
supplements taken within 30 days prior to the planned first dose will be collected.
Risk factors for the study participant developing severe COVID -19 illness will be recorded 
(Appendix 11).
8.2.2. Height and Weight
Height and weight will also be measured and recorded at screening. Height may  be self -
reported.
8.2.3. Targeted Physical Examinations
A targeted ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, cardiopulmonary  assessments. 
Investigators should pay  special attention to any  previously  identified or new AE/targeted 
condition that the participant has experienced.
Physical examination findings collected during the study  will be considered source data and 
will not be required to be reported, unless otherwise noted. An y untoward physical 
examination findings that are identified during the active collection period and meet the 
definition of an AE or SAE ( Appendix 3 ) must be reported according to the processes in 
Sections 8.3.1 to 8.3.3.
8.2.4. Vital Signs
Temperature, pulse rate, respiratory  rate, and blood pressure will be assessed as specified in 
the

throughout the stud y duration. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is 
not available.
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements shoul d be preceded b y at least 5 minutes of rest 
for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones).
Investigators will supply  each participant with a thermometer and will instruct them to 
measure their temperature if they are feeling feverish. I nvestigators will instruct participants 
to contact them if they  develop a fever (>100.4°F or >38°C), to inform them of their fever and 
to schedule a COVID -19 Signs/Sy mptoms Onset visit as soon as possible but no later than 
2days after symptom onset, as specified in the SoA . Investigators will instruct participants 
with fever to follow local public health measures to reduce the spread of COVID -
19.
Each participant will also be supplied with a pulse oximeter to be used at home as directed b y 
the investigator. This may include monitoring of ox ygen saturation for participants who 
develop COVID -19 sy mptoms and will be implemented at the discretion of the investigator. 
The investigator will instruct the participant regarding use of the pulse oximeter and what 
value should trigger a call to the investigator.
Vital signs are to be taken before blood collection for laboratory  tests.
8.2.5. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
See Appen dix 2 for the list of clinical safet y laboratory  tests to be performed and the SoA for 
the timing and frequency. All protocol- required laboratory  assessments, as defined in 
Appendix 2 , must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory  manual and the SoA. 
Unscheduled clinical laboratory  measurements may  be obtained at any  time during the study  
to assess an y perceived safet y issues.  
Laboratory  safet y parameters will be graded according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) 
Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events,64version 2.1. The 
investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this review, and record any  
clinically  relevant changes occurring during the study  in the AE section of the CRF. 
Clinically  significant abnormal lab oratory  findings are those which are not associated with 
the underl ying disease, unless judged by  the investigator to be more severe than expected for 
the participant's condition.
If a baseline laboratory  result meets Section 5.2 exclusionary  laboratory  values and the 
participant is still receiving stud y treatment, the investigator should contact the Medical 
Monitor. All laboratory  tests with values considered clini cally  significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study  or within 28 day s after the last dose of study  intervention should be 
repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically  
significant b y the investigat or or medical monitor.

Page 63If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by  
the investigator, the etiology  should be identified and the sponsor notified.
See Appendix 6 for sugge sted actions and follow -up assessments in the event of potential 
drug-induced liver injury.
8.2.6. Pregnancy Testing
Pregnancy  tests may  be urine or serum tests, but must have a sensitivity  of at least 
25mIU/mL. Pregnancy  tests will be performed in WOCBP at the times listed in the SoA. 
Following a negative pregnancy  test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be 
commenced. Pregnancy  tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed during 
the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy  is otherwise suspected) and at the 
end of the stud y. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested b y IRBs/ECs or if 
required b y local regulations. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an 
ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy  test is required. In such cases, the participant must be 
excluded if the serum pregnancy  result is positive.
If a participant requiring pregnancy  testing cannot visit a local laboratory , a home urine 
pregnancy testing kit with a sensitivi ty of at least 25 mI U/mL may  be used by  the participant 
to perform the test at home, if compliant with local regulatory  requirements. The pregnancy  
test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source documents/medical records. If 
the pregnancy  test is positive, the EDP should be reported ( Section 8.3.5.1). Confirm that the 
participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol.
8.3.
Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Safety Reporting
The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 3 .
AEs may  arise from s ymptoms or other complaints reported to the investigator by  the 
participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legall y 
authorized representative), or they  may  arise from clinical findings of the Investigator or 
other healthcare providers (clinical signs, tes t results, etc.).
The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue 
and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether the 
event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or caused the participant to discontinue 
the study  intervention (see Section 7.1). 
During the active collection period as described in Section 
8.3.1, each participant will be 
questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner.
In addition, the investigator may  be requested by  Pfizer Safet y to obtain specific follow -up 
information in an expedited fashion.

Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 648.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
Thetime period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, 
which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study  (ie, bef ore undergoing 
any study -related procedure and/or receiving study  intervention), through and including a 
minimum of 28 calendar day s, except as indicated below, after the last administration of the 
study  intervention. 
Follow -up by  the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and 
until the AE or SAE or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the 
investigator.
For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for the collection of 
future information, the active collection period ends when consent is withdrawn.
If a participant permanently  discontinues or temporaril y discontinues study  intervention 
because of an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must be recorded on the CRF and the SAE 
reported using the CT SAE Report Form.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek information on AEs or SAEs after the 
participant has conc luded study  participation . However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, 
including a death, at an y time after a participant has completed the stud y, and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study  intervention, the investigator must 
promptly  report the SAE to Pfizer using the CT SAE Report Form.
8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in 
Section 8.3.1 are reported to Pfizer Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form immediately  upon 
awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in 
Appendix 3. The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor within 
24
hours of it being available.
8.3.1.2. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period, 
which begins af ter obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.1 ,will be recorded 
on the AE section of the CRF.
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed and all spontaneously  reported 
AEs and SAEs reported by  the participant.

Page 658.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports a re provided in Appendix 3 .
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurren ces.
8.3.3. Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively  follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the investigator must pursue and 
obtain adequate information until resolut ion, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, 
or the participant is lost to follow
-up (as defined in Section 7.3).
In general, follow -
up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality . Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications 
and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a participant death, a summary  of available 
autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . 
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 .
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by  the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safet y of participants and the safet y of a 
study  intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply  with country -specific regulatory  requirements relating to safet y 
reporting to the regulatory  authorit y, IRBs/ECs , and investigators.
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory  
requirements and sponsor policy  and forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives SUSARs or other specific safet y information (eg, summary or 
listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the SRSD(s) for the 
study  and will notify  the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.3.5. Environmental Exposure, Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Environmental exposure, occurs when a person not enrolled in the study  as a participant 
receives unplanned direct contact with or exposure to the study
 intervention. Such exposure 
may or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE or SAE. Persons at risk for environmental 

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 66exposure i nclude healthcare providers, famil y members, and others who may be exposed. An 
environmental exposure may  include exposure during pregnancy , exposure during 
breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.
Any such exposure to the study  intervention under study  are reportable to Pfizer Safet y 
within 24 hours of investigator awareness.
8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy
An EDP occurs if: 
A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing 
study  intervention. 
A male participant who is receiv ing or has discontinued study  intervention exposes a 
female partner prior to or around the time of conception.
A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to 
study  intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of 
environmental EDP:  
A female family  member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after 
having been exposed to the study  intervention by  ingestion.
A male famil y member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study 
intervention by  ingestion then exposes his female partner prior to or around the 
time of conception.
The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The initia l information submitted 
should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related to 
termination of pregnancy). 
If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant’s partner, the investigator must report 
this information to Pfizer Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP 
Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the 
pregnancy  will be collected after the start of study  intervention and until a minimum 
of 28 calendar days after the last administration of study  intervention.
If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report 
information to Pfizer Safety  using the CT SAE Report Form and EDP Supplemental 
Form. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the partic ipant enrolled in 
the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the 
completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file.

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 67Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth , the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assesse d by gross visual inspection (unless 
preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets 
the criteria for an SAE (ie, ecto pic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal 
demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y in a live -born bab y, a terminated fetus, an 
intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death), the investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting S AEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to 
Pfizer Safety  as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion including miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to the study  intervention. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested b y the sponsor. Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the participant wit h the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that 
the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding
An exposure during breastfeeding occurs if: 
A female participant is found to be breastfeeding while receiving or after 
discontinuing study  intervention.
A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to 
study intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental 
exposure during breastfeeding is a female family  member or healthcare provider who 
reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study  intervention 
by ingestion.

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 68The investigator must report exposure during breastfeeding to Pfizer Safety  within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The 
information must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form. When exposure during 
breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does 
not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , so the information is not recorded on a 
CRF. However, a cop y of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the 
investigator site file.
An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specificall y 
approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with 
authorized use. However, if the infant experiences a n SAE associated with such a drug, the 
SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure
The investigator must report any  instance of occupational exposure to Pfizer Safet y within 
24 hours of the investigator’s awarenes s using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of 
whether there is an associated SAE. Since the information about the occupational exposure 
does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a 
CRF; however, a cop y of th e completed CT SAE Report Form must be maintained in the 
investigator site file.

8.3.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest
AESI s include hemody namic events, inflammatory  events, and thy roid- related events.
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are examined as part of routine safet y data review 
procedures throughout the clinical trial and as part of signal detecti on processes.
All AESI s must be reported as an AE or SAE following the procedures described in 
Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 . An AESI  is to be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. In 
addition, an AESI  that is also an SAE must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form. 
8.3.8.1. Lack of Efficacy
The investigator must report signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of 
efficacy . Lack of efficacy  or failure of expected pharmacological action is reportable to 
Pfizer Safety  only if associated with an SAE .

Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the study  participant.
The administration of expired study  intervention
The administration of an incorrect study  intervention
The administration of an incorrect dosage
The administration of study  intervention that has undergone temperature excursion 
from the specifi ed storage range, unless it is determined by  the sponsor that the study  
intervention under question is acceptable for use
The administration of study  intervention consistent with the medication error 
descriptions in Section 6.4.
Such medication errors occurring to a stud
y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified within 24 hours.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, as determined by  the 
investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if

Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE.
8.4. Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples of approximately 4 mL, to provide a minimum of 2 mL plasma, will be 
collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of PF-07321332 as specified in the SoA. 
Self-collected whole blood (Tasso device) may also be collected and used to measure concentrations of PF-07321332. Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the laboratory manual or by the sponsor. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded.
The actual times may change, but the number of samples will remain the same. All efforts 
will be made to obtain the samples at the exact nominal time relative to dosing. Collection ofsamples obtained ≤1 hour outside the scheduled nominal sampling time windows will not be 
captured as a protocol deviation, as long as the exact time of the collection is noted on the source document and the CRF. This protocol deviation window does not apply to samples to be collected more than 10 hours after dose administration at outpatient/follow-up visits with visit windows.
Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of PF-07321332. Samples collected for analyses of 
PF-07321332 concentration may also be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study, for metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical method, or for research related to the study intervention(s) and COVID-19. Samples may also be used to evaluate the PK of ritonavir.
Genetic analyses will not be performed on these samples unless consent for this was included 
in the informed consent. Participant confidentiality will be maintained.
Samples collected for measurement of concentrations of PF-07321332 will be analyzed using 
a validated analytical method in compliance with applicable SOPs.
The PK samples must be processed and shipped as indicated in the instructions provided to 
the investigator site to maintain sample integrity. Any deviations from the PK sample 
handling procedure (eg, sample collection and processing steps, interim storage or shipping 
conditions), including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. On a case-by-case basis, the sponsor may make a determination as to whether sample integrity has been compromised.
Drug concentration information that would unblind the study will not be reported to 
investigator sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.CCICCI

8.6. Biomarkers
Collection of samples for biomarker research is also part of this study. 
The following samples for biomarker research are required and will be collected from all 
participants in this study as specified in the SoA:
•Nasal swab will be collected to measure SARS CoV-2 viral load by RT-PCR. 
•Nasal viral load samples may be used for SARS CoV-2 viral sequencing.
•Nasal viral load samples may be used for SARS CoV-2 infectivity assays and 
phenotypic analyses. 
•10 mL blood optimized for plasma may be utilized for proteomics and immunologic 
studies.

8.6.4. SARS-CoV-2 Assessments
8.6.4.1. Rapid Antigen AssessmentsRapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be performed as described in the SoA. 
Investigator sites will use test kits that are authorized for use in this study.
8.6.4.2. Viral Load Assessments
The first nasal swab will be self collected by the participant under observation by site staff to 
ensure correct collection methodology. Thereafter, nasal swabs will be collected by the HCP or self collected by the participant as specified in the SoA. On the days where there is an in-
person visit, the nasal swab should be collected by the HCP and the participants instructed to not collect the nasal swab prior to the visit. If, for any reason, a nasal swab was already collected in the morning of an in person visit, another swab for viral load assessment should not be collected on the same day and that would not be considered a protocol deviation.
Additional swabs may be required at the visit on days for which an in-person visit occurs (eg, 
COVID-19 Signs/Symptoms Onset visit), which should be collected by the HCP if not already self collected by the participant. 
Results of centrally read nasal swabs will not be available to the investigator. Therefore if 
COVID-19 symptoms occur during the study, investigators will make treatment decisions based on assessment of the participant’s symptoms, rapid antigen testing results, other locally available testing results (eg, RT-PCR) obtained and used outside this trial, and other relevant factors determined in the investigator’s clinical judgment. Results of these local tests will be recorded on the CRF.
Nasal swabs will be collected per the SoA, and may be analyzed to measure SARS-CoV-2
RNA by RT-PCR.  
Storage and shipping instructions will be in accordance with the laboratory manual.

9.STATISTICAL CONSIDER
ATIONS
Detailed methodolo gy for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a SAP, which will be maintained b y the sponsor. The 
SAP may  modify  what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definitions or their anal yses will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
9.1.Statistical Hypotheses
The primary  hypothesis is to test, in participants who have a negative RT -PCR at baseline, 
whether or not the risk rat io between 5- day and 10 -day regimens of PF -07321332/ritonavir

5-day and 10-day regimens of PF-07321332 /ritonavir versus placebo groups in participants who have a negative RT-PCR result at baseline.
9.1.1. Estimands
9.1.1.1. Primary Estimand/Co-Primary EstimandsThe primary estimand is the risk reduction between 5-day and 10-day regimens of 
PF-07321332/ritonavir versus placebo in the proportion of individuals who develop symptomatic RT-PCR or rapid antigen test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection through Day 14 in adults who have a negative RT-PCR result at baseline and are household contacts of an individual with symptomatic COVID-19. This will be estimated without regard to adherence to randomized treatment.
9.1.1.2. Secondary Estimand
The estimand associated with the secondary objective is  
•The risk reduction between 5-day and 10-day regimens of PF-07321332/ritonavir versus 
placebo in the proportion of individuals who develop symptomatic RT-PCR or rapid antigen test-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection through Day 14 in adults who have a negative RT-PCR result at baseline, who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and are household contacts of an individual with symptomatic COVID-19. This will be estimated without regard to adherence to randomized treatment.
Symptomatic RT-PCR or rapid antigen test-confirmed infection through Day 14 is 
considered the main clinical outcome measure so estimands for the measure in targeted populations are presented. Estimands for the other outcome measures/populations are considered supportive of the main outcome measures and are not presented.
9.1.2. Multiplicity Adjustment
There will be 2 group comparisons for the primary endpoint: 5-day regimen of 
PF-07321332/ritonavir versus placebo groups and 10-day regimen of PF-07321332/ritonavir versus placebo groups. Multiplicity adjustment for the primary endpoint will be made for multiple comparisons using Hochberg method.

If the primary  endpoint is significant for both treatment groups, the key  secondary  endpoint 
will be tested at full alpha level using Hochberg method65to adjust for multiple comparisons 
for both treatment groups.
If one of PF -07321332/ritonavir arms is discontinued, sequential testing will be performed in

9.2.Analysis Sets
For purposes of analy sis, the following anal ysis sets are defined:
Participant Analysis Set Description
Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) All participants randomly  assigned to study  intervention.
Safety  Anal ysis Set All participants randomly  assigned to study  intervention 
and who take at least 1 dose of study  intervention. 
Participants will be anal yzed according to the study 
intervention they  received.
Modified Intent -To-Treat
(mITT)All participants randomly  assigned to study  intervention 
who take at least 1 dose of study  intervention and have a 
negative RT -PCR result at baseline .  
Participants will be anal yzed according to the study 
intervention they  were randomized.

Page 76Participant Analysis Set Description
Per-Protocol (PP) All participants in the mITT set without important protocol 
deviations considered to impact the interpretation of the 
primary  efficacy endpoint. Protocol deviations will be 
reviewed to generate the list of participants with significant 
deviations to be excluded from the PP analy sis set. The PP 
exclusion criteria will be finalized prior to breaking the 
blind.
9.3. Statistical Analyses
The SA P will be developed and finalized before any  anal yses are performed and will 
describe the anal yses and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. 
This section is a summary of the planned statistical analy ses of the primary  and second ary 
endpoints.
9.3.1. General Considerations
The number of participants randomized to the double -blind treatment phase , completing the 
study  drug administration, and completing the study  will be summarized from the FAS. The 
reason for discontinuations will be sum marized by treatment group. 
Baseline demographic and other characteristics will be tabulated for the FAS and 
summarized by  treatment group. Quantitative variables will be described by  standard 
descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum), and qualitative 
variables will be summarized by  frequency  tables with number and proportion in each 
category .
For continuous endpoints, an MMRM or ANCOVA model will be used to anal yze change 
from baseline, whichever is appropriate. Estimated mean differences between treatments 
groups will be calculated.
For categorical endpoints, proportion of participants for each category  will be summarized 
for each group.
For count endpoints, the total number of the events and average number of events will be 
summarized for each group. 
Time to event will be summarized graphicall y using Kaplan -Meier plots for each of the 
treatment groups. Treatment comparisons will be conducted using Cox proportional hazard 
model .

Page 77Below are the combinations of RT- PCR and rapid antigen test results that may  be available 
for a participant and how these results would be considered toward confirming SARS- CoV -2 
infection in anal yses of the primary  and relevant secondary  endpoints.  
the first instance of a positive RT -PCR with either a positive or negative rapid antigen 
test, or
the first instance of a positive rapid antigen test with a negative RT -PCR test.
If only  1 test is available, infection is defined as a positive result (RT -PCR or rapid antigen 
test).
Considering the frequency (daily  Day s 1-14 and at COVID -19 signs and s ymptoms onset 
visits) and greater sensitivity  for RT -PCR testing relative to the rapid antigen test, it is 
anticipated that the majority  of primary  endpoint events will be confirmed with a positive 
RT-PCR result .
9.3.2. Primary Endpoint(s)/Estimand(s) Analysis
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be conducted using the mITT anal ysis set. 
For the primary  efficacy  anal ysis, GEE will be used to anal yze the proportion of participants 
with a negative RT -PCR result at baseline who develop a s ymptomatic RT -PCR or rapid 
antigen test -confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection through Day  14 for each treatment group. The 
compound sy mmetry variance -covariance structure will be used to account for the correlation 
among the participants associated with the same index case. The risk ratio between 5 -day 
regimen of PF -07321332/ritonavir versus placebo group and 10 -day regimen of 
PF-07321332/ritonavir versus placebo group and the corresponding 95% CIs will be 
calculated based on the GEE model using a log link function. Comparisons between the 
5-day and 10 -day regimens of PF -07321332/ritonavir versus placebo will be presented as a 
risk reduction wi th 95% CI s, which is calculated as 1 minus the risk ratio.
A symptomatic infection event is defined as having any  SARS -CoV -2 symptoms 1 day  prior 
to,on,or after the first RT-PCR or rapid antigen test -confirmed infection. For COVID - 19 
related hospitalization or COVID -19-related death, it will be considered as achieving the 
event. 
Multiplicity  adjustment for primary  endpoint will be made for multiple comparisons using 
Hochberg method. 65
Significance level will be determined using the O’Brien -
Fleming approach at the interim 
analysis and the final analy sis. The overall ty pe I error rate is maintained at 5% (2 -sided).
Sensitivity  analy ses will be performed to the primary  efficacy  endpoint using PP anal ysis set.

Page 809.4.Interim Analyses
An interim anal ysis will be conducted for efficacy, futility , and sample size re -estimation and 
reviewed b y an independent E-DMC after a prespecified accrual of participants (ie, before or 
at approximately  70% overall participants have completed the Day  14 assessments with a 
minimum number of 24 participants having s ymptomatic infection [mI TT anal ysis set] ). The 
nominal significance level for the interim and final anal yses is determined by  means of the 
Lan-DeMets procedure with an O’Br ien-Fleming stopping boundary , with an overall 
two-sided ty pe I error rate of 5%. O’Brien -Fleming approach provides relatively  conservative 
stopping boundary  for decision making, ie, the nominal level for interim analy sis for efficacy  
and futility  is 0.014 and 0.32 . The nominal significance level for final analysis is 0.046. The 
actual stopping boundaries will depend on the exact number of participants included in the 
interim analy sis.
At the predefined interim anal ysis, the sample size may  be adjusted ba sed on sample size 
re-
estimation with maximum increase of 30%. A well -established method such as CHW66
will be used to control the Ty pe I error probability. Besides stopping a 
PF-07321332/ritonavir arm for safet y or futility , a PF -07321332/ritonavir arm ( 5-day or 
10-day regimen) may  be discontinued based on overall evaluation of efficacy  and safet y 
profiles between the 2 arms.
Before an y interim anal ysis is performed, the details of the objectives, decision criteria, 
dissemination plan, and method of maint aining the study  blind as per Pfizer’s SOPs will be 
documented and approved in a DMC charter. In addition, the analy sis details will be 
documented and approved in the SAP.
9.5.Sample Size Determination
Based on the results from Study  C4671005, which showed 
PF-07321332/ritonavir treatment 
significantl y reduced the risk of hospitalization or death from an y cause b y 89% compared 
with placebo in nonhospitalized sy mptomatic adult participants with COVID -19 who were at 
increased risk of progression to severe disea se when they  were treated within 3 day s of 
symptom onset, and the high relative risk reduction (approximately  80%) observed in 
Regeneron REGEN -COV post -exposure proph ylaxisstudy , the risk reduction between 
PF-07321332/ritonavir group versus placebo group is assumed to be 70%. The symptomatic 
infection rate assumption in the placebo group is adjusted to 4% based on theobserved 
seropositivity  rate in this study and the impact of seropositivity  on the incidence of primary  
endpoint events in the REGEN -COV pos t-exposure proph ylaxis study  where the incidence of 
symptomatic infection was 2% in participants who were seropositive and 8% in those who 
were seronegative .2As of January  2022, a large percentage of participants were observed to 
be seropositive . Based on a 2% placebo event rate for participants who were seropositive and 
8% placebo rate for participants who were seronegative observed in the REGEN -COV 
postexposure prophy laxis study ,2the expected placebo rate across the 2 groups is estimated 
to be approximately  3%. In addition, based upon emerging epidemiology  data for the 
Omicron variant ,34which suggests higher infectivity  than with prior variants, the placebo rate 
is adjusted to be 4%.

Page 81Among baseline RT -PCR negative participants, assuming a 4% s ymptomatic infection rate in 
the placebo group, a 70% reduction in sy mptomatic infection ( 1.2% s ymptomatic infection 
rate) in the PF -07321332/ritonavir group (5 -day and 10 -day regimen), a sample size of 
821participants per group ( 2463 participants total) will provide approximately  90% power 
for each comparison between 5 -day and 10
-day regimens of PF -07321332/ritonavir group 
versus placebo group under a 2 -sided t ype-1 error rate of 5%. Assuming approximately  5% 
of participants with negative rapid antigen test result at screening will have a positive 
RT-PCR result at baseline, and assuming an approxim ately  10% dropout rate, the total 
sample size for this study will be approximately  2880 participants.
Study  enrollment will stop once approximately  2463 participants are evaluable and at least 
34 participants had s ymptomatic infection for the primary  anal ysis. However, enrollment 
may continue until the 70% interim anal ysis has been completed.

Plan, which is maintained by  the sponsor.
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF.
Study  monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the CRF by  authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study  is 
being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other stud y 
agreements, I CH GCP guidelines, and all applicable regulatory  requirements.
10.1.9. Study and Site Start and Closure
The study  start date is the date on which the clinical study  will be open for recruitment of 
participants.
The first act of recruitment is the date of the first participant’s first visit and will be the study  
start date.
The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study  site or terminate the study  at any  
time for an y reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study  sites will be closed upon study  
completion. A study  site is considered closed when all required documents and study  
supplies have been collected and a stud y-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may  initiate study -site clo sure at any  time upon notification to the sponsor 
or designee/CRO if requested to do so by  the responsible I RB/EC or if such termination is 
required to protect the health of study  participants.
Reasons for the earl y closure of a stud y site b y the sponsor m ay include but are not limited 
to:
Failure of the investigator to comply  with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or the ICH GCP 
guidelines;
Inadequate recruitment of participants by  the investigator; 
Discontinuation of further study  intervention development.
If the stud y is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the ECs/IRBs, the regulatory  authorities, and any  CRO(s) used in the study  of 
thereason for termination or suspension, as specified by  the applicable regulatory  
requirements. The investigator shall promptly  inform the participant and should assure 
appropriate participant therap y and/or follow -up.

10.1.10. Publication Policy
The results of this study  may  be published or presented at scientific meetings b y the 
investigator after publication of the overall study  results or 1 y ear after the end of the study  
(or study  termination), whichever comes first. 
The investigator agrees to refer to the primary  publication in any  subsequent publications, 
such as secondary  manuscripts, and submits all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor 
30days before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary  information and to 
provide comments, and the investigator will, on request, remove an y previously undisclosed 
confidential information before disclosure, except for any  study -or Pfizer 
intervention -related information necessary  for the appropriate scientific presentation or 
understanding of the study  results.
For all publications relating to the stud y, the investigator will compl y with recognized ethical 
standards concerning publications and authorship, including those established by  the 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
The sponsor will comply  with the requirements for publication of the overall study  results 
covering all investigator sites. I n accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the 
sponsor will support publication of multicenter studies only  in their entirety and not as 
individual site data. I n this case, a coordinati ng investigator will be designated b y mutual 
agreement.
Authorship of publications for the overall study  results will be determined by  mutual 
agreement and in line with I nternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship 
requirements. 
If publica tion is addressed in the clinical study  agreement, the publication policy  set out in 
this section will not apply.

Evaluatin g, Follow -Up, and Reporting
10.3.1. Definition of AE
AE Definition
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study 
participant, temporall y associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not 
considered related to the study  intervention.
Note: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally
 associated with the use of study  intervention.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. An y abnormal laboratory test 
results that meet an y of the conditions below must be recorded as an AE:
Is associated with accompany ing s ymptoms.
Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention.
Leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional 
concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New condition detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration, even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug- drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE or SAE unless it is an int entional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of 
sequelae.

PF-07321332
Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 93Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments that are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/di sorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
10.3.2. Definition of an SAE
An SAE is defined as any u ntoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one 
or more of the criteria listed below:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
In general, hospitalization signifies that the part icipant has been admitted (usually  
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency  ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur durin g hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.

Protocol C4671006
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 25 January 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 94Hospitalizatio n for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), that may  interfere wi th or 
prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Is a suspected transmission via a Pfizer product of an infectious agent, pathogenic 
or non- pathogenic, is considered serious.  
g.Theevent may  be suspected from clinical s ymptoms or laboratory  findings indicating 
an infection in a participant exposed to a Pfizer product. The terms “suspected 
transmission” and “transmission” are considered sy nony mous. These cases are 
considered unexpect ed and handled as serious expedited cases b y pharmacovigilance 
personnel. Such cases are also considered for reporting as product defects, if 
appropriate.
h.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the investigator in deciding
whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as significant 
medical events that may jeopardize the participant or may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definition. These eve nts should usually  be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, o r development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse.
10.3.3. Recording/Reporting and Follow -Up of AEs and/or SAEs During the Active 
Collection Period 
AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording AEs on the CRF and for 
reporting SAEs on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safet y throughout the active

Page 95collection period. These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of events: (1) SAEs; (2) 
nonse rious AEs; and (3) exposure to the study  intervention under stud y during pregnancy  
or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. 
It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not 
the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE 
Report Form for reporting of SAE information.

*EDP (with or without an associated AE or SAE): any pregnancy information is reported to 
Pfizer Safety using CT SAE Report Form and EDP Supplemental Form; if the EDP is 
associated with an SAE, then the SAE is reported to Pfizer Safety using the CT SAE Report 
Form . 
** EDB is reported to Pfizer Safety using the CT SAE Report Form which w ould also include 
details of any SAE that mig ht be associated w ith the EDB.

Page 96When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investig ator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory  reports, and diagnostic 
reports) related to the event.
The investigator will then record all relevant AE or SAE information in the CRF.
It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s 
medical records to Pfizer Safety  in lieu of completion of the CT SAE Report 
Form/AE or SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y Pfizer Safety. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the 
exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical 
records before submission to Pfizer Safety .
The investigator will attempt to establish a diag nosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE or SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories, which are based on the 
Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity  of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events,64version 2.1 (July 2017):
GRADE Clinical Description of Severity
1 MILD adverse event
2 MODERATE adverse event
3 SEVERE adverse event
4 POTENTIALLY LIFE -THREATENING event 
5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE or SAE. The investigator will use clinical 
judgment to determine the relationship.
A “reasonable possibility” of a r elationship convey s that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 97Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other 
risk factors, as well a s the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration, will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE or SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE or SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality 
for every event be fore the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.
The investigator may  change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality  
assessment.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
If the investigator does not know whether or not the study  intervention caused the 
event, then the event will be handled as “related to study  intervention” for reporting 
purposes, as defined by  the sponsor. In addition, if the investigator determines that 
an SAE is associated with study  procedures, the investigator must record this 
causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an 
assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance 
with the SAE reporting requirements.
Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations, as medically  indicated or as requested by  the 
sponsor, to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as full y as 
possible. This may  include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare providers.
If a participant dies during participation in the study  or during a recognized 
follow -up period, the investigator will provide Pfizer Safet y with a cop y of any 
postmortem findings, including histopathology .

Page 98New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  submitted 
documents.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours 
of receipt of the information.
10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs
SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting an SAE to Pfizer Safety  will be the 
electronic data collection tool.
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool ( see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.
The site will ent er the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as the data 
become available.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will 
be taken off -line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
If a sit e receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated 
data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see 
next secti on) or to Pfizer Safety  by telephone.
SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via CT SAE Report Form
Facsimile transmission of the CT SAE Report Form is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to Pfizer Safety .
In circumstances when the facsimile is not working, notification by  telephone is 
acceptable with a cop y of the CT SAE Report Form sent by  overnight mail or 
courier service.
Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the CT SAE Report F orm pages within the designated reporting 
time frames.

10.4.1. Male Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria
Male participants are eligible to participate if they  agree to the following requirements during 
the int ervention period and for at least 28 day safter the last dose of stud y intervention, which
corresponds to the time needed to eliminate reproductive safet y risk of the study  
intervention(s) :
Refrain from donating sperm.
PLUS either :
Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse with a female of childbearing potential as 
their preferred and usual lifesty le (abstinent on a long -term and persistent basis) and 
agree to remain abstinent. 
OR
Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below:
Agree to use a male condom when having sexual intercourse with a woman of 
childbearing potential who is not currently  pregnant.
In addition to male condom use, a highl y effective method of contraception may be 
considered in WOCBP partners of male participants (refe r to the list of highly  
effective methods below in Section 10.4.4).
10.4.2. Female Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteri a
A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at 
least 1 of the following conditions applies:
Is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in 
Section 10.4.3).
OR
Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly  effective (with a 
failure rate of <1% per year), as described below, during the intervention period 
and for at least 28 day safter the last dose of stud y intervention, which 
corresponds to the time needed to eliminate an y reproductive safety  risk of the 
study  intervention(s). If a highl y effective method that is user depend ent is 
chosen, a second effective method of contraception, as described below, must also
be used. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive 
method in relationship to the first dose of stud y intervention.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 100Because ritonavir may  reduce the effect of estradiol- containing contraceptives when agents 
are coadministered, a barrier method or other nonhormonal method of contraception must 
also be used if the participant is using estradiol -containing contraceptives.
The investigator is re sponsible for review of medical history , menstrual history , and recent 
sexual activity  to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an earl y undetected 
pregnancy . 
10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and u
ntil becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below).
If fertility  is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot 
be confirmed before the first dose of study  intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are notconsidered WOCBP:
1.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
Documented h ysterectomy ;
Documented bilateral salpingectomy ;
Documented bilateral oophorectom y.
For individuals with permanent infertility  due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study  entry .
Note: Documentation for any  of the above categories can come from the site personnel’s 
review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history  
interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant’s medical 
record for the stud y.
2.Postmenopausal female:
A postmenopausal sta te is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  I n addition:
A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range must be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women under 50 years of age and not using hormonal 
contraception or HRT. 
A female on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods

Page 101if they  wish to continue their HRT during the study . Otherwise, they  must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  
enrollment.
10.4.4. Contraception Methods
Contraceptive use b y men or women should be consistent with local availability /regulations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical t rials.
1.Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation.
2.Intrauterine device.
3.Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem.
4. Bilateral tubal occlusion (eg, bilateral tubal ligation).
5.Vasectomized partner:
A vasectomized partner is a highl y effective contraceptive method provided that 
the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and 
the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highl y effective 
method of contraception shoul d be used. The spermatogenesis cy cle is 
approximately  90 day s.
6.Combined (estrogen- and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral;
Intravaginal;
Transdermal.
7.Progestogen -only hormone contraception associate d with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral;
Injectable.
8.Sexual abstinence:
Sexual abstinence is considered a highl y effective method only  if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study  interventi on. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be

Male or female condom with or without spermicide;
Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide;
A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with 
spermicide (double -barrier methods).
Because ritonavir may  reduce the effect of estradiol- containing contraceptives when agents 
are coadministered, a barrier method or other non -
hormonal method of contraception must 
also be used if the participant is using estradiol -containing contraceptives.

Study Intervention Rechallenge Guidelines
Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  elevations in 
transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury  but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.” In som e participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a 
more serious potential outcome. These participants fail to adapt and therefore are 
"susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonl y referred to as DILI. 
Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 ×ULN should be monitored 
more frequently  to determine if they  are “adaptors” or are “susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or ALT precede TBili elevations (>2 ×
ULN) b y several days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are 
still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same 
laboratory  sample). In rare instances, by  the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT 
values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, 
abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria 
outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and 
should alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes 
of liver injury  have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and u nderly ing conditions. Participants who present 
with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI 
(Hy’s law) cases to definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Participants with AST/ALT an d TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available.
For participants with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values a bove the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3×ULN (whichever is smaller).

Page 105Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law ca se should be reviewed with the sponsor.
The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detaile d history , and physical assessment. 
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili for suspected Hy’s law 
cases, additional laboratory  tests should include albumin, CK, direct and indirect bilirubin, 
GGT, PT/INR, total bile acids, and alka line phosphatase. Consideration should also be given 
to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further 
testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analy ses at the time of the recognized initial 
abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such 
as review of ethanol, acetaminophen/paracetamol (either by  itself or as a coformulated 
product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , recreational drug, or supplement 
(herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , travel history, history  of contact 
with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic disease, and 
potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collecte d. Further testing for acute 
hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection, liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract), and collection of serum 
samples for acetaminophen /paracetamol drug and/or protein adduct levels may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have be en received and have excluded an alternative etiology .

Page 10710.8. Appendix 8: Prohibited Concomitant Medications That May Result in DDI  
PF-07321332 and ritonavir are both primarily  metabolized by  CYP3A4. Therefore, 
concomitant use of an y medications or substances that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 are 
prohibited within 28 days prior to dosing of stud y intervention and during study  treatment.
Additionally , ritonavir and PF -07321332 are inhibitors of CYP3A4. Therefore, medications 
highl y dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations 
may be associated with serious and/or life- threatening events are not permitted during dosing 
of PF -07321332/ritonavir (at le ast 24 hours prior to the first dose of study  intervention or as 
late as Day  1, prior to the first dose of study  intervention –see below) and for 4 day s after the 
last dose of PF- 07321332/ritonavir. Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 as well as other enzymes, including glucuronos yl 
transferase. Since ritonavir 100 mg q12h is being used to boost the exposure of 
PF-07321332, no additional DDI is expected other than those associated with ritonavir 
100mg q12h based on in vitro assessments. Thus, the prohibited concomitant medications 
and those to be used with caution are primaril y based on the ritonavir label.
A nonexhaustive list of prohibited and precautionary medications is provided below. If a 
medication is not list ed, it should not automatically be assumed it is safe to co -administer. 
Appropriatel y qualified site staff will review all concomitant medications to determine if they 
are prohibited.
The Pfizer study team is to be notified of any  prohibited medications ta ken during the stud y. 
After consulting with the sponsor, the investigator will make a judgement on the ongoing 
participation of an y participant with prohibited medication use during the study.
This list of drugs prohibited for potential DDI concerns with the IMP may  be revised during 
the course of the study  with written notification from sponsor, to include or exclude specific 
drugs or drug categories for various reasons (eg, emerging DDI results for the IMP, 
availability  of new information in literature on the DDI potential of other drugs).  
This is not an all -inclusive list. Site staff should consult with the sponsor or designee with 
any questions regarding potential DDI.

Page 11910.12. Appendix 12: Country Specific Requireme nts
10.12.1. Japan
A Protocol Administrative Change Letter was issued on 22 July 2021 to provide Japan 
country  specific guidance regarding Exclusion Criterion #5 .
Exclusion Criterion #5: Known HIV infection with a viral load >400 copies/mL  or taking 
prohibited med ications for HIV treatment (from known medical history within past 6 months 
of the screening visit).
If HIV infection is known by  medical interview or examination results (if any ), the 
investigators must consult with the patient’s HIV treatment specialist to confirm that the HIV 
RNA level has been monitored at an appropriate frequency  and the HIV RNA level has been 
≤400 copies/mL  during the past 6 months before the screening visit in order to assess the 
study  eligibility  of that patient.
Rationale: There is a risk for patients with uncontrolled HIV to develop resistance to 
ritonavir which is being administered with PF -07321332. According to the HIV treatment 
guideline in Japan, even if there is an occasional increase in the amount of HIV RNA in the 
blood to about 20 -500 copies/mL , the same treatment may  be continued. The guideline 
recommends a resistance test when HIV RNA levels exceed 500 copies/mL.

A Protocol Administrative Change Letter was issued on 26 Oct 2021 to provide Bulgaria 
country  specifi c guidance regarding exclusion criteria 3 and 5 on participants with known 
hepatitis B or C infection (chronic or active) or poorly controlled HIV (viral load >400 
copies/mL  within the last 6 months).
Per guidance from Bulgarian regulatory  authorities, hep atitis B and C and HIV testing must

A Protocol Administrative Change Letter was issued on 22 Dec 2021 to provide Ukraine 
country  specific guidance regarding nasal swab collection.
As per Ministry  of Health of Ukraine Order # 722 dated 28 -Mar-2020, requirement is made 
to have diagnostic tests for COVID- 19 performed by  a healthcare professional. The change 
being made in this letter is to shift from nasal swab self collection b y the pa rticipants to nasal 
swab collection performed by a healthcare professional .
Revised note on Nasal Swab from section 1.3 (deletions in strikethrough)
At baseline, a nasal swab will be selfcollected by  the participant to determine RT -
PCR status (+ or -); this test will not be used to determine study  eligibility . The 
sample will be collected under observation by  site staff to ensure correct collection 
method. Thereafter, nasal swabs will be selfcollected by the participant at about the 
same time each day , preferabl y in the morning. 
Nasal swabs will be selfcollected from Day  1 to 14 including day s when a study  visit 
occurs (**including at unplanned visits).
Revised first paragraph from section 8.6.4.2 (deletions in strikethrough, additions in bold): 
The first nasal swab will be self collected b y the participant under observation by site staff to 
ensure correct collection method. Thereafter, Nasal swabs will be self collected by  a 
healthcare professional the participant at about the same time each day , preferabl y in the 
morning. If an in -person visit occurs on the same day  as self collection of the nasal swab, the 
nasal swab self -collection should be done prior to the visit. 
Additional swabs may  be required at the visit on day s for which an in -person visit occurs (eg, 
COVID -19 Signs/S ymptoms Onset visit). Participants A healthcare professional should 
collect conduct the nasal swab self-collection for Viral Load Assessment by central lab 
prior to any other swab on the day s described in the SoA, including those for which an in -
person visit is scheduled.
It is noted that the PACL dated 14 December 2021 is not applicable in Ukraine .

The Protocol Amendment Summary  of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly  before the table of contents (TOC).  The protocol amendment summary  of changes 
tables for past amendment(s) can be found below:
Overall Rationale for the Amendment 1: 
The protocol was amended to modify  the eligibility  criteria for the study  to exclude Rapid 
Antigen Test positive participants, modify  the primary  anal ysis set, and provide clearer 
guidance for assessment of participants who develop sy mptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection. 
Section # and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale
3. Objectives, Endpoints, 
and Estimands
9. Statistical 
ConsiderationsPrimary analysis set limited to 
participants who have a negative 
RT-PCR result at baseline.
Primary and secondary 
estimand/endpoints adapted to 
include adults who have a 
negative RT -PCR result at 
baseline, as applicable.
Additional detail provided in 
description of primary and key 
secondary analyses including 
intercurrent event.By excluding participants with a 
positive RT -PCR result at baseline 
from the primary analysis set, this 
analysis more accurately reflects 
postexposure prophylaxis.
Addition of intercurrent events 
provides greater clarity to the 
analysis of primary and key 
secondary endpoints.

4.1 Overall Design
9.5. Sample Size 
DeterminationIncreased sample size Increased sample size accounts for 
participants who have a negative 
screening antigen test, but who 
subsequently have a positive 
RT-PCR result at baseline. 
4.1. Overall Design Removal of stratification 
variable based on rapid antigen 
test.Removal of this stratum accounts 
for exclusion of participants who 
have a positive screening antigen
test.

results. 
10.9. Signs and 
Symptoms Attributable 
to COVID -19Addition of loss of taste and loss 
of smell to exclusionary 
symptoms and to symptoms that

analyses.Loss of taste/smell is a frequent 
first symptom associated with 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.
5.2. Exc lusion Criteria Exclusion of participants with 
history of positive test for anti -
SARS -CoV -2 antibody. Exclusion of participants with 
history of positive SARS -CoV -2 
antibody test will reduce factors 
that may obscure treatment effect. 
5.2. Exclusion Criteria Addition of approved, authorized 
or investigational 
anti-SARS -CoV -2 treatments to 
the list of prohibited medications 
for study entry.Increases focus of eligibility on 
postexposure prophylaxis.

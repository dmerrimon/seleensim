Clinical Phase: II
Rationale: The Post -traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Psychopharmacology 
Working Group has recently called for novel, effective and efficient 
trauma -focused interventions and has labelled current treatment outcomes 
as “the Crisis in th e Pharmacotherapy of Post -traumatic Stress Disorder”.1
MDMA -assisted psychotherapy has recently received Breakthrough 
Therapy designation (BTD) by the FDA for PTSD, implying that 
psychedelic -assisted psychotherapies may provide better outcomes for 
patients than the current standard of care. Psilocybin therapy with 
COMP360 (COMPASS Pathways’ propri etary synthetic psilocybin 
formulation) has received si milar BTD for treatment -resistant depression, 
a condition often comorbid with PTSD.  It is therefore reasonable to 
obtain proof of feasib ility for COMP360 th erapy for PTSD.  If 
demonstrated safe and well to lerated, COMP360 therapy may offer a 
powerful alternative to MDMA -assisted psychotherapy in reducing PTSD 
symptoms.

Study Design and 
Procedures:This is a phase II, multicentre, fixed -dose open label trial. The study 
population will include adult men and women outpatients, 18 years of age 
and older meeting Diagnosti c and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(5thEdition; DSM- 5) diagnostic criteria for PTSD after a traumatic event 
experienced during adulthood. 
After signing the informed consent form  (ICF), participants will be 
assessed for their eligibility with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview , version 7.0.2 (MINI 7.0.2), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5
(PCL -5), Life Events Checklists for DSM-5 (LEC- 5), the Childhood 
Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating
Scale ( C-SSRS) . Those who meet the eligibil ity criteria will enter the 
screening period. Additionally, a medical history, an electrocardiogram 
(ECG), blood tests, and vital signs w ill be obtained. Participants will be 
offered the option of enrolling in the neuroimaging component of the 
study. Participation in this part of the study is optional , and participants 
who do not consent to neuroimaging will not be excluded from the study. 
If participants consent to neuroimaging , they will be assessed for 
additional eligibility criteria for the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
scan. 
During the screening period, participants who are on antidepressant 
and/or antipsychotic medications will be expected to complete taper ing of 
these medications at least 2 weeks prior to baseline. Participants will be 
given a choice of the tapering rate. During the tapering period all 
participants will be supported by the study clinician. 
Once the participant has been evaluated  as eligible, they are invited to 
enter the screening period visits. During the first of these visits the 
participant begins tapering off their antidepressant and/or antipsychotic 
medications, if appropriate. The participant must complete the taper within the first 4 weeks of this peri od, prior to 2 weeks completely off 
antidepressant and/or antipsychotic med ications, before the baseline visit.
Section 10.3 describes guidance for antidepressant and antipsychotic 
medications requiring immediate cessation at 
screening V1a followed by 
at least four weeks of washout prior to baseline. 
The designated study team member will be in frequent contact with the
participants to monitor for withdrawal and worsening of symptoms. The 
participant will meet with a therapist during screening .These are safety 
sessions and will contribute to th e participant’s preparation for the 
COMP360 administration session.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023  Participants discontinuing antidepressant and/or antipsychotic 
medications during the screening period w ill be evaluated for safety at the 
clinic weekly for a minimum of three weeks prior to COMP360 
administration to ensure safe discon tinuation of current antidepressant 
therapy required by the protocol. Participants not discontinuing 
antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medications during the screening 
period will visit the clinic weekly for a minimum of two weeks prior to 
COMP360 administration . For all participants, preparation sessions with 
a therapist will take place at the final two screening period visits and a 
final preparation session will take  place at baseline. Participants 
discontinuing antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medications mus t have 
completed washout before the first preparation session. Participants’ 
companions (carers, friends, or family members) may be educated about 
the signs of worsening of PTSD and su icidality and instructed on ways to 
contact the study team in case of significant worsening. During these 
visits the C -SSRS, the M odified Discontinuation Emergent Signs and 
Symptoms Scale (mDESS), and any changes in medications since the 
previous visit will be obtained in addition to other assessments at the study 
clinician’ s discretion. The designated study team member will contact the 
participant by phone calls in between in clinic visits during screening 
period to monitor for withdrawal and worsening of symptoms.
The day before the administration session, the participants will undergo a 
baseline assessment ( 2 to 6 weeks after beginning screening period ) that 
will consist of the Clinician- Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5
(CAPS -5), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), EuroQuol- 5 Dimensions- 5
Levels ( EQ-5D-5L), C-SSRS, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale –Positive 
symptom subscale (BPRS+), Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma 
(PACT), Resilience Adult Scale (RAS), a semi -structured interview on 
the management of their PTSD, vital si gns, urinalysis, urine drug screen, 
and urine pregnancy test (only for women of childbearing potential). After 
baseline data are collected and entered in the Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) , the Clinical Assessment Technologies Team (CAT) team will
complete a final review to ensure the participant’s continued eligibility. 
Participants cannot be progressed to the administration session until this 
approval is received. Full descriptions  of the activities carried out during 
the therapist sessions can be found in the Therapist Manual. Those who 
agreed to take part in the optional neuroimaging component of the study 
and met the eligibility criteria  will be offered an MRI scan .To reduce 
participant burden on baseline visit, th e MRI scan can be organised within 
7 days prior to the baseline visit. The investigator will be responsible for
confirming eligibility of the participant before MRI. 
The following day, the participants w ill attend the clinic for the dosing 
session that will last approximately 6 -8hours and will be supported by 
two designated trained therapists. Participants will receive 25 mg 
COMP360. A full description of the activities of the administration 
session is found in the Therapist Manual. After the acute effects of 
COMP360 pass, participants will complete the Five-Dimensional Alt ered 
States of Consciousness ( 5D-ASC), and will be evaluated for safety and 
accompanied home. On the following day,  participants will be seen in 
person for a safety check, assessment of suicidality, and to discuss their 
experience during the dosing session (integration). During this visit,

Page 7 of 88
 
Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023  participants will complete a semi-stru ctured interview on the acceptability 
of the therapeutic intervention and the severity of PTSD symptoms will
be evaluated using the PCL -5. All sessions between the therapists and the 
participant may be audio recorded , and the administration session may be 
video recorded, for research, adherence monitoring, and quality 
assurance. Audio and video recording of the sessions are subject to 
participant consent. Participants who do not consent to either or all 
recordings will not be e xcluded from the study. 
All participants will be asked to remain off medications for their PTSD 
symptoms for at least 4weeks following the administration session. 
Rescue medications are allowed as not ed in the protocol. Participants who 
restart their med ications during the first 4 weeks after the dosing session 
will be assessed for reasons of resuming their medications and followed 
until 12 weeks post COMP360 administr ation. Participants will be seen 
at the clinic for screening (plus visits during the scr eening period as 
required by the protocol), baseline, da y 1, day 2, week 1, week 2, week 4,
and week 12 visits . Participants will also be contacted for a remote follow-
up at week 6 and week 9. The option of an in clinic visit at weeks 6 and 9 
will also be available. See Section 5.3 for a full schedule of assessments.
Participants who agreed to the optional neuroimaging component of the 
study will be offered an MRI scan at week 4.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 20231 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
Background information for the investigati onal product is provided in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).2
Background
COMP360 is COMPASS’ proprietary formulation of synthetic psilocybin. Psilocybin 
belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics (meaning ‘mind manifesting’). 
Specifically, psilocybin is considered a 5-hydroxytryptaminergic (serotonergic) psychedelic, along with other tryptamines su ch as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ergolines 
such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and phenethylamines such as mescaline.
Study Rationale
PTSD is a serious debilitating condition, highly impactful on quality of life, resulting in 
diminished cognitive and psychosocial functi oning, fractured relationships, inability to 
maintain employment, substance abuse, high  healthcare utilisation costs, increased 
depression, and suicide risk. People who experience PTSD relive their traumatic experience(s) through nightmare s and flashbacks, have difficulty sleeping, and feel 
detached or estranged. Despite the fact that sy mptoms can be severe and long lasting, there 
are currently no effective treatments for PTSD.
1
International guidelines recommend psychological interventions (such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy or eye movement  desensitisation and reprocessing) as first-
line treatments for PTSD followed by phar macological approaches, aiming to improve 
mood and reducing hyperarousal.
3,4Serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are 
recommended by guidelines as second-line tre atments, but despite being effective in some 
cases, about 40% of those with PTSD will not improve after treatment.5
The PTSD Psychopharmacology Working Group has recently called for novel, effective and efficient trauma-focused interventions a nd has labelled current treatment outcomes as 
“the Crisis in the Pharmacotherapy of Post -traumatic Stress Disorder” .
1MDMA-assisted 
psychotherapy has recently been designated as a Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD)by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PTSD, implying that psychedelic-assisted 
psychotherapies may provide better outcomes for p atients than the current standard of care.  
COMP360 therapy has received similar BTD for treatment-resistant depression, a condition often comorbid with PTSD. It is therefore reasonable to obtain proof of 
feasibility for COMP360 for PTSD. If demo nstrated to be safe and well tolerated, 
COMP360 may offer a powerful alternative to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in reducingPTSD symptoms.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023  In this study, the aim is to assess the safety  and tolerability, and explore efficacy of 
administration of a single dose of COMP360 25 mg under supportive conditions in 
participants with PTSD.
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacokinetics of a different form of psilocybin (non-COMP360) were studied in 
12 healthy adult subjects who received single oral doses of 0.3, 0.45, or 0.6 mg/kg at
minimal intervals of 4 weeks.6The results suggested rapi d luminal and first pass 
dephosphorylation of psilocybin to its active metabolite, psilocin. Plasma exposures of psilocin were linear within the dose range  tested and the elimination half-life of psilocin 
was 3 h (standard deviation [SD] ± 1.1 h). Variati on in psilocin exposure was not predicted 
by body weight; therefore, a fixed oral psilocybin dose of 25 mg is expected to result in psilocin exposure (based on the area under the curve [AUC] and C
max) similar to that 
demonstrated after an individualised 0.3 mg/k g oral dose. At the 0.3 mg/kg dose, the AUC 
was 140 Pg h/L (interquartile range [IQR] 102  - 175), the plasma psilocin C maxwas 16 
Pg/L (IQR 14.5-17.2) and T maxwas 2.03 h (1.15 - 2.07). No psilocybin was found in plasma 
or urine, and renal clearance of intact psilocin accounted for less than 2% of the total 
clearance. An extended elimination phase in  some subjects suggests potential for 
hydrolysis of psilocin glucuronide metabolite.
Available results of COMP360 and previously p ublished information on different forms of 
psilocybin from in vitro assays and rodent studies demonstrate broadly similar 
pharmacokinetics to human studies after a single dose.
The subjective intensity of the psychedelic ef fects of a different form of psilocybin (non-
COMP360) have been shown to c orrelate with plasma levels of psilocin and its levels of 
occupancy of 5-HT 2Areceptors.7The psychedelic effects of psilocybin can be blocked with 
ketanserin, a 5-HT 2Areceptor antagonist.8Thus, the pharmacokinetics of psilocin and 
concomitant activation of 5-HT 2Areceptors appears to be closely associated with the 
psychedelic effects of psilocybin.1.2.2 Clinical Adverse Event ProfileThe safety of COMP360 should be considered in terms of benefit and risk. Within the 
context of COMP360 administration in a cont rolled setting with psychological support, a 
participant may report visual or auditory distu rbances, perceptual distortions, altered sense 
of time, and other changes in mood or affect amongst other neuropsychiatric observations
which have been previously described.
15These effects are both expected, and may be a 
necessary component of therapeutic response. Investigators must follow regulatory guidance for AE reporting which addresses untoward medical occurrences associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or not co nsidered drug related. An AE can be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (eg an abn ormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023  Results from COMPASS’ completed trial in heal thy volunteers (COMP 002, EudraCT 
number: 20180999878-30) suggests that COMP360 is generally well tolerated. There were 
no SAEs and no AEs led to study withdrawal. In total, 511 TEAEs were reported over the 
12-week study duration across the 89 participan ts. Of the 511 TEAEs, the majority had an 
onset and resolution on day 1. Of the 403 TEAEs that started on the day of dosing, 343 (85.4%) were resolved the same day.
1.2.3 Dosing Regimen
This study will evaluate a 25 mg single COMP360 dose administered under supportive 
conditions. 
Carhart-Harris- successfully evaluated tw o oral doses of psilocybin (non-COMP360) (10 
mg and 25 mg) administered seven days apar t to patients with unipolar TRD. Minimal AEs 
were reported in this study.
9Work by the Griffiths group showed that under supportive 
conditions, psilocybin at doses of 20 to 30 mg/70 kg can dose dependently occasion 
mystical- -type experiences.10The doses successfully explored in cancer patients with 
mood and/or anxiety symptoms range between 14-30 mg/70 kg.10-12
COMPASS is currently running a phase IIb study to measure COMP360 efficacy on 
TRD symptoms using doses of 1 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg. Considering that depression is 
highly comorbid with PTSD, we expect a 25 mg dose to be adequate in this population 
for safety purposes.

Study Design
This is a phase II, multicentre, fixed-dose ope n label trial. The study population will include 
adult men and women outpatients, 18 years of age and older meeting Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5thEdition; DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for PTSD 
after a traumatic event ex perienced during adulthood. 
After signing the informed consent form (ICF), participants will be assessed for their 
eligibility with the Mini International Ne uropsychiatric Interview, version 7.0.2 (MINI 
7.0.2), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Life Events Checklists for DSM-5 (LEC-
5), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) a nd the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS). Those who meet the eligibility criteria will enter the screening period. 
Additionally, a medical history, an electroc ardiogram (ECG), blood tests, and vital signs 
will be obtained. Participants will be offer ed the option of enrolling in the neuroimaging 
component of the study. Participation in this part of the study is optional, and participants who do not consent to neuroimaging will not be  excluded from the study.  If participants 
consent to neuroimaging, they will be as sessed for additional eligibility criteria for the 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. 
During the screening period, participants who are on antidepressant and/or antipsychotic 
medications will be expected to complete tap ering of these medications at least 2 weeks 
prior to baseline. Participants will be given a choice of the tapering rate. During the tapering 
period all participants will be supported by the study clinician. Once the participant has been evaluated as eligible, they are invited to enter the screening 
period visits. During the first of these visits  the participant begins tapering off their 
antidepressant and/or antips ychotic medications, if appropri ate. The participant must 
complete the taper within the first 4 weeks of this period, prior to 2 weeks completely off 
antidepressant and/or an tipsychotic medications, before the baseline visit. Section 10.3
describes guidance for antidepressant and antipsychotic medications requiring immediate 
cessation at Screening V1a followed by at least four weeks of washout prior to baseline.
The designated study team member will be in frequent contact with the participants to 
monitor for withdrawal and worsening of sy mptoms. The participant will meet with a 
therapist during screening. These are safety sessi ons and will contribute to the participant’s 
preparation for the COMP360 administration session.
Participants discontinuing antidepressant a nd/or antipsychotic medications during the 
screening period will be evaluated for safety at the clinic weekly for a minimum of three 
weeks prior to COMP360 administration to ensure safe discontinuation of current 
antidepressant therapy required by the protocol. Participants not discontinuing 
antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medicati ons during the screening period will visit the 
clinic weekly for a minimum of two week s prior to COMP360 administration. For all

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023  participants, preparation sessions with a therap ist will take place at the final two screening 
period visits and a final preparation session will take place at baseline. Participants 
discontinuing antidepressant  and/or antipsychotic medications must have completed 
washout before the first preparation session. P articipants’ companions (carers, friends, or 
family members) may be educated about th e signs of worsening of PTSD and suicidality 
and instructed on ways to contact the study team  in case of significant worsening. During 
these visits the C-SSRS, the Modified Di scontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms 
Scale (mDESS), and any changes in medications  since the previous visit will be obtained 
in addition to other assessments at the study clinician’s discretion. The designated study 
team member will contact the participant by phone  calls in between in clinic visits during 
screening period to monitor for withdrawal and worsening of symptoms.
The day before the administration session,  the participants will undergo a baseline 
assessment (2 to 6 weeks after beginning sc reening period) that will consist of the
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DS M-5 (CAPS-5), Sheehan Disability Scale 
(SDS), EuroQuol-5 Dimensions- 5 Levels (E Q-5D-5L), C-SSRS, BPRS+, Perceived 
Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT), Re silience Adult Scale (RAS ), a semi-structured 
interview on the management of their PTSD, vi tal signs, urinalysis, urine drug screen, and 
urine pregnancy test (only for women of childbe aring potential). After baseline data are
collected and entered in the Electronic Da ta Capture (EDC), the Clinical Assessment 
Technologies Team (CAT) team will complete a final review to ensure the participant’s 
continued eligibility. Participants cannot be  progressed to the administration session until 
this approval is received. Full descriptions  of the activities carried out during the therapist 
sessions can be found in the Therapist Manual.  Those who agreed to take part to the 
optional neuroimaging component of the study and met the eligibility criteria will be 
offered an MRI scan. To reduce participant bu rden on baseline visit, the MRI scan can be 
organised within 7 days prior to the baseline vi sit. The investigator will be responsible for
confirming eligibility of the participant before MRI. The following day, the participants will attend  the clinic for the dosing session that will 
last approximately 6-8 hours and will be support ed by two designated trained therapists. 
Participants will receive 25 mg COMP360. A full description of the activities of the 
administration session is found in the Therap ist Manual. After the acute effects of 
COMP360 pass, participants will complete th e Five-Dimensional Altered States of 
Consciousness (5D-ASC), and will be evaluated for safety and accompanied home. On the 
following day, participants will be seen in  person for a safety check, assessment of
suicidality, and to discuss their experience duri ng the dosing session (integration). During 
this visit, participants will complete a semi-structu red interview on the acceptability of the 
therapeutic intervention and the severity of PTSD symptoms will be evaluated using the 
PCL-5. All sessions between the therapists a nd the participant may be audio recorded, and 
the administration session may be video recorde d, for research, adherence monitoring, and 
quality assurance. Audio and video recording of  the sessions are subject to participant 
consent. Participants who do not consent to either or all recordings will not be excluded from the study.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023  All participants will be asked to remain off  medications for their PTSD symptoms for at 
least 4 weeks following the administration se ssion. Rescue medications are allowed as 
noted in the protocol. Participants who restar t their medications during the first 4 weeks 
after the dosing session will be assessed for reasons of resuming their medications and 
followed until 12 weeks post COMP360 administ ration. Participants will be seen at the 
clinic for screening (plus safety visits during the screening period as required by the 
protocol), baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, week 2, week 4, and week 12 visits. Participants 
will also be contacted for a remote follow-up at week 6 and week 9. The option of an in clinic visit at weeks 6 and 9 will also be available. See Section 5.3 for a full schedule of 
assessments. Participants who agreed to th e optional neuroimaging component of the study 
will be offered an MRI scan at week 4.

Participant Screening 
Participants will be recruited primarily from the community and referring healthcare providers. 
Those participants considered potentially eligible for the study will be assessed to confirm 
eligibility after the participant has signed an ICF. Rescreening of participants considered not 
eligible for the study will be allowed. Decisions to  rescreen will be discussed on a case-by-case 
basis with the Medical Monitor and study investig ators. Participants who consent to take part 
in the optional neuroimaging portion of the study w ill be assessed to confirm eligibility with 
additional criteria specific for MRI. If the partic ipant does not meet the eligibility criteria for 
the neuroimaging, they will not be able to partic ipate to the MRI scanning, but they will still 
take part in the main study. 
Deviation from Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
No deviations will be permitted from the inclus ion or exclusion criteria. The investigator may 
call the Medical Monitor to discuss th e eligibility of any given participant.

The procedures to be performed throughout th e study are outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Section 5.3) .A detailed description of each assessment may be found in 
Section 8.
General Instructions
Participants will be outpatients and will be  recruited primarily from the community and 
referring healthcare providers. Those participants  considered eligible for the study will be 
further assessed to confirm eligibility after the participant has signed an ICF.
Study Procedures by Time Point  
7.2.1 Screening Period
The participant will be seen initially to evaluate suitability for the study. Participants requiring
medication washout will be seen at the clinic weekly for a minimum of three weeks prior to 
the baseline visit to ensure safe discontinuation of current antidepressant/antipsychotic
medications required by the protocol, and to conduct psychoeducation and preparation sessions. Participants not requiring medication was hout will be seen at the clinical weekly for 
a minimum of two visits to conduct psychoeducati on and preparation sessions. At the first 
screening visit (V1), the following assessments will be performed and recorded:
oICF
oMedical history
oPrior and current medications; the particip ant will be tapered from prohibited 
medications (see  Section 10.3) , if any, under the supervision of the study clinician
oReview of inclusion/exclusion criteria ( Section 6)

the participant’s mobile phone and activated 
All participants will undergo two in-person preparation sessions during the screening period,
where the designated therapist will use psychoeducational material. More details on the preparation sessions are in the Therapist Manual.
Once a participant completes all screening assessmen ts and all screening data is entered into 
the EDC, the Medical Monitor, and CAT Team will review data entered and issue approval, if 
the patient is eligible. Once approval is issue d, the participant should then be invited for a 
screening V1a visit. The V1a visit is the point at which the patient begins tapering off their 
antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medications , if appropriate. The part icipant must complete 
the taper within the first 4 weeks of this peri od, prior to 2 weeks comp letely off antidepressant 
and/or antipsychotic medications, before baseline. The tapering period used in the study is set 
at the industry standard for depression trials. T he study team will complete telephone check-
ins in between the weekly in clinic visits.
At subsequent screening period visits (V1a, V1b, etc), medications taken and any changes in 
medications since the previous visit, and th e C-SSRS and mDESS (if the participant is 
withdrawing from prohibited medications) will be obtained.
7.2.2 Baseline Visit –Visit 2 –Day -1
The baseline visit should occur within 2 to 6 weeks after beginning of screening period. At 
baseline visit, the participant’s eligibi lity will be confirmed by reviewing the 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria ( Sections 6.2 and6.3) and updating medical history.

psychoeducational material and the anticipated psil ocybin session with the participant. If the 
participant remains eligible, arrangements will be made for the participant to return to the study 
site for IMP administration the next day. Afte r baseline data is enter ed into EDC, the CAT 
team will complete a final review to ensure the pa rticipant’s continued eligibility. Participants 
cannot be progressed to the administration session until this approval is received.
If the participant opts to participate in the neur oimaging part of the study, specific eligibility 
criteria will be reviewed by the investigator ( Section 6) .If considered eligible, the participant 
will undergo an MRI scan (within 侓7 days prior to baseline).

Premature Discontinuation
If a participant’s participation in the study is terminated prematurely for any reason, the reason 
for such ET should be documented and the V10 (EOS) procedures should be performed as 
noted in  Section 7.2.10.
A termination form should be completed for every participant who is enrolled, whether the 
participant completes the study or not. The r eason for any ET should be indicated on this form; 
as much information should be provided as possi ble. The primary reason for a participant 
discontinuing early should be selected from the following standard categories of ET:
xScreen Failure: Participant does not qualify to participate in the study.
xLack of efficacy
xAdverse Event : Clinical or laboratory events occurred  that, in the medical judgment of the 
investigator for the best interest of the par ticipant, are grounds for discontinuation. This 
includes serious and nonserious AEs regardless of relation to the IMP.
xDeath: The participant died.
xWithdrawal of Consent : The participant desired to withdraw from further participation in 
the study in the absence of an investigator-d etermined medical need to withdraw. If the 
participant gave a reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded.
xLost to Follow-up : The participant stopped coming for visits and study personnel were 
unable to contact the participant.
xNon-compliance: The participant was non-compliant with study visits or procedures. 
xOther : The participant was discontinued for a reason other than those listed above, such 
termination of the study by the sponsor.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 20238 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PROCEDURES
Efficacy Assessments 
8.1.1 Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5
The CAPS-5 is the gold standard clinician rated  assessment for PTSD. It consists of 30 items 
and can be used for diagnostic purposes as well as monitoring PTSD symptoms severity over 
time. Each item could be rated as 0=absent, 1=mild/subthreshold, 2=moderate/subthreshold, 
severe/markedly elevated, 4=extreme/ incapacitati ng. At baseline visit the last month version 
of CAPS-5 will be used for diagnostic purposes . The last month version of the assessment will 
be administered to monitor participant sympto ms improvement after treatment at weeks 4 and 
12.13
8.1.2 PTSD Checklist for DSM-5The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-r eported scale, used for provisi onal PTSD diagnosis, screening 
and symptoms monitoring purposes. The particip ant will complete the past month version of 
this assessment at screening, scoring the severi ty of their symptoms on  a 5-points Likert scale 
where 0 = not at all and 4 = extremely.
14The screener should help the participant understanding 
this scale and in its correct completion to ensu re the PCL-5 is used to measure the relevant 
Criterion A for the trauma. The past day version of the assessment will be used at day 2. The 
past week version of the assessment will be  administered at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 
and 12.
8.1.3 EuroQoL5dimension 5level Scale
The EQ‑5D‑5L was introduced by the EuroQoL Group in 2009.21The EQ-5D-5L consists of 
2 sections: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). 
The descriptive system comprises five dime nsions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The participant is asked 
to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each 
of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level 
selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant’s health state.
The EQ VAS records the participant’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS, where the endpoints 
are labelled ‘The best imaginable health state’ and ‘The worst imaginable health state’. The 
VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of he alth outcome that reflect the participant’s own 
judgement. 
The EQ-5D-5L will be obtained at baseline, week 4, and week 12 visits.8.1.4 Sheehan Disability ScaleThe SDS is a brief, 5-item inventory that a ssesses functional impairment in work/school, social 
life, and family life. The total score ranges from  0 to 30 with 0 representing no impairment and

with Post -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 47 of 88
Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 202330 representing severe impairment. The last tw o items of the scale (Days Lost and Days 
Unproductive) do not count toward the total score.  Each domain is rated on a 10-point visual 
analogue scale (VAS).15The SDS will be completed by participants at baseline, week 4 and 
week 12.
8.1.5 Resiliance Adult Scale 
The RAS was developed to capture a set of fundamental protective factors based on resilience 
research. It includes 33 items, in a six-facto rs structure including (1) perception of self, (2) 
planned future, (3) social competence, (4) struc tured style, (5) family cohesion, (6) social
recourses.16
8.1.6 Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma ScaleThe PACT scale is a self-reported, 20 items scale, organised in two sub-scales, (1) Forward 
focus and (2) Trauma focus. The first subscale m easures the ability of the individual to move 
beyond their trauma, while the second measure s the perceived ability to focus on processing 
the trauma. Overall the scales provides a quantif ication of the individual’s coping flexibility.
17
Safety Assessments
8.2.1 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating ScaleThe C-SSRS will be used to assess suicide poten tial or tendency as a study entry criterion and 
monitored throughout the study.
The C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview designe d to assess the severity and intensity of 
suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour, and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour over a specified 
time period. The measurement of suicidal ideation is based on five “yes” or “no” questions 
with accompanying descriptions arranged in order of increasing severity. If the patient answers 
“yes” to either questions 1 or 2, the in tensity of ideation is assessed in five additional questions 
related to frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason s for the most severe 
suicidal ideation. Suicidal behaviour is assess ed by asking questions categorising behaviours 
into actual, aborted, and interrupted attempt s; preparatory behaviour; and non-suicidal self-
injurious behaviour. 
If any item(s) on the C- SSRS are answered “yes”, the prim ary investigator or physician 
investigator must review the patient’s res ponses in order to (a) at screening and day -1
determine the patient’s study eligibility and potential need for refer ral to a mental health 
professional, and (b) during the study evaluate the patient’s need for appropriate medical 
management such as a referral to a mental health professional.
A significant risk of suicide is defined as a “yes” in answer to (a) questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal 
ideation section; or (b) any questions on any item in the suicidal behaviour section. This must 
be reported as an AE or SAE as appropria te and followed up accordingly. Additionally, if a 
patient responds “yes” to any of the suicidal ideation questions 1 through 3, the investigator 
should apply clinical judgment to determine the need for reporting this as an AE or SAE and 
the need for any a ppropriate referral.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023
 The C-SSRS will be collected at every visit.
8.2.2 Vital Signs 
Blood pressure will be measured supine, after at least 5 min at rest. The three measurements 
should be recorded 1 to 2 min ap art, and the results averaged to inform eligibility at screening 
and baseline. Blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse rate will be obtained at screening,
baseline, administration session, and day 2.
On Day 1 (administration session), body temperature and respiratory rate will be measured 
before and after COMP360 administration. On Day 1, blood pressure and pulse rate will be 
monitored via an automatic arm cuff, with measurements collected supine at rest, in triplicate approximately one minute apart, at 15 minutes before COMP360 administration, and one, three 
and six hours after COMP360 administration. Measurements should be collected within a±10-minute time window. At the end of the COMP 360 administration session, a final triplicate 
measurement will be taken after the participant has rested for at least five minutes in the sitting 
position.
Any AEs related to blood pressure and pulse ra te will be recorded. Investigators should not 
inform participants of any blood pressure or pulse rate changes unless clinically warranted.
All extreme high blood pressure values (systolic >160 mmHg or diastolic >110 mmHg) should 
be double-checked before the values are recorded. If blood pressure remains high, the 
Investigator should consider seeking assistance  from health care providers experienced in 
managing elevated blood pressure and refer participants with signs or symptoms of 
hypertensive crisis (eg chest pain, shortness of  breath, visual disturbance, neurological deficits, 
etc) immediately for emergency care.
8.2.3 Electrocardiogram 
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be obtained at screening, baseline, and day 2. 
8.2.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be per formed including blood chemistry, haematology, 
urinalysis, urine drug screen, and serum and uri ne pregnancy tests (for women of childbearing 
potential). Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests  will be collected at screening, baseline, 
and day 2, week 4, and week 12. Urine sample s for urinalysis will be collected at screening
and baseline. Urine samples for urine drug screen will be collected at screening, baseline, day 
2, and weeks 1 to 12. For urine drug screen, a dipsti ck will be performed as standard test. If the 
dipstick results at screening, day 2, or weeks 1 to 12 are positive, the sample will be sent to the 
central lab for a confirmatory assessment. The study doctor will discuss the results of the urine 
drug screen with the participant, if deemed necessary. The details of the analyses are listed in 
Table 8.1. and in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 5.3.

depression has been previously demonstrated 19. The four-item positive symptom subscale 
assesses conceptual disorganisation, unusua l thought content, suspiciousness, and 
hallucinatory behaviour, which are scored on a scale from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely 
severe) with a score range of 4-28. A score of 0 will be recorded if the symptom was not 
assessed.
8.2.7 Modified Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale
The mDESS is a 15-item, self-reported scale, listing typical symptoms that can arise from 
antidepressant withdrawal.20It is a modified version of the 43-item Discontinuation Emergent 
Signs and Symptoms Scale.21If participants will be require d to withdraw from prohibited 
medications, they will be asked to class each of the 15 symptoms as new, old but worse, old 
but improved, old but not changed, or not present. A total score ranging from 0 to 15 is 
calculated by summing the number of ‘new symptom(s)’ and the number of ‘old symptom(s) 
but worse’. The mDESS will be performed at each vi sit during the Screening Period (V1b
onwards) and at Baseline in the subset of part icipants who are withdrawing from prohibited 
medication/s during the Screening Period.
Other Assessment Instruments 
8.3.1 Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Version 7.0.2The MINI was designed as a brief structured  interview for the major Axis I psychiatric 
disorders in DSM-5 and International Classification of Diseases-10. Validation and reliability 
studies have been done comparing the MINI to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5Patient Edition and the Composite International D iagnostic Interview (a structured interview 
developed by the World Health Organisation). Ve rsion 7.0.2 of the MINI will be used for this 
study. The results of these studies show that th e MINI has similar reliability and validity 
properties, but can be administered in a much  shorter period (mean 18.7 ± 11.6 min, median 
15 min) than the above referenced instruments. It can be used by clinicians after a brief training 
session.

8.3.2 McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder
The MSI-BPD is a commonly used measure to assess for BPD. The scale consists of 10 items 
based on the DSM-5 BPD criteria; the first 8 it ems represent the first eight criteria in the 
DSM-5 for BPD diagnosis, while the last two questions assess the paranoia and dissociation 
criteria for BPD. Scores for the MSI-BPD range  from 0 to 10, with each item rated as ͆1͇
if present and ͆0͇ if absent. A score of 7 or higher in dicates a likelihood for the participant 
to meet criteria for BPD. The MSI-BPD will be collected at Screening only and participants 
positive for BPD will be subject to clinical confirmation of diagnosis by the study clinician 
and Medical Monitor.

 8.3.3 Life Event Checklist for DSM-5
LEC-5 is a self-report measure designed to screen for potentially traumatic events in a 
respondent's lifetime. The LEC-5 assesses exposure to 16 events known to potentially result in 
PTSD or distress and includes one additional item assessing any other extraordinarily stressful 
event not captured in the first 16 items. For each item in the list the participant has the option 
to reply, “happened to me”, “witnessed it”, “learne d about it”, “part of my job”, “not sure”, 
“doesn’t apply”. The LEC -5 will be administered at screening together with the PCL-5.22
8.3.4 Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
The CTQ is a 28-item self-report measure valid ated to screen for history of childhood abuse 
and the meaning given to the abuse by the parti cipant. It consists of 5 subscales measuring, 
physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect. The 
CTQ will be used at screening to ex clude participants with childhood trauma.23
8.3.5 Semi-structured PTSD management interview Participants will be asked at baseline about th eir PTSD symptoms and feelings at the time of 
diagnosis and the type of treatments and support offered to them before joining the study. 
8.3.6 Semi-structured qualitative interview 
Participants will be asked their overall opini on of their experience with COMP360 therapy, if 
they consider a single dose enough, the impact of the experience on their lives and any 
feedback on the study design. This will occur at day 2 and week 12.
8.3.7 Five Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire
The 5D-ASC measures the acute drug effects us ing 5 primary dimensions and respective 
subdimensions to assess alterations in mood, per ception, and experience of self in relation to 
environment and thought disorder. The 5 dimensions include oceanic boundlessness ,anxious 
ego dissolution ,visionary restructuralization ,auditory alterations , and reduction of 
vigilance.
24,25This will be administered immediately after the psilocybin session on day of 
COMP360 administration. 
8.3.8 Emotional Breakthrough Inventory
The EBI is an eight-item brief measure intended  to index the degree to which an individual 
experiences their emotion during the study drug admin istration session. Each of the items is a 
VAS, with units from 0 to 100. A total score can be derived by averaging individual item 
responses.26
8.3.9 Cue app
If the participant opts to participate in the Cue ap p portion of the study, the app will be activated 
on the participant’s mobile phone at the screeni ng visit; it will be deactivated at the EOS.
Participants who do not consent to the app inst allation, or do not have a smart phone, will not 
be excluded from the study.

 Mobile data collection: The Cue app will collect data from the participant’s smart phone and 
periodically send these data back to the HealthRhythms ’ highly secured servers. Once the app 
is installed on the phone, the participant would use their phone as they normally would and 
keep their phone with them as often as possible. The d ata collected from the participant’s phone 
will include:
xActivity data based on CoreMotion on iOS and the Activity Transition API on Android.
xLocation information from the Location API on both iOS and Android, which uses GPS 
and/or cell tower location information.
xDevice display status from Springboard on iOS and display on/off broadcast events on 
Android. These data are used to approximate when  a user is actively using their phone.
xPedometer data (“steps”) based on CoreMotion on iOS and Google Fit on Android.
No personally identifiable information is captured, and all captured data are encrypted on the 
smartphone before upload to HealthRhythms’ cloud storage servers, and the data remain 
encrypted in transit and at rest.
8.3.10 Biomarkers measurements
If the participant opts to participate in this portion of the study, additional blood samples will 
be drawn. Participants who do not consent to bl ood withdrawal for biomarkers will not be 
excluded from the study, and clinical laboratory tests will still be run for safety purposes.
Blood samples to measure biomarkers levels will be collected at baseline, week 4, and week 
12 after COMP360 administration. Up to 100mL of blood will be collected at each time 
point: five X 10ml EDTA tubes, one X 8.5ml serum tube, two X 2.5ml RNA PAXGene tube,
and two X 8.5ml DNA PAXGene tube will be collected.
In addition to clinical laboratory measure ments, the biomarkers measured will include
biomarkers related to stress and inflammation such as plasma or serum cortisol, oxytocin, 
ACTH, catecholamines, BDNF, NPY, and cytokines; telomere length and telomerase activity; and the expression levels of stress-relevant mRNAs through transcriptomics and candidate gene analyses.
In addition, aliquots of the samples will be bio-banked for future studies, such as for genome-
wide methylation, genome-wide expression, genotyping/GWAS (psych chip).   
 
8.3.11 Magnetic Resonance Imaging
 
If the participant opts to par ticipate in this portion of the stud y, brain imaging via MRI will be 
performed at baseline and week 4. To reduce participant burden at baseline visit, the baseline 
MRI can be carried out ≤  7 days prior to the baseline visit . The activity of brain regions will be

Route Oral
Formulation Capsule
Strength 5m g
Storage
All IMP must be kept in a lock ed area with limited access. The high-density polyethylene 
(HDPE) bottles of IMP are to be stored as indi cated in the IMP Handling Manual. Deviations 
of storage temperature outside this re quired range should be documented and COMPASS or 
its designee should be notified promptly. Bot tles of IMP should not be frozen. If any 
component of the IMP is damaged, COMPASS or its designee must be notified as soon as 
possible. 
Packaging
COMP360 capsules are packaged into HDPE containers w ith child -resistant, tamper -evident 
screw cap lids with a mounted desiccant by 
 Each bottle contains 5 capsules for a single 
dose administration. Labels are affixed on to the bottles consistent with regulations in 
participating countries. Single individual bottles will  be provided for use by a given participant. 
Dose and Administration 
Each participant will be assigned 1 treatment bottle containing the following:
x5 x 5mg COMP360 capsules 
After a light breakfast taken at least 2 h prior to IMP administration and under observation of 
study staff, the 5 -capsule dose is to be swallowed with a full glass of water; due to the number 
of capsules in a dose, additional wat er may be necessary to swallow the dose. Study staff will 
ensure the entire 5 -capsule dose has been swallowed. 
To prepare for the drug experience, the particip ant will take the IMP and lie down in a room 
with dim lights and a standard playlist of relaxing music playing quietly. Two trained therapist s
will be present with the participant at all times.

Page 55 of 88
Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023The effects of COMP360 usually start about 20 to 30 min after administration, become most 
intense in the first 90 to 120 min, and gradually subs ide after 5 to 6 h. The participants will be 
asked to remain in the room for the duration of the session regardless of the intensity of the 
effects, preferably lying down. A light meal and fruit will be available for the participant. 
About 5 to 6 h after dosing, a trained therap ist will discuss the study drug administration 
experience with the participant. The participant is  to be discharged 6 to 8 h post-dosing when, 
in the opinion of the investigator, the acute effects of COMP360 are resolved. The participant 
will be accompanied home. The site is to be notif ied that they have returned home safely, and 
in the absence of receiving a phone call, site staff will directly contact the participant.
More details on preparation, administration, and integration sessions are available in the 
Therapist Manual. 
Accountability
The investigator must keep an accurate account  of the number of IMP units delivered to the 
site, administered to participants, and ret urned to COMPASS or its designee during and at the 
completion of the study. The IMP must be administ ered to participants only by an appropriately 
qualified person. The IMP is to be used in a ccordance with the protocol by participants who 
are under the direct supervision of the investigat or. Investigators should maintain records that 
document adequately that the participants were  administered the IMP dose specified by the 
protocol and reconcile all IMPs received at the s ite before final disposition. At the end of the 
study, or as directed, all IMP, including unused, partially used, and empty containers, will be 
returned to the sponsor or its designee.
Compliance
Administration of the IMP will be supervised  by study personnel to ensure compliance.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 202310 CONCOMITANT THERAPY
All prescription and non-prescription medic ations (eg over-the-counter drugs and herbal 
supplements) that participants report taking duri ng the 30 days prior to screening will be 
assessed and recorded at that vis it. For each medication, docum entation should list the trade or 
generic name, the total daily dose including units  (or the dose, units and scheduled and actual 
frequency of administration if the medicati on is not taken daily), the route of administration, 
and the reason for use. 
Concomitant medication refers to all drugs and ther apies used from the time the ICF was signed 
through the end of study participation. Changes, additions, or discontinuations to medicat ions will be assessed and recorded in the 
eCRF during each study visit. All as-needed ( pro re nata, PRN) prescriptions should be 
converted to reflect actual number of pills or dose taken per day. 
Permissible Medications
All concurrent non-serotonergic medications are allowed.
Medications for the management of concur rent anxiety and insomnia, or nonpsychiatric 
medications that have a potential psychotropic effect are permitted with the following 
limitations. From the initial screening visit through final study visit (EOS), participants are permitted to remain on the same regular dos e regimen of benzodiazepines they were already 
on in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Part icipants who were not taking benzodiazepines 
before screening may take up to 2 mg of lora zepam equivalents per day for anxiety emerging 
during the withdrawal of antidepressant and an tipsychotic medications. Benzodiazepines may 
not be taken within 8 hours before COMP360 administration. Hypnotics such as zopiclone, eszopiclone or zolpidem are allowed for in somnia. Prescription and non-prescription
medications with psychoactive properties that are used as needed for nonpsychiatric conditions 
(eg pseudoephedrine for allergies or cold symptoms ;) can be used daily but not within 12 hours 
before dosing. Documentation of the use of ad junctive anxiolytics, hypnotics or medication 
with potential psychotropic properties (including over-the-counter preparations) will be obtained at each clinic visit. Ongoing, stably- dosed medications prescribed for attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, including psychostimula nts, atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine, 
are permitted alone or in combination. Atomoxe tine use should be avoided for 12 hours prior 
to and six hours post COMP360 administration (see Section 10.3) .
Therapy considered necessary for the participan t’s welfare may be given at the discretion of 
the study clinician.
Definition of Women of Childbearing Potential and/or Acceptable Contraceptive 
Methods
A woman is considered of childbearing potential (eg fertile) following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently st erilised (eg participant had hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy).

Page 57 of 88
 
Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023
 A woman who is not of childbearing potential is considered to be postmenopausal after at least 
12 months without menstruation. 
The following methods of contraception, if used properly and used for the duration of the study, 
are generally considered highly effective: 
oCombined oestrogen- and progestogen-containing hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral
Intravaginal
Transdermal
oProgestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:Oral
Injectable
Implantable
oIntrauterine device
oIntrauterine hormone-releasing system
oBilateral tubal occlusion
oVasectomised partner
oSexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only in case of refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse du ring the entire period of the clinical trial and when in 
line with the preferred and us ual lifestyle of the subject
Periodic abstinence (eg calendar, sympto thermal, or post-ovulation methods) is not an 
acceptable form of contraception for this study.  
These methods of contraception also apply to partners of male participants.The investigator and each participant will determine the appropriate method of contraception 
for the participant during the participation in th e study. This will be documented at screening.
If a participant or the partner of a male pa rticipant becomes pregnant during the study, the 
investigator will notify the PI, study spons or and COMPASS immediately after the pregnancy 
is confirmed according to  Section 14.5.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023
Prohibited Medications
Participants are to be discontinued from antid epressant and/or antipsychotic medications at 
least two weeks prior to baseline visit. These medications include the following two classes of 
the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) C lassification System: - NO5A Antipsychotics 
& NO6A Antidepressants. Participants should also discontinue prazosin one week before 
COMP360 administration session. For fluoxetine , aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, and cariprazine, 
immediate cessation at screening V1a followed by at least four weeks of washout will be 
required prior to baseline.
Opioid medications (all classes) are prohibited in the two-weeks prior to baseline and if taken 
for >3 consecutive days in the post-administration follow-up period. 
In vitro inhibition studies suggest that psiloci n, the active metabolite of psilocybin, may be an 
inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 at clini cally relevant concentrations. In the absence 
of formal drug-drug interaction studies yet to be co mpleted, it is recommended to avoid the use 
of medications that are sensitive substrates of CYP2D6 (eg atomoxetine, desipramine, 
dextromethorphan, eliglustat, nebivolol, nortri ptyline, perphenazine, R-venlafaxine, 
tolterodine) or substrates with a narrow therap eutic index (dosulepin) for 12 hours prior to and 
six hours post COMP360 administration. As COMP360 is a single dose treatment, the risk for any clinically important drug-drug interactions is  considered low. After a single oral 
administration of COMP360, the half-life of ps ilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, is
approximately three hours. Therefore, drug inter action potential would be greatly diminished 
by day 2.
The medical monitor should be contacted if ther e is any question that a used medication is 
thought to be in one of these classes. These medications are not to be reintroduced to the 
participant until after week 4. Participants who require concomitant medication(s) specifically 
for the treatment of PTSD at any time through th e duration of the study will be assessed for 
reasons of resuming their medications an d followed until 12 weeks post COMP360 
administration. Participants can resume taking prazosin the day after administration session, if necessary. The study clinician should initiate treatment of symptoms of PTSD as deemed 
appropriate and may change the venue of thera py (eg outpatient to in patient) if deemed 
clinically necessary. The intervention may  be a combination of somatic (eg approved 
antidepressant medication) and non-somatic (various forms psychotherapy, eg TF- CBT) whose therapeutic intention is remediation of PT SD symptoms. Because the anticipated half-
life of COMP360 is approximately 3 h, and only 1 administration of test product is permitted, 
no known issues regarding pharmacokinetics or  pharmacodynamic interactions are envisioned 
within approximately 7 days of product administration.
Rescue Medication
Rescue medications may be used during and after the administration session. 
The decision to medicate a participant will depend on whether the responsible physician judges 
that they are capable of maintaining the safety  of the participant and others without medical 
intervention.

 xBenzodiazepine anxiolytics are the pharmacol ogical intervention of choice in case of acute 
psychological distress (eg medications such as  lorazepam or alprazolam that have a rapid 
onset, a short time until peak plasma concentration, and a short duration of therapeutic 
action; the oral route is preferable because IV injection procedures may further exacerbate 
the participant’s anxiety) 
xAntipsychotic medications (eg risperidone) should be available in the event that an 
adverse reaction escalates to unmanageable psychosis. 
In case of the development of acute anxiety or psychotic symptoms requiring pharmacological 
intervention, the participant will be managed appropriately. The participant may be discharged 
from the clinic when, in the opinion of investig ator, the condition has st abilised. The participant 
will be accompanied home. The site is to be not ified by the participant that they have returned 
home safely, and in the absence of receiving a phone call site staff will directly contact the 
participant.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 202311 ADVERSE EVENTS
Throughout the course of the study, all AEs will  be monitored and recorded in the eCRF, 
including the AE’s description, start and end date, seriousness, severity, action taken, and 
relationship to the IMP. If AEs occur, th e first concern will be the safety of the study 
participants. 
Per ICH E2A: An AE is any untoward med ical occurrence in a participant or clinical 
investigation participant administered a pharm aceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this tr eatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal la boratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a med icinal product, whether considered related 
to the medicinal product. Medical interventions such as surgeries, dia gnostic procedures, and therapeutic procedures are 
not AEs, but the action taken to treat the med ical condition. They should be recorded as 
treatment of the AEs. The investigator will promptly  notify COMPASS or ICON of all SAEs and nonserious AEs 
occurring during the clinical trial so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards 
the safety of participants and the safety of the product under clinical investigation are met. 
COMPASS or ICON has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of  a product under clinical investigation. COMPASS 
or ICON will comply with country-specific regulat ory requirements relati ng to safety reporting
to the regulatory authority, Institutional Re view Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC), and investigators. These will be detailed in the safety plan. 
Documenting Adverse Events
AEs occurring from when the participant signs the ICF until the last study event will be 
recorded. Any AEs occurring before the start of treatment (eg before the dose of the IMP on 
day 1) will be recorded as pre-treatment AEs. Also, the sign, symptom, or disease present before starting the treatment period are only cons idered AEs if they worsen after starting the 
treatment period. Investigators s hould document all significant illnes ses that the participant has 
experienced within 3 months of the screening a nd up to the day of inclusion. Illnesses first 
occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the 
study are to be documented as AEs.
All clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG results or findings should be appraised by 
the investigator to determine their clinical significance. Isolated abnormal clinical laboratory 
test results, vital sign findings, or ECG findings (e g not part of a reported diagnosis) should be 
reported as AEs if they are sy mptomatic, lead to IMP discontinuation/study withdrawal, require 
corrective treat ment, or constitute an AE in the investigator’s clinical judgment.
At each time point, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by 
evaluating the participant. AEs may be directly  observed, reported spontaneously by the 
participant or by questioning the participant at each time point. Pa rticipants should be

with Post -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 61 of 88
Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023questioned in a general way, without asking ab out the occurrence of any specific symptoms. 
The investigator must assess all AEs to determi ne intensity, causality and seriousness, in 
accordance with the definitions in Sections 11.2, 11.3, and 12.1, respectively. The
investigator’s assessment must be clearly docu mented in the study site’s source documentation 
with the investigator’s signature. 
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term. When a diagnosis is unavailable, report 
the primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE ter m with additional details included in the
narrative until the diagnosis becomes available. If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do 
not suggest a common diagnosis, report th em as individual entries of AE or SAE.
The investigator should report all AEs on the AE page(s) of the eCRF and source documents, 
regardless of seriousness, severity, and causality. Whenever possible, an AE will be reported 
using a diagnostic term, (eg “common cold” or “upper respiratory infection” rather than 
“runny nose, cough, mild fever”) and should be described with t he attributes described in 
Sections 11.2 and11.3.
Assessment of Intensity
Each AE will be classified according to the following criteria:
Mild: The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the 
participant’s normal level of functioning.
Moderate: The AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not 
hazardous to the participant’s health.
Severe: The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or 
incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the participant’s health.
Severity versus Seriousness: Severity is used to describe the level of functional impairment 
and hazardousness due to the intensity of a spe cific event while the event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"seriousness". An SAE is one that results in death, is life-threatening, causes hospitalisation or prolongs hospitalisation, causes significant or pers istent disability, results in a congenital 
disorder or is otherwise medically significant (see Section 12 for details).
When changes in the intensity of an AE occu r more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the experience should be noted. If the intensity category changes over several 
days, those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).
Assessment of Causality
Each AE will be assessed as to its relations hip to the IMP, based on the following criteria. 
Although the attribution by the investigator will be collected for reported events, for analytic 
purposes a temporal association with the use of the IMP will be assumed sufficient for at least plausible association. All noxious and unintende d responses to the IM P related to the dose 
should be reported as Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR).

Page 62 of 88
Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023Not related: No causal relationship exists between the IMP and the AE, but an 
obvious alternative cause exists, eg the participant’s underlying 
medical condition or concomitant therapy.
Possibly related: A connection with the administrati on of the IMP appears unlikely 
but cannot be ruled out with certai nty. An AE may be considered 
possibly related if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it 
follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from administration of the 
IMP; (2) i t could not readily have been produced by the participant’s 
clinical state, environmental or to xic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the part icipant; or (3) it follows a known 
pattern of response to the IMP.
Related: There is a reasonable/plausible possibility that the AE may have 
been caused by the IMP.
When assessing the relationship to the IMP, the following criteria will be considered:
oKnown class effect
oBiological plausibility
oLack of alternative explanation —concomitant drug or disease
Action Taken Regarding Investigational Medicinal Product
Dose modifications of IMP (eg dose not changed, drug withdrawn, drug interrupted, or dose 
increased) are not applicable as this is a single dose study. 
oNot Applicable: Participant died, study treatment had been completed prior to reaction/event, or reaction/event occurred prior to start of treatment
Other Action Taken for Event
Other possible actions that can be taken for event are the following:
xNone (eg no treatment was required)
xMedication required (eg prescription and/or  OTC medication was required to treat 
the AE)
xHospitalisation or prolongation of hospit alisation required (eg hospitalisation was 
required or prolonged because of the AE, whether medication was required)
xOther
Adverse Event Outcome
The outcome of AEs can be defined as one of the following:

xRecovered/Resolved with Sequelae (eg the residual effects of the AE are still 
present and observable, incl uding sequelae/residual effects)
xFatal (eg ‘fatal’ should be used when death is a direct outcome of the AE)
xUnknown
Clinical Laboratory Changes
Clinically significant abnormalities in a labor atory value that is new in onset or which has 
worsened in severity or frequency from the baseline condition and meets one of the following criteria will be recorded and reported as an AE:
oRequires therapeutic intervention or diagnostic tests
oHas accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs
oIs judged by the investigator as clinically significant
Combined elevations of aminotransferases and bilirubin, either serious or nonserious, and 
whether causally related, meeting the criteria of a po tential Hy’s Law case (total bilirubin level 
≥3 × upper limit of normal [ULN] with  simultaneous ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN) should always 
be reported to the sponsor as soon as possible following the procedures outlined in Section 12.3
for SAE reporting, with the investigator’s asse ssment of seriousness, causality, and a detailed 
narrative.
Overdose
Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirme d) must be communicated to the CRO, within 
24 hours and be fully documented as an AE or SA E if it meets the SAE criteria. Details of any 
signs or symptoms and their management should be recorded including details of any antidote(s) administered.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or nonser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the study drug, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate 
notification by the investigator to COMPASS and the CRO is requ ired. Such AEs may require 
further investigation to characterise and understand them.

The final list of preferred ter ms corresponding to AESIs will be provided in the study Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). The investigator must re port to COMPASS and the CRO all the above 
events within 24 hours of learning about the event regardless of relationship to study drug.
The report should include the following minimum information:
oParticipant number
oEvent
oDate/time of onset

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 202312 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Definition of Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:
oDeath
oLife-threatening
oInpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
oPersistent or significant disability/incapacity
oCongenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant who received 
psilocybin.
oOther: Important medical events that may not  result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospitalisation, may be consider ed an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardise the participant and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Suicidal 
behaviours (which do not include non-suicid al self-injurious behaviours) must be 
classified as important medical events if  they do not otherwise meet SAE criteria.
Examples of important medical events are:
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalisation
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Definition of Terms
Life-threatening: An AE is life-threatening if  the participant was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; eg  it does not include a reaction that  if it had occurred in a more 
serious form might have caused death. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved 
without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug-
induced hepatitis can be fatal.
Hospitalisation: AEs requiring hospitalisation shou ld be considered SAEs. Hospitalisation for 
elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that ar e not the result of AEs (eg elective surgery 
for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If 
anything untoward is reported du ring the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an 
AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria.
In general, hospitalisation signifies that the part icipant has been detained (usually involving at 
least one an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment
that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in 
doubt as to whether 'hospitalisation' occurred  or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious.

The Safety and Tolerability of COMP360 in Participants 
with Post -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 67 of 88
Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of deat h should always be reported as an SAE.
Any serious, untoward event that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the 
investigator assesses as related to I MP should also be reported and managed as an SAE.
The investigator should follow participants with AEs until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilised. In case of unresolved AEs, including significant abnormal clinical 
laboratory values at the end of study assessment, th ese events will be followed until resolution 
or until they become clinically not relevant.
Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitatin g or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of th e participant's ability to carry out normal life 
functions.
Reporting Serious Adverse Even ts
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness criteria ( Section 12.1).If
the AE is considered serious, the invest igator should report this event to the CRO , and to the 
IRB/IEC according to its standard operating procedures.
If the investigator detects an SAE in a study participant after the last scheduled follow -up visit, 
and considers the SAE related or possibly r elated to this study’s IMP administration, the 
investigator should report it to the CRO.
The investigator must report to the sponsor all SAEs on the eCRF page within 24 hours of
learning about the event regardless of relationship to IMP. 
All information about SAEs will be collected and reported via paper SAE form and sent by e -
mail message or facsimile (contact information will be contained in the investigator site file). 
The in vestigator should send the initial report within  24 h of becoming aware of the SAE. At 
minimum, the initial report should include the following information: 
oEvent and brief description of the SAE (including diagnosis or signs/symptoms)
oStudy code
oParticip ant identification number, initials, gender, and date of birth
oIMP
oReporter name and contact information
• Site staff will complete th e paper SAE report form and e -mail it within 24 h to the 
following ad dress: 
• In cases wh ere the email system is unavailable, site  staff will send the SAE by fax to: 
If the SAE has not resolved at the time the in vestigator submits an initial SAE report, the 
investigator must provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon receipt of

 significant information if the event is still ongoing). Additional follow-up information must be 
reported on the SAE report form and emailed  or faxed as specified above within 24 h of 
awareness following investigator (or site) awar eness of the information. The investigator 
should not delay reporting an SAE in order to obtain additional information. Additional 
information, when available, should be report ed per the reporting procedures described above. 
All SAEs shall be followed until resolution, unti l the condition stabilises, or until the participant 
is lost to follow-up, or otherwise explained. Once the SAE is resolved, the corresponding AE 
eCRF page shall be updated. Additionally, any relevant laboratory test reports, consultation 
reports from other health care professionals, discharge summaries, or other information that
has been gathered about the event may be requested by the CRO as part of SAE follow-up
activities.
In the case of a “minimum report” (one that solely comprises the information bulleted above), 
a more detailed follow-up report should be se nt as soon as more in formation becomes available 
but no later than 7 calendar days after the date of the initial report. Each SAE should be 
followed up until resolution or stabilisation a nd for reported deaths, the investigator should 
supply the CRO and the IRB/IEC with any addi tional requested information (eg, autopsy 
reports and terminal medical reports). 
The original SAE form should be ke pt at the study site. The sponsor or its representative will 
be responsible for determining and in turn, reporting SAEs to regulatory authorities according 
to the applicable regulatory requirements. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or stable and the outcome documented on the eCRF. 
Investigator safety reports will be prepared for  suspected unexpected se rious adverse reactions 
(those not listed in the IB) according to local regulatory requirements and COMPASS/the CRO
policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives an investigator sa fety report describing an SAE(s) or other 
specific safety information (eg summary or listi ng of SAEs) from COMPASS or the CRO will 
file it with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.

Hypotheses and Treatment Comparisons
There are no formal hypotheses being tested in this study.
Sample Size Considerations
The sample size is not based on a formal statistical ev aluation but is considered to be adequate 
to meet the objectives of the study.
Analysis Sets
Analysis Population Definition
Screening Analysis Set All participants who signed the ICF
Safety Analysis Set All participants who receive study drug
Full Analysis Set (FAS) All participants in the Safety Analysis Set who have at least one
post-baseline efficacy assessment
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all safety-related evaluations and study population-
related evaluations. The FAS will be used for all efficacy-related evaluations.
General Considerations
A detailed SAP will be finali sed and signed before database lock. Any deviations from the 
methods described below will be included in th e SAP and considered final, which will be 
included in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).
All TFLs will be created using SAS®version 9.4 or higher.
Unless otherwise specified, “baseline” is defined as the last observed value of the parameter of 
interest prior to dosing. For numerical variables , change from baseline will be calculated as the 
difference between the value of interes t and the corresponding baseline value. 
Continuous data will be summarised descriptiv ely using N (number of participants), n (number 
of observations), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Categorical 
data will be summarised using frequency c ounts and percentages. Confidence intervals for 
selected endpoints will also be displayed.
All individual participant data will be listed.
Data Handling
Procedures for the handling of any missing, unused or spurious data will be described in the 
SAP.

 13.5.1 Analysis of Efficacy
Since this is a single treatment open-label st udy, no statistical testing will be performed.
The FAS will be used for all efficacy-related endpoint s, if the two sets ar e not identical. For 
each of the secondary (CAPS-5, PCL-5, SDS an d EQ-5D-5L (including EQ VAS)) and some 
exploratory endpoints (PACT, RAS) measuring changes from baseline, summary statistics will 
be provided. In addition, 95% confidence intervals for changes from baseline as well as for 
proportions of responders and remitters based on the CAPS-5 will be provided. Graphical 
displays will also be created for a subset of the efficacy endpoi nts to visualise their profile over 
time.
Analysis of all exploratory endpoints will be further detailed in the SAP.
13.5.2 Analysis of Safety
13.5.2.1 Adverse Events
AEs will be coded by System Organ Class (SOC ) and Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification. 
A TEAE is defined as any AE that has an onset  on or after taking study  drug, or any pre-existing
condition that has worsened on or after taking study drug.
The frequency and incidence of TEAEs will be  summarised by SOC and PT. Summaries will 
also include, but not limited to, relationship to study drug and maximum severity. The summary 
will be sorted by International Agreed Orde r for SOC and alphabetical order for Preferred 
Term.For each of the summaries produced at the particip ant level, multiple occurrences of the same 
event within a participant will be counted on ce in the summaries by SOC and Preferred Term; 
multiple occurrences of the same event within  a participant will be counted once in the 
maximum severity category (severe > moderate > mild) and/or maximum drug relationship 
category (reasonable possibility/no reasonable po ssibility). If severity or relationship is found 
to be missing, the most severe occurrence will be imputed for that particular summary.AESIs will also be presented using the same logic as for general AE summary tables, including 
patient incidence and event counts.These summaries will also present the number of events that occurred, so multiple occurrences 
of the same event within a pa rticipant will all be accounted for in the maximum intensity 
category and maximum relationship category they were classed as.13.5.2.2 Electrocardiogram DataECG data and changes from baseline/screening  will be summarised by visit. Frequency 
tabulations of the abnormalities will be provided, as well a summary using the ICH E14 
Guideline: The Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic 
Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs. ECG variables to be analysed will include heart rate 
(bpm), RR interval (ms), PR in terval (ms), QRS interval (ms), QT interval (ms), and corrected

Good Clinical Practice
The study will be performed in accordance wi th this protocol, US  investigational new drug 
(IND) regulations (21 Code of Federal Regul ations [CFR] 312), ICH guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), the regulations on electronic records and electronic signature (21 CFR 
11), and the most recent guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki (Section 21.2) .These 
guidelines are on file at the CRO. 
The study will also be performed in accordance with any laws and regulations in force in the 
country in which the research is carried out. 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will  periodically review and evaluate the 
accumulated study data for participant sa fety, study conduct and progress and when 
appropriate, efficacy. The DSMB will make r ecommendations concerning the continuation, 
modification or termination of the trial, always ensuring participant safety is paramount. As 
outlined in the DSMB charter, the DSMB can r ecommend modifying or stopping the study if 
the risks to participants appear to exceed th e benefits by following the below guidance: 
xAny participant who experiences increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥5-fold upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≥3-fold ULN 
with concomitant serum total bilirubin ≥2-fold the ULN and ≥35% direct, will be 
withdrawn from the study and will be followed until resolution of the abnormal 
laboratory values. 
xAny participant who experiences clinically si gnificant suicidal risk or risk of self-injury 
during study participation will be withdrawn from the study and followed until 
resolution.
Other stopping criteria will include:
xA ‘serious’ adverse reaction in two participants, ie, an SAE that is considered at least 
possibly related to IMP administration.
xIf there is an unacceptable tolerability profile based on the nature, frequency and 
intensity of observed AEs and/or clinical safety monitoring in the opinion of the 
investigator.
xIf any of the above study stopping criteria  are fulfilled, all dosing will be stopped 
immediately in all study participants. No fur ther dosing will be permitted at a group or 
individual level. If the trial is halted due to safety concerns, or because the stopping 
criteria are fulfilled, the trial will only re sume after Research Ethics Committee (REC) 
and regulatory authority approval via a substantial amendment.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023The composition, the frequency of the review , range of decisions permitted, and the methods 
for dissemination of information will be addressed in a separate charter. 
Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee
Conduct of the study must be approved by an appropriately constituted IRB/ IEC. Approval 
is required for the study protocol, protocol amendments, ICFs, participant information sheets, and advertising materials.
Informed Consent
Written, informed consent will be obtained from all  study participants. Participants should be 
informed that they may withdraw from the st udy at any time. They w ill receive all information 
that is required by local regulations and ICH guidelines. The Principal Investigator or a 
designated representative will provide the sponsor or its representative with a copy of the IRB 
approved ICF before the start of the study.
Exposure in Utero During Clinical Studies
Sponsor must be notified of any participant who becomes pregnant within 30 days of receiving the IMP. Reporting after the follow-up visit or ET is done voluntarily by the investigator. 
Sponsor must be notified of any male participant whose partner becomes pregnant within 30 
days of the participant receiving the IMP. Reporting after any follow-up visit or ET is donevoluntarily by the investigator. 
Although pregnancy is not technically an AE, all pregnancies must be followed to conclusion 
to determine their outcome. This information is  important for both drug safety and public health 
concerns. It is the responsibility of the inves tigator, or designee, to report any pregnancy in a 
participant or the partner of a male participant using the eCRF pregnancy within 24 h of 
becoming aware of the event. Exposure in Utero (EIU) Reporting form. Please contact your 
study monitor to receive the EIU Re porting form upon learning of a pregnancy. The 
investigator should make every effort to follow the participant until completion of the pregnancy and complete the EIU Reporting for m eCRF with complete pregnancy outcome 
information, including normal delivery and i nduced abortion. The adverse pregnancy outcome, 
either serious or nonserious, should be reported in accordance with study procedures. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie post-partum complications, spontaneous or induced abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including that in an aborted foetus), the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs outlined in Section 12. In the event the eCRF system is unavailable, a back-up 
paper Pregnancy Reporting Form will be availa ble for site staff to complete following the 
reporting guidelines as outlined in Section 12.2.
For reports of pregnancy in the partner of a male participant within 30 days from receiving the IMP, the pregnancy eCRF page EIU form (or SAE form if associated with an adverse outcome) 
should be completed with the participant’s initials, and date of birth, and details regarding the 
partner of the male participant should be  entered in the narrative section.

Records Management
By signing this protocol, the investigator grants pe rmission to personnel from the sponsor, its 
representatives, and appropriate regulatory aut horities, for on-site monitoring of all appropriate 
study documentation, paper and electronic, as well as on-site review of the procedures 
employed in eCRF generation, where clinically appropriate. 
Source Documentation
Note that a variety of original documents, data, and records will be considered as source 
documents in this trial. The eCRF itself is not to be used as a source document under any 
circumstances.
Study Files and Record Retention
The investigator must arrange for retention of st udy records at the site. The nature of the records 
and the duration of the retention period must meet the requirements of the relevant regulatory 
authority. In addition, because this is an interna tional study, the retention period must meet the 
requirements of the most stringent authority. The investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.

 15 AUDITING AND MONITORING
This study will be monitored for quality ass urance at all stages of its development by the 
clinical research personnel employed by the sp onsor or its representative. Monitoring will 
include personal visits and telephone communica tion to assure that the investigation is 
conducted according to the protocol, standa rd operating procedures, GCP guidelines, and 
applicable regulatory requirements. Quality control procedures will be applied to each stage of 
data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed correctly. On-site
review of eCRFs will include a review of forms for completeness and clarity, and consistency 
with source documents available for each participant.
The investigator and appropriate personnel will be periodically requested to attend 
meetings/workshops organised by the sponsor to assure acceptable protocol execution. The study may be audited by the sponsor or by regul atory authorities. If such an audit occurs, the 
investigator must agree to allow access to requ ired participant records. By signing this protocol, 
the investigator grants permission to personne l from the sponsor, its representatives, and 
appropriate regulatory authorities, for on-site monitoring of all appropriate study 
documentation, as well as on-site review of the procedures employed in eCRF generation, where clinically appropriate.

 16 AMENDMENTS
Protocol modifications, except those intended to  reduce immediate risk to study participants, 
may be made only by COMPASS. A protocol ch ange intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to participants may be imp lemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is 
notified within five days.
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written 
amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC a nd the investigator must await approval before 
implementing the changes. COMPASS will su bmit protocol amendments to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities for approval. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the invest igator, and/or COMPASS the amendment to the 
protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the 
participant and/or has an impact on the par ticipant's involvement as a study participant, the 
currently approved written ICF will require similar modification. In such cases, informed 
consent will be renewed for participants enro lled in the study before continued participation.

A. INTRODUCTION
The World Medical Association has developed th e Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles to provide guid ance to physicians and other pa rticipants in medical research 
involving human participants. Medical resear ch involving human participants includes 
research on identifiable human material or identifiable data.It is the duty of the physician to promote and safe guard the health of the people. The physician’s 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.

 The Declaration of Geneva of the World Me dical Association binds the physician with the 
words, "The health of my partic ipant will be my first consid eration," and the International Code 
of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the participant's interest when 
providing medical care which might have the ef fect of weakening the physical and mental 
condition of the participant."
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human participants.
In medical research on human participants, co nsiderations related to the well-being of the 
human participant should take precedence over the interests of science and society.
The primary purpose of medical research involvi ng human participants is to improve 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedur es and the understanding of the aetiology and 
pathogenesis of disease. Even the best-prove n prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic 
methods must continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, 
accessibility and quality.In current medical practice and in medical re search, most prophylactic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.
Medical research is participant to ethical sta ndards that promote respect for all human beings 
and protect their health and rights. Some research  populations are vulnerable and need special 
protection. The particular needs of the economicall y and medically disadvantaged must be 
recognised. Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent for 
themselves, for those who may be participan t to giving consent under duress, for those who 
will not benefit personally from the research a nd for those for whom the research is combined 
with care.
Research investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for 
research on human participants in their own countries as well as applicable international 
requirements. No national ethical, legal or regulat ory requirement should be allowed to reduce 
or eliminate any of the protections for human  participants set forth in this Declaration.
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCHIt is the duty of the physician in medical research  to protect the life, health, privacy, and dignity 
of the human participant.
Medical research involving human participants mu st conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources 
of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation.
Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research, which may affect the 
environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected.
The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human participants should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a specially

 appointed ethical review comm ittee, which must be independent of the investigator, the 
sponsor or any other kind of undue influence. This independent committee should be in 
conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research experiment is performed. The committee has the right to moni tor ongoing trials. The researcher has the 
obligation to provide monitoring informatio n to the committee, especially any SAEs. The 
researcher should also submit to the co mmittee, for review, information regarding funding, 
sponsors, institutional affiliations, other po tential conflicts of interest and incentives for 
participants.
The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved 
and should indicate that there is compliance with  the principles enunciated in this Declaration. 
Medical research involving human participants should be conducted only by scientifically 
qualified persons and under the supervisi on of a clinically competent medical person. The 
responsibility for the human participant must alway s rest with a participant of the research, 
even though the participant has given consent.
Every medical research project involving human participants should be preceded by careful 
assessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the 
participant or to others. This does not preclude  the participation of healthy volunteers in 
medical research. The design of all studies should be publicly available.
Physicians should abstain from engaging in re search projects involving human participants 
unless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be 
satisfactorily managed. Physicians should ceas e any investigation if the risks are found to
outweigh the potential benefits or if there is c onclusive proof of positive and beneficial results.
Medical research involving human participants should only be conducted if the importance of 
the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burde ns to the participant. This is especially 
important when the human participants are healthy volunteers.
Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in 
which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research.
The participants must be volunteers and in formed participants in the research project.
The right of research participants to safeguard their integrity must always be respected. Every 
precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the participant, the confidentiality of the 
participant’s information and to minimise the im pact of the study on the participant's physical 
and mental integrity and on the personality of the participant.
In any research on human beings, each potential participant must be ad equately informed of 
the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possi ble conflicts of interest, institutional 
affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated bene fits and potential risks of the study and the 
discomfort it may entail. The participant should be informed of the right to abstain from 
participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. 
After ensuring that the participant has underst ood the information, the physician should then 
obtain the participant's freely-given informed co nsent, preferably in writing. If the consent

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023
 cannot be obtained in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and 
witnessed.
When obtaining informed consen t for the research project the phys ician should be particularly 
cautious if the participant is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent 
under duress. In that case the informed cons ent should be obtained by a well-informed 
physician who is not engaged in the investigatio n and who is completely independent of this 
relationship.For a research participant who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of 
giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, th e investigator must obtain informed consent 
from the legally authorised representative in  accordance with applicable law. These groups 
should not be included in research unless the re search is necessary to promote the health of the 
population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent 
persons.When a participant deemed legally incompetent, such  as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the invest igator must obtain that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorised representative.Research on individuals from whom it is no t possible to obtain cons ent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if th e physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons 
for involving research participants with a cond ition that renders them unable to give informed 
consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the 
review committee. The protocol should state that consent to remain in th e research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorised surrogate.Both authors and publishers have ethical oblig ations. In publication of the results of research, 
the investigators are obliged to preserve the accur acy of the results. Negative as well as positive 
results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional 
affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should 
not be accepted for publication.
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE
The physician may combine medical research wi th medical care, only to the extent that the 
research is justified by its potential prophylactic,  diagnostic or therapeutic value. When medical 
research is combined with medical care, addition al standards apply to protect the participants 
who are research participants.The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those 
of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the 
use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies  where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or 
therapeutic method exists.

Version 5.0 (USA) –09 June 2023
 At the conclusion of the study, every participant entered into the study should be assured of 
access to the best-proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by the
study.
The physician should fully inform the participant which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a participant to part icipate in a study must never interfere with the 
participant-physician relationship.In the treatment of a participant, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic 
methods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the 
participant, must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic 
measures, if in the physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or 
alleviating suffering. Where possible, these mea sures should be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate their safety and efficac y. In all cases, new information should be recorded 
and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

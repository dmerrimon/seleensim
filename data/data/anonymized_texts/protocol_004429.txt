Idiopathic HypersomniaIND No.: 144843 EudraCT No.:
Not applicable
Study Number: TAK-925-2002 Phase: 1b
Study Design:
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability of a single intravenous (IV) infusion dose of TAK-925 in subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH). Subjects will be males and females aged 18 through 75 years, inclusive, with IH diagnosed according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 (ICSD-3) criteria as verified by a previous nocturnal polysomnogram (nPSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) study performed 
within the last 10 years. 
The treatment periods begin on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 (Study Day 1) with Treatment Period 2 commencing on 
Study Day 3. In the morning of Day 1 of Treatment Period 1, eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 sequence groups as listed in the table below. After randomization, the subject will be dosed in 2 treatment periods according to the order defined by the sequence group to which he/she is randomized. On Day 1 of each treatment period, TAK-925 (or placebo) will be administered as  a single 9-hour IV  infusion commencing at approximately 0800. The infusion will 
be terminated at approximately 1700.
 summary of study drug assignment for each sequence follows:
Sequence N Treatment Period 1 Treatment Period 2
1 20 TAK-925 112 mg Placebo
2 20 Placebo TAK-925 112 mg
 A total of 40 subjects will be randomized so that at 
least 36 subjects will complete the study. To avoid enrollment of short sleepers with chronic sleep deprivation, prospective participants will complete approximately 7 consecutive days of actigraphy supported by a sleep diary beginning on Study Day -9 and ending on Study Day -3 (ie, the day before their Study Day -2 admission to the clinical 
unit), to ensure an average nightly sleep duration of ≥420 minutes (7 hours) during the subject’s normal nocturnal 
sleep period and also, that if the subject’s average nightly sleep duration is ≤480 minutes (8 hours), that the subject 
does not have insufficient sleep syndrome (sleeping >2 hours/night more on “off days” than on “work days”). After screening, eligible subjects must discontinue their stimulant medications used for treatment of IH. Medications must be discontinued for a minimum of 7 days or at least 5 half-lives of each medication, whichever is longer, before the first day of dosing (Day 1 of Treatment Period 1). Sodium oxybate must be discontinued at least 4weeks prior to CCICCI

screening.
The screening period is up to 28 days. Following screening, subjects who meet all screening entry criteria will be 
admitted to the clinical  unit on Study Day -2Semi-recumbent vital signs will be obtained following admission; the ESS 
will be recorded in the late afternoon. An overnight 8-hour nocturnal polysomnography (nPSG) will be performed, 
commencing at the subject’s usual bedtime (eg, between 2200 and 2300) to confirm that the subject does not have 
other comorbid sleep disorders or clinically significant nocturnal hypoxemia (O 2saturation ≤80% for ≥5% of total 
sleep time), and to confirm the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is ≤10/hour and the periodic limb movement index 
associated with arousals (PLMAI) is ≤15/hour.
Study Day -1 is the designated baseline assessment day and is also intended for accommodation to sleeping in the 
clinical unit without nPSG hookups.
There will be a minimum 24-hour washout interval between the end of TAK-925 
infusion and the commencement of treatment in the subsequent treatment period to allow for complete elimination of the preceding treatment effect. Study Days 2 and 4 are washout days. 
 During the study, adverse events (AEs) will be recorded, and clinical labs, vital signs, and ECGs will be 
obtained. Subjects will be discharged from the unit following completion of study exit procedures in the afternoon of Study Day 4 (Day 2 of Treatment Period 2). 
Subjects will be contacted by telephone approximately 7 days (±2 days) following unit discharge for a safety check 
and all women of childbearing potential will be asked to return to the clinic to complete a urine pregnancy test. If needed, subjects may be seen in the clinic for any safety issues or concerns.

Use of any over the counter or prescription medications with stimulating properties within 7 days prior to dosing 
or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer ) that could affect the evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness, or any use of 
sodium oxybate within 4 weeks of screening.
Nicotine dependence that is likely to have an effect on sleep (eg, a subject who routinely awakens at night to 
smoke) or challenge the conduct of this study (smokes ≥10 cigarettes/day) and/or an unwillingness to discontinue 
allsmoking and nicotine use during the confinement portion of the study (Day -2 to Day  4).
Caffeine consumption of more than 600 mg/day  for 7 day s before Study D ay 1 (1 serving of coffee is 
approximately equivalent to 120 mg of caffeine) and/or unwilling to discontinue all caffeine during the 
confinement portion of the study (Day -2 to Day  4).

hours before check -in through discharge on Study Day 4.
Histor y or presence of any unstable medical condition, behavioral or psychiatric disorder (including major 
depression or active suicidal ideation), or surgical history that could affect the safety of the subject or interfere 
with study efficacy, safety, PK assessments, or the ability of the subject to complete the study per the judgment 
of the investigator.
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
The primary endpoints for this study are:
Percentage of subjects who experience at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE).

Statistical Considerations:
Standard summaries of TEAEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), clinical safety labs, vital signs, and ECGs 
will be performed. Where appropriate, BP and QT parameters will be summarized (N, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) for baseline, post-dose, change from baseline, and change from time-matched baseline to post-dose by 
treatment.
The observed HR and BP will be analyzed using linear mixed effect model for repeated measures in crossover studies. 
The model will include sequence, period, treatment, time points, and treatment by time point interaction as fixed effects and a random effect for subject. The estimated mean HR and BP for each treatment and the associated standard error and 95% CI will be extracted from the model at each time, along with all pairwise differences from placebo and associated standard errors, 95% CIs, and p-values. The same quantities, averaged over all timepoints during the 
infusion and post the end of the infusion, will also be extracted from the model using appropriate contrasts.
Individual plasma concentrations of TAK-925 and PK parameter estimates will be listed for each 
subject and summarized using descriptive statistics, as appropriate.
Sample Size Justification:
Up to 40 subjects are planned to be randomized equally to each treatment sequence to ensure 36 subjects complete the 
study. This number of subjects is typical for phase 1 crossover study designs and is considered sufficient for assessment of safety.
In addition, when the true difference between TAK-925 and placebo is minimal, 
the chance to observe the same event is no more than 10%. Non-informative prior distributions  were used in the above 
probability calculation. Allowing for 4 dropouts (10%), 40 subjects are planned to be randomized.CCI

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Orexin and Idiopathic Hypersomnia
Orexin (OX) is a neuropeptide and the orexinergic system is a major wake -prom oting system o f 
the brain. Two orexinergic neuropeptides, OX -A and OX -B, have been ident ified to date. These 
neuropepti des exert effects via 2 ty pes of  receptors: orexin ty pe-1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 
type-2 receptor (OX2R). OX -A has a high affinit y to OX1R and OX2R, and OX -B has a high 
affinit y to OX2R. The 2 ty pes of  OX receptors have a distinct distribution in the arousal network: 
the locus coerul eus contains only  OX1Rs, the tuberom ammillary  nucleus contains only  OX2Rs, 
and both receptor ty pes occur in the dorsal raphe nucleus and ventral tegmental area. The 2 ty pes 
of OX receptors al so make distinct contributions to the regulat ion of arousal. OX2Rs in the 
tuberom ammillary nuc leus are essential for the maintenance of wakefulness, whereas both 
receptor ty pes are requi red for the inhibit ion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [1].
The pathological loss of orexinergic neurons is associated with the developmen t of narcolepsy 
type 1 (NT1) [
2]. Narcol epsy wi th catapl exy, or NT1, has bee n defined by  Internati onal 
Classificat ion of Sleep Disorders, Edit ion 3 (ICSD -3) cri teria as having l ow levels o f orexin in 
cerebrospinal fluid (<110 pg/mL; <30% of normal levels), coming fro m the nearly  com plete l oss 
of orexin producing neurons [3].
Idiopathic hyperso mnia (IH), defined by ICSD -3, is a chroni c neuro logical disorder that resul ts in 
excessive dayt ime sleepiness and is frequent ly accompanied by lo ng nocturnal or day time sleep, 
unrefreshing sleep, difficult y in awakening, cognit ive dysfunct ion, and autonomic symptoms [4].
The eti ology of the condi tion is unknown. Orexin levels in pat ients with IH are wi thin norm al 
limits. IH is thought to be a relat ively rare disease with the prevalence rate of 0.02% to 0.010% [
5].
However, the lack of clear dist inguishing symptoms, the unknown mechanism o f disease, and lack 
of a diagnosti c biomarker resul t in di fficul ties in discriminat ing IH fro m other ty pes of  
hyperso mnia, and thus the prevalence remains unclearly established.
Very  few clinical studi es have been conducted for the treatment of IH. A double -blind 
placebo -controlled crossover study  with a treatm ent peri od of  3 weeks each wit h 200 mg o f 
modafinil vs placebo in 33 drug -free adult IH patients without long sleep according to ICSD -
2 
criteria found that m odafinil significantly decreased the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) by  
4.5points. Change in sleep la tency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) versus 
placebo was not si gnificant. The clinical glo bal impressio n improved significant ly on modafinil 
from baseline to the last visit on treatment [6]. Medicat ions used for the treatment of IH incl ude 
stimulants such as modafinil, armodafinil methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and pemo line as 
well as in some patients, sodium oxybate, clarithromycin, and flumazenil. Ant idepressants with 
activat ing effects such a bupropion and venlafaxine may also be used. Modafinil is the only drug 
that had a m arket ing authorizat ion in so me European countries for the treatment of patients with 
IH. However, the European Medicines Agency wit hdrew the indicat ion of modafinil for the 
treatm ent of IH because the risk for development of skin or hy persensi tivity react ions and 
neuropsy chiatri c disorders outweighed the evidence for clinically important efficacy . There i s no

gold standard treatment for IH. As such, there is a huge unmet medical need for an effective 
treatment of the excessive daytime s leepiness (EDS) in this condition.
4.1.2 TAK-925
TAK-925 is a first-in -class OX2R-selective agonist. TAK-925 has a half-maximal effective 
concentration of 5.5 nM in OX2R– Chinese  hamster ovary (CHO) cells, versus >30 μM in OX1R–
CHO cells, indicating over 5,000-fold selectivity for OX2R. In vivo pharmacology studies 
demonstrated significant effects of TAK-925 on increasing wakefulness and decreasing 
cataplexy-like events in the OX/ataxin-3 transg enic mouse model of narcolepsy. In contrast,
TAK-925 did not show an arousal effect in OX2R knock-out mice, consistent with selectivity for 
OX2R. In addition, the arousal effect of TAK-925 after single dosing was demonstrated in 
3 different species of wild-type animals without orexin deficiency, including mice, cynomolgus 
monkeys, and marmosets during their normal sleep phase. These preclinical studies suggest that 
TAK-925 should show arousal effects in hypers omnolent states, whether or not due to orexin 
deficiency.
The first-in-human phase 1 study (TAK-925-1001), was conducted in Japan. This study was 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and PD of single, ascending 
doses of TAK-925 when adminis tered via a 9-hour IV i nfusion to healthy adult and healthy elderly 
subjects (aged ≥65 years old) and subjects with NT1. Single doses ranging from 7 to 240 mg in 
healthy sub jects, and single doses of 5, 11.2, and 44.8 mg test ed in subjects with NT1, were safe 
and well-tolerated with no severe adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs). All AEs 
except influenza (considered as moderate) were mild in severity. A single event of euphoric mood 
was reported for a subject receiving 44.8 mg TAK-925, the event was considered related to study
drug and resolved the same day. All cardiovascular-related AEs (increased blood pressure [BP], 
pulse rate increased) were considered mild by the investigator. The incidence of increased BP was 
increased in a dose-dependent manner starting from 134 mg (2 of 6 healthy adult sub jects [33.3%]) 
and was most evident in the 240-mg group (4 of 6 healthy adult subjects [66.7%]). At the same 
dose of 112 mg, the incidence of increased BP was higher in Cohort 3 healthy elderly subjects (3 
of 6 subjects [50.0%]), compared with Cohort 1 and 2 healthy adult subjects (2 of 6 subjects CCI

[33.3%]). Dose-related increases in BP and pulse after single dosing were observed in healthy 
cohorts. 
.
Following a single IV infusion, mean plasma systemic exposure of TAK-925 increased 
approximately dose proportionally ac ross cohorts. On average, time to reach plateau was 
approximately 3 hours and the plasma terminal elimination t 1/2ranged from approximately 3 to 
5 hours across all doses. TAK-925 exposure was increased by <30% in elderly subjects (aged 65 to 
80 years) possibly due to decreased hepatic clearance. Furthermore, a proof-of-mechanism (POM) 
study in sleep-deprived healthy subjects was conducted in the United States (TAK-925-1002). 
 All regimens were well-tolerated with no severe or SAEs, and most AEs 
were mild. A single event of euphoric mood was reported for a subject during treatment with 
112 mg TAK-925; the event was considered mild in  intensity, related to study drug, and resolved 
the following day. Changes in DBP appeared to increase with increasing concentration of 
TAK-925 but there were no apparent trends in the change from time-matched baseline in heart rate 
(HR) or SBP when compared to TAK-925 plasma concentration. Lastly, another study, 
TAK-925-1003, is evaluating both NT1 subjects (orexin deficient) as well as narcolepsy type 2 
(NT2) subjects (orexin levels though to be within  normal) with TAK-925 admin istered as  a 9-hour 
IV infusion for 7 days.
For more detailed background on TAK-925 nonclinical and clinical studies, please refer to the 
Investigator's Brochure.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of a single IV infusion 
of TAK-925 in subjects with IH to support further development of TAK-925 as a potential 
treatment for this condition.
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
Results from Study TAK-925-1002 in sleep-deprived subjects suggest that there may be potential
benefit of TAK-925 in other patient populations who have EDS associated with primary sleep 
disorders that are not associated with orexin deficiency, including patients with NT2, IH, and EDS 
associated with obstructive sleep  apnea (OSA). Hence in this proposed phase 1b study, adult 
patients diagnosed with IH according to  the ICSD-3 criteria will be evaluated.CCICCICCI

4.3 Benefit/Risk Profile
TAK-925 is a first-in -class OX2R-selective agonist. Nonclinical pharmacology studies 
demonstrated that TAK-925 had arousal effects in hypersomnolent states both in animals with 
orexin deficiency (mice) and animals without orexi n deficiency (mice, cynomolgus monkeys and 
marmosets). To explore potential effects in humans, the TAK-925-1001 (first-in-human) and 
TAK-925-1002 studies included healthy adult subjects, healthy elderly subjects, narcolepsy 
subjects with orexin deficiency (NT1), and sleep-deprived healthy subjects. In this proposed phase 
1b study, subjects with IH will be evaluated. The results may provide an early indication of 
whether TAK-925 has PD effects in subjects with IH and is safe and well-tolerated.
Increased SBP was noted in the safety pharmacology study in monkeys. This is considered a 
potentially on- mechanism effect based on published literature [7]. In the completed clinical studies 
of TAK-925, mild treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of increased BP and HR have been 
observed, which resolved after treatment discontinuation. The 112 mg dose level proposed in this 
study was found to be safe and tolerable in these studies in which healthy subjects received single 
IV doses of TAK-925 up to 240 mg (Study TAK-925-1001). In sleep-deprived healthy subjects, 
administration of the 112 mg dose level resulted in some elevation of placebo-adjusted mean DBP 
of approximately 6 to 9 mmHg throughout mu ch of the nocturnal infusion time although not 
reported as TEAEs (Study TAK-925-1002). In this study, BP will be frequently monitored for all 
subjects. As TAK-925 has been shown to have a s hort elimination half-life, discontinuation of 
infusion, if needed, would be e xpected to result in rapid resolution of increased BP. Stopping 
criteria for effects on BP are provided (see Section 6.3).CCI

6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION
6.1 Study Design
This is a phase 1b, randomized, double-b lind, placebo-c ontrolled, 2-period, 2-tr eatment crossover 
study to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerab ility of a single IV infusion dose of TAK-925 in 
subjects with IH. Subjects will be males and females aged 18 through 75 years, inclusive, with IH 
diagnosed according to the ICSD-3 criteria (Appendix F)  as verified by a previous nocturnal 
polysomnography (nPSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) study performed within the last 
10 years. 
The treatment periods begin on Da y 1 of Treatment Period 1 (Study Day 1) with Treatment 
Period 2 commencing on Study Day 3. In the morning of Day 1 of Treatment Period 1, eligible 
subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 sequence groups as listed in Table 6.a.  After randomization, 
the subject will be dosed in 2 treatment periods according to the order defined by the sequence 
group to which he/she is randomized. On Day 1 of each treatment period, TAK-925 (or placebo) 
will be administered as a single 9-hour IV infusion commencing at approximately 0800. The 
infusion will be ter minated at approximately 1700.
. 
A summary of the treatment assignmen t and sequence is presented in Table 6.a.  The Schedule of 
Study Procedures is included in Appendix A and Treatment Day 1 Hourly Schedule is in Appendix 
B.

At the screening visit, eligible subjects who have an ESS score of ≥11 will complete medical 
histories and physical examinations, semi-recumbent vital signs assessment, a 12-lead ECG, Beck 
Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Columbia Sui cide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and clinical 
safety laboratory tests. Subjects with an ESS sc ore of <11 who are taking stimulants at screening 
may continue the screening process and repeat the ESS at Study Day -2 following washout. A total 
of 40 subjects will be randomized so that at least 36 subjects will complete the study. To avoid 
enrollment of short sleepers with chronic sleep deprivation, prospective participants will complete 
approximately 7 consecutive days of actigraphy supported by a sleep diary beginning on Study 
Day -9 and ending on Study Day -3 (ie, the da y before their Study Day -2 admission to the clinical 
unit), to ensure an average nightly sleep duration of ≥420 minutes (7 hours) during the subject’s 
normal nocturnal sleep peri od, and, if the subject’s average nightly sleep duration is ≤480 minutes CCI

(8 hours), that the subject does not have insufficien t sleep syndrome (sleepi ng >2 hours/night more 
on “off days” than on “work days”). During screening, eligible subjects must discontinue their 
stimulant medications used for treatment of IH. Medications must be discontinued for a minimum 
of 7 days or at least 5 half-lives of each medication, whichever is longer, before the first day of
dosing (Day 1 of Treatment Period 1). Sodium  oxybate must be discontinued at least 4weeks
before screening. 
The screening period is up to 28 days. Following screening, subjects who meet all screening entry 
criteria will be admitted to the clinical unit (St udy Day -2). Semi-recumben t vital signs will be 
obtained following admission, and the ESS will be recorded in the late afternoon. An overnight 
8-hour nPSG will be performed commencing at approximately the subject’s normal bedtime (eg, 
between 2200 and 2300) to confirm that the subject does not have other comorbid sleep disorders 
or clinically significant nocturnal hypoxemia (O 2saturation ≤80% for≥5% of total sleep time), 
and to confirm the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) is ≤10/hour and the periodic limb movement 
index associated with arousals (PLMAI) is ≤15/hour.
Safety assessments including BP, pulse, respiration 
rate, and ECG will be collected per the Schedule of Study Procedures (Appendix A) .
On Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 (Study Day 1), all eligible subjects will be randomized and 
receive the first dose of study drug. TAK-925 or place bo will be administered as a single 9-hour IV 
infusion commencing at approximately 08:00.
tudy Days 2 and 4 are washout days.
 Safety assessments 
including AEs, vital signs, and ECGs will be r ecorded. During the study, AEs will be recorded, 
and clinical labs, vital signs, and safety ECGs will be obtained. Subjects will be discharged from 
the unit following completion of study exit procedures in the afternoon of Study Day 4 (Day 2 of
Treatment Period 2). 
Subjects will return to the study site or be co ntacted by telephone approximately 7 days (±2 days) 
following unit discharge for a safety check and all women of childbearing potential must return to 
the study site to complete a urine pregnancy test at the end-of-study visit.

6.2 Justification for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints
6.2.1 Rationale for Study Design
This is a study with a 2-period Williams crossover design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, 
 of TAK-925. The endpoints in such studies have smaller variability than those in the 
parallel design as the subjects are used as their own control. Such design has been previously used 
in other studies of drugs that have been evaluated for effects on wakefulness [8]. As previously 
shown, mean TAK-925 concentrations decline rapidly after the end of infusion with levels 
quantifiable up to 18 hours post-dose at a dose of 112 mg; hence, a greater than 24-hour period 
from the end of dosing of TAK-925 to the start of the next dosing is deemed sufficient to ensure 
adequate drug washout. The short washout interval also enables full confinement from Treatment 
Period 1 to Treatment Period 2, which will potentially reduce the dropout rates and increase study 
compliance. Some subjects with IH have severe dayt ime sleepiness despite their best efforts to stay 
awake.
6.2.2 Rationale for Dose
Based on the currently available information, this study will evaluate a single-dose of TAK-925 at 
112 mg.
Single-dose administration of TAK-925 in a slow infusion over 9 hours up to 240 mg in healthy 
adult subjects, up to 112 mg in healthy elderly sub jects, and up to 44.8 mg in subjects with NT1, 
was well-tolerated with no major safety concerns. BP and HR increases were the most frequently 
reported TEAEs. While these increases were consistently observed with TAK-925 doses 
≥134.4 mg/day in healthy adult sub jects (or 112 mg/day in healthy elderly subjects) with a greater 
incidence of these AEs at the maximum dose of 240 mg, no BP or HR increase AEs were reported 
with lower TAK-925 doses.CC

A single dose of 112 mg is selected to evaluate a dose of TAK-925 that is expected to produce 
wake-promoting e ffects, while maintaining an acceptable clinical safety profile in this IH subject 
population. 
6.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
As this is a single-dose study, the standard safety endpoints for early clinical development will be 
included. In a safety pharmacology study of TAK-925 as well as in the first-in-human study
(TAK-925-1001), cardiovascular-related adverse findings including PR prolongation and 
elevation of BP and HR were reported. Based on these observations, the following assessments 
will be included:
!TEAEs; subjects will be monitored closely throughout the study for any AEs.
!Physical examinations.
!Vital signs, including frequent monitoring of BP, pulse, and respiratory rate.
!12-lead ECGs.
!Clinical laboratory safety evaluations (standard hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis).
To characterize the PK of TAK-925 administered as a single IV infusion dose 
to subjects with IH, the following PK parameters will be estimated as data permit.
!AUC∞.
!AUC last.
!Cmax.
!Ceoi.
!Time of first occurrence of C max(tmax).
!Terminal disposition phase half-life (t 1/2z).
!Volume of distribution at steady state after IV administration (V ss) (only for TAK-925).
!Volume of distribution during the terminal disposition phase after IV administration (V z) (only 
for TAK-925).
!Total clearance after IV administration (CL) (only for TAK-925).

7.5 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject
The primary  reason for di scont inuat ion or wi thdrawal  of the subject from  the study  or study drug 
shoul d be recorded in the electronic case rep ort form (eCRF) using the following categories. For 
screen failure subjects, refer to Section 9.8.
1.Pretreatment event (PTE) or AE: The subject has experienced a PTE or AE that requires early 
termination because cont inued participat ion imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s 
healt h or the subject is unwilling to continue because of the PTE or AE.
Liver function test (LFT) abnormalit ies:
Study  drug shoul d be discontinued immediately with appropriate clinical fo llow-up 
(including repeat laboratory  tests, until a subject’s laboratory  profile has returned to 
norm al/baseline status, see Section 9.4), if the fo llowing circumstances occur at any t ime 
during study  drug treatm ent:
–ALT or AST >8 × ULN, or
–ALT or AST >3 × ULN in conjunct ion with elevated total  bilirubin >2 × ULN or 
internat ional norm alized ratio >1.5, or
–ALT or AST >3 × ULN with appearance of fat igue, nausea, vo miting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%).
Suicidali ty:
–Study  drug should be discont inued immediately for subjects at imminent risk o f suicide 
per the invest igator’s clinical judgment.
BP and HR increase: Criteria for stopping an infusion due to elevated BP or HR are defined 
as fo llows (“sustained” is defined as 2 readings separated by  approximately  15 minutes):
–Sustained SBP ≥160 mmHg or su stained post -dose change fro m pre-dose baseline o f 
≥30mmHg.
–Sustained DBP ≥100 mmHg or sustained post -dose change fro m pre-dose baseline of 
≥30mmHg
–Sustained HR >100 bpm or sustained post -dose change fro m pre-dose baseline of 
≥30bpm.
Seizures
Severe cha nges in mood.
Any subject who experiences a treatment -emergent seri ous AE or a severe AE that is 
considered related to treatment.
Note: The reasons above should be recorded on the eCRF if the PTE or AE is chosen as the 
primary  reason of discont inuat ion.

meet protocol entry  criteria or di d not adhere to protocol requirements, and continued 
participat ion poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s healt h.
3.Lost to fol low-up: The subject di d not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject 
were unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents.
4.Voluntary  withdrawal: The subject (or subject’s legally  acceptable representative) wishes to 
withdraw from  the study . The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the 
eCRF. 
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, 
where possible, the primary  underlying reason shoul d be recorded (i e, wi thdrawal due to an 
AE shoul d not be recorded in the “vo luntary withdrawal” category ).Similarly, lack o f efficacy 
shoul d not be recorded in the “vo luntary withdrawal ” category .
5.Study  terminat ion:The sponsor, IRB, IEC, or regulatory  agency  terminates the study .

by a physician or obtained by the subject OTC.
9.1.5 Washout of Prohibited Concomitant Medications
The use of conco mitant m edicat ions is prohibited starting from 7 days or 5 half -lives, whichever 
period is l onger for the drug classes liste d in Table 7.abefore administration of the first dose of 
study  drug.
9.1.6 Actigraphy and Sleep Diary
Approximately  7 consecutive days of act igraphy supported by a sleep diary will be recorded 
beginning on Study  Day  
-9 and ending on Study  Day  -3 (ie, the day  before thei r Study  Day  -2 
admissio n to the clinical unit). Data from the act igraphy device will be downloaded by the site to 
ensure that a subject sleeps o n average 420 min (7 hours)/night and does not have insufficient 
sleep syndrome, as specified in the exclusio n criteria.
9.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments
9.2.1 Physical Examination Procedure
A full physical examinat ion will be performed at the times specified in the Schedule of Study  
Procedures ( Appendix A) and will consist of the following body  systems: (1) ey es; (2) ears, nose, 
throat; (3) cardiovascular system; (4) respi ratory  system; (5) gastrointestinal system; 
(6)dermatologic system; (7) extremit ies; (8) musculoskeletal system; (9) nervous system; 
(10) lymph nodes; and (11) other.
All postbaseline physical examinat ions should assess clinically signifi cant changes fro m the 
baseline assessment.
9.2.2 Height, Weight, and BMI
Body  weight and height will be obtained with the subject’s shoes off, and jacket or coat removed.
BMI equals a subject’s weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (BMI =kg/m2). 
BMI will be rounded to the nearest whole number according to the standard convent ion of 0.1 to 
0.4, round down, and 0.5 to 0.9, round up.
9.2.3 BDI-II
The Beck Depressio n Inventory  is a wi dely used psychom etric test for m easuring the intensit y, 
severit y, and depth of depression in patients with psychiatric diagnoses. This study  will use the 
most updated versio n of the Beck Depressio n Inventory  (1996, BDI -II).
The test is composed of 21 questions, each designed to assess a specific symptom commo n among 
peopl e with depressio n. Each answer is scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores 
indicate m ore severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used are:
0–13: minimal depressio n.

14–19: mild depressio n.
20–28: m oderate depressi on.
29–63: severe depressio n.
The BDI -II is posit ively correlated with the Hamilt on Depression Rat ing Scale with a Pearson r of 
0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown to have a high one -week test -retest 
reliabilit y (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly  sensit ive to daily variat ions in mood 
[
12]. The test also has high internal consistency (α =.91) [ 13].
9.2.4 C
-SSRS
Suicidal  ideati on will  be assessed using the C -SSRS at the times stipulated in the Schedule of 
Study  Procedures (see Appendix A). Two versi ons of  the C -SSRS will be used in this study : the 
screening/baseline C -SSRS lifet ime and the since -last-visit C -SSRS. Any  suicidal  ideation or 
suicidal behavi or during study periods detected by  C-SSRS will be recorded as AEs. The 
investigator will ensure that any  suicidal  ideation or behavior is medically addressed, including 
assessment and treatment by  qualified m edical  personnel .
9.2.5 Study Drug Administration
On Day 1 of each t reatment period, study drug (TAK -925 112 mg o r placebo) will be administered 
as described in Sect ion 6.1.
9.2.6 Vital Sign Procedure
Vital signs will  include SBP and DBP, HR, body  temperature, and respi ratory  rate. The sam e 
method (eg, same size cuff, manual or automated) must be used for all measurements for each 
individual subject and should be the same for all subjects.
Body  temperature will be measured with an oral  (tem perature taken at floor of the mouth) or 
tympanic thermo meter. O 2saturation index will be measured at screening (finger monitor).
Subjects should rest in a bed with the head o f the bed at 30 degrees for at least 5 minutes before 
vital signs are measured. Vital signs will include HR, respiratory rate, SBP, and DBP. The same 
method (eg, same size cuff, manual or automated) must be used for all measurements for each 
individual subject and should be the same for all subjects.
Subjects should c ontinue to rest in a bed with the head of the bed at 30 degrees fro m the time of 
dosing unt il 2 hours post -dose except to stand if necessary for study -related procedures.
9.2.7 12-Lead ECG
A standard 12
-lead ECG will be recorded. The fo llowing parameters will be recorded 
electroni cally by  a central  reader fro m the subject’s ECG trace: HR, RR interval, PR interval, QT 
interval , QRS interval.

samples should be collected at a site that is as distant to the infusion site as possible, and the site of 
the blood sampling should be documented. The blood sampling times and times of the start and 
end of infusions should be recorded accurately on the source document and eCRF; particular care 
should be given when recording the blood samp ling times during the infusion and around the time 
close to the infusion. Sampling time points may be adjusted based on the preliminary emerging 
concentration data collected from prior subjects, but the total number of samples collected per 
subjects should not exceed the planned number.
Instructions for collecting, processing, and shipping of PK samples are provided in the laboratory
manual.
9.5.2.2 PK Sample Analysis
Plasma concentration of TAK-925  will be measured by a validated

10.0 PRETREATMENT EVENTS AND AEs
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 PTEs
A PTE i s defined as any  untowa rd medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but pri or to administration of any study  drug; i t 
does not necessarily  have to have a causal relat ionship wit h study  parti cipat ion.
10.1.2 AEs
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject 
administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clini cally significant abnormal 
laboratory  value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f a drug whether or not 
it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.3 Additional Points to Consider for PTEs and AEs
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or 
AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure .
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  drug or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by the invest igator for any reason.
PTEs/AEs caused by a study  procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) o r symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG findings are only  considered to be PTEs or AEs if they 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some ac tion or i ntervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). 
Alaboratory  or ECG retest and/or continued mo nitoring of an abnormal value or finding are

TAK -925
Study No. TAK -925-2002 Page 59of 118
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 02 04 March 2020
not consi dered an intervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for 
verification, evaluat ion or monitoring o f an abnormalit y is not consi dered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condi tions and shoul d NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related to 
study  procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complication occurs before start of study drug) or an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators shou ld ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing episodic concurrent medical condit ion (eg, asthma, epilepsy) any 
occurrence of an episode should only be captured as a PTE/AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious, or severe in nature. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion from baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condition should only  be recorded as a PTE/AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the cond ition (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Invest igators should ensure that 
the AE term re corded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term  recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs/serious PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum intensit y record ed.
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
perform ed early  (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the

TAK -925
Study No. TAK -925-2002 Page 60of 118
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 02 04 March 2020
worsening of the condit ion shoul d be recorded as a PTE or an AE. Complications result ing 
from any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insuff icient clinical response (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion should NOT be recorded as an 
AE. The invest igator must make the dist inction between exacerbation of pre -exist ing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented in the eCRF. Any manifested side effects will be 
considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.
10.1.4 SAEs
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose fulfills 1 or more of the 
serious cri teria below:
1.Results in DEATH.
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were m ore severe.
3.Requi res inpat ient HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of exist ing hospitalizat ion.
4.Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.
5.Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT.
6.Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the fo llowing:
May require intervent ion to prevent items 1 through 5 above.
May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospitalization.
Includes any event or synonym described in the Takeda Medically  Significant AE List 
(Table 10.a).

Terms identified on the Medically Significant AE List represent the broad medical concepts to be considered as 
“Important Medical Events” satisfying SAE reporting requirements.
PTEs that fulfill 1 or more of the serious criteria above are also to be considered SAEs and should 
be reported and followed up in the same manner (see Sections 10.2.2 and10.3) .
10.1.5 AEs of Sp ecial Interest
AESIs will be collected and reported as AEs or SAEs, as defined in 
Section 10.1.2 and10.1.4,  according to the procedures in Section 10.2.1 and10.2.2,  respectively.
10.1.6 Intensity of PTEs and AEs
The different categories of intensity (s everity) are characterized as follows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.7 Causality of AEs
The relationship of each AE to study drug(s) will be assessed using the following categories:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant medications, and concurrent treatments may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follo w a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/or 
that can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant medications, and concurrent treatments.CCI

10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The rel ationship should be as sessed as related if the invest igator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as not related.
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the firs t signs/symptom s were noted by  the subject 
and/or invest igator.
10.1.10 Stop Date
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.
10.1.11 Frequency
Episodi c AEs/PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those w hich occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Drug
Drug withdrawn –a study  drug i s stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stopping a study  drug.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not applicable –a study  drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE eg, the 
study  has been terminated, the subject died, d osing with study drug was already stopped before 
the onset of the AE.
Dose interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
Dose delayed –the dose was delayed due to the particular AE.
10.1.13 Outcome
Recovered/reso lved –Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/resolving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/reso lving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, si gns/ sym ptom s or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the

subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved”.
Resolved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of death.
Unknown –the course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hospital change or 
residence change at the end of the subject’s participation in the study .
10.2 Procedures
10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs
10.2.1.1 PTE and AE Collection Period
Collect ion of PTEs w ill co mmence from the time the subject signs the informed consent to 
participate in the study  and cont inue until the subject is first administered study drug (Study 
Day 1) or until screen failure. For subjects who discontinue prior to study  drug administra tion, 
PTEs are collected until the subject discontinues study  parti cipat ion.
Collect ion of AEs will co mmence fro m the time that the subject is first administered study  drug 
(Study  Day 1). Routine co llection o f AEs will continue unt il the fo llow-up/early te rminat ion visit .
10.2.1.2 PTE and AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ngat any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Non-serious PTEs, rel ated or unrel ated to the study  procedure, need not to be followed- up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study  drug or 
not, m ust be m onitored until  the symp toms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or until there is a sat isfactory  explanat ion for the 
changes observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, 
whether or not the in vestigator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The 
following informat ion will be documented for each event:
1.Event term .
2.Start and stop date and time.
3.Frequency.
4.Intensit y.

5.Invest igator’s opinio n of the causal relat ionship between the event and administration of study 
drug(s) (related or not related) (not completed for PTEs).
6.Invest igator’s opinio n of the causal relat ionship to study  procedure(s), including the details of 
the suspected procedure.
7.Action concerning study  drug (not appli cable for PTEs).
8.Outcom e of event.
9.Seriousness.
10.2.2 Collection and Reporting of SAEs
When an SAE occurs through the AE collection period it should be reported according to the 
following procedure:
SAEs should be reported via SAE eCRF in Rave EDC, which is the preferred m ethod of reporting 
SAEs. A Takeda SAE eCRF must be completed in English and signed by the invest igator 
immediately  or wi thin 24 hours of first onset or notification o f the event. The informat ion shoul d 
be co mpleted as fully as possible but shoul d contain, at a minimum:
A short descript ion of the event and the reason why  the event i s categori zed as serious.
Subject identificat ion number.
Invest igator’s name.
Nam e of the study  drug(s).
Causalit y assessment.
If access to Rave EDC is not feasible wit hin 24 hours of receiving the event, the paper SAE forms 
shoul d be submi tted vi a fax. The SAE form should be completed within 24 hours of first onset or 
notification o f the event, signed by the investigator, and transmitted via fax or email to the 
attenti on of the contact listed in Section 1.1. In case of fax, site personnel need to confirm 
successful transmissio n of all pages and include an e -mail address on the fax cover sheet so that an 
acknowledgment of receipt can be returned via e -mail wit hin 1 busine ss day .
Email submissio n of SAE forms (to the appropriate e -mail address listed below) with a portable 
docum ent format (PDF) attachment should only be used in the case where fax is not possible and 
access to Rave EDC is not feasible within 24 hours of rece iving the event. In case of e mail, site 
personnel need to confirm successful transmissio n by awaiting an acknowledgment of the receipt 
via e m ail wi thin 1 business day .
United States and Canada: PVSafet yAmericas@tpna.co m
Rest of World: eupv@tgrd.com
If SA Es are reported via fax or by  email, Rave EDC must be updated as soon as possible with the 
appropriate informat ion.

Any SAE spontaneously reported to the invest igator fo llowing the AE collect ion period should be 
reported to the sponsor if considered relate d to study  parti cipat ion. 
10.2.3 Reporting of Abnormal LFTs
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST elevated >3 ×ULN on 2 consecut ive occasions, the 
abnorm ality shoul d be recorded as an AE. In addition, an LFT Increases eCRF must be co mpleted 
provi ding addit ional information on rel evant recent history , risk factors, clinical signs and 
symptoms and results of any addit ional diagnosti c tests performed.
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST >3 ×ULN and total bilirubin >2 ×ULN for which an 
alternat ive etio logy has not been i dentified, the event should be recorded as an SAE and reported 
as per Secti on 10.2.2 . The investigator must con tact the m edical m onitor fo r discussio n of the 
relevant subject details and possible alternative etiologies, such as acute viral hepat itis A or B or 
other acute liver disease or medical history /concurrent m edical  condi tions. Foll ow-up laboratory  
tests as described in Section 9.4must also be performed. In addit ion, an LFT Increases eCRF must 
be co mpleted and transmitted with the Takeda SAE form (as per Section 10.2.2 ).
10.3 Follow -up of SAEs
If informat ion not available at the time of the first report becomes available later, the invest igator 
shoul d com plete a follow -up SAE fo rm or provide other wri tten documentati on and fax it 
immediately . 
Copi es of  any relevant data from the hospital notes (eg, ECGs, laboratory  tests, 
discharge summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the addressee, if requested.
All SAEs should be fo llowed up unt il reso lution or perm anent outcome of the event. The timelines 
and procedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the init ial report.
10.3.1 Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities
The sponsor will be resp onsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions 
(SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory  authori ties, invest igators, and IRBs or 
IECs, as applicable, in accordance with nat ional regulat ions in the countries where the st udy is 
conducted. Relat ive to the first awareness of the event by/or further provisio n to the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee, SUSARs will be submitted to the regulatory  authori ties as expedi ted reports
within 7 days for fatal and life -threatening events and 15 days for other serious events, unless 
otherwi se requi red by  national regulat ions. The sponsor will also prepare an expedited report for 
other safet y issues where these might materially alt er the current benefit -risk assessment of a study 
drug/sponsor -supplied drug or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the study 
drug/sponsor -supplied drug administration or in the overall conduct of the study. The study site 
also will forward a copy of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC in accorda nce with local
regul ations.

12.1 eCRFs
Com pleted eCRFs are required for each subject who signs an informed consent.
The sponsor or its designee will supply study  sites wi th access to eCRFs. The sponsor will make 
arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the eCRF. These forms are used to transmit  
the informat ion collected in the performance of this study to the sponsor and regulatory authorities. 
eCRFs must be completed in English.
After complet ion of the entr y process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, such as 
inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may be issued by Takeda 
personnel (or designees) and will be answered by the site.
Correcti ons are recorded i n an aud it trail that captures the ol d informat ion, the new informat ion, 
ident ificat ion of the person making the correction, the date the correction was made, and the reason 
for change. Reasons for si gnificant correcti ons shoul d addi tionally be included.
The princ ipal invest igator must review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and must e-sign 
the appropriate eCRFs as indicated. Furthermore, the invest igator must retain full responsibilit y 
for the accuracy  and authent icity of all data entered on the eCRFs .
After the lock of  the study database, any  change of, m odificati on of , or addi tion to the data on the 
eCRFs should be made by the invest igator with use of change and modificat ion records of the 
eCRFs. The principal invest igator must review the data change for c ompleteness and accuracy and 
must si gn and date.
eCRFs will be reviewed for completeness and acceptabilit y at the study  site during peri odic visi ts 
by the sponsor or its designee. The sponsor or its designee will be permitted to review the subject’s 
medica l and hospital records pertinent to the study  to ensure accuracy  of the eCRFs. The 
completed eCRFs are the sole property  of the sponsor and should not be made available in any 
form to thi rd parti es, except for authorized representatives o f appropri ate gove rnmental  health or 
regul atory  authori ties, wi thout wri tten permissio n of the sponsor.

13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to unblinding of subject’s 
treatment assignment. This document will provide  further details regarding the definition of 
analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives.
A blinded data review will be conducted prior to unblinding of subject’s treatment assignment. 
This review will assess the accuracy and completeness of the study database, subject evaluability,
and appropriateness of th e planned s tatist ical met hods.
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
13.1.1.1 Safety Set
The safety set will consist of all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. Subjects in this analysis set will be used for demographic, baseline characteristics, and 
safety summaries.
13.1.1.2 PK Set
The PK analysis set will consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and have
at least 1 measurable plasma concentration.
13.1.2 Analysis of Demographics an d Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized and listed by treatment 
sequence and overall. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data for continuous 
variables such as age and weight (number of subjects [N], mean, median, SD, minimum, and 
maximum) and for categorical variables such as sex, ethnicity, and race (number and percentage of 
subjects within each category). Tobacco and alcohol use will also be summarized. Medical history 
and medication history will be listed by subject.
13.1.3 PK Analysis
Individual plasma concentrations of TAK-925 and PK parameter estimates 
will be listed for each subject and summarized using descriptive s tatistics as  appropriate.CCI

13.1.5 Safety Analysis
AEs will be summarized using the safety analysis set.
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA. Data will be summarized using preferred term and primary 
system organ class.
Standard summaries of TEAEs, clinical safety labs, vital signs and ECGs will be performed. 
Where appropriate, BP and QT parameters will be summarized (N, mean, SD, median, minimum 
and maximum) for baseline, post-dose, change from baseline and change from time-matched 
baseline to post-dose by treatment.
The observed HR and BP will be analyzed using linear mixed effect model for repeated measures 
in crossover studies. The model will include sequence, period, treatment, time points, and 
treatment by time point interaction as fixed effects and a random effect for subject within 
sequence. The estimated mean HR and BP for each treatment and the associated standard error and 
95% CI will be extracted from the model at each time, along with all pairwise differences from 
placebo and associated standard errors, 95% CIs, and p-values. The same quantities, averaged over 
all timepoints duri ng the infusion and post the end of the infusion, will also be extracted from the 
model using appropriate contrasts.
13.2 Interim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination
When at least 12 subjects completed both treatment periods, an interim analysis may be performed 
for futility, superiority, and/or sample s ize re-estimation. The criteria for futility and superiority 
will be described in the SAP.
13.3 Determination of Sample Size
Up to 40 subjects are planned to be randomized equally to each treatment sequence to ensure 
36 subjects complete the study. This number of subjects is typ ical for phase 1 crossover study
designs and is considered sufficient for assessment of safety.CCI

14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
14.1 Study Site Monitoring Visits
Moni toring visit sto the study  site will  be made peri odically  during the study  to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are fo llowed. Source documents will be reviewed for verificat ion of data 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, dat a, and records. 
The invest igator and the study site guarantee access to source documents by the sponsor or its 
designee (CRO) and by  the IRB or IEC.
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by the sponsor or sponsor’s 
design ee (as l ong as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the invest igator’s
binder , study  drug, subject m edical  records, informed consent documentation, and review of 
eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important that the investig ator and other study  
personnel are available during the monitoring visit s and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
14.2 Protocol Deviations
The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study  subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviat ion from protocol -specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the sponsor or 
designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be 
no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) from the inclusio n or exclusio n criteria.
Significant deviat ions include, but are not limited to, those that invo lve fraud or misconduct, 
increase the healt h risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study  assessment.
14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections
The study  site also m ay be subject to qualit y assurance audi ts by  the sponsor or desi gnees. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated audi tor will contact the site in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilit ies where laboratory  samples are collected, 
where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facilit y used during the study . In 
addition, the re is the possibilit y that this study may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including 
those of foreign governments (eg, the United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA], the 
United Kingdo m Med icines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the Pha rmaceut icals and 
Medical Devices Agency of Japan). If the study  site is contacted for an inspection by  a regulatory 
body , the sponsor should be notified immediately. The investigator and study site guarantee access 
for quali ty assurance auditors to all stu dy docum ents as described in Section 14.1.

15.0 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF T HE STUDY
This study  will be conducted wi th the highest respect for the individual pa rticipants (i e, subjects) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration o f 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the study  according to applicable local o r regi onal regul atory  requi rements and align his or her 
conduct in accordance with the “Responsibilit ies of the Inve stigator” that are listed in Appendix C. 
The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilities.
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable state a nd federal/local requirements 
of each participat ing regio n. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names 
and tit les of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC 
has di rect parti cipat ion in this st udy, written notification regarding his or her abstinence fro m 
voting must also be obtained. Those American sites unwilling to provide names and tit les of all 
members due to privacy  and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a Federal Wide 
Assurance Number or comparable number assigned by  the Department of Health and Human 
Services.
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submissio n to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Inves tigator’s Brochure, a copy  of 
the informed consent form, and, if applicable, subject recruit ment materials and/or advertisements 
and other documents required by all applicable laws and regulations, must be submitted to a 
central  or local IRB or IEC for app roval. The IRB’s or IEC’s w ritten approval  of the protocol and 
subject informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before 
commencement of the study  (ie, before shipment of the sponsor -supplied drug or study -specific 
screening activit y). The IRB or IEC approval must refer to the study  by exact protocol tit le, 
number, and versio n date; ident ify versio ns of other documents (eg, informed consent form) 
reviewed; and state the approval date. The sponsor will ship drug/notify site on ce the sponsor has 
confirmed the adequacy of site regulatory  docum entati on and, when applicable, the sponsor has 
received permissio n from competent authori ty to begin the study . Until the si te receives 
drug/notificat ion no protocol activit ies, including sc reening may  occur.
Study  sites m ust adhere to all requirements st ipulated by their respect ive IRB or IEC. This may 
include notificat ion to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed 
consent form, recruit ment materials intended fo r viewing by  subjects, l ocal safety reporting 
requi rements, reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the study at intervals specified 
by the respect ive IRB or IEC, and submission o f the invest igator’s final status report to IRB or 
IEC. All IRB a nd IEC approvals and relevant documentation for these items must be provided to 
the sponsor or its designee.
Subject incentives shoul d not exert undue influence for participat ion. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by the IRB or IEC and sponsor.

15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws a nd regulations. The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclo sures of the subject’s personal and personal healt h informat ion for purposes of 
conducting the study. The informed consent form and the subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
further explain the nature of the study, its object ives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the 
date informed consent is given. T he informed consent form will detail the requirements of the 
subject and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any t ime without giving a reason and 
without prej udice to hi s or her further m edical care.
The invest igator is responsible for the prepa ration, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
inform ed consent form  and if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) must 
be approved b y both the IRB or IEC and the sponsor prior to use.
The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form  (if applicable), and subject informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective subject. 
It is the responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject. Information should be given in both oral and wri tten form  whenever possible and in the 
manner deemed appropriate by the IRB or IEC. If the subject is not capable o f rendering adequate 
written inform ed consent, then the subject’s legally  acceptable representative may  provide such 
consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If th e 
subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the informed consent form and subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) m ust be 
signed and dated by  the subject , or the subject’s legal ly acceptable representative, at the time of 
consent and prior to the subject entering into the study . The subject or the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, 
using blue or black b allpoint ink. The invest igator must also sign and date the informed consent 
form and subject authorizat ion (if applicable) at th e time of consent and prior to subject entering 
into the study; however, the sponsor may  allow a designee of the invest igator to sign to the extent 
permitted by  applicable law.
Once signed, the original informed consent form, subject authorization form (if applicable), and 
subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the invest igator’s site file. The 
investigator mus t docum ent the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s 
medical record. Copies of the signed informed consent form, the signed subject authorization for m 
(if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) shall be given to t he subject.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 02 04 March 2020
All revised informed consent forms must be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects or the 
relevant subject’s legally acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent was obtained should be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record, and the subject should receive a copy of the revised informed consent form.
15.3 Subject Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and uphold the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasion of privacy. Throughout this study, a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a subject identification number. As 
permitted by all applicable laws and regulations, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and subject initials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique 
identification number.
To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requires the investigator to permit the monitor or the sponsor’s designee, representatives from any 
regulatory authority (eg, FDA, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency), the sponsor’s designated auditors, and the 
appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or 
documents), including, but not limited to, laboratory test result reports, ECG reports, admission 
and discharge summaries for hospital admissions occurring during a subject’s study participation, 
and autopsy reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires the specific 
authorization of the subject as part of the informed consent process (see Section 15.2) .
Copies of any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have certain 
personally identifiable information removed (ie, s ubject name, address, and other identifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s eCRF).
15.4 Publication, Disclosure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy
15.4.1 Publication and Disclosure
The investigator is obliged to provide the sponsor with complete test results and all data derived by 
the investigator from the study. During and after the study, only the sponsor may make study
information available to other study investigators or to regulatory agencies, except as required by
law or regulation. Except as otherwise allowable in the study site agreement, any public disclosure 
(including publicly accessible websites) related to the protocol or study results, other than study
recruitment materials and/or advertis ements, is the sole responsibility of the sponsor.
15.4.2 Clinical Study Registration
In order to ensure that information on clinical studies reaches the public in a timely manner and to 
comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidance, Takeda will, at a minimum register all CCI

publicly  accessible websites before start of study , as defined in Takeda Policy/Standard . Takeda 
contact informat ion, along wit h invest igator’s cit y, state (for Americas investigators), country, and 
recrui ting status will be registered and available for public viewing.
For some registries, Taked a will assist callers in lo cating study  sites cl osest to thei r homes by 
provi ding the invest igator name, address, and phone number to the callers request ing study  
inform ation. Once subjects receive invest igator contact informat ion, they  may call  the si te 
requesting enrollment into the study. The invest igative sites are encouraged to handle the study 
inquiries according to their established subject screening process. If the caller asks addit ional 
questions bey ond the topic of study  enro llment, th ey shoul d be referred to the sponsor.
Any invest igator who objects to the sponsor providing this informat ion to callers must provide the 
sponsor with a written notice request ing that their informat ion not be listed on the registry  site.
15.4.3 Clinical Study Results Disclosu re
Takeda will post the results of clinical studie son ClinicalTrials.gov and/or other publicly  
accessible websites, as required by Takeda Policy/Standard, applicable laws and/or regulat ions.
15.5 Insurance and Compensation for Injury
Each subject in the study  must be insured in accordance with the regulations applicable to the site 
where the subject is participat ing. If a local underwriter is required, then the sponsor or sponsor’s 
designee will obtain clinical study  insurance against the risk o f injury to stud y subjects. Refer to 
the study site agreement regarding the sponsor’s policy on subject compensat ion and treatment for 
injury . If the invest igator has questions regarding this policy, he or she should contact the sponsor 
or sponsor’s designee.

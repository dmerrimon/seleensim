Confidential  Page 7 of 67 With 100 subjects completing the 52 weeks  treatment period, the study will 
have 95% or greater chance of observing adverse events that occur at a true incident rate of 
3.0% or higher. Therefore, with 100 subjects completing 52 weeks  of treatment, 
if an adverse event of a specific type is not observed, then with 95% confidence, the true 
incidence rate of the adverse event is less than 3.0%.  
Primary Safety Analyses: 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. An AE is treatment 
emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of trial treatment.  
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided. 
Furthermore, frequencies will be given of subjects with TEAEs by system organ class, by 
system organ class and preferred term, by system organ class, preferred term and maximal 
severity, by system organ class, preferred term and strongest relationship, and by system 
organ class, preferred term, maximal severity, and strongest relationship. Separate 
summaries will be performed for ocular and non-ocular AEs.  
Secondary Safety Analyses: 
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundoscopy, 
and intraocular pressure will be summarized by visit using descriptive statistics.  
Assessments performed by eye, study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately. 
Changes or shifts from baseline (as defined in clinical trial CYS-004) will also be 
summarized where appropriate.  
Exploratory Analyses:  
Quantitative prespecified efficacy variables will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, min, and max) and analyzed at each measured visit and with 
change from baseline (as defined in clinical trial CYS-004). Assessments performed by eye, 
study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately 
Dichotomous secondary efficacy variables will be summarized descriptively (frequency and 
percentage).

2.1 Dry Eye Disease (DED) 
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by the International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) as a 
multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film, 
and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular 
surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles ( Craig et 
al. 2017 ). Symptoms of DED such as feeling of dryness, burning, a sandy/gritty sensation, foreign 
body sensation, pain or itchiness are quite debilitating. In addition, visual function related 
symptoms such as fluctuating vision with blinking, blurred vision, and difficulty with reading 
despite perfect visual acuity is an important and underestimated aspect of the disease. In 
consequence, DED negatively impacts quality of life comparably to other severe diseases 
(Schiffman et al. 2003 ), and adverse effects on mental health, such as depression and anxiety, have 
been observed  (Le et al. 2012 ).  DED is a serious disorder that, if left untreated or undertreated, 
progressively damages the ocular surface and may lead to vision loss due to corneal complications 
(Lemp et al. 1995 ). 
As many as 5 - 35% of subjects visiting ophthalmic clinics report dry eye symptoms, making it 
one of the most common conditions seen by ophthalmic specialists ( McCarty et al. 1998; Lin et 
al. 2003 ). Estimates of the prevalence of dry eye vary considerably, depending on the criteria used 
to define the disease, but in the United States (US), it has been estimated that as many as 3.2 
million women and 1.7 million men over the age of 50 have DED, with a projected 40% increase 
in the number of patients affected by 2030 ( Schaumberg et al. 2002; Schaumberg et al. 2003; 
Schaumberg et al. 2009 ) With the aging population in the US and other countries of the developed 
world, and with increasing use of visual displays / computers, DED is expected to continue to 
become more prevalent and finding a treatment is becoming more important ( Benitez-del-Castillo 
et al. 2017 ).  
 
2.2 Product Rational 
Cyclosporine A (CsA), a potent and selective immunosuppressive drug, acts as a regulator of T-
cells via inhibition of calcineurin. Due to this mode of action it has been widely studied as topical 
treatment for T-cell mediated diseases of the ocular surface such as DED. In the US, CsA eye 
drops formulated as an emulsion have been approved and marketed as Restasis 0.05%  for this 
indication since 2002. In Europe - Ikervis TM , a 0.1% CsA emulsion formulation, received a 
marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of DED in early 
2015. A second CsA containing product, Cequa TM , a nano-emulsion was approved in the US in 
2018. 
CyclASol, in contrast, is a clear ophthalmic solution of CsA developed with the goal of avoiding 
the use of oils, surfactants and preservatives. Potential benefits from this CyclASol formulation 
include improved tolerability and efficacy, early onset of efficacy and decreased visual 
disturbances associated with oily eye drops, emulsions or ointments. Moreover, the multiple dose 
containers allow for a convenient handling. 
CyclASol ® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS-005  Version 3.0 10 th December 2020 
 
Confidential  Page 14 of 67 For the solubilization of CsA in CyclASol the semifluorinated alkane (SFA)  
 F4H5  
 is used as the vehicle.  
 F4H5 is colourless, has a high 
vapor pressure, and is immiscible with water while having nearly the same refractory index. 
F4H5’s physical properties make it an optimal vehicle for topical ocular use. As a result of it s high 
vapor pressure ( Krafft et al. 2009 ), F4H5 dissipates quickly from the ocular surface and 
consequently does not interact physically with the tear film, as shown in rabbits, where F4H5 had 
no effect on tear film break-up time (TFBUT) (Agarwal et al. 2019) . Due to the low surface tension 
of F4H5, CyclASol eye drops are of small size,  
potentially reducing pre-corneal clearance. Importantly, the low surface tension of the CyclASol 
formulation facilitates dissemination of the applied eye drop on the conjunctiva. The dissemination 
and spreading properties are further thought to improve the local bioavailability. 
 
2.3 Trial Rational 
After successful preclinical testing and early clinical testing, a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial (CYS-003, 
ESSENCE) confirmed the effects and good tolerability seen in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinica l 
trials.  
CyclASol 0.1% met the primary endpoint showing superiority compared to vehicle in change from 
baseline in total corneal fluorescein staining (tCFS) at Day 29 with high statistical significance 
(p=0.0002). Additionally, the CyclASol 0.1% group consistently showed statistically significant 
improvements over time in total and central corneal and conjunctival staining compared to vehicle. 
The therapeutic effects observed had an early onset after 14 days of treatment that continued over 
the 84-day treatment period. CyclASol 0.1% also showed trends of more improvement in the 
second primary endpoint of change from baseline in total Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI ©) 
at Day 29. Additionally, statistically significant and greater improvements in dryness-related 
symptoms as measured by VAS (Dryness Score) at Day 29 were demonstrated in the CyclASol 
0.1% treatment group compared to the vehicle group. 
CyclASol 0.1% was safe and comfortable, and showed an excellent tolerability in all clinical tria ls 
conducted to date with instillation site reactions as low as 2.5% and a very low drop-out rate due 
to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) of 3 subjects in each CYS-002 in CYS-003. 
This phase 3 open label safety extension trial is designed to investigate the long-term safety and 
tolerability of CyclASol 0.1% BID dosing of subjects completing the 4-weeks treatment trial CYS-

The investigational medicinal product (IMP) CyclASol 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution contains CsA 
as active ingredient and its vehicle, which consists of F4H5. CsA is a potent and selective 
immunosuppressive drug, used routinely for decades as an oral immunomodulator in various 
indications. CsA containing eye drops have been proven safe over the last 15 years. The excipient 
F4H5 used in CyclASol is chemically inert, without pharmacologic activity and not undergoing

so far. Therefore, it has been subjected to the same pivotal non-clinical studies as a new acti ve 
substance with favorable results. 
282 subjects have been exposed to CyclASol 0.05% or 0.1% up to 4 months duration in clinical 
trials to date (clinical trials CYS-001: Phase 1; CYS-002: Phase 2; CYS-003: Phase 2b/3) with a

In summary, based on the preclinical and clinical data obtained to date, risks to subjects in the 
planned CYS-005 trial are considered very low. Furthermore, the subjects in the trial will be

Confidential  Page 16 of 67 closely monitored, and current standard ophthalmic safety assessments will be performed during 
the entire treatment period. The results to date demonstrate the efficacy of CyclASol on signs and 
symptoms of DED. Treatment with CyclASol therefore provides a favorable benefit-risk profile 
in subjects with DED, addressing a clinical need that is currently not optimally addressed with 
available treatment options for DED.  
The  subjects qualifying for participation in CYS-005 will have completed the pivotal 
clinical trial CYS-004 with four weeks treatment according to protocol and tolerated exposure to 
IMP (randomized 1:1 to CyclASol or vehicle) well enough to continue treatment for one year. 
They are experienced in handling the IMP bottle and familiar with all safety and efficac y 
assessments they will undergo in CYS-005. 
This clinical trial CYS-005 is designed to confirm the positive benefit-risk profile for long-term 
treatment with CyclASol.

3.1  Primary objective 
• The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate safety and tolerability of CyclASol during 
long-term use in subjects with Dry Eye Disease. 
3.2 Secondary objectives 
• The secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy of CyclASol during long-term use in subjects 
with Dry Eye Disease. 
 
 
4 TRIAL DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Trial Design 
This is a Phase 3 multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolera bility 
and efficacy of CyclASol 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution in subjects with signs and symptoms of DED. 
 subjects who completed the clinical trial CYS-004 and meeting all other trial 
eligibility criteria will be included at approximately 13 sites in the US to receive treatment with 
CyclASol.  
Eligible subjects will dose the IMP (CyclASol) bilaterally BID for approximately 12 months (52 
weeks).  
 
4.2 End of Trial Definition 
The “end of the trial ” for an individual subject is defined as that subject’s last visit  as specified in 
the Schedule of Assessments. 
 
The “end of the trial ” for the overall trial is defined as completion of the last visit or procedure as 
specified in Schedule of Assessments for all subjects in the trial. 
 
4.3 Visit Description 
Subjects will be required to sign an Informed Consent before completing any trial related 
procedure. All examination procedures are listed in Section 8.4 and in the Schedule of 
Assessments . For consistency and to avoid interference, they should be performed in the respective 
order as listed. Trial Drug Dispensation is described in Section 7.1.4. 
CyclASol ®0.1% Ophthalmic Solution Novaliq GmbH 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS-005 Version 3.0 10 thDecember 2020 
Confidential Page 18 of 67 Visit 1 
The results of assessments at Visit 3 (Day 29) in study CYS-004 (final visit ) will be taken as Day 1 
data for CYS-005. Further data/assessments to be captured will be the  CYS-005 Informed Consent, 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria to determine CYS-005 eligibility, and IMP dispensation. 
Each subject will be given a dosing diary to record that their doses 
were taken. Study staff will help the subject to understand how to use the dosing diary and when 
the remaining doses should be taken. Subjects will be instructed to take their first dose at home. If 
needed, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or request of the subject, self-dosing can occur at 
this visit under staff supervision for instruction purposes. 
Visits 2-6
Subjects will return to the clinic on week 4 ± 2 days (Visit 2), week 12 ± 7 days (Visit 3), week 26
± 7 days (Visit 4), week 40 ± 7 days (Visit 5) and week 52 ± 7 days (Visit 6) to investigate ocular 
and non-ocular safety and tolerability of IMP and assess signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. 
At those visits all used and unused trial medication should be returned to the clinic. 
The dosing diary will be collected 
during each visit and checked for compliance. Subjects will be discharged from the trial after a ll 
Visit 6 assessments have been completed. 
Interim Telephone Calls 
In order to keep a monthly contact with the subjects, interim telephone calls on a monthly basis 
will be performed asking about the subject ’s well-being with non-leading AE questioning, BID 
dosing, issues with IMP and any changes in medical history or concomitant treatments. 
Early Termination (ET)
Subjects who terminate early during the treatment period will be asked to complete all assessments 
as indicated at Visit 6 on the schedule of assessments prior to commencement of any alternative 
dry eye therapy (if considered possible). Dosing diary and trial medication will be collected. 
Subjects who are terminated early from the trial will not be replaced.

Confidential  Page 19 of 67 4.5 Enrollment and Treatment Assignment 
Subjects will keep the assigned unique subject number as allocated in clinical trial CYS-004. If all  
inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met at Visit 1,  qualifying subjects 
will be included in CYS-005.  
 
Each subject will spend approximately 52 weeks in the trial. The total duration of the trial from 
“first subject in ” to “last subject out ” is expected to be approximately 16 months. 
 
4.6 Justification of Trial Design 
This trial is designed as an open-label, single-arm extension trial to clinical trial CYS-004 to 
investigate long-term safety and tolerability of 52 weeks treatment with CyclASol 0.1% BID in at 
least 100 subjects.  
 
An open-label design is deemed adequate as there are no eye-drops available acting purely a s 
placebo in DED, thus influencing the background incidence of AEs in this indication. In addition, 
the vehicle F4H5 previously used as control in clinical trials with CyclASol 0.1% is as well part 
of the CyclASol formulation. 
 
4.7 Justification for Dose 
The CyclASol 0.1% BID dosing regimen was selected for the first pivotal trial CYS-003 based on 
results of CYS-002. The trial CYS-004 is designed to replicate the efficacy and safety results of 
CYS-003 with the same dosing regimen, consequently the open label extension trial CYS-005 will 
use the same dose and schedule of application.

9.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered IMP-related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medical (investigational) product, whether or not related 
to the medical (investigational) product. 
Resolved AEs and AE that are ongoing after Visit 3 (Day 29) in the CYS-004 trial, and prior to 
IMP administration at Visit 1 of CYS-005, will not be considered Adverse Events in CYS-005. 
These events will be considered medical history and will be transferred to CYS-005 database 
accordingly. If there is a worsening or reoccurring of such medical history after administration of 
the IMP, this should be considered a new AE and reported.  
Worsening of DED will be considered an AE only if the dry eye status of the subject exceeds their 
previous experiences with the condition. This will be determined by the subject and the 
investigator.  
A clinically relevant worsening of visual acuity from Visit 0 of CYS-004,  
 will be considered an AE. 
IMP includes the investigational drug under evaluation and any other medications required by the 
protocol given during any stage of the trial. 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, severity, 
relationship to IMP, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by the physician or reported by the subject upon non-leading questioning.  
AEs (both elicited and observed) will be monitored from the time of Informed Consent and 
throughout the trial. All AEs will be promptly reviewed by the investigator for accuracy and 
completeness. All AEs will be documented on the appropriate source document and eCRF. 
 
9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by the investigator or reported to him/her by the subject.  The assessment of severity 
is made irrespective of relationship to investigational product or seriousness of the event and 
should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate :  Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe :  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
CyclASol ® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS-005  Version 3.0 10 th December 2020 
 
Confidential  Page 35 of 67 Severity is not the same as “seriousness”, which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to life or functioning (see Section 9.2). Seriousness (not 
severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
9.1.2 Relationship to Investigational Product 
The relationship of each AE to the IMP should be determined by the investigator using these 
explanations: 
• Suspected :  A reasonable possibility exists that the investigational product caused the 
AE. 
• Not Suspected : A reasonable possibility does not exist that the investigational product 
caused the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused the AE .  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest 
a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE include: a single occurrence of an event that is 
uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IMP exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic 
injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
associated with IMP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IMP 
(e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as 
known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events 
that commonly occur in the trial population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those 
events occur more frequently in the IMP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control 
group. 
 
9.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the IMP. CyclASol contains the active ingredient CsA and the vehicle F4H5 and has been tested 
in three clinical studies up to now, AEs of those have been listed in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
Therefore, the following definition will be used: 
• Unexpected : An AE that is not listed in the investigator’s brochure (IB) in the Adverse 
Reaction Section at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
• Expected : An AE that is listed in the invest igator’s brochure (IB) in the Adverse 
Reaction Section at the specificity and severity that has been observed. 
• Not Applicable : Any AE that is unrelated to the IMP. 
The Investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification is 
subject to the sponsor’s  determination. 
 
9.1.4 Outcome 
The outcome of any AE will be determined and recorded using the following categories: 
• Recovered/Resolved 
• Recovering/Resolving 
CyclASol ® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH

Confidential  Page 36 of 67 • Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae 
• Lost to Follow-up 
• Fatal 
• Unknown 
 
9.1.5 Period of Observation 
For the purpose of this study, the period of observation for collection of adverse events extends 
from the time the patient gives informed consent until the end of the Visit 6 at (Week 52 ± 1) or 
Early Termination. 
If the investigator detects a Serious Adverse Event (Section 9.2) in a study patient after the end of 
the period of observation this should be reported to the Sponsor only if the investigator considers 
the event related to prior study treatment or procedures. The investigator should contact the 
sponsor to determine how the adverse event should be documented and reported. 
 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening AE; 
o Note: An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject or subject at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
o Note: The term “ inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission 
(even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient 
admission includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care 
inpatient unit. Inpatient hospitalization does not include: emergency room 
visits; outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay 
units; rehabilitation facilities; hospice facilities; nursing homes; or clinical 
research/phase 1 units. 
o Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospitalization” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required 
for the reason for the initial admission as determined by the investigator or 
treating physician. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
o Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic 
nerve).

Confidential  Page 37 of 67 • A congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Medically important. 
o Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. 
 
9.3 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to , Novaliq,  
 and the IRB as required by the IRB, federal, state, or local regulations and governing 
health authorities and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
 
9.3.1 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs, regardless of their relationship to the IMP, must be immediately 
reported (i.e. within a maximum 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event). All information 
relevant to the SAE must be recorded on the appropriate SAE report forms. The investigator is 
obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by  and/or Novaliq in addition to 
that information reported on the case report form. All subjects experiencing a SAE must be 
followed up and the outcome reported. 
In the event of a SAE, the investigator must notify and the sponsor immediately; obtain and 
maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from 
colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the subject; provide  and the 
trial sponsor with a complete case history, which includes a statement as to whether the event was 
or was not suspected to be related to the use of the IMP; and inform the IRB of the AE within their 
guidelines for reporting SAEs.

All SAE that are ‘suspected  reactions ’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to the IRB as required 
by the IRB, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities. 
9.4 Procedures for Unmasking of IMP  
All subjects, investigators, and trial personnel involved with the conduct of the trial will be 
unmasked as this is a single-arm and open label extension trial.  
 
9.5 Type and Duration of the Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events 
The investigator will follow unresolved AEs to resolution until the subject is lost to follow-up or 
until the AE is otherwise classified. Resolution means the subject has returned to baseline state of 
health or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. If the 
subject is lost to follow-up, the investigator should make 3 reasonable attempts to contact the 
subject via telephone, post, or certified mail. All follow- up will be documented in the subject’s 
source document. Non-serious AEs identified on the last scheduled contact must be recorded on 
the AE eCRF page with the status noted.  
If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE (i.e., 
resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE Report Form must be completed 
and e-mailed/faxed  within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the new information. The 
original SAE form is not to be altered. The report should describe whether the event has resolved 
or continues and how the event was treated. 
 
9.6 Procedures for Reporting Pregnancies 
Pregnancy in itself is not considered an AE or SAE (unless there is a suspicion that an IMP may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication), but it is an important medica l 
event that must be followed up. Any pregnancy that occurs during the clinical trial where the fetus 
could have been exposed to IMP must be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy. 
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain the outcome and condition of the infant 
information within 30 calendar days after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar 
days postpartum. 
If a subject or Investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to IMP administration, 
the IMP must be withheld until the results of pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is 
confirmed, the subject must not receive IMP and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy 
is suspected while the subject is receiving IMP treatment, the IMP must immediately be withheld 
until the result of pregnancy testing is known.

pregnancy. 
A Pregnancy Reporting Form will be completed by the trial site’s principal investigator and sent 
to  via the SAE Fax number or e-mail (see Section 9.3).  will forward the documentation 
to the medical monitor,  project manager and the sponsor for review.   
At the completion of the pregnancy, the Pregnancy Outcome Form is to be submitted to  via 
the SAE contact details.  will manage the query and reconciliation process until the pregnancy 
documentation is complete.

10.1 Analysis Populations 
The following analysis population will be considered: 
• Safety Set (SAF) – The SAF includes all enrolled subjects who received at least one 
dose of the IMP. The SAF will be analyzed for all assessments.   
The statistical analysis of baseline, primary and secondary endpoint data will be performed for the 
SAF.  
10.2 Statistical Hypotheses 
There are no formal hypotheses to be tested in this open-label safety extension trial. 
10.3 Sample Size 
 subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure that at least 100 evaluable participants 
complete  
the 52 weeks (12-month) treatment period.  
With 100 subjects completing the 52 weeks  treatment period, the study will have 
95% or greater chance of observing adverse events that occur at a true incident rate of 3.0 % or 
higher.  Therefore, with 100 subjects completing 52 weeks  of treatment, if an adverse 
event of a specific type is not observed, then with 95% confidence, the true incidence rate of the 
adverse event is less than 3.0%.  
10.4 Statistical Analysis 
10.4.1  General Considerations 
Quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum. The dichotomous variables will be summarized using counts 
and percentages.  
Summaries will be provided for demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapies, and 
subject disposition. 
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent therapies, and AEs will be coded 
to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate. 
Baseline measures are defined as the measure prior to the administration of IMP as defined in 
clinical trial CYS-004. CFB will be calculated as Visit CYS-005 – Baseline CYS-004.  
Summaries will be presented separately for subjects treated with CyclASol in CYS-004 and 
subjects treated with vehicle in CYS-004 as well as overall.

Confidential  Page 41 of 67 10.4.2  Unit of Analysis 
For efficacy endpoints, the unit of analysis will be the “ study eye” which was determined during 
CYS-004. This information is transferred to the CYS-005 trial.  
 
10.4.3  Missing Data 
The primary analysis will be completed with available data per subject from the Safety Set (SAF).  
 
 
10.4.4  Primary Safety Analyses 
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population.  
Dosing information will be summarized overall subjects and listed for each subject will be listed. 
Discontinuation of treatment will be summarized by treatment received. The primary reason for 
trial drug discontinuation will also be summarized by treatment received. 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. An AE is treatment emergent 
if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of trial treatment in clinical trial CYS-005. 
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious 
TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided. Furthermore, frequencies 
will be given of subjects with TEAEs by system organ class, by system organ class and preferred 
term, by system organ class, preferred term and maximal severity, by system organ class, preferred 
term and strongest relationship, and by system organ class, preferred term, maximal severity, and 
strongest relationship. Separate summaries will be performed for ocular and non-ocular AEs. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the most recent version of WHO-Drug Dictionary 
and summarized by treatment group. 
 
10.4.5  Secondary Safety Analyses 
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure (IOP) 
and dilated fundoscopy will be summarized by visit using descriptive statistics. Changes or shifts 
from baseline (as defined in clinical trial CYS-004) will also be summarized where appropriate. 
Assessments performed by eye will be summarized separately for study eye and fellow eye.  
 
 
10.4.6  Exploratory Analyses 
 
The analysis of the prespecified efficacy endpoints and other endpoints will use the SAF  with 
available data per subject.

11  COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, ETHICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES 
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical Practices 
(GCPs), including the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines, and in 
general, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, all applicable local, state, and 
federal requirements relevant to the use of investigational products in the countries involved will 
be adhered to. 
 
11.1 Protection of Human Subjects 
11.1.1  Subject Informed Consent 
Informed consent/assent must take place before any trial specific procedures are initiated. Signed  
and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject prior to performing any 
trial specific procedures and assessments. 
All informed consent/assent forms must be approved for use by the sponsor and receive 
approval/favorable opinion from an IRB prior to their use. If the consent form requires revision 
(e.g., due to a protocol amendment or significant new safety information) , it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that the amended informed consent is reviewed and approved by the

trial as well as those currently enrolled in the trial. 
. 
11.1.2  Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval 
This trial is to be conducted in accordance with Institutional Review Board regulations (U.S. 21 
CFR Part 56.103). 
Only an IRB/IEC approved version of the informed consent form will be used. 
11.2 Ethical Conduct of the Trial 
This trial will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that originated with the 
Declaration of Helsinki. 
 
11.3 Subject Confidentiality 
All personal trial subject data collected and processed for the purposes of this trial should be 
maintained by the investigator and his/her staff with adequate precautions as to ensure that the 
confidentiality of the data in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 
Monitors, auditors and other authorized representatives of  drug safety, the sponsor, the 
IRB/IEC approving this trial, the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services, other 
domestic government agencies, and other foreign regulatory agencies will be granted direct access 
to the trial subject’s original medical and trial records for verification of the data and/or clinical 
trial procedures. Access to this information will be permitted to the aforementioned individuals to 
the extent permitted by law. 
A report of the results of this trial may be published or sent to the appropriate health authorities in 
any country in which the investigational product may ultimately be marketed, but the subject’s 
identity will not be disclosed in these documents. 
 
11.4 Documentation 
Source documents may include a subject’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, the 
investigator’s trial subject files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as X-rays, laboratory 
tests, and ECGs . The investigator’s copy of the eCRFs serves as the investigator’s record of a 
subject’s trial-related data. 
 
 
11.4.1  Retention of Documentation 
All trial related correspondence, subject records, consent forms, record of the distribution and use 
of all investigational products and copies of case report forms should be maintained on file for at 
least two years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there 
are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or until at least two years

Confidential  Page 44 of 67 have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational 
product. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor 
to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
The investigator must notify the sponsor prior to destroying trial documentation even after the 
above-mentioned time has passed. 
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping trial records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the  
responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new 
custodian. 
 
11.5 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Electronic Case Reports Form s 
(eCRFs) 
All subject data will be captured in the subject source documents which will be transcribed to the 
eCRFs. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that trial data is completely and accurately 
recorded on each subject’s eCRF, source document, and all trial-related materials. All trial data 
should also be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, and original. Recorded data should only be 
corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or render illegible the previous entry (e.g., 
by drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected 
data). An individual who has corrected a data entry should make clear who made the correction 
and when, by adding to the correction his/her initials as well as the date of the correction. 
Data entry of all enrolled subjects will use software that conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements 
and will be performed only by staff that have been trained on the system and have access to the 
system. An audit trail will be maintained within the electronic system to capture all changes made 
within the eCRF database. After the end of the trial and database lock, compact discs (CDs) 
containing copies of all applicable subjects’ eCRFs will be provided to e ach investigator site to be 
maintained on file by the investigator. 
  
11.6 Monitoring and Quality Assurance 
During the course of the trial a clinical research associate (CRA) will make routine site visits to 
review protocol compliance, assess IMP accountability, and ensure the trial is being conducted 
according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records 
will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality. Further details of 
the trial monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan. 
Domestic and foreign regulatory authorities,  and quality assurance, sponsor and or its 
designees may carry out on-site inspections and/or audits which may include source data checks. 
Therefore, direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits. 
All inspections and audits will be carried out with consideration to data protection as well as 
subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.

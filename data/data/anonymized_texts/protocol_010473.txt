  1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Study Design  
The current study is an open- label, Phase II study of patients with advanced carcinoid or 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors  with progressive disease . A total of 70 patients w ill be 
enrolled with advanced neuroendocrine tumors:  35 patients with advanced carcinoid tumors and 35 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors . The estimated time for accrual of the patients 
is 18- 24 months . This study will include a Pre -Treatment Period (screening and baseline 
evaluations), a Treatment Period (consisting of 4 -week cycles of cabozantinib administered daily 
orally at a dose of 60 mg, and a Post -Treatment Period (consisting of a post -treatment visit 
30 days  [+7] after the last dose of  study treatment, with follow -up information obtained every 
12 weeks  post last dose thereafter until final survival status is determined) . Tumor assessments 
will be performed after the second, fourth, and sixth cycles, then every third cycle (± 5 days ) 
following randomization until documented disease progression per RECIST by the investigator  
or end of treatment at the physician’s discretion .

1.33 Define molecular and imaging correlates of response, pending funding availability including dynamic / perfusion CT, and circulating biomarkers.  
 2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Investigational Agent  
Cabozantinib (XL184) is a new chemical entity that exhibits potent inhibitory activity against several receptor tyrosine kinases known to influence tumor growth, metastasis , and angiogenesis. 
The primary targets of cabozantinib are MET and VEGFR2/KDR, with IC50 (concentration associated with 50% inhibition) values of 1.8 and 0.035 nM, respectively. The in vitro target inhibition profile of cabozantinib is shown in Table  1-1.

Data from pharmacodynamic experiments have shown that cabozantinib inhibits ME T and 
VEGFR2 in  vivo. Oral administration of cabozantinib resulted in blockade of MET 
phosphorylation in human lung tumor xenografts in nude mice and blockade of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in mouse lung tissue. The duration of action for cabozantinib was susta ined, 
with >  50% inhibition observed 10- 24 hours post -dose at a dose level of 100  mg/kg for all targets 
studied.  Treatment with cabozantinib results in anti- angiogenic effects in xenograft tumors, with 
disruption of the vasculature beginning within 24 hours after administration. These effects translate into significant tumor growth inhibition or tumor regression after cabozantinib treatment in multiple tumor models including MTC (thyroid), breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and GB (brain) (Table 1- 2).

 Page 6 of 77 Activity of Cabozantinib in the Transgenic RIP -Tag2 Model System  
Inhibition of the VEGF signaling pathway was previously shown to result in more invasive 
tumors in the transgenic RIP -Tag2 m ouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer that 
spontaneously develops aggressive tumors (Pàez -Ribes  et al. 2009). Treatment with cabozantinib 
for 3  weeks, from age 14 to 17 weeks, significantly blocked liver metastasis in the RIP -Tag2 
model compared w ith anti -VEGF treatment or vehicle alone. The number of liver metastases was 
5-fold greater in anti -VEGF antibody -treated animals compared with vehicle- treated animals, 
and no liver metastases were detected in cabozantinib -treated animals. In addition, tre atment 
with cabozantinib from age 14 to 20 weeks improved survival. Median survival was 14.7 weeks for vehicle -treated animals (n  = 12) and 16.4 weeks for anti -VEGF antibody -treated animals 
(n = 7; P  < 0.05 vs. vehicle), and all cabozantinib- treated animal s survived for the full 20 weeks 
of observation (n = 6; P  < 0.05 vs. vehicle and anti -VEGF antibody) . 
 Activity of Cabozantinib in a Pr eclinical Bone Metastasis Model  
The human prostate cancer model ARCaP -M, which expresses both MET and the VEGF 
co-recepto r NP-1 (Zhang  et al  2010), was used in a prostate tumor xenograft study in bone. 
ARCaP -M cells were injected into the tibiae of nude mice on Day  1, and on Day  31 animals with 
established bone lesions were randomized to receive cabozantinib or vehicle qd for 7 weeks of treatment. As shown in the representative x -ray images (Figure  1-1), tibiae from vehicle -treated 
animals exhibited both osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions, whereas tibiae from cabozantinib-treated animals appeared mostly normal. Thus, cabozan tinib treatment blocked both osteoblastic 
and osteolytic progression of ARCaP -M xenograft tumors in bone.

 Page 7 of 77 Cabozantinib Nonclinical Toxicology  
Cabozantinib nonclinical tox icology has been characterized in single - and repeat -dose studies in 
multiple species. In nonclinical toxicology studies of cabozantinib in rodents and non- rodents, 
histopathological changes associated with cabozantinib administration were observed in 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal, and reproductive 
tract tissues, and secondary changes were observed in bone and pancreas. Cabozantinib tested 
negative in bacterial and mammalian cell genotoxicity assays in vitro. In  reproductive toxicity 
studies, cabozantinib was embryotoxic in rats, produced fetal soft tissue changes in rabbits, and 
decreased fertility in male and female rats. Details can be found in the Investigator Brochure.  
 2.1.1 Clinical Experience and Activity  
Cabozantinib has demonstrated broad clinical activity in multiple tumor types, including thyroid, breast, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancers, melanoma, glioblastoma (GB), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Observations of cli nical activity have 
included shrinkage of soft tissue tumor lesions including visceral metastases, effects on metastatic lesions on bone scan (partial or complete bone scan resolution), reduction in serum markers of bone resorption and formation, increases  in hemoglobin, and improvements in bone 
pain and reductions in narcotic use in subjects with bone metastases. In the Phase  1 
Study  XL184- 001, with an enriched medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) population, confirmed 
partial response (cPR) (with duration up to 48+ months) was reported in 29% of MTC subjects, and stable disease (SD) of at least 6 months was reported in 41% of MTC subjects. In the Phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial, Study  XL184- 203, disease control rates (DCR; defined 
as SD or confirmed res ponse) at Week  12 ranged from 40- 73% in the six cohorts for which 
cabozantinib had the greatest activity: non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 40%; breast cancer, 
45%; melanoma, 47%; ovarian cancer, 55%; castration- resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), 68%; 
and HCC, 73%. Please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for updated 
information regarding the clinical experience of cabozantinib.  
 2.1.2 Clinical Safety Profile  
As of 04 May 2011, 1333 subjects have been enrolled in clinical studies with cabozantinib, for which serious adverse event (SAE) data are available (1003 subjects in open- label clinical 
studies with cabozantinib and 330 subjects in the blinded Study XL184- 301, randomized 2:1 for 
cabozantinib versus placebo). As of 01 March 2011, adverse event (AE) data are available for 913 subjects who have been dosed with cabozantinib in open- label clinical studies (806 subjects 
in single -agent cabozantinib studies and 107 subjects in combination studies of cabozantinib with 
erlotinib, rosigl itazone, or temozolomide [TMZ] ± radiation). These subjects have been treated 
with cabozantinib at salt weight doses ranging from 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg on an intermittent dosing schedule and from 25 mg (19.7 mg freebase equivalent weight) to 265 mg (209 mg freebase equivalent weight) on a fixed daily dosing schedule.

 Page 8 of 77 2.1.2.1 Adverse Events  
The most commonly re ported SAEs that were assessed as related to study treatment with 
cabozantinib (as a single- agent or part of a combination treatment) were pulmonary embolism 
(PE), diarrhea, dehydration, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), vomiting, nausea, thrombocytopenia, 
fatigue, wound dehiscence, and PPE syndrome. Ten percent of subjects were reported to have 
discontinued study treatment due to an AE, most frequently fatigue. There have been 15 deaths 
assessed as related to study treatment: GI hemorrhage (two subjects), PE (tw o subjects), 
respiratory failure (two subjects), respiratory disorder (one subject), hemoptysis (one subject), 
death due to unknown cause (two subjects), intracranial hemorrhage (one subject), intestinal perforation (one subject), enterocutaneous fistula ( one subject), hemorrhage (presumed to be 
hemoptysis; one subject), and diverticular perforation, peritonitis (one subject). Details for these and 13 additional deaths assessed as not related to study treatment are provided in this Investigator’s Brochure.   2.1.2.2 Serious Adverse Events  
As of 04 May 2011, of the 1003 subjects enrolled in open- label clinical trials with cabozantinib 
(either as a single- agent or in combination with other therapies), 473 subjects (47%) experienced 
one or more SAEs, and 199 subjects experienced one or more SAE that was assessed as related to treatment with cabozantinib. The majority of SAEs were attributed to the underlying cancer. The most commonly reported SAEs that were assessed as related to study treatment with cabozantini b (as a single- agent or part of a combination treatment) were PE, diarrhea, 
dehydration, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), vomiting, nausea, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, wound dehiscence, and PPE syndrome.  In the blinded study of cabozantinib versus placebo (Study XL184- 301) in subjects with MTC SAEs of one Grade  4 reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), one Grade  5 cardiac arrest following asystolic vagal 
reaction after aspiration on study medication, and three of acquired tracheo -esophageal fis tula 
(two Grade  3, one Grade 5) were reported.  
 Deaths  
As of 04 May  2011, across all open- label studies (single -agent cabozantinib and cabozantinib in 
combination with other therapies), there have been 15 deaths assessed as related to study treatment: GI h emorrhage (two subjects), PE (two subjects), respiratory failure (two subjects), 
respiratory disorder (one subject), hemoptysis (one subject), death due to unknown cause (two subjects), intracranial hemorrhage (one subject), intestinal perforation (one subject), enterocutaneous fistula (one subject), hemorrhage (presumed to be hemoptysis; one subject), and diverticular perforation, peritonitis (one subject).  
 2.1.3 Clinical Pharmacokinetic s 
Pharmacokinetic analysis showed dose proportional increases in maximum pl asma concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration  time curve (AUC) both for the powder -in-bottle 
(PIB) formulation (dose range: 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg) and the capsule formulation (dose range: 125 to 175 mg). Terminal- phase half -life (t1/2,  z) values were 59.1 to 136 hours. More detailed 
information regarding cabozantinib PK from all studies and product metabolism in humans may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure .

2.1.3.1 Phase 1: Study  XL184- 001  
In Study  XL184- 001, a preliminary PK analysis has been performed for 74  subjects. The cutoff 
date for the data used for this PK analysis was 02 September 2008. In an analysis of PK data on 
subjects ( Cohorts  1-9) receiving cabozantinib as an oral  suspension at 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg on the 
Intermittent 5&9 schedule, values for C max and AUC from 0 hours to the last sampling time point 
(AUC 0-last) increased generally dose- proportionally. The t 1/2, z values were long (range: 59.1 to 
136 hour s). 
 
Data fr om Cohorts 10- -13 (175 mg PIB qd; 265 mg PIB qd; 175 mg capsule formulation qd; 
250 mg capsule formulation qd) and the eMTD Cohort ( 175 mg capsule formulation qd) show 
that drug accumulation (based on C max and AUC 0-24 values) at steady -state after qd dosin g is 
approximately 4 - to 6- fold. In addition, exposure values from PIB (Cohort  10) or the capsule 
formulation (Cohorts  12 and eMTD Cohort) are compared in Table 5 2. The data are limited by a 
small sample size but show that cabozantinib exposure (AUC) values from capsule- formulation 
cohorts are about 2- fold greater than those observed in the respective PIB  Cohort.

 2.1.3.2 Phase 1: Study XL184- 002 
As of 15 March 2010, PK data were available from three subjects enrolled in the first cohort of Arm 1a (cabozantinib 75 mg  qd + TMZ  75 mg/m
2 qd + radiothera py). Intensive PK sampling 
was conducted during the concurrent treatment phase on Days  1 and 29. The observed Day 1 
mean exposure values for TMZ were close to published reference values at 75 mg/m2 (ie, Day  1 
AUC: 10. 3 ± 0.913 μg•hour/mL vs 12.1 ±  1.1 μg•hour/mL, from Ostermann et al. 2004). 
Similarly, mean steady -state exposure values (AUC) for cabozantinib (18.0  ± 0.818 μg•hour/mL) 
were comparable to those extrapolated from Study  XL184 -201 (17.5 μg•hour/mL, predicted 
from observed values at 125 mg), a  Phase 2 trial in which subjects with GB are receiving 
cabozantinib monotherapy. Sparse PK samples were also available from three subjects in Arm  2a 
(cabozantinib 75 mg qd + TMZ 200 mg/m2/day on Days  1-5 of every 28 -day cycle ). Results 
show that the mean steady -state concentration values for cabozantinib at 4 hours post - 
cabozantinib dose (801 ±  182 ng/mL) were very close to those extrapolated from 
Study  XL184- 201 ( 810 ng/mL, estimated from observed values at 125 mg). Overall, the 
preliminary data show no apparent metabolic (exposure) drug- drug interaction between 
cabozantinib and TMZ.

Pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib were evaluated for three subjects after a single dose on Day  1 
and for two subjects at steady -state on Day   19. Exposure values for C max and AUC 0-24 were 4 - to 
5-fold higher than that observed for Day  1, which was consistent with the observation in 
Study  XL184- 001 of the magnitude of cabozantinib accumulation after repeated qd dosi ng. 
 
2.1.3.4 Phase 1: Study  XL184- 008 
The XL184- 008 study is designed as a two -treatment two -period single -sequence crossover 
study to test cabozantinib for inhibition of the CYP2C8 pathway. Rosiglitazone, a known CYP2C8 substrate, is administered on Day  1, and PK samples are obtained over 24 hours. 
Starting on Day  2, cabozantinib is administered qd at a dose level of ≥  125 mg/day (salt weight) 
for 21   days to achieve steady -state levels of cabozantinib. Rosiglitazone is then administered 
again on Day  22, 1 hour after the twenty -first dose of cabozantinib, and PK sampling is repeated 
over a 24- hour period. As of 17 May  2011, preliminary PK data were available from 20 subjects, 
16 of whom were evaluable on both Day  1 and Day  22. Based on the data for these 16 subjects, 
the geometric mean Day  22:Day  1 ratio of rosiglitazone AUC
0-24 was 1.00 (90% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.921.09), and the corresponding ratio for C max was 0.92 (90%CI:  0.78- 1.09). 
Furthermore, both C max and AUC 0-24 were similar on Day 1 and Day  22 for 
desmethyl -rosiglitazone, a metabolite of rosiglitazone generated via a CYP2C8 metabolic 
pathway. Based on these preliminary data, there was no evidence for marked inhibition of rosiglitazone metabolism, suggesting that cabozantinib does not inhibit  the CYP2C8 pathway at 
clinically relevant concentrations.

 Page 11 of 77 As of 17 February 2010, PK data available for 5 cohorts (n = 1–16 subjects/cohort) showed that 
exposures to cabozantini b at doses of 50- 125 mg or erlotinib at doses of 50- 150 mg were not 
apparently affected by co -administration of both drugs. Exposure (AUC) values of cabozantinib 
at doses of 50- 150 mg were close to the levels estimated from PK data of Study  XL184- 001 in 
which cabozantinib was administered as a single agent (dose range: 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg). In 
addition, AUC values for erlotinib at doses of 50- 150 mg before or after co -administration of 
cabozantinib are not markedly different (Table 2.1.3.5).

 In addition, intensive PK samples were taken from 15 subjects receiving a capsule dose of 125 mg  qd. Consistent with an approximately 30% lower dose, steady state mean values of C
max 
and AUC 0-24 for 11 of these subjects were appr oximately 40% lower compared to subjects treated 
at 175 mg  qd in Study  XL184- 001 (C max: 1390 ng/mL [125 mg] vs 2310 ng/mL [175 mg]; 
AUC:  26,500 ng•h/mL [125 mg] vs 41600 ng•h/mL [175 mg]). Consistent with the observations 
for sparse sampling at pre -dose an d post -dose, an approximately dose -proportional increase in 
Cmax and AUC at steady -state was observed between 125 and 175 mg; a 1.6 -fold increase in 
exposure was observed as the dose increased by 1.4- fold. 
 2.1.3.6 Phase 2: Study XL184- 203 
As of 12 June 2011, sparse plasma drug concentration data from the Lead- In Stage of the RDT 
study, XL184- 203, were available across all nine tumor type cohorts (n = 149 subjects). Steady -
state trough concentrations on Day  42 (ie, at the end of Week  6) were summarized after 
excluding subjects with documented prior dose holds or dose modifications (Table  2.1.3.6). 
Based on this preliminary analysis, no clear evidence was found to suggest that any one tumor type had markedly different steady -state trough concentrations or var iability in steady -state 
trough concentrations compared with the other tumor types studied.

The starting dose of single agent cabozantinib in this study will be 60 mg daily ( free base 
weight) . While the MTD of single -agent cabozantinib f rom the Phase 1 study ( XL184- 001) was 
175 mg , in both the XL184 -201 and XL184- 203 studies, anti -tumor activity has also been 
observed at starting doses of cabozantinib lower than 175 mg . 
 Based on in vivo target modulation studies, cabozantinib exhibited I C50 values (concentration 
required for 50% inhibition) between 2 and 7.4 μM  for MET, VEGFR2, and RET  (Table 2.1.4) .

2.1.4 Clinical Pharmacodynamics  
Data from pharmacodynamic experiments show that, in vivo, cabozantinib inhibits key RTKs that promote tumor cell proliferation and/or angiogenesis (MET, VEGFR2, TIE -2, and RET). 
This provides support for the hypothesis that the efficacy of cabozantinib against multiple tumor types potentially results from inhibition of both tumor cell division a nd angiogenic responses. In 
general, there was a good correlation between increases in plasma drug concentrations and increased inhibition of receptor phosphorylation at the doses tested. Results from dose -response 
experiments in mice indicated that the ED
50 of targets was achieved at well tolerated doses of 
cabozantinib at plasma exposure comparable to exposure observed in clinical tria ls. 
 2.1.4.1 Pharmacodynamic Findings in Humans :  Phase 1: Study XL184 -001  
2.1.4.1.1 Plasma Sample Collection for Pharmac odynamic Analyses  
Plasma samples were analyzed for several biomarkers of response to anti -angiogenic agents, 
including levels of VEGF -A, soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2), and placental growth factor (PlGF). 
Clinical studies have shown increases in VEGF -A and PlGF  and decreases in sVEGFR2 in 
response to treatment with anti- angiogenic agents other than cabozantinib (Motzer et al. 2006).  
 Changes in pharmacodynamic markers consistent with anti -angiogenesis activity were observed 
in Cohorts 6 through 12 and the eMTD C ohort with plasma samples taken on Day 1 pre -dose and 
Day 29. While small cohort sizes presented a challenge for statistical analysis of 
pharmacodynamic marker changes the combined data of Cohorts 12 and the eMTD Cohort (ie, subjects enrolled at the MTD) d emonstrated that changes in PlGF (↑), VEGF -A (↑), EPO (↑), and 
sVEGFR2 (↓) reached statistical significance. Soluble MET as a potential biomarker of MET 
inhibition was increased upon cabozantinib treatment and changes reached statistical 
significance. Chan ges in these pharmacodynamic biomarkers were also observed in earlier 
cohorts and reached statistical significance for some time points and/or some cohorts. Analysis

 Page 14 of 77 of plasma biomarkers revealed that Ang2, EPO, and OPN significantly ( P < 0.05) correlate with 
tumor response across multiple tumor types (MTC: n = 29, melanoma: n = 4, colorectal 
carcinoma: n = 3, other n = 10 [with n = 1 per tumor type]) and thus mig ht represent potential 
prognostic biomarkers. Predictive biomarkers correlating with tumor shr inkage could not be 
identified.  
 
Similar data showing modulation of plasma markers of anti- angiogenesis therapy by 
cabozantinib treatment have been obtained from several other clinical studies, inclu ding 
XL184 -201 (see Section  2.1.4.3) and XL184 202 (not shown). 
 
2.1.4.1.2 Determi nation of Mutational RET Status in Tumor Tissue and/or Whole Blood Samples  
Germline and somatic RET genotyping was performed on DNA  isolated from whole blood 
(n = 29) and tumor (n = 27), respectively, for the subjects with MTC. Activating RET mutations 
were detected in 25/31 (81%) of MTC tumors. Of note, the tumor of one subject with MTC with 
rapid clinical progression demonstrated the P -loop, BRAF activating mutation G469A, the 
absence of a detectable RET mutation, and a 2.2 -fold amplification of the MET gene. Of the four 
remaining tumors without detectable RET mutations, one was found to have a 1.7- fold 
amplification in MET. The genotyping data suggest the absence of a correlation between RET mutations and either clinical response or time on study.   
 2.1.4.1.3 Pharmac odynami c Analyses of Surrogate Tissues  
One set of serial skin biopsies was received from a subject enrolled in the eMTD Cohort and was analyzed using fluorescence -based IHC. Changes in total MET, RET and KIT were minimal 
during the course of cabozantinib treatment but the activity (as assessed by the phosphorylation status) of these cabozantinib targets (decrease compared to baseline: MET: 40%, RET: 40%, KIT: 61%) as well as of the downstream signaling molecules AKT (39%) and ERK (55%) was statistically significantly reduced in this surrogate tissue. These observations support the on-target inhibitory effect of cabozantinib. Total levels and phosphorylation of VEGFR2 were not affected by cabozantinib treatment in this surrogate tissue.   2.1.4.2 Pharmacodynamic Findings in Humans:  Phase 1b/2: Study  XL184- 202 
2.1.4.2.1 Molecular Analy sis 
Molecular analyses included the determination of EGFR mutations and MET gene copy number status. Based on preliminary data, clinical activity of cabozantinib in combination with erlotinib was observed in a largely erlotinib -pretreated population, which included patients with the EGFR 
T790M mutati on and with and without MET amplification (Wakelee et al. 2010).  
 2.1.4.3 Phase 2: Study  XL184- 201 
2.1.4.3.1 Plasma Sample Collection for Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Plasma samples were analyzed for several biomarkers of response to anti -angiogenic agents, 
including levels of VEGF -A, sVEGFR2, and PlGF. Changes in pharmacodynamic markers 
consistent with cabozantinib on- target effects were observed after cabozantinib administration in 
40 subjects treated with a starting dose of 175 mg. Changes in PlGF (↑), VEGF -A (↑), sVEGFR2 
(↓), and sKIT(↓) reached statistical significance at multiple time points, particularly Days 15 and 29, on which the largest amount of data was available. Soluble MET as a potential biomarker of MET inhibition was modulated (↑) upon cabozant inib treatment and changes reached statistical

 Page 15 of 77 significance as well, on Day 15 and Day 57 (Cycle 3 Day 1), though changes were less robust 
than those for the analytes listed above. Baseline plasma levels of VEGF -A and PlGF were 
markedly higher in subjects that had received prior treatment with agents that directly target VEGF (ie, bevacizumab [n = 6] and VEGF -Trap [n = 1]) compared to subjects who either had no 
prior anti -angiogenic treatment or had treatment with anti- angiogenic agents that do not target 
VEGF directly (14 -fold higher for VEGF -A; 2-fold higher for PlGF; both P < 0.001). 
Preliminary analysis of potential correlations between clinical outcome and baseline levels or changes during treatment of the plasma proteins did not reveal significant corr elations other than 
a trend observed towards lower baseline bFGF in subjects with PR compared to subjects with PD in fewer than 8 weeks ( P = 0.05).  
 Results from a similar analysis of plasma samples obtained from subjects treated with a starting dose of 125 mg showed statistically significant modulation of plasma biomarkers VEGF -A, 
PlGF, and sVEGFR2, as well as modulation of sKIT and sMET. Mean fold -changes from 
baseline at Day 15 of treatment (pre -dose) were as follows (N = 29): VEGF -A: 1.8- fold increase; 
PlGF: 2.7- fold increase; sVEGFR2: 17% decrease (ratio of 0.83); sKIT: 11% decrease (ratio of 
0.89). As in the 175- mg cohort, baseline plasma level s of VEGF -A and PlGF in the 125- mg 
group were markedly higher in subjects that had received prior treatment with bevacizumab [n = 8] compared to subjects who either had no prior anti -angiogenic treatment or had treatment 
with anti- angiogenic agents that do not target VEGF directly [n = 25] (5.7- fold higher for 
VEGF -A; 1.9- fold higher for PlGF; both P < 0.001). 
 2.1.4.4 Phase 2: Study  XL184- 203 
2.1.4.4.1 Analysis of Pharmacodynamic Plasma Samples  
Plasma analyses thus far have focused on the crosslinked C -telopeptide of type  I collagen (CTx), 
a marker of osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Levels of CTx were red uced in the majority 
of subjects including those with CRPC for whom at least one baseline and a Week  6 or Week  12 
plasma sample could be tested. The effects of cabozantinib on decreasing plasma CTx levels appear to be independent of prior or concomitant bi sphosphonate treatment or presence of bone 
metastases ( Gordon et al . 2011, Hussain  et  al. 2011). In addition, total ALP (t
-ALP) was 
routinely measured in serum in these subjects. While t -ALP is also generated in the liver, in men 
with CRPC with elevated levels, it correlates well with levels of bone -specific ALP, a marker of 
osteoblast activity and bone formation. Consistent with effects of cabozantinib on osteoblast activity, the majority of CRPC subjects with bone metastases and elevated t -ALP levels at 
baseline showed reductions in t -ALP. These effects were independent of prior or concomitant 
bisphosphonate treatment ( Hussain  et al. 2011).  
 
2.1.4.4.2 Genotyping of Archival Tumor Tissue  
Thus far, select genotyping analyses have been conducted on archival tumor tissue and clinical 
sites have shared their own results when available. Based on the preliminary analysis of 48 
melanoma subjects with both tumor response and BRAF mutation data, clinical activity of 
cabozantinib appears to be independent of BRAF mut ation status (Gordon et al. 2011). Clinical 
activity of cabozantinib also appears to be independent of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in NSCLC subjects based on the preliminary data (Gordon et al. 2011). However, only 4 of 23 NSCLC subjects with available E GFR genotyping data and only 3 of 23 NSCLC subjects with 
available KRAS genotyping data were positive for a mutation. In the limited samples tested from

 2.1.4.5 Phase 3: Study  XL184- 301 
2.1.4.5.1 Pharmacodynamic Sample Collection and Analysis P lan 
Archival tumor samples to determine the RET mutational status in tumors and a whole blood 
sample to determine the hereditary RET status are being collected from every subject. Plasma 
samples taken at baseline and intermittently while on treatment are being collected to evaluate changes in plasma markers of anti -angiogenesis therapy. Data analysis is not yet complete. Refer 
to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for information regarding the  clinical 
pharmacodynamics of cabozantinib.  
 2.1.5 Clinical Activity  
Preliminary clinical activity data are available for Studies XL184 -001, XL184- 201, XL184- 202, 
and XL184- 203. 
 XL184- 001 
Study  XL184- 001 was a pha se 1 dose -escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. 
Eighty -five subjects, including 37 subjects with MTC (35 with measurable disease), were 
enrolled in the XL184- 001 study. Of the 85 subjects, 18 subjects experienced a tumor shrinkage  
of ≥ 30%, including 17 (49%) of 35 subjects with MTC with measurable disease. In the response 
evaluable subset of subjects with MTC, 10 (29%) of 35 subjects had confirmed partial responses (cPRs). In addition, 15 subjects with MTC had stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months. 
 XL184- 201 
Study  XL184- 201 was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability and antitumor activity of 
cabozantinib in subjects with progressive or recurrent GB. Clinical efficacy data are summarized in Table 2.1.5 for 46  subjects  who received cabozantinib at a  starting dose of 175 mg (Group A) 
and 59 subjects who received cabozantinib at a st arting dose of 125 mg qd (Group B). In both of 
these cohorts, radiographic response was evaluated by an IRF review of MRI scans per modified Macdonald criteria (Macdonald et al. 1990). An additional cohort with a starting dose of 125 mg  qd (Group C) was also enrolled, but clinical efficacy data have not yet been analyzed.

XL184- 202 
In Study  XL184- 202, sixty -four subjects were enrolled in the Phase  1 dose -escalation portion of 
the study examining the combination of cabozantinib and erlotinib in NSCLC subj ects. All but 
two subjects had been previously treated with and progressed on erlotinib therapy. Nine subjects (14%) had a ≥  30% decrease in the sum of tumor measurements compared with baseline 
measurements. A cPR was observed in 5 subjects (8%). In additi on, 24 subjects (37%) had 
SD/PR ≥  4 months (range, 4.6- 23+ months).  
 Twenty -eight subjects were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study, in which subjects who 
had received clinical benefit from erlotinib and subsequently experienced PD receive single -agent cabozantinib or cabozantinib in combination with erlotinib. Additional details about 
the design of Study  XL184 -202 are presented in Section  5.1.5 of the Investigator’s Brochure v7. 
Two subjects (7%) had a ≥  30% decrease in the sum of tumor measuremen ts compared with 
baseline measurements (one subject who received treatment with single -agent cabozantinib and 
one subject who received treatment with cabozantinib in combination with erlotinib). A cPR was observed in the subject who was treated with single -agent cabozantinib. 
 XL184- 203 
Study  XL184- 203 is an ongoing Phase  2 randomized discontinuation study of cabozantinib in 
subjects with advanced solid tumors, a total of 531 subjects have been enrolled. An analysis of data from the Lead -In Stage for 490 su bjects showed clinical activity in multiple tumor types 
including regression of soft -tissue tumor disease, bone scan resolution in subjects with bone 
metastasis, and other signs of clinical benefit (Gordon et  al. 2011; Hussain et al. 2011; 
Bukanovich et al  2011). Randomization was suspended in the CRPC and ovarian cancer cohorts 
based on observed high rates of clinical activity, and randomized subjects were unblinded. Non-randomized expansion (NRE) cohorts have been initiated for these tumor types.

 Page 18 of 77 CRPC Co hort (N = 171)  
The majority (91%) of enrolled subjects had ≥ 2 disease sites; 37% had evidence of disease in 
liver or lung, and 87% had metastasis to bone. Forty -three percent of subjects were pretreated 
with docetaxel, 9% with abiraterone or MDV3100, and 22% with other cytotoxic and/or experimental therapies. Seven subjects achieved a cPR at Week 12, and three additional subjects achieved PR after the 12 -week Lead -In Stage. The overall DCR at Week 12 was 68%. 
Regression of measurable soft -tissue disease was observed in 74% of subjects with at least one 
post-baseline tumor assessment. Changes in PSA appeared to be independent of radiographic 
changes.  
 In 108 CRPC subjects evaluable for post -baseline bone scan changes, best assessments of bone 
scan were parti al or complete resolution in 82 subjects (76%), stable disease in 23 subjects 
(21%), and PD in three subjects (3%). Based on a retrospective survey completed by investigators, the majority of the subjects reported reduced bone pain and reduced reliance upon narcotic pain medication. There were 83  subjects with bone metastases and bone pain at baseline 
who had at least one post -baseline assessment of pain status. Of these, 56 subjects (68%) had 
pain improvement at either Week  6 or 12. There were 71 subjects who required narcotic 
analgesic medication at baseline for control of bone pain. Among the 67 of these subjects who were evaluable for post -baseline pain improvement, 47 (70%) had pain improvement at Week 6 
or Week  12, and among the 55 subjects who were ev aluable for post -baseline changes in 
consumption of narcotics, 31 (56%) were able to decrease or discontinue narcotic medication.  
 A positive correlation between bone scan resolution and improvement in clinical symptoms of disease was observed. Subjects wi th bone scan resolution (either complete or partial) were more 
likely to be free of disease progression at 6  months (61% vs. 35%), experience pain relief (83% 
vs. 43%), reduce or eliminate their need for narcotic analgesics (68% vs. 33%), achieve tumor 
regression (78% vs. 58%), and experience substantial declines in markers of bone turnover (60% 
vs. 43%), as compared to those who did not achieve bone scan resolution (stable or progressing bone sca n). 
 Reductions of t -ALP and CTx were observed. Of 28 subject s with bone metastases who had 
t-ALP levels at least 2  × ULN, and at least 12 weeks of follow -up, the majority had decreases in 
t-ALP. In addition, of 118 subjects with bone metastases and plasma CTx data, the majority also 
showed a decrease in CTx at Week  6 or Week  12. Reductions in either CTx or t -ALP occurred 
regardless of prior bisphosphonate treatment. The investigator -assessed median PFS of the 
Randomized Stage, from Week  12 onward, was 6 weeks (95% CI: 5 –12 weeks) for the placebo 
group (n =  17), and 21 weeks (95%  CI: 11  weeks, upper limit not yet reached) for the 
cabozantinib group (n =  14). The hazard ratio of 0.13 (95%  CI: 0.03 -0.50) strongly favored the 
cabozantinib arm and corresponds to an 87% reduction in the risk of disease progression for subjects treated with cabozantinib compared with placebo ( P = 0.0007). The overall median PFS 
from Day 1 of starting cabozantinib treatment, excluding subjects randomized to placebo, was 29 weeks and appeared to be independent of prior docetaxel treatment.

The majority (93%) of enrolled subjects had the ovary as primary disease site, and 79% had 
serous cell carcinoma differentiation . Forty -nine percent of enrolled subjects were considered 
platinum refractory/resistant, defined as  a platinum- free interval of 6  months or less. More than 
half of the subjects (57%) had received ≥ 2 prior lines of platinum -based chemotherapy, 31% had 
received pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan, and 10% had received prior VEGF pathway inhibitors. The overall DCR at Week 12 was 53%. Two of 11 subjects (18%) with platinum refractory disease, defined as a platinum -free interval of <  1 month, achieved a 
confirmed response (one CR and one PR). Five of 23 subjects (22%) with platinum -resistant 
diseas e, defined as a platinum -free interval of 1 -6 months, achieved a PR. Ten of 36 subjects 
(28%) with platinum sensitive disease, defined as platinum -free interval > 6 months, achieved a 
PR. The DCR at Week  12 for the platinum -refractory group was 36%, for the resistant group 
39%, and for the sensitive group 67%. A total of 37 patients experienced reductions in the ovarian cancer tumor marker CA125, including 8 with decreases greater than 50%. There was no consistent concordance between CA125 changes and tumor  regression. At the time point of the 
analysis, the median duration of response was not reached with 36 weeks of median follow -up 
(Buckanovich et al. 2011).  
Melanoma Cohort (N = 77)  
Fifty -four (70%) of the enrolled melanoma subjects had advanced cutaneous /mucosal melanoma 
and 23 (30%) had advanced primary ocular disease. BRAF mutation was detected in 17 (32%) of subjects. The majority of patients (87%) had 0 -2 lines of prior therapy and 13% had 3 or more 
lines of therapy. The overall DCR at Week 12 was 47% . Regression of measurable soft -tissue 
disease was observed in 39 of 65 (60%) of subjects with at least one post -baseline tumor 
assessment. During the Lead -In Stage, the first 12 weeks of the study, a cPR was observed in 4 
subjects. Tumor regression appear ed to occur regardless of BRAF mutational status. Two out  of 
2 patients with bone metastases followed by bone scan experienced partial resolution of bone lesions. One patient with symptomatic bone metastases following treatment with ipilimumab experienced relief of bone pain on cabozantinib and remains on study with stable disease for more than 6 months. Of the 77 enrolled subjects, including those potentially randomized to placebo, 27% remained on study at 6 months.  
NSCLC Cohort (N = 60)  
The majority (93% ) of enrolled subjects had Stage IV disease at diagnosis, and 7% had stage III 
disease. Seventeen (28%) subjects had squamous cell carcinoma differentiation, and 43 (72%) had adenocarcinoma or other histologic subtypes. Half of the subjects had 0- 2 lines of prior 
therapy, and the other half had 3 or more lines of prior therapy . Prior therapies included 
anti-VEGF pathway therapy (32%) and anti -EGFR therapy (42%). The overall DCR at Week  12 
was 40%. Six subjects (10%) achieved a cPR. Tumor regression appeared to occur regardless of 
either EGFR or KRAS mutational status. Forty percent of subjects in the cohort r emained on

lines of therapy, and 40% had been treated previously with anti -VEGF path way therapy. The 
overall DCR at Week  12 was 45%. Regression of measurable soft -tissue disease was observed in 
15 of 16 (94%) of subjects with at least one post -baseline tumor assessment. During the Lead -In 
Stage, the first 12  weeks of the study, a cPR was observed in 2 subjects. Two of 3 subjects with 
bone metastases followed by bone scan experienced partial resolution on bone scan accompanied by symptomatic pain relief.  
 
SCLC (N =  21), Pancreatic Cancer (N = 20), Gastric/GEJ Cancer (N = 21) Cohorts  
Lower DCRs at Week  12 were observed in SCLC  (38%), pancreatic cancer (35%), and 
gastric/GEJ cancer  (33%). Confirmed partial tumor responses were observed in SCLC  (1) and 
gastric/GEJ cancer  (1). 
 Translational Medicine  
Genotyping data in the XL184- 001 study sugge st the absence of a correlation between RET 
mutations and either clinical response or time on study. In an ongoing analysis in the XL184 -201 study, genotyping analysis of several genomic alterations frequently found in GB 
revealed that none appear to confe r resistance to cabozantinib. 
 Data from subjects enrolled in ongoing clinical studies demonstrated statistically significant changes in plasma biomarkers such as sMET and sKIT. Analysis of serial hair and/or skin samples revealed substantial inhibition of  the phosphorylation of cabozantinib targets such as 
MET, RET, and KIT, as well as of downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK, following administration of cabozantinib.  
 2.2 Study Disease  
Neuroendocrine tumors, which include carcinoid tumors and pancrea tic neuroendocrine tumors, 
are relatively uncommon, comprising only approximately 1- 2% of all malignancies . However, 
this assertion has been revisited in recent years, with the most recent SEER database reporting an annual incidence of over 5 per 100,000 [1] . When patients with neuroendocrine tumors present 
with surgically resectable disease, the prognosis is excellent, but unfortunately, a substantial fraction of patients with neuroendocri ne tumors either present with or develop metastatic disease

 Page 21 of 77 that is not amenable to curative approaches . In these patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy has been 
of limited efficacy and counterbalanced with substantial toxicities . A variety of other agents have 
been attempted, including somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
such as sorafenib [2]  and sunitinib [3], VEGF antagonists, such as bevacizumab [4] , and mTOR 
inhibitors such as temsirolimus [5] , and everolimus [6] . Somatostatin analogs are generally 
administered to patients for symptomatic benefit, but have not generally resulted in radiographic 
responses . A str ategy of angiogenesis inhibition in particular is compelling in neuroendocrine 
tumors given the highly vascularized nature of neuroendocrine tumors [7 -9]. Well -differentiated 
neuroendocrine tumors have a higher micr ovessel density than poorly differentiated 
neuroendocrine tumors [10, 11] . In addition, pancreatic endocrine tumors also display platelet -
derived growth factor receptors and stem -cell factor receptor (c- kit) [12, 13] .  
Metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been demonstrated to express MET, and in 
one small study, 33% of metastatic pancreatic endocrine tumors versus only 17% of non-metastatic neuroendocrine tumors ex pressed MET . Greater than 50% of tumors metastatic to 
lymph nodes or liver expressed MET [14] . 
 The data from clinical trials to date demonstrate possible clinical benefit of antagonism of the VEGF pathway in neuroendocrine tumors . In a Phas e II tria l of 44 patients with metastatic 
carcinoid tumors, the use of bevacizumab was associated with a response rate of 18% and progression- free survival (PFS) of 95% versus a response rate of 0% and PFS of 68% for patients 
receiving interferon -based the rapy [4] . Similarly, the use of sunitinib, a multitargeted tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor that includes activity against VEGF and KIT, in a Phase II trial of 109  patients 
with advanced neuroendocrine tumors demonstrated partial responses of 16.7% and 2.4% in pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors, respectively . Stable disease was achieved in 
83% of patients with carcinoid and 68% of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [3] . 
In a recent published Phase  III trial of sunitinib versus placebo restricted to patients with 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, the objective response rate was 9.3%, but median progression free survival was more than doubled compared to patient s treated with placebo (11.4 months  
versus 5.5 months ) [15] . 
 2.3 Rationale  
The antitumor activity of prior VEGF -directed therapies with bevacizumab and sunitinib, along 
with the currently limited treatment options for patients with neuroendocrine tumors make the identification of further agents with activity in patients with carcinoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors a high priority . We propose to study cabozantinib, which is known to 
inhibit both VEGF, MET, and KIT receptors, in patients with neuroendocrine tumors . Carcinoid 
tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have demonstrated markedly different response rates in prior trials of sunitinib and everolimus, and a recently published consensus of the nationa l cancer institute recommend evaluation separately in clinical trials [16]. Therefore, we 
propose enrolling two cohorts of patients, one with carcinoid tumor s, and one with pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors . We plan to treat patients with cabozantinib 60 mg ( free base weight) per 
day. This dose was selected based on the dose reductions necessary in the XL184 -203 clinical 
trial, where over half of patients requi red a dose reduction to 60 mg. Our primary endpoint will 
be overall response rate, and secondary endpoints will include progression- free and overall 
survival . Patients will be enrolled at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center  and the 
Dana Faber Cancer Institute .

2.4 Correlative Background  
There are ongoing efforts to identify biomarkers to predict response to various cancer therapeutics and allow for better matching of potentially toxic therapies with patients most likely to respond [17] . In particular, predicting and assessing response to antiangiogenic agents is 
vitally important. No validated biological markers (or biomarkers) currently exist for 
appropriately selecting patients with cancer for antiangiogenic therapy. W e also lack biomarkers 
able to identify escape pathways that should be targeted after tumors develop resistance to a 
given antiangiogenic agent. A number of potential systemic, circulating, tissue and imaging biomarkers have emerged from recently completed  phase  I–III studies [17]. Some of these are 
measured at baseline, for example VEGF gene polym orphisms, soluble VEGF receptor  1 
(sVEGFR1), while others are measured during treatment (such as hypertension, MRI -measured 
Ktrans, circulating angiogenic molecules or collagen  IV); all are mechanistically based. Some of 
these biomarkers might be pharmacodynamic, for example, increase in circulating VEGF, placental growth factor (PlGF), while others have potential for predicting clinical benefit or identifying the escape pathways , for example, stromal -derived factor 1α (SDF1α) or 
Interleukin  6. Most biomarkers are disease and/or agent specific and all of them need to be 
validated prospectively. These need to be explored in larger pa tient cohorts and in a disease – and 
agent -specifi c manner . In rectal cancer patients, we previously found that sVEGFR1 may be a 
predictive biomarker of response and toxicity for bevacizumab with radiation and chemotherapy [18, 19] . In addition, we found that bevac izumab therapy alone in creased the cancer cell 
expression of SDF1α and its receptor CXCR4 [20] . Moreover, high plasma SDF1α concentration 
during treatment was significantly associated with development of distant metastases [21] . 
Bevacizumab induced a sustained elevation in circulating plasma VEGF and PlGF, transiently increased sVEGFR2 and IL -6, and decreased sVEGFR1 [18] . The change in plasma PlGF (after 
bevacizumab alone) correlated with pathologic response after treatment, and circulating VEGF and IL -6 (after bevacizumab with chemoradiation) showed association with nodal disease status 
after treatment [18] . We found that some of these biomarkers were common across disease types 
and antiangiogenic agent types. For example, bevacizumab increased VEGF, PlGF and sVEGFR2 in sarcoma and ovarian cancer patients [22, 23] . On the ot her hand, while anti -
VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as cediranib, sunitinib and sorafenib also increased circulating PlGF and VEGF levels in brain tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma and sarcoma patients, respectively, they decreased sVEGFR2 and increas ed SDF1α in all cases [20, 24- 26]. 
Similar to rectal cancer, increases in circulating SDF1α correlated with a poor outcome after anti-VEGFR therapy [20, 24- 26]. These hypot heses -generating data from these exploratory 
studies need to be confirmed in further studies of anti -VEGF agents . We have previously have 
evaluated a battery of biomarkers after bevacizumab treatment in patients with various types of cancer: rectal carcino ma [18, 19, 21, 27- 30], sarcoma [23] , ovarian carcinoma [22] , lung 
carcinoma [31] , and Schwannoma [32] , as well as in breast cancer (trial ongoing, 
#DFCI  07-130). These biomarkers have been evaluated in m ore than a dozen trials of 
anti-VEGFR tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (e.g., sunitinib, sorafenib, vatalanib, cediranib, 
vandetanib) [20, 24- 26, 33- 35]. In study  XL184- 001, a Phase I study of cabozantinib 
administered to  subjects  with advanced malignancies, a prelim inary analysis of samples of 
14 subjects  revealed statistically significant chang e in VEGF -A and sVEGFR2 levels.

particular, functional  CT has been used at MGH to as sess changes in tumor perfusion parameters 
such as blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time and permeability surface area following 
therapy in rectal cancer, where both blood flow and PS product as measured by dynamic  CT 
were significantly decreased fol lowing treatment with a bevacizumab -containing treatment [18] . 
At MGH, low  dose CT  perfusion technique has also been utilized in hepatocellular carcinoma, 
where lower mean transit time was significantly associated w ith progressive disease . In addition, 
bevacizumab therapy was associated with decreases in blood flow, blood volume, and permeability surface area product, though only change in mean transit time after bevacizumab therapy correlated with clinical outcome [36] . Functional  CT has also been utilized in 
neuroendocrine tumors, revealing a correlation between decreases in blood flow and volume with anti- VEGF treatment with bevacizumab at day  2 and week  18 [4] .

5.2 Agent Administration  
Cabozantinib 60 mg  (free base weight) per day will be administered daily and continuously for a 
cycle length of 28 days . The 60 mg  starting dose was derived from the ongoing adaptive 
randomized discontinuation trial, XL184 -203, which used 100 mg per day ( free base weight), but 
over half of patients required a dose reduction to 60  mg. Participants will keep a drug diary to 
document daily oral dosing of cabozantinib. Subjects will be provided with a sufficient supply of study treatment and instructions for taking the study treatment on days  without scheduled clinic 
visits. After fasting (with exception of water) for 2  hours , subjects  will take study treatment daily 
each morning with a full glass of water (minimum of 8 oz/ 240 mL) and continue to fast for 1 hour after each dose of study tre atment . For missed doses, if it has been more than 12 hours  
since a scheduled dose, patients will be ins tructed not to take the missing dose. If patients vomit 
after taking their scheduled tablets , they will be instructed not to take another dose on this day 
and continue on their regular dosing schedule. If doses are withheld, the original schedule of 
assessments should be maintained when cabozantinib is restarted. The subject should be instructed to not make up the missed doses and to maintain the planned dosing schedule.  
 Subjects will be monitored continuously for adverse events through 30 days  (+7 days ) after the 
date of the decision to discontinue study treatment. Subjects will be instructed to notify their  
physician immediately for any and all toxicities.  Subjects experiencing one or more AEs  due to 
the study treatment may require a dosing delay, or reduction(s), in their dose in order  to continue 
with study treatment. Assessment of causality (chronology, confounding  factors such as disease, 
concomitant medications, diagnostic tests, and previous experience with the study treatment) should be conducted by  the PI when possible, before a decision is made to modify the dose or to 
hold dosing temporarily.  
 5.2.1 Drug formulation – Cabozantinib (XL184)  
Composition, Formulation, and Storage  
Cabozantinib must be stored at room temperature and inventoried according to applicable state and 
federal regulations.  
Investigational Treatment  
Chemical Name:  Cyclopropane -1,1-dicarboxylic acid [4 -(6,7-dimethoxy -quinolin -4-yloxy) -
phenyl] -amide (4 -fluoro -phenyl) -amide, (L) -malate salt.  
 
 Cabozantinib is an L -malate salt. In all studies except XL184 -203, cabozantinib doses and 
capsule strengths are expressed based on the weight of the cabozantinib salt. However, in Study XL184 -203, doses and capsule strengths are expressed based on the cabozantinib free  base 
equivalent weight. The new standard for Exelixis is to express the dosing in terms of the free base weight.  The difference between capsule strengths based on freebase or the L -malate 
salt weight (ie , < 2% based on correction for salt equivalent weights) is small relative to  the 
variance in mean exposures in  subjects  administered the same cabozantinib capsule dose 
(approximately 40% coefficient of variation for mean AUC), and is therefore considered to be not clinically relevant.

 5.3  General Concomitant Medication  and Supportive Care Guidelines  
5.3.1 Drug -drug interactions  
Cytochrome P450: Preliminary data from a clinical drug interaction study ( Study  XL184- 008) 
show that clinically relevant steady -state concentrations of cabozantinib appear to have no 
marked effect on the AUC of co- administered rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 substra te. Therefore, 
cabozantinib is not anticipated to markedly inhibit CYP2C8 in the clinic, and by inference, is not anticipated to markedly inhibit other CYP450 isozymes that have lower [I]/ Ki values compared 
to CYP2C8 (ie, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, a nd CYP3A4). In vitro data indicate 
that cabozantinib is unlikely to induce cytochrome  P450 enzymes, except for possible induction 
of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concentrations ( 30 μM). 
 Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substra te), based on data 
from in vitro studies using CYP -isozyme specific neutralizing antibodies. Preliminary results 
from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184- 006, showed that concurrent administration of 
cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co- administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family 
(eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamaze pine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, 
and St . John’s Wort) may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations. The chronic use of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided. Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with caution becau se these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. 
Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended. In addition, caution must be used when discontinuing treatment  with a 
strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject who has been concurrently receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase the exposure to cabozantinib.  Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -007, showed that  concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 33-39% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib 
in healthy volunteers. Co- administration of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4

 Page 29 of 77 family (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and 
ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib concentrations. Grapefruit / grapefruit juice and Seville oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant 
medications w ith no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is recommend ed. 
 
Because in vitro studies only assessed the metabolizing capacity of the CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 pathways, the potential for drugs that inhibit/induce other CYP450 pathways (eg, CYP2C8 , CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP1A2) to alter cabozantinib exposure is not known. 
Therefore, these drugs should be used with cautio n when given with cabozantinib. 
 Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction tables for lists of substrates, inducers, and inhibitor s 
of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockhart 2007; http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx
). 
 
Protein Binding : Cabozantinib is highly protein bound (approximately 99.9%) t o human plasma 
proteins. Therefore, highly protein bound drugs should be used with caution with cabozantinib because there is a potential displacement interaction that could increase free concentrations of cabozantinib and/or a co -administered highly prote in-bound drug (and a corresponding increase 
in pharmacologic effect). Factors that influence plasma protein binding may affect individual tolerance to cabozantinib. Therefore, concomitant medications that are highly protein bound (eg, diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propranolol) should be used with caution. Because warfarin is a highly protein bound drug with a low therapeutic index, administration of warfarin at therapeutic doses should be avoided in subjects receiving cabozantinib due to the pote ntial for 
a protein bi nding displacement interaction.  
 
Other Interactions : A relative bioavailability study in dogs suggests that cabozantinib is unlikely 
to be affected by drugs that alter gastric pH. In vitro data suggest that cabozantinib is unlikely to

5.3.3 Supportive medications  
Other concomitant medications may be given as clinically indicated, including supportive medications for diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or other supportive medications.  
 
5.3.4 Use of other medications not specified above  
No treatment with chronic immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine following transplantation or 
systemic steroids for treatment of autoimmune disease) will be permitted during this study; however, use of inhalant steroids and steroids given for antiemetic purposes or supportive therapy for brain metastases are permitted.  
 5.4 Duration of Therapy  
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
Disease progression,  
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
Participant decides to withdraw from the study, or  
General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating investigator.  
 5.5 Duration of Follow Up  
Subject survival information will be collected, preferably via office visit or telephone contact, 
every 12  weeks  (± 1 week) from the date of last dose of s tudy drug until the subject’s death or 
until the subject is lost to follow -up, or until study closure  (approximately 6 months  after the last 
subject terminates treatment).  
 
5.6 Criteria for Removal from Study Participants will be removed from study when a ny of the criteria listed in Section  5.4 applies. 
The reason for study removal and the date the participant was removed must be documented in the study -specific case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
 In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, participating investigators must 
immediately notify the Principal Investigator (or Protocol Chair),  Jennifer Ang Chan, Pager

Toxicity a ssessments will be carried out using NCI Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE v. 4.0) which is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting//ctc.html).  
 Subjects will receive caboz antinib orally at a (starting) dose of 60 mg ( free base) once daily. In 
all subjects, dose reductions and delays to manage toxicity are allowed under the guidelines below.

 Page 31 of 77 6.1 General Guidelines for Treatment Delay , Dose Reduction, or Study Drug 
Discontin uation for Toxicity 
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs throughout the study and for 30 days (+  7 days) 
after the last dose of study treatment, and for any serious adverse event assessed as related to 
study treatment or study procedures, even i f the SAE occurs more than 30 days after the last dose 
of study treatment. Subjects will be instructed to notify their physician immediately of any and 
all AEs. Subjects experiencing one or more AEs due to the study treatment may require a dosing 
delay or reduction(s) in their dose in order to continue with study treatment. Assessment of causality (chronology and confounding factors such as disease, concomitant medications, diagnostic tests, and previous experience with the study treatment) should be conduc ted by the 
principal investigator (PI) when possible, before a decision is made to modify the dose or to hold dosing temporari ly. 
 As a general approach, it is suggested that all AEs be managed with supportive care when possible at the earliest signs of to xicity to avoid dose interrupts and reductions if possible. 
 
Re-escalating  study treatment after a dose reduction:  
• Subjects may be re- escalated to the previous dose at the discretion of the investigator but not 
sooner than 2 weeks beyond the resolution to Grade  ≤ 1 or to the baseline value of AEs.  
• If a subject has been dose- reduced more than once ( 20 mg  qd), dose escalation can only 
occur to the next dose level ( 40 mg  qd). Further dose escalation to the highest dose level is 
allowed only if clinically indic ated per investigator’s judgment.  
• If the AEs that previously led to dose reduction(s) recur upon re -escalation, the dose should 
be reduced again and no further dose escalation will be permitted.  
 Dose re -escalation is not allowed for dose reduction trigg ered by neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia.  
 
TABLE 6.1 – Dose reductions  
Starting dose  1st dose reduction  2nd dose reduction

Note:  subjects may be re- escalated to the previous dose  at the discretion of the investigator no 
sooner than 2  weeks beyond resolution (Grade  ≤ 1 or to the baseline value [or lower] of AEs).  
Subjects who cannot tolerate study treatment at 20 mg (free  base) PO will be discontinued from 
study treatment.  
 
Disco ntinuation from study treatment: 
• If the subject does not recover from his or her toxicities to tolerable Grade ≤ 1 within 6 weeks, the subject will have study treatment discontinued unless there is unequivocal evidence that the subject is benefitting.  In this situation, a subject may be able to restart therapy with a dose reduction upon resolution of the toxicity.  
• The minimum dose of study treatment will be 20 mg (free base) qd. Subjects who cannot 
tolerate 20 mg  qd will have study treatment discontinued.

 Page 32 of 77 Additional information for dose delays or dose reductions:  
• Dose delays for reason(s) other than AEs related to cabozantinib, such as surgical procedures 
with no anticancer therapy intent, may be allowed with investigator approval. The acceptable length of  interruption will be determined by the investigator and sponsor.  
 Warnings, Precautions, and Management of Anticipated Adverse Events  
The general adverse event profile of cabozantinib includes GI symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), fatigue, anorexia, PPE syndrome, skin rash, elevated ALT and AST, increased pancreatic enzymes with rare cases of  pancreatitis, as well as side effects associated with inhibition of VEGF signaling such as thrombotic events (eg, PE and DVT), hypertension, proteinuria, hemorrhagic events, and rare cases of GI perforation and rectal/perirectal abscess. Arterial thromboembolism (TIA, MI) have been reported rarel y. 
 6.2 Management of Adverse Events  
In the absence of an unacceptable cabozantinib -related toxicity and/or clinical signs of disease 
progression, subjects may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects must be instructed to notify their physician immediately for any and all toxicities.  
 Guidelines for the management of AEs (ie, dose inte rruptions and dose reductions) are presented 
in the next sections. Each dose reduction of cabozantinib should be to one dose leve l lower that 
the current dose. Dose reductions of more than one dose level are acceptable if agreed to by the Investigator. If study treatment of cabozantinib is restarted after being withheld or interrupted, 
the subject should be instructed not to make up the missed doses of cabozantinib.  
 The reason for treatment delay and reduced dose must be recorded on the CRF.  
Dosing may ne ed to be interrupted for AEs considered not related to cabozantinib if this is 
clinically indicated or if causality is initially uncertain. Study treatment may be resumed at the same dose (or a lower dose per investigator judgment) if the AE is determined not to be related to cabozantinib once the investigator determines that retreatment is clinically appropriate and the subject meets the protocol re -treatment criteria.  
 
Events triggering permanent  discontinuation of cabozantinib:  
• Development of Grade 4 thr omboembolic events  
• Development of an acute MI or any other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic 
complication.  
• Any G rade 4 non- hematologic toxicity, with the exception of Grade  4 asymptomatic 
amylase or lipase elevation, judged to be related to st udy medication unless the patient is 
deriving clin ical benefit from cabozantinib. If the patient is deriving clinical benefit from 
cabozantinib, the toxicity must resolve to Grade  ≤1 prior to restarting , and after approval 
by the investigator, treatment at a reduced dose can be considered.  
• Transaminase elevations that are accompanied by evidence of impaired hepatic function 
(bilirubin elevation >  2xULN), in the absence of evidence o f biliary obstruction (i.e., 
significant elevation of ALP) or some other explanation of the injury.

General Guidelines for Non- Hematologic and Hematologic Adverse Events  
General guidelines for the management of non -hematologic and hematologic toxicities are 
provided i n Table 6.2.1 and Table  6.2.2, respectively. As a general approach, it is suggested that 
all AEs be managed with supportive care when possible at the earliest signs of toxicity. For more specific guidelines on gastrointestinal AEs (diarrhea, nausea/vomitin g, stomatitis/mucositis), 
hepatobiliary disorders, pancreatic disorders (lipase and amylase elevations), skin disorders (PPE), embolism and thrombus, hypertension, proteinuria , hemorrhage, rectal and  perirectal 
abscess; gastrointestinal perforation and ga strointestinal fistu la, wound healing and surgery, and 
endocrine disorders, refer to the specific subsections below. Guidance for the management of fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, non- gastrointestinal fistula, osteonecrosis of the jaw, eye 
disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, respiratory/thoracic/mediastional disorders and congenital, familial and genetic disorders can be

Diarrhea, Nausea, Vomiting,  Stomatitis, and Mucositis  
Diarrhea  
Subjects should be instructed to notify their physician immediately at the first signs of poorly 
formed or loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements. Administration of antidiarrheal agents is recommended at the first sign of diarrhe a as initial management. 
Loperamide is recommended as standard first line therapy. Alternatively, diphenoxylate/atropine can be used. Additional agents to consider in subjects with diarrhea that is refractory to the above include deodorized tincture of opi um and octreotide (Benson et al. 2004). Some subjects may 
require concomitant therapy with loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, and deodorized tincture of opium to control diarrhea. When combination therapy with antidiarrheal agents does not control the dia rrhea to tolerable levels, a dose reduction and/or dose interruption of cabozantinib should 
be implemented  as described in Table 6.1. In addition, general supportive measures should be 
implemented including continuous oral hydration, correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, small frequent meals, and stopping lactose -containing products, high fat meals 
and alcoh ol.

Nausea and Vomiting 
Anti-emetic agents along with supportive care are recommended as clinically appropriate at the 
first sign of nause a and vomiting. A dose reduction and/or dose interruption of cabozantinib may 
be required as described in  Table 6.1 if anti- emetic treatment and/or prophylaxis alone is not 
adequa te. 
 
Agents classified as having a high therapeutic index (such as 5 -HT3 receptor antagonists, or 
NK-1 receptor antagonists) per ASCO or MASCC/ESMO guidelines for anti -emetics in 
oncology or dexamethasone are recommended (Hesketh et al. 2008, ASCO 2006; Roila et al, Annals of Oncology, 2010). Caution is recommended with the use of aprepitant or fosaprepitant and nabilone as cabozantinib exposure may be affected by concomitant administration because aprepitant and fosaprepitant are both inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, and nabilone is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4.  
Stomatitis and Muc ositis  
Preventive measures may include a comprehensive dental examination to identify any potential complications before study treatment is initiated. Appropriate correction of local factors should be instituted as indicated, such as modification of ill -fitting dentures and appropriate care of 
gingivitis. During treatment with cabozantinib, good oral hygiene and standard local treatments such as a traumatic cleansing, and oral rinses (eg,  with a weak solution of salt and baking soda) 
should be maintained. T he oral cavity should be rinsed and wiped after meals, and dentures 
should be cleaned and brushed often to remove plaque. Local treatment should be instituted at the earliest onset of symptoms. When stomatitis interferes with adequate nutrition and local therapy is not adequately effective, dose reduction or temporary withholding of cabozantinib 
should be considered.  
 Hepatobiliary Disorders  
Elevations of transaminases have also been observed during treatment with cabozantinib. In general, it is recommended  that subjects with elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin have more 
frequent laboratory monitoring of these parameters. If possible, hepatotoxic concomitant medications and alcohol should be discontinued in subjects who develop elevated transaminas es. 
 Since subjects may enter the study with elevations of AST/ALT at baseline, the following 
guideline should be used for dose modifications:

Grade 4  Discontinue study treatment permanently. LFTs should be 
monitored as clinically indicated, at least 2 -3 times per week, u ntil

 Page 38 of 77 Cabozantinib treatment should also be interr upted when transaminase increases are accompanied 
by progressive elevations of total bilirubin, and/or elevations of coagulation tests 
(eg, International Normalized Ratio [INR]). Monitoring of transaminases should be intensified 
(2–3 times per week) and cabozantinib should be held until the etiology of the abnormalities is 
determined and these abnormalities are corrected or stabilize at clinically acceptable levels (INR 
< 2 × ULN, total bilirubin <  3 × ULN, aminotransferases < 2.5 ×  ULN or baseline).  
 
Subje cts must have cabozantinib permanently discontinued if transaminase elevations are 
accompanied by evidence of impaired hepatic function (bilirubin elevation >2xULN), in the absence of evidence of biliary obstruction (i.e., significant elevation of ALP) or some other explanation of the injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis), as the combined finding (i.e., Hy’s  Law cases) represents a signal of a potential for the drug to cause severe liver  injury.  
 All subjects who develop isolated bilirubin eleva tions ≥  3 times the upper limit of normal should 
have study treatment held until recovered to Grade  ≤ 1 or baseline (or lower). If this occurs 
within 6 weeks of the dosing delay, study treatment may continue at a reduced dose. In subjects without biliary obstruction and Grade  4 bilirubin elevati on, or with recurrence of Grade  3 
bilirubin elevation after a dose reduction, study treatment must be discontinued.
 
 
Pancreatic Conditions  
Amylase and lipase elevations have been observed in clinical studies with ca bozantinib. The 
clinical significance of asymptomatic elevations of enzymes is not know but, in general have not been associated with clinically apparent sequelae, and no specific interventions is required.. It is 
recommended that subjects with lipase elev ation and/or symptoms of pancreatitis have more 
frequent laboratory monitoring of lipase and/or amylase (2- 3 times per week). Subjects with 
symptomatic pancreatitis should be treated with standard supportive measures.

Skin Disorders  
Palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE; also known as hand- foot syndrome), skin 
rash (including blister, eryt hematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, 
and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pigmentary changes, and alopecia have been 
reported with cabozantinib. All subjects on study should be advised on prophylactic measures including the use of emollients, removal of calluses, avoidance of exposure of hands and feet to 
hot water leading to vasodilatation, protection of pressure -sensitive areas of hands and feet, and 
use of cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and keep the palms and soles dry.  
 The onset of PPE is variable with paresthesia (tingling, numbness) being the characteristic initial manifestation, which can be accompanied by slight redness or mild hyperkeratosis. PPE advances with symmetrical painful erythema and s wollen areas (edema) on the palms and soles. 
The lateral sides of the fingers or periungual zones may also be affected. Adequate interventions are required to prevent worsening of skin symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis of a ffected areas.  
 Aggressive management of symptoms is recommended, including early dermatology referral. Subjects with skin disorders should be carefully monitored for signs of infection (eg, abscess, cellulitis, or impetigo).

from study if reactions worsen or  do not improve within 6  weeks.  
 
Embolism and Thrombosis  In clinical studies with cabozantinib, venous thrombotic events (DVT and PE) have been observed in less than 10% of subjects, and arterial thromboembolic events (MI and TIA) have been reported rarely. I n addition, subjects with cancer have a significantly increased likelihood 
of developing thromboembolic complications ( De Groot  et al, 2009).

 Page 42 of 77 Cabozantinib must be discontinued in subjects who develop Grade  4 thromboembolic events or 
who develop an acute M I or any other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic 
complication. In patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation for Grade  2 or Grade  3 
thromboembolic events, cabozantinib may be continued as follows: Subjects who develop a 
Grade 2 or Grade  3 PE and/or DVT should have study treatment interrupted until full 
anticoagulation is established with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  (Full anticoagulation 
with warfarin is not permitted). Venous filters (e.g. vena cava filters) are not recommended due 
to the high incidence of complications associated with their use. Once a subject is fully anticoagulated, treatment can be restarted per investigator judgment at one dose lower. Subjects should permanently discontinue after a second thrombotic event. Al though routine prophylactic 
anticoagulation is not necessary for all subjects, prophylactic anticoagulation is allowed for individual subjects at the discretion of the investigator.   Hypertension  
Hypertension is a relatively common complication of other V EGF -pathway inhibitors and has 
been observed in cabozantinib clinical studies.  
 Decisions to decrease or hold the dose of study treatment must be based on BP readings taken by a medical professional and must be confirmed with a second measurement at least 5 minutes following the first measurement. Other than for hypertension requiring immediate therapy, the presence of new or worsened hypertension should be confirmed at a second visit before taking new therapeutic action. Blood pressure should be monitored in a constant position visit to visit, either sitting or supine. Cabozantinib dosing should be interrupted in subjects with severe hypertension (180 mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg diastolic; or sustained ≥  160 mm Hg systolic 
or ≥ 110 diastolic) who cannot be controlled with medical interventions and discontinued in 
subjects with hypertensive crises or hypertensive encephalopathy.

Proteinuria Proteinuria has been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. D evelopment and worsening of proteinuria should be monitored by serial 
urinalysis (qualitative/ semiquantitative assessment by dipstick; quantitative assessment by urine protein/urine creatinine ratio [UPCR], or 24- hour urine protein excretion). When a UPCR 
exceeds  1 (m g/dL protein  / mg/dL creatinine), a repeat UPCR or a 24 -hour urine protein and 
creatinine should be performed to confirm the result. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who develop nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >  3.5 grams per day in combinat ion with 
low blood protein levels, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and edema) or any other relevant renal disease. Also, given the nephrotoxic potential of bisphosphonates, these agents should be used with caution in patients receiving t reatment with cabozantinib.  Details of 
management are described in Table 6.2.3.

• If proteinuria of ≥  3.5 g/24 hours is confirmed without 
diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, continue to hold 
cabozantinib and monitor UPCR weekly. If UPCR decreases to < 1, restart c abozantinib at a reduced dose. Continue 
monitoring UPCR once every week until two consecutive readings are < 1, then revert to UPCR monitoring frequency 
specified in the protocol.  
 
Hemorrhage  
Hemorrhagic events have been reported with approved drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. As preventive measures, subjects should be evaluated for potential bleeding risk factors prior to initiating cabozantinib treatment and monitored for bleeding events with serial complete blood counts and physical examination while on study. Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
• Tumor lesions of the lung with cavitations or tumor lesions which invade, encase, or abut 
major blood vessels of the lung; NSCLC with squamous cell differentiation is known for 
significant lung cavitations and centrally loc ated tumors that may invade major blood 
vessels. The anatomic location and characteristics of tumor as well as the medical history 
should be carefully reviewed in the selection of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib. 
• Recent or concurrent r adiation to the thoracic cavity  
• Active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory GI diseases  
• Underlying medical conditions that  affect normal hemostasis (eg, deficiencies in clotting 
factors and/or platelet function, or thrombocytopenia)  
• Concomi tant medication with anticoagulants or other drugs which affect normal hemostasis

 Page 45 of 77 Based on the described predisposing risk factors for hemoptysis, many studies with 
antiangiogenic drugs exclude subjects with NSCLC and squamous cell differentiation. Although enrollment of subjects with NSCLC with squamous cell differentiation has been allowed on cabozantinib studies, cabozantinib studies exclude NSCLC subjects with any of the following: tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood vessel; cavitating  lesions; history of 
clinically significant hemoptysis; or recent (within 3  months) radiation therapy to the thoracic 
cavity including brachytherapy unless radiation therapy targets bone metastasis.  
 Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with ser ious and life -threatening bleeding 
events or recent hemoptysis (≥  ½ tablespoon of red blood). Treatment with cabozantinib should 
be interrupted if less severe forms of clinically significant hemorrhage occur and may be restarted after the cause of hemorrha ge has been identified and the risk of bleeding has subsided. 
Therapy of bleeding events should include supportive care and standard medical interventions.  
 Furthermore, subjects who develop tumors abutting, encasing, or invading a major blood vessel or wh o develop cavitation of their pulmonary tumors while on study treatment must immediately 
be discussed with the sponsor to determine the safety of continuing study treatment.  
 Rectal and Perirectal Abscess  
Rectal and perirectal abscesses have been reported,  sometimes in subjects with concurrent 
diarrhea. These should be treated with appropriate local care and antibiotic therapy. Cabozantinib should be held until adequate healing has taken place.  
 Gastrointestinal perforation and GI fistula  
Gastrointestinal perforation and GI fistula have been reported with approved drugs that inhibit 
VEGF pathways as well as with cabozantinib. To allow for early diagnosis, subjects should be monitored for episodes of abdominal pain, especially if known risk factors for devel oping GI 
perforation or fistula (Turnage et al. 2008) are present. Such risk factors include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
• Intra -abdominal tumor/metastases invading GI mucosa  
• Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or ap pendicitis  
• History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra -abdominal 
abscess  
• Prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing ) 
 Complete healing following abdominal surgery or resolution of intra -abdominal abscess must be 
confirmed prior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib.  
 Additional risk factors include concurrent use of steroid treatment or non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (Rodriguez et al. 2001, Straube et al. 2009). Constipation, consistent 
with symptoms of bowel obstruction, should be monitored and effectively managed. Discontinue cabozantinib and initiate appropriate management in subjects who have been diagnos ed with GI 
perforation or fistula.

 Page 46 of 77 Wound healing and Surgery  
VEGF in hibitors can cause wound healing complications and wound dehiscence which may 
occur even long after a wound has been considered healed. Therefore, surgical and traumatic 
wounds must have completely healed prior to starting cabozantinib treatment and be monitored for wound dehiscence or wound infection while the subject is being treated with cabozantinib. 
 
Treatment with cabozantinib must be interrupted for any wound healing complication which 
needs medical intervention. Treatment with cabozantinib can be resumed once wound healing has occurred unless otherwise prohibited in specific protocols. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with serious or chronic wound healing complications.  
 The appropriate dose hold interval prior to elective surgery to reduce the risk for wound healing complications has not been determined. In general, cabozantinib should be stopped at least 3 weeks (5 half li ves) prior to elective surgery.  
 Endocrine Di sorders  
Prospective studies of markers of thyroid functions are currently ongoing in two single -agent 
studies to characterize the effects of cabozantinib on thyroid function. Preliminary data indicate that cabozantinib affects TFTs in a high number of subj ects. In Study XL184- 203, 17 of 34 
(50%) euthyroid subjects with CRPC developed abnormal thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) 
levels 6  weeks after initiation of cabozantinib treatment (6% showed TSH levels between 5 and 
7 mU/L, 44% had TSH >  7 mU/L). The medi an TSH level at week 6 was 5.2  mU/L 
(range,  0.02 -29.7 mU/L). In a Phas e 1 combination study  of rosiglitazaone and cabozantinib 
(XL184- 008) to determine the potential for a clinically significant drug -drug interaction of 
cabozantinib on the CYP isozyme CYP 2C8, subjects with advanced solid tumors (particularly 
RCC and DTC) are enrolled. A mong 11 evaluable subjects, the AE of hypothyroidism was 
reported in 55% of subjects. Currently available data are insufficient to determine the cause of TFT alterations and  its clinical relevance. Routine monitoring of thyroid function and 
assessments for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is recommended for subjects treated with cabozantinib. Management of thyroid dysfunction (eg,  symptomatic 
hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines.  
 Other endocrine disorders such as hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, and associated laboratory changes, have been observed in less than 10% of subjects. Monitoring with standard laboratory tests for e ndocrine disorders and clinical examination prior to initiation and during treatment 
with cabozantinib is recommended. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with severe or life -threatening endocrine dysfunction. 
 Concomitant Medications and Thera pies 
Anticancer Therapy  
If a subject requires additional systemic anticancer treatment, including steroid  treatment for 
prostate cancer subjects, study treatment must be discontinued other than the use of octreotide . 
Local intervention is discouraged unles s medically unavoidable. Subjects receiving local 
intervention (eg, palliative radiation) are allowed to continue to receive study treatment at the investigator’s discretion. Subjects with prostate cancer currently  receiving luteinizing hormone -

maintained on these agents. 
 Other Medications  
Subjects must be instructed to inform the investigators of the current or planned use or all other 
medications during the study (including  prescription medications, vitamins, herbal and 
nutritional supplements, and over -the-counter medications). It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are documented.  
 
Anti-emetics and anti -diarrheal medications should not be administered prophylactically prior to 
the first dose of cabozantinib. After the first dose of study treatment, at the discretion of the investigator or after the onset of symptoms, treatment (or prophylaxis) with anti- emetic and anti -
diarrheal medications may be undertaken per standard clinical practice. Bisphosphonates are allowed if started prior to screening activities or may be initiated during the course of the study to control bone pain with agreement from the sponsor.  Colony st imulating factors (eg,  erythropoietin and granulocyte colony -stimulating factors) and 
pain medications administered as dictated by standard practice are acceptable while the subject is enrolled in the study. However, colony stimulating factors should not be administered prophylactically prior to the  first dose of study treatment.  
 No concurrent investigational agents are permitted.  7. VISIT SCHEDULE AND ASSESSMENTS  
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1- week prior to start of protocol therapy. S cans 
must be done ≤  4 weeks  prior to the start of therapy. In the event that the participant's condition 
is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours  prior to initiation of 
the next cycle of therapy.

 Page 52 of 77 8. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
8.1 Antitumor Effect  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed 
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee ( Therasse et  al, 
2000) . RECIST  version 1.1 will be used. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. For the purposes of this 
study, patients should be reevaluated every 8 weeks . In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory 
scans should also be obtained no less than 4 weeks  following initial documentation of objective 
response  
 
8.1.1 Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity . All participants who receive at least one dose of study treatment will be 
evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment.  
 
Evaluable for objective response . Only those participants who have measurable disease present 
at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for response. These participants will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective disease progression or die prior to the end of cycle  1 will also be considered evaluable.}  
 8.1.2 Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per orga n and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and will be  recorded 
and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of  their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be repr esentative of all involved organs, and should be chosen based 
on their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible repeated measurements in which case the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 8.1.2.1 Complete Response  
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) 
must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm.  
 8.1.2.2 Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

CONFI DENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
 Page 53 of 77 8.1.2.3 Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In a ddition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
 
8.1.2.4 Stable Disease (SD)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qua lify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as 
references the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
8.1.3 Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 8.1.3.1 Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10  mm short axis). Note: If tumor markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize  for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  
 8.1.3.2 Non- complete response (non- CR)/Non -progression (non- PD) 
Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits.  
 8.1.3.3 Progr essive Disease (PD)  
Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non- target 
lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not  a single lesion increase. Although a clear 
progression of non- target lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should 
prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed later on by the review panel (or s tudy chair).  
 8.1.3.4 FDG -PET 
While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.

 Page 54 of 77 b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at  follow -up: If the positive  FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up 
CT scans are needed to determine i f there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis  of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. 
The use of FDG -PET in this circum stance should be prospectively described in the protocol 
and supported by disease specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be  
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -
PET and biopsy r esolution/sensitivity. Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one 
which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 8.1.4 Cytology and Histology  
If the measurable disease is restri cted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature  should be 
confirmed by cytology/histology. These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known re sidual benign tumors can remain). The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin 
of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between  response or stable 
disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
8.1.5 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 Page 56 of 77 8.1.6 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurement s should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks  before the beginning of the treatment. The same metho d of assessment 
and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical 
examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical 
exam.  
 8.1.6.1 Clinical Lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial  (e.g., skin nodules, 
palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is  recommended.  
 8.1.6.2 Chest X -ray/Ultrasound  
Ultrasounds  should not be used to measure lesions. Ultrasound is not useful i n assessment of 
lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used  instead of CT in selected instances.  Chest radiographs may be used as a 
method of measurement  in addition to MRI of the abdomen, if  the primary disease is not in the 
chest, and if  there is a concern abou t radiation exposure due to CT.  
 8.1.6.3 Conventiona l CT and MRI  
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the s lice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain 
situations (e.g., for body scans). Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, whic h greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. 
Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -
up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if 
possible . When both CT and liver MRI are used to evaluate liver disease, the MRI will serve as 
the imaging method to evaluate the size of the lesions within the liver; in this instance, the CT will b e used to measure the size of the lesions outside of the liver.

 Page 57 of 77 8.1.6.4 PET- CT 
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is not 
always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with co nventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 8.1.6.5 Endoscopy and Laparoscopy  
The uti lization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such 
techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 8.1.6.6 Tumor Markers  
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical r esponse.  
 8.1.7 Confirmation Measurement/Duration of Response  
8.1.7.1 Confirmation  
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat studies that should be performed no less than 4 weeks  after the criteria for r esponse are 
first met. In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval of no less than 6  weeks . 
 8.1.7.2 Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since t he treatment started). The duration of overall complete response is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  8.1.7.3 Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 8.1.8 Progression- Free Survival  
Progression- Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time 
of objective disease progression. This will be assessed as a secondary endpoint in the expansion cohort treated at the recommended phase  2 dose or MTD.  
 8.1.9 Response Re view

8.2 Translational Medicine Assessments  
This study will collect samples for translational medicine assessments in all enrolled  subjects . 
Sample types include whole blood, plasma, and tumor tissue. Most of the tumor samples are expected to be archival tissue. The sponsor or designee may retain anonymized leftover samples 
(eg, blood, tumor, DNA) for possible future analyses beyond the end of the study to elucidate 
further disease subtypes, drug response and toxicity, and possibly to identify new drug targets 
and additional biomarkers of response to study drug. Samples will be archived according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, EMEA’s Reflection Paper on Pharmacogenom ic 
Samples, Testing and Data Handling (EMEA 2007), and will not carry  personal identification 
(eg, Social Security number or name). The samples will be destroyed after 15 years  or earlier if 
requested by the subject unless already anonymized prior to the r equest.  
 8.2.1 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Unless prohibited by local regulations, blood samples will be collected and processed into plasma for all  subjects  for potential analyses of cabozantinib mechanism of action based 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers (eg, s MET, HGF, VEGF -A, PlGF, sVEGFR2, sKIT) as  well as 
disease specific markers. Additional exploratory studies may be performed to  characterize 
disease subtypes and potential biomarkers of response or resistance. Analyses may include but are not limited to qua ntification and genotyping of circulating  plasma DNA, evaluation of micro 
RNAs, and analyses of additional soluble markers. Pharmacodynamic plasma samples will be collected at the time points outlined in Study  Calendar ( Section  7.2).  
 8.2.2 Tumor Samples a nd Analyses  
Tumor sample requisition is required for enrollment . Any  subjects  diagnosed ≥7 years  prior to 
the date of screening with no additional tumor tissue collected in the last 7  years  are excluded 
from this requirement, but efforts should be made to obtain samples if possible. Archival tumor tissue slides (a minimum of 10 consecutive unstained sections of 4- 10 microns if available) or a 
tumor tissue paraffin block will be requisitioned for shipment to a central laboratory. In rare cases, frozen tissue may also be provided. Alternatively, a new biopsy may be obtained before the first dose of cabozantinib. Fine needle aspirates may also be acceptable and collection of tumor fluid samples (confirmed as malignant by a cytopathologist) may be considered on a 
case by  case basis. Tumor analyses may involve evaluation of the signaling pathways related to 
cabozantinib targets (eg, VEGFR, MET, KIT, RET) and include methods such as genotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or Immuno- histochemistry (IHC). Mutation and/or 
amplification status of disease -specific tumor -promoters or suppressors may also be determined 
to characterize the potential impact on response or resistance to cabozantinib (eg , HER2, EGFR, 
KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PTEN, PIK3CA, TP53, GNAQ, CDKN2A). Broader genome -wide copy 
number and mutation profiling may also be conducted. For paired tumor biopsies pharmacodynamic markers such as pMET/MET, pVEGFR2/VEGFR2, pERK/ERK, pAKT/AKT and pKIT/KIT may also be analyzed by IHC. In addition, samples f rom bone or other tissues 
may be used to analyze disease- specific markers . Exploratory analyses of potential biomarkers of 
cabozantinib activity (circulating angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers VEGF, PlGF, sVEGFR1, bFGF , IL-1β, IL -6, IL -8, and TNF -α and sVEGFR2 and SDF1α may  be performed

protocols in a previous study of bevacizumab in Mullerian carcinoma [22] . Blood- circulating 
cells may be enumerated in fresh samples usi ng a standard flow cytometry protocol. Due to 
funding, DFCI and MGH will not be collecting archival tissue.  
 
8.2.3 Circulating Biomarkers  
8.2.3.1 Plasma Biomarker Analysis  
Plasma samples may  be analyzed  for potential biomarkers using multiplexed enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (96- well plates, 4 -10 analytes) or single cytokine ELISA (for 
analytes unavailable in multiplex, e.g., collagen IV, SDF1α). Using these technology, we will be 
able to assess VEGF family members and their soluble recepto rs, and collagen IV, SDF1α, 
bFGF, sICAM -1, sVCAM -1, PDGF -C, PDGF -B, thrombospondin- 1, Ang1, Ang2, IL -1, IL -6, 
IL-8, and TNF -α. This broad array of proteins to be tested will permit complete evaluation of the 
most promising known angiogenic biomarkers.  
 8.2.4   P eripheral blood will be collected for CTC analysis only for patients being treated at  
Massachusetts General Hospital  using the Herringbone -Chip microfluidic platform, as
 described 
below. Samples will b e collected prior to starting on study, followed by Day 1 of cycles 2, 4, and 
6. CTC  analyses will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Haber . Two 10 mL samples of 
peripheral blood will be  collected into vacutainer tubes (Becton- Dickinson) containing the 
anticoagulant  EDTA. Samples will be proces sed through the HB -Chip within 6 hours of  
collection, according to previously established protocols . 
Briefly, a 5 mL aliquot of blood will be placed into an air -tight conical tube on a  rocker 
assembly, and approximately 4 mL of blood will be pneumatically driven through the HB -Chip 
at a flow rate of 1.5 -2.5 mL/hour. The HB -Chip will then be  flushed with 2.5 mL of phosphate -
buffered saline at 2.5 mL/hr to remove  nonspecifically bound cells. CTCs on the HB -Chip will 
be fixed, permeabilized,  and stained with a ntibodies. Captured CTCs will then be identified and 
enumerated using the automated detection system .

patients with lesions that are at least 2  cm in largest diameter before the first cycle and following 
the second  cycle of cabozantinib.  Functional CT will be performed on a 64 -slice multidetector 
row CT  scanner ( Volume  CT, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Data will be analyzed on a 
workstation (Advantage Windows, GE) using commercially available  CT perfusion 3.0 software, 
which implements a deconvolution approach to calculate regional blood flow, blood volume, and permeability -surface area (PS) product. Multiple, non- overlapping regions of interest (ROI) will 
be drawn over the tumor for each of four 10 mm slices (4  cm of volume) and blood perfusion 
values will be  obtained.  
 8.2.5 Pharmacogenetic Blood Sample  
Unless prohibited by local regulations, a blood sample (collected pre -dose on Week  1 Day  1) 
may be utilized for genotyping/single nucleotide polymorphism analysis to correlate genetic variation with safety and tolerability or with r esponse to cabozantinib. This may include a 
genome -wide analysis. The sponsor or designee may retain anonymized DNA samples for future 
pharmacogenetic analyses beyond the end of the study. The sample will be archived according to FDA regulations, EMEA’s Re flection Paper on Pharmacogenomic Samples, Testing and Data 
Handling (EMEA 2007), and will not carry personal identification (eg, Social Security number or name). The samples will be destroyed after 15  years  or earlier if requested by the subject 
unless al ready anonymized prior to the request.

9.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject who has 
been enrolled in a clinical study and who may have been given an investigational product, 
regardless of whether or not the event is assessed as related to the study treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associa ted with the use of an investigational product, regardless 
of whether or not the event is assessed as related to the investigational product. Pre -existing 
medical conditions that worsen during a study should be recorded as AEs.  
 
All untoward events that oc cur after informed consent through 30 days  after the last dose of 
study treatment are to be recorded by the investigational site. This requirement includes AEs from unscheduled as well as scheduled visits.  Assessment of the relationship of the AE to the s tudy treatment by the investigator is based on 
the following two definitions:  
• Not Related: A not -related AE is defined as an AE that is not associated with the study 
treatment and is attributable to another cause.  
• Related: A related AE is defined as an AE where a causal relationship between the event and the study treatment is a reasonable possibility. A reasonable causal relationship is meant to convey that there are facts (eg, evidence such as dechallenge/ rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to sugge st a causal relationship between the AE and study 
treatment.  
 Serious Adverse Events  
The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance with the International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic  E2A.  
 An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death. 
2. Is immediately life -threatening (ie,  in the opinion of the investigator, the AE places the 
subject at imme diate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death).  
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization.  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
5. Note: The term “disability” refers to events that result in a substantial disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life function.  
6. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
7. Is an important medical event (IME). Note: The ter m “important medical event” refers to an 
event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed under the definition of Serious Adverse Event. Examples of IMEs include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or develo pment of product dependency or product abuse.

• The investigator agrees to provide suppleme ntary information requested by the Exelixis 
Drug Safety personnel or designee.  
• Pregnancy, although not itself an SAE, should also be reported on an SAE form or 
pregnancy form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termi nation, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or 
congenital abnormalities.  
 Regulatory Reporting All serious unexpected adverse drug reactions (unexpected related SAEs) must be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  by the investigator as required by 21 CFR 312.32. 
• These reports are to be filed utilizing the Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form). 
 The final MedWatch Form must be submitted by the study site to Exelixis at the time of submission to the FDA to allow Exelixis time to cross -report to Exelixis’ IND. Email:

 Other Safety Considerations  
Laboratory Data  
All laboratory data required by this protocol and any other clinical investiga tions should be 
reviewed. Any abnormal value that leads to a change in subject management (eg,  dose reduction 
or delay or requirement for additional medication or monitoring) or that is considered to be of clinical significance by the investigator should b e reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate.  
 Pregnancy  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, she will be taken off study treatment and will be followed through the end of her pregnancy. Forms for reporting pregnancies will be provided to the study  sites upon request. The outcome of a pregnancy (for a subject or for the partner of a 
subject) and the medical condition of any resultant offspring must be reported to Exelixis or designee. Any birth defect or congenital anomaly must be reported as an SAE , and any other 
untoward events occurring during the pregnancy must be reported as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate.  
 Medication Errors/ Overdose  
Any study drug administration error or overdose that results in an AE, even if it does not meet the definition of s erious, requires reporting within 24 hours  to Exelixis or designee.

 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Study Design  
 12.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR) . ORR is defined using the 
RECIST criteria as the proportion of  subjects  with a confir med CR or confirmed PR. The point 
estimate of the ORR with a 90% confidence interval based on the exact binomial distribution will be presented . 
 12.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
12.1.2.1 Progression- free survival will be defined as the time from administration of the  initial 
dose of cabozantinib to evidence of radiographic progression as defined by  RECIST criteria or 
death from any cause without evidence of disease progression, whichever occurs first. Cases with incomplete follow up or without adequate disease  evaluations will be censored at date last 
documented to be progression free . Kaplan  Meier estimates of progression -free survival rates 
will be calculated along with their  corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Cox proportional 
hazards regression  modeling of PFS will be used to assess the effect of cabozantinib on 
progression- free survival while controlling for other confounders. Overall survival determined 
from the time of drug administration to time of death.  
 12.1.2.2 Overall survival will be defined as the time from administration of the initial dose o f 
cabozantinib until death from any cause.

 Page 71 of 77 12.1.2.3 Biologic correlative studies of target inhibition (see above)  
All tissue and circulating biomarkers will be correlated with clinica l outcome in collaborat ion 
with our statistician . For imaging, multiple, non -overl apping regions of interest (ROI will be 
drawn ove r the tumor for each of four 10 mm slices (4  cm of volume) and blood perfusion values 
will be obtained . Descriptive statistics will be provided for  all outcome measurements and 
goodness of fit tests (e.g. Chi -square, Kolmogorov Smirnov) will be conducted to assess the 
distribution of the changes in functional  imaging. As appropriate, we will use parametric (t -test) 
or nonparametric (Wilcoxon Rank -Sum)  tests to compare between the two groups of patients 
stratified by response and PFS status. To test the prognostic effect of changes in these parameters  
on OS and PFS, we will utilize the Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, comparison to 
RECIST ba sed measurement, tumor volume and tumor density will be  performed by using well 
established protocols in our department to evaluate the most sensitive image biomarker of monitoring response a nd predicting clinical outcome.  
 12.1.2.4 Tolerability and safety  analysis  
Preliminary Phase I data revealed excellent tolerability . For the safety analysis, all  enrolled 
patients who receive at least one dose of cabozantinib will have information collected on adverse events, which will be summarized  by dose, severity as assessed by the Common Toxicity Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v. 4.0 and relationship to Study Drug . 
 12.2 Rationale for Sample Size  
The data from recent phase  II clinical trials of agents targeting the VEGF or mTOR pathways has 
guided our trial design and sample size calculation . The Phase II trial of the VEGF inhibitor, 
bevacizumab in patients with carcinoid tumors revealed a response rate of 18% [4] . A Phase II 
trial of the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus in p atients with low grade neuroendocrine tumors 
demonstrated response rates of 20% [37] . Similarly, a phase II trial of sunitinib performed in 
neuroendocrine tumors demonstrated a response rate of 16.7% in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and 2.4% in patients with carcinoid tumors [3] . More recently, Phase III trials of both 
sunitinib and everolimus have been published in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, demonstrat ing lower overall response rates of 5% for everolimus (2% with placebo) and 9.3% 
for sunitinib (0% for placebo) [38, 39] . Notably, despite the low response rate observed with 
these targeted agents to date, 64% of patients receiving everolimus (versus 21% in placebo), and a large, but unreported percentage of patients receiving sunitinib demonstrated tumor shrinkage that did not meet partial response criteria .  
 Patients will be stratified depending upon whether they have a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor or carcinoid tumor . For both subgroups, we hypothesize that cabozantinib will have a true 
response rate of greater than or equal to 12%, while the null hypothesize posits that the response rate will be ≤2%. The 12 % response rate was selected on the basis of the response rate in the 
recent Phase III sunitinib trial in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, as well as the experience 
with multiple targeted agents in several phase  II trials in patients with carcinoid tumors and  
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. A sample size of 35 achieves >80% power to detect a difference of 10% using a one -sided binomial test, with type I error of 3% and the population 
proportion under the null hypothesis is 2%. Therefore, 3 or more responders  would be necessary 
to reject the null hypothesis.  For efficacy evaluation of the study, all treated patients will be 
included when calculating the response rate . Therefore the overall sample size is anticipated to 
8/21/2019  
 
CONFI DENTIAL

 Page 72 of 77 be approximately 35 subjects  for each tum or type, or 70 patients in total. Study patients will 
continue to be followed until progression or death, allowing us to capture all patients for this 
analysis . 
 Given the data above demonstrating tumor shrinkage and PFS benefit in patients treated with 
sunitinib or everolimus without impressive overall response rates, an overall response rate of 
2%-12% would still be consistent with cabozantinib having activity in neuroendocrine tumors . 
As such, progression- free survival will be examined as one of the seco ndary endpoints, and we 
have not included a two -phase design in this protocol . 
 
12.3 Reporting and Exclusions  
12.3.1 Evaluation of toxicity  
All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment. Participants not completing 2 cycles of therapy due to reasons unrelated to study drugs will not be evaluated for DLT, but will be replaced.  
 12.3.2 Evaluation of response  
All participants included in the study will be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations. Each participant will be assigned one of the following categories: 1 ) complete response, 2)  partial response, 3)  stable dise ase, 4)  progressive disease, 
5) early death from malignant disease, 6 ) early death from toxicity, 7 ) early  death because of 
other cause, or 9)  unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). By arbitrary convention, 
category  9 usually designates the "unknown" status of any type of data in a clinical database.  
 13. PUBLICATION PLAN  
The Principal Investigator (Prot ocol Chair) holds the primary responsibility for publication of the 
study results; provided that the PI will provide any such publication to Exelixis, Inc. for review at least sixty (60)  days  prior to submission and also comply withy any provisions regardi ng 
publication as are agreed to between the PI’s institution (eg, institution name.) and Exelixis, Inc. in the Clinical Trial Agreement related to this study. The results will be made public within 24 months  of the end of data collection. However, if a report is planned to be published in a peer -
reviewed journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. In any event, a full report of the outcomes should be made public  no later than three (3)  years  after the end of data collection. Authorship 
for abstracts and manuscripts resulting from this study will be determined according to guidelines established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.

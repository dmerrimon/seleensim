Version Date:January 24, 2018   4 -Analysis SummaryThe study design is a multicenter, phase I/II, open-label, non-randomized 
study.  Phase I will be a dose-escalation study to determine the MTD and 
the safety profile of the combination of temozolomide and pazopanib in 
patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.  
Pharmacokinetic sampling for  temozolomide and pazopanib will be 
performed in an additional 6 patients enrolled at the MTD.  The MTD 
will be the recommended Phase II dose.  Once the MTD is determined, 
the study will proceed to a single-arm, open-label phase II to evaluate 
efficacy endpoints.  Phase II analyses will include patients treated at the 
MTD in the PK cohort from phase I.  This protocol describes the phase 
I/II trial.  Data will be pooled from patients enrolled at all study sites.

Version Date:January 24, 2018   7 -1.0 INTRODUCTION  – BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.1 Pancreatic  Neuroendocrine Tumors:  Background and Standard Therapies
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), also known as pancreatic endocrine 
tumors or islet cell carcinomas, are rare malignancies with a reported annual 
incidence of 0.32 cases per 100,000 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER) Program registries.1  Advanced pancreatic NETs have a 
reputation for being more indolent than other pancreatic malignancies.  However, 
they can be aggressive and are most often diagnosed at an advanced stage (14% 
localized, 22% regional, and 64% distant).  Analyses from the SEER data from 
2000 to 2004 showed a median survival time of only 27 months among patients 
with advanced disease.2  Pancreatic NETs are sometimes divided into functioning 
and nonfunctioning tumors based on whether they cause clinical hormonal 
symptoms.  However, the functional status of these tumors may change over time 
or with treatment.  The introduction of somatostatin analogs has resulted in major 
advances in the management of hormonal syndromes from NETs and has recently 
been shown to prolong time to tumor progression in patients with advanced 
midgut NETs.3  
Pancreatic NETs are responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Streptozocin- based 
combination therapy has been an historical treatment standard for patients with 
advanced pancreatic NET.  In an early randomized trial, streptozocin 
plus doxorubicin had a combined biochemical and radiologic response rate of 
69% and a median survival of 2.2 years.4 A retrospective analysis of 84 patients 
with either locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic NETs treated with 
streptozocin, 5-FU, and doxorubicin reported a 39% objective radiographic 
response rate and a median survival duration of 37 months.5  The widespread 
adoption of streptozocin-based regimens has been limited by a relatively 
cumbersome administration schedule and by concerns about toxicity, including 
nausea, hair loss, and renal dysfunction.  More recently, novel approaches 
including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors 
(including bevacizumab6, sorafenib7, sunitinib8, and pazopanib9) have shown 
preliminary evidence of activity in pancreatic NETs. 
 
1.2 Temozolomide  in Pancreatic NETs
1.2.1 Clinical  activity in Pancreatic NETs
Temozolomide is a cytotoxic alkalyting agent that has been specifically 
developed as an oral and less toxic alternative to dacarbazine.10  
Temozolomide and dacarbazine have similar mechanisms of action:  both 
agents are metabolized to the active agent 5-(3-methyl-triazeno) 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   8 -imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), an inhibitor of nucleoside 
incorporation.
   Temozolomide is currently FDA approved for refractory 
anaplastic astrocytoma and newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma 
multiforme (GBM).
Both temozolomide and dacarbazine have demonstrated activity in 
treatment
 of metastatic pancreatic NETs.  The Eastern Oncology Group 
(ECOG) evaluated the efficacy of dacarbazine in a phase II study in 
patients with advanced pancreatic NETs and reported an ORR of 33% and 
a median overall survival (OS) of 19.3 months.11  A combination of 
dacarbazine, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide in patients with 
pheochromocytoma was reported to result in a biochemical responses but 
was also associated with significant toxicity.12-14  The potential toxicity of 
dacarbazine precludes its use in treatment for advanced pancreatic NET.  
The efficacy of temozolomide monotherapy was reported in a phase II 
trial in patients with advanced pancreatic NETs, only one of 12 (8%) 
patients with pancreatic NET had a PR, while SD lasting at least 4 weeks 
was noted in 8 (67%) patients.15    A phase II study of 30 patients with 
metastatic pancreatic NETs investigated the combination of capecitabine 
plus temozolomide and reported ORR 70%.  Among these patients, 21 
(70%) achieved a PR, 8 (27%) had SD, and 1 (3%) had disease 
progression.16  
                        
                        1.2.2 Safety  of temozolomide
In the phase II study of temozolomide monotherapy, toxicities were 
mainly hematologic, and dose reduction due to hematologic toxicity was 
necessary in 4 patients.  There were 2 patients with grade 3/4 fatigue.15  In 
the phase II study of temozolomide combined with capcitabine, Four 
patients (4%) experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events (fatigue n=1, 
elevated AST n=1, anemia n=1, thrombocytopenia n=1).16   
1.3 Role  of VEGF Pathway in Pancreatic NETs 
Neuroendocrine tumors are characterized by abundant vasculature and high levels 
of VEGF expression, and therefore are potentially susceptible to therapeutic 
strategies targeting pathways involved in angiogenesis.17 
                        
                        1.3.1 Preclinical  studies of VEGF inhibition in Pancreatic NETs
Overexpression of VEGF and its receptor subtypes has been observed in 
preclinical models in both carcinoid and pancreatic endocrine tumors.  
This suggests that autocrine activation of the VEGF pathway may promote 
tumor growth.17-19  Casanovas et al showed that inhibition of VEGFR with 
antibodies disrupted tumor growth in a mouse pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumor model, providing further support for this hypothesis.20

Version Date:January 24, 2018   9 -                       1.3.2 Clinical  experience with VEGF inhibition in Pancreatic NETs
Recently, agents targeting VEGF pathway have shown promising results 
in phase II/III clinical trials in patients with advanced pancreatic NET.  
Sunitinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the VEGF 
receptor has been evaluated in a phase II study in patients with advanced 
NET.  Among 66 pancreatic NET enrolled patients, the overall response 
rate (ORR) was 16.7%, 68% had stable disease (SD), and the median time 
to progression was 7.7 months.8  Sunitinib was subsequently evaluated in 
a phase III randomized trial of sunitinib versus placebo in patients with 
pancreatic NET.  The primary end point was progression-free survival 
(PFS).  The trial was stopped early at the recommendation of the data 
safety and monitoring board.  The median PFS was 11.4 months in the 
sunitinib arm versus 5.5 months in the placebo arm (p = 0.0001); ORR 
with sunitinib was 9.3% (2 complete and 6 partial responses).21  Another 
phase II study of 93 patients with advanced NET evaluated the efficacy of 
sorafenib, a potent small molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases 
including VEGFR 2, as well as FLT3, PDGFR, and fibroblast growth 
factor receptor-1 (FGFR1).  In a preliminary report, among the 43 
pancreatic NET patients enrolled, ORR was 11% with 32% exhibiting 
partial or minor response; the 6 month PFS was 60% .7  
 
1.4 Pazopanib  in Pancreatic NETs
1.4.1 Clinical  activity in Pancreatic NETs
Pazopanib is an oral, selective, small molecule inhibitor of the VEGFR-1, 
-2, and -3, PDGF-α,  PDGFR-β, and c-kit tyrosine kinases.  Pazopanib 
selectively inhibits VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation and is 
active in in vivo angiogenesis assays.22  In 2009, pazopanib was approved 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of 
patients with advanced RCC [Votrient PI, 2012]. In 2012, pazopanib was 
FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue 
sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy.  However, the efficacy of 
pazopanib for the treatment of patients with adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma 
or gastrointestinal stromal tumors has not been demonstrated [Votrient PI, 
2012].   This approval was based on a phase III randomized, double-blind 
trial in which 435 patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC were 
randomly assigned 2:1 to receive oral pazopanib or placebo.  The primary 
end point was PFS.  PFS was significantly prolonged with pazopanib 
compared with placebo in the overall study population (median PFS of 9.2 
versus 4.2 months with a hazard ratio of 0.46, 95% confidence interval of 
0.34 to 0.62 and p = 0.0001) and the ORR was 30% in the pazopanib 
group compared to 0% in placebo.23
  
In a phase II study, pazopanib was evaluated in two parallel cohorts of 
patients
 with carcinoid and pancreatic NET.  Pazopanib was administered 
at a dose of 800 mg p.o. daily in combination with octreotide LAR.  There

Version Date:January 24, 2018   10 -were no responses in the 20 carcinoid patients.  The study opened to a 
second stage of accrual for the pancreatic NET cohort only.  Of the 31 
evaluable pancreatic NET patients, there were 6 (19%) partial responses 
(PR), 5 (16%) minor responses (MR), and 21 (68%) SD; the 6-month PFS 
was 81%7.   A phase III trial evaluating pazopanib in patients with 
advanced pancreatic NET after progression from everolimus is currently 
underway.24 
1.4.2 Safety  of pazopanib
In the hallmark article leading to the approval of pazopanib in the 
treatment
 of metastatic RCC, the most common grade 3/4 adverse events 
(AEs) in the pazopanib arm were hypertension (4%) and diarrhea (4%).  
Arterial thrombotic events occurred in 3% of pazopanib-treated patients 
[myocardial infarction/ischemia (2%), cerebrovascular accident (1%), and 
transient ischemic attack (1%)] compared with none in the placebo arm. 
The incidence of hemorrhagic events (all grades) in the pazopanib arm 
was 13% compared with 5% in the placebo arm.23  In the study of 
pazopanib in patients with neuroendocrine tumors, Grade 3/4 toxicities 
were relatively rare and included: anemia (n=1), neutropenia (n=3), 
hypertriglyceridemia (n=2), transaminitis (n=3), fatigue (n=3), 
hypertension (n=6), nausea (n=1), diarrhea (n=3), pain (n=1), rash (n=1), 
syncope (n=1), and confusion (n=1).9

1.5 Rationale  for Current Study:  Combination of Temozolomide and Pazopanib
1.5.1 Preclinical evidence of temozolomide in combination with anti-
angiogenesis therapy
As seen in the above data, there is evidence to support the use of both anti-
angiogenesis therapy as well as cytotoxic therapy.  There is preclinical 
data to support that the combination of the two is promising.  Fisher and 
colleagues reported that 14 target genes of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-
1), were found to be up-regulated after temozolomide treatment to GBM 
cell lines, including VEGF.25  Sandström and colleagues reported ZD6474, 
a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-2, was evaluated in combination with either 
radiotherapy or temozolomide in an orthotopic glioma model; combination 
with temozolomide decreased tumor area by 74%.  Morphologically, these 
tumors had a much lower cellular density and they found that the 
proliferation index was decreased in tumors treated with ZD6474.26  Zhou 
and colleagues evaluated the combination of sunitinib with temozolomide 
in an orthotopic human glioma mouse model to investigate how sunitinib 
at different dose levels affects brain distribution of temozolomide.  In this 
study, they found that the effect of sunitinib on the brain tumor 
distribution of temozolomide was dose dependent.  Optimal tumor

ratio of functioning vessels to normal vessels.  This research suggests that 
antiangiogenic therapy with sunitinib at an appropriate dose can positively 
alter the vasculature to improve penetration of temozolomide into the 
tumor.27  The results of these preclinical studies justify further 
investigation using combination therapy. 
1.5.2 Clinical  evidence for temozolomide combination with anti-aniogenesis 
therapy
This preclinical data has translated into clinical success with the 
combination
 of temozolomide and anti-angiogenesis therapy.  
Thalidomide  is postulated to have anti-angiogenesis activity through its 
ability to interfere with VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 
pathways.28   A phase II study evaluated the combination of temozolomide 
and thalidomide in 29 patients with metastatic NET.  The results 
demonstrated an ORR of 45% in pancreatic NET versus only 7% in 
metastatic carcinoid; the median duration of response of 13.5 months and 
1 year survival was 79%.29  Another phase II study investigated the 
combination of temozolomide and bevacizumab in patients with advanced 
NET.  In a preliminary report, among 17 enrolled pancreatic NET patients, 
there were 4 (24%) PR, and 12 (70%) SD.30  
The combination of temozolomide with full dose anti-angiogenesis 
therapy
 has been successfully administered in multiple phase II trials.  In a 
phase II trial of temozolomide and sorafenib in advanced melanoma 
patients, standard dosing of temozolomide (150mg/m2 daily for 5 of every 
28 days) was given with sorafenib 400 mg orally twice per day.31
1.5.3 Safety of temozolomide combination with anti-antiogenesis therapy
In the phase II study of temozolomide and thalidomide, a total of 16 (55%) 
patients discontinued treatment because of treatment related toxicity.  
Neuropathy, a known toxicity of thalidomide, developed in 11 patients 
(38%).  Grade 2 or 3 thrombocytopenia occured in 4 patients (14%), 
resulting in treatment discontinuation.  Other toxicity resulting in study 
discontinuation included rash (n=1), neutropenia (n=1), and infection 
(n=4).  A total of 11 patients developed infections while receiving study 
treatment, including 3 opportunistic infections (1 case of Pnemocystis 
carinii pneumonia, 1 case of disseminated varicella zoster virus, and 1 
case of cutaneous herpes zoster).  Of these 3 patients, all had received 
more than 6 months of therapy and developed grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia; 
the study treatment did not include prophylactic antibiotics.29  
In the phase II study combining temozolomide and bevacizumab, grade 
3/4 toxicities included:  lymphopenia (n=21, 62%), leukopenia (n=2, 6%), 
thrombocytopenia (n=7, 21%), neutropenia (n=2, 6%), hyponatremia 
(n=1, 3%), vomiting (n=3, 9%), nausea (n=2, 6%), dehydration (n=1, 3%), 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   12 -fatigue (n=2, 6%), constipation (n=1, 3%), and hypertension (n=1, 3%).  
Due to anticipated lymphopenia, patients received prophylaxis with 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1 DS tablet every MWF) and acyclovir 
(400 mg p.o. TID).30  
In the phase I portion of another study (a phase I/II combining 
temozolomide and everolimus in metastatic pancreatic NET) 1 patient 
experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) consisting of grade 4 
thrombocytopenia, and the cohort was expanded to 6 patients with no 
further observed DLTs.  A total of 24 patients were enrolled at the time of 
the analysis and the most common observed grade 3 or 4 toxicities were 
anticipated hematologic effects and included thrombocytopenia (n = 4), 
lymphopenia (n = 5), and neutropenia (n = 2).  Grade 3 or 4 non-
hematologic toxicities included hyperglycemia (n = 1), elevated 
transaminases (n = 1), elevated triglycerides (n = 1) and rash (n = 1).32 
The phase II study combining temozolomide with full-dose sorafenib was 
generally well tolerated, with grade 3/4 toxicity including lymphopenia 
(15%), hypertension (13%), hand-foot syndrome (13%), and fatigue 
(13%).31 A phase II study of sorafenib and temozolomide in patients with 
recurrent glioblastoma showed similar tolerability of full dose anti-
angiogenic therapy.  In this study, sorafenib 400 mg p.o. twice daily was 
given with continuous daily temozolomide 50mg/m2/day, and these doses 
were well tolerated with the most common grade 3 toxicities including an 
increase in amylase/lipase (13%), erythrodysesthesia (19%), and 
hypophosphatemia (9%).  Only 3 patients ultimately required any dose 
modification of sorafenib to 400 mg p.o. daily.33 
1.5.4 Rationale  for current study design
Given the overexpression and activation of the VEGF pathway in 
pancreatic
 NET, and the established activity of temozolomide in PNET, 
we believe that the combination of temzolomide with a molecular-targeted 
therapy offers potential for additive or synergistic inhibition of shared 
targets.  We have chosen pazopanib as the anti-angiogenic agent for this 
trial, given the promising phase II data from Phan et al demonstrating both 
partial responses and stabilization of disease with pazopanib as 
monotherapy9.  We propose to conduct a phase I/II clinical trial of the 
combination of temozolomide and pazopanib in patients with advanced 
PNETs.  Phase I of the study will be an open-label dose escalation trial to 
determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of the 
combination in this population.  The MTD will be the recommended Phase 
II dose.  Once the MTD is determined, that cohort will be expanded to 6 
additional patients to establish the pharmacokinetics (PK).The study will 
then proceed to a single-arm, open-label phase II trial to evaluate efficacy 
endpoints.    The phase II analyses will include the 6 patients treated at 
MTD for a PK cohort who will have MGMT expression and function CT

Section 5 for a detailed description of the study design for both phases. 
Our hypothesis for this study is that the combination of temozolomide and 
pazopanib is safe and may be effective in patients with advanced PNET.  
This is backed by clinical and preclinical evidence as outlined above.
(Note: The MTD has now been identified at dose level -2 (75 mg/m2 per 
day p.o. days 1-7 and 15-21 of Temozolomide and 400 mg per day p.o. 
days 1-28 of Pazopanib.  As of12.15.15, all patients moving forward will 
be treated at this dose. ) 
1.5.5 Rationale  for current study treatment doses
In the above phase II studies, studies, temozolomide was administered 
orally at 150 mg/m2 daily for 7 consecutive days every other week.30  The 
phase I/ II study of  the combination of everolimus and  temozolomide in 
metastatic PNET patients used a similar dose and schedule of 
temozolomide administration.32  Given that the activity and safety of this 
regimen has been rigorously evaluated in previous studies in PNET (as 
outlined above) we propose to use a similar dosage and schedule for 
temozolomide in our phase I/II trial of the combination of temozolomide 
and pazopanib.  The starting dose for the first cohort of the phase I portion 
will be temozolomide 150 mg/m2 orally on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each 
cycle (1 cycle = 28 days).      
The starting dose of pazopanib in our study is 400 mg orally on a daily 
basis throughout each cycle.  The rationale for this starting dose is based 
on the known metabolism of both of these drugs and the low likelihood of 
interactions.   Pazopanib metabolism is primary mediated by CYP3A4.  In 
contrast, the cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a minor role in 
metabolism of temozolomide or its metabolites, and therefore should not 
affect the metabolism of the pazopanib.  
1.5.6    Phase 1 summary: 
Eighteen patients have been treated with the Combination of 
Temozolomide and Pazopanib in the phase I portion of this trial. As per 
study design, once the MTD is determined, that cohort will be expanded to 
6 additional patients to establish the pharmacokinetics (PK).  MTD has 
now been identified at dose level -2 (75 mg/m2 per day p.o. days 1-7 and 
15-21 of Temozolomide and 400 mg per day p.o. days 1-28 of Pazopanib). 
Hence, all patients moving forward will be treated at this dose. (i.e. as of 
12.15.15)

Version Date:January 24, 2018   14 -1.6 Background and Rationale for Correlative Studies      
     1.6.1    O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) Expression
In this study we will examine the predicitive role of MGMT expression in 
pancreatic NET to temozolomide therapy.  O6-methylguanine DNA 
methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme believed to induce 
cancer cell resistance to O6-alkylating agents such as temozolomide.  
Inactivation of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation is associated 
with longer survival in patients with GBM treated with temozolomide.37, 38 
Low MGMT expression, detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
correlates with response to temozolomide treatment in low-grade 
oligodendroglioma, and MGMT immunostaining has been suggested as a 
marker for predicting tumor chemosensitivity.39 MGMT promoter 
hypermethylation has been described in small groups of NET including 
pancreatic NET and carcinoid.40   Ekeblad et al examined the role of 
MGMT expression in 27 patients with a variety of NET (12 PNET) treated 
with temozolomide monotherapy.  They found a low percentage of 
MGMT-positive tumor cell nuclei in 43% of tumors.  Four out of five 
patients with a radiologic response had tumors with low MGMT 
expressions.  This suggests a possible predictive value of MGMT IHC in 
NET and needs to be further investigated.15

3.0 PATIENT  SELECTION AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
3.1 Population and Accrual Overview
The target population for this phase I/II trial is patients with advanced, 
unresectable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) with adequate 
performance status and organ function.  This will be a multicenter trial with the 
lead site being the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of 
Northwestern University.  Participating sites will include the University of 
Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, 
University of Washington and Fox Chase Cancer Center.  Patients from 
Northwestern University will be recruited from the Hematology-Oncology 
outpatient clinic of the Northwestern Medical Group. Patients may be referred to 
the Principal Investigator, Dr.Sheetal Kircher, at 312-695-0990.  Patients from the 
University of Michigan will be recruited from Hematology-Oncology outpatient 
clinic of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and may be 
referred to Dr. Mark Zalupski at 734-615-3969.  Patients from Vanderbilt 
University will be recruited from the Hematology-Oncology outpatient clinic and 
may be referred to Dr. Jordan Berlin at 615-936-8422.  Patients from Fox Chase 
will be recruited from the Hematology-Oncology outpatient clinic and may be 
referred to Dr. Crystal Denlinger at 215-214-1676.  Patients from University of 
Washington will be recruited from the Hematology-Oncology outpatient clinic 
and may be referred to Dr. E. Gabriela Chiorean at (206) 288-6248.
We anticipate an accrual rate of approximately 3 patients per month combined 
between
 the 5 study sites.  Based upon this rate of accrual and a DLT window of 
28 days, we anticipate completion of the phase I portion of this study in 6 to 14 
months, depending upon determination of the MTD.  Assuming a similar rate of 
accrual, we anticipate completion of stage I of the phase II portion in an 
additional 7 months.  If the study proceeds to stage II of the phase II, we 
anticipate completion of accrual within an additional 8 months, with assessment 
of the primary endpoint after 6 additional months (14 months total).  Accrual to 
both phases of the study and assessment of the primary endpoint for the phase II 
portion is estimated to be completed within approximately 3-4 years.

5.0 TREATMENT  PLAN
5.1 Overview
This will be a phase I/II multicenter trial of the combination of temozolomide and 
pazopanib in patients with advanced PNETs.  The phase I portion will employ a 
standard 3+3 dose escalation schema.  The starting dose of temozolomide for 
cohort 1 will be 150 mg/m2 per day on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each 28-day cycle.  
The starting dose for cohort 1 of pazopanib will be 400 mg per day, taken 
continuously throughout each cycle.  Patients will be assessed for DLT during the 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   21 -first 28-day cycle.  The frequency of DLTs observed in each cohort will 
determine whether and how the doses are adjusted (either up or down) in the next 
cohort.  Dose escalation rules and definitions are outlined below.  Once the MTD 
has been determined, that will be the recommended dose for the phase II portion 
of the trial.  In the phase I portion of the trial, once the MTD is reached, the 
cohort will be expanded to an additional 6 additional patients to perform PK 
studies. MTD has now been identified at dose level -2 (75 mg/m2 per day p.o. 
days 1-7 and 15-21 of Temozolomide and 400 mg per day p.o. days 1-28 of 
Pazopanib).  The phase II portion will be a Simon 2-stage design, with anywhere 
from 11 to 27 patients being enrolled to the phase II portion.  The 6 patients in the 
PK cohort treated at MTD in the phase I portion will be included in the phase II 
analysis.  
5.2 Study  Drug Administration
Both study drugs will be orally self-administered.  Patients will be provided a 
drug diary to record the date and time of each dose of temozolomide and 
pazopanib, as well as any skipped doses or doses intentionally held per the 
treating physician’s instructions. The study team will instruct patients on 
completing the diary, and will collect the completed diaries for the previous cycle 
on Day 1 of the subsequent cycle. 
5.2.1 Temozolomide
Patients will be instructed to take temozolomide orally once a day starting 
on Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment.  The dose of temozolomide will depend on 
the phase and cohort onto which the patient is enrolled (refer to Section 
5.3 for dose escalation rules).  For phase I, the starting dose of 
temozolomide will be 150 mg/m2 per day.  Patients will continue 
temozolomide for 7 consecutive days at a time, every other week (Days 1-
7 and 15-21 of the cycle).  One cycle equals 28 days.  Patients will 
continue to take temozolomide every other week until study 
discontinuation (refer to Section 5.8 for duration of treatment and 
discontinuation rules).
Temozolomide tablets will be swallowed whole.  Patients will be 
instructed to fast at least 1 hour before and 1 hour after administration of 
temozolomide.  Water is allowed during the fasting period.  
Temozolomide may be taken before or after pazopanib (on days when 
both drugs are taken), but it is recommended that they be taken around the 
same time.  If a dose is missed, the patient should take the dose as soon as 
possible, but only if there are 12 or more hours remaining before the next 
dose is due.  If the next dose is due in less than 12 hours, the subject 
should skip the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled.
If vomiting  occurs after taking temozolomide, the patient should not take a 
replacement dose on that day.  The patient should resume taking 
temozolomide at the next scheduled dose on the following day.

Version Date:January 24, 2018   22 -(Note:  For patients in the PK  cohort, please refer to the Study Parameters 
Table for PK Cohort for information regarding temozolomide doses on 
Cycle 1, Days 1-3.)
 
5.2.2 Pazopanib
Patients will be instructed to take pazopanib orally once a day starting on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 of study treatment.  The dose of pazopanib will depend on 
the phase and cohort onto which the patient is enrolled (refer to Section 
5.3 for dose escalation rules).  For phase I, the starting dose of pazopanib 
will be 400 mg per day.  Pazopanib will be taken daily continuously study 
discontinuation (refer to Section 5.8 for duration of treatment and 
discontinuation rules).
Pazopanib should be taken orally without food at least 1 hour before or 2 
hours after a meal.  The tablets should be swallowed whole and must not 
be crushed or broken.  The time of day the tablets are taken should be 
relatively constant.  Pazopanib may be taken before or after temozolomide 
(on days when both drugs are taken), but it is recommended that they be 
taken around the same time.  If a dose is missed, the patient should take 
the dose as soon as possible, but only if there are 12 or more hours 
remaining before the next dose is due.  If the next dose is due in less than 
12 hours, the subject should skip the missed dose and take the next dose as 
scheduled.
If vomiting  occurs after taking pazopanib, the patient should not take a 
replacement dose on that day.  The patient should resume taking 
pazopanib at the next scheduled dose on the following day.  If vomiting 
persists, the patient should be instructed to notify the investigator.  
(Note:  For patients in the PK  cohort, please refer to the Study Parameters 
Table for PK Cohort for information regarding pazopanib doses on Cycle 
1, Days 1-3.)
5.3 Phase  I Dose Escalation
5.3.1 Dose escalation schema
For cohort Level 1, starting doses will be temozolomide 150 mg/m2 per

and approval.
5.3.2 Dose  escalation rules
If a  DLT is encountered, the following rules in the table below will be 
applied (refer to Section 5.4.2 for definitions of DLT).  All patients on a 
given cohort must complete at least 28 days of treatment, and toxicity data 
must be available for review in order to determine whether accrual should 
proceed to the next cohort.  All toxicity data will be reviewed and dose 
level changes approved by the DMC prior to enrolling patients to 
subsequent cohorts.

treated at this dose. ) 
5.4 Dose Limiting Toxicity
5.4.1 DLT  evaluation
Toxicities will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  A DLT will be 
defined as any of the following events (described below in 5.4.2), which 
are attributable to protocol treatment, occurring during the DLT window.  
The DLT window is defined as the first 28 days of therapy (or completion 
of 1 cycle of therapy).  Any exclusions from these are described in 5.4.3.
5.4.2 DLT  definitions
DLT will be defined as the occurrence of any of the following felt to be 
related to study treatment during Cycle 1:
5.4.2.1 Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (see exceptions below 
in 5.4.3).
5.4.2.2 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia.
5.4.2.3 Grade 4 neutropenia or Grade 3 febrile neutropenia associated with 
temperature > 38°C.
5.4.2.4 Inability to complete Cycle 1 due to toxicity related to study drug.
5.4.2.5 Delay  in administration of scheduled doses of study drug greater 
than 2 weeks due to drug related toxicity of any grade.
5.4.3 DLT  exclusions

5.4.3.2 Lymphopenia  not associated with active infection or clinical 
disease will NOT be considered a DLT. 
5.4.3.3 Any  grade non-hematologic toxicity will NOT be considered a 
DLT unless continued despite maximum supportive care beyond 
the 2 week delay allowed in section 5.4.2.5.  (see 5.5.8).
5.4.3.4 Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity will be considered a 
DLT EXCEPT in cases where the event existed at baseline.  In 
these cases, toxicity needs to increase in severity by 2 grades per 
CTCAE v. 4.03 before it is considered a DLT.  
5.4.4 DLT  Terminology Clarifications
5.4.4.1 Unless  otherwise noted, “clinically relevant” is defined as placing 
the patient at risk for other toxicity by the judgment of the treating 
investigator.   
5.4.4.2 “Optimal  supportive care” is defined as standard of care measures 
that the treating physician deems appropriate and sustainable over 
multiple cycles of therapy.  Specific supportive care guidelines are 
given below in 5.5.  This definition relies upon the clinical 
judgment of the treating investigator.  This may include (but is not 
limited to) the following: 
5.4.4.2.1 Intravenous fluid hydration for dehydration
5.4.4.2.2 Electrolyte  supplementation for low electrolytes
5.4.4.2.3 Loperamide  for diarrhea
5.4.4.2.4 Antiemetics  for nausea
5.4.4.2.5 Skin care for rash
5.4.4.2.6 Printed  information as used in standard clinical care)  
5.5 Supportive  Care Guidelines
Supportive medications to alleviate or mitigate adverse effects of protocol therapy 
may include the following agents at the discretion of the treating investigator and 
according to institutional standards of care.  
5.5.1 Antidiarrheal  Agents  
Patients should be instructed to begin loperamide at the earliest signs of a 
poorly formed or loose stool.  Oral loperamide should be prescribed in the 
following manner: 4 mg at first onset of diarrhea then 2 mg 
every 2 hours until diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours up to 16 mg daily.
5.5.2 Antiemetic  Agents
Drugs such as lorazepam, prochlorperazine, or serotonin antagonists may 
be used if clinically indicated.
5.5.3 Antihistamines
An antihistamine such as diphenhydramine may be used to manage 
dermatitis associated with therapy at the discretion of the treating 
physician. 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   26 -5.5.4 Anti-diabetic  Agents
For patients who develop clinically significant hyperglycemia on study 
protocol, anti-diabetic therapy and dietary modification are required.  The 
oral anti-diabetic agents, glyburide or metformin, may be instituted at the 
discretion of the treating physician, assuming no contraindication.  
Insulin may be instituted at the discretion of the treating physician to 
optimize glycemic control.  Management of complications of 
hyperglycemia should be performed by treating physician according to 
institutional standard practices.  All patients who develop clinically 
significant hyperglycemia on study protocol must receive diabetic 
teaching and education materials.   
 (Note:  Metformin must be temporarily discontinued for ≥ 48 hours before 
and after iodinated contrast imaging, with confirmation of stable renal 
function prior to resuming this agent after contrast exposure.)  
5.5.5 Antihyperlipidemic  Agents
Patients who develop serum cholesterol > 350 mg/dL and/or triglycerides 
>
 300 mg/dL while on therapy will require medication (assuming no 
contraindications and with standard precautions as appropriate for the 
class of agents chosen) and/or dietary modifications at the discretion of the 
treating investigator. 
Concomitant use  of pazopanib and simvastatin (Zocor) increases the risk 
of ALT elevations and should be undertaken with caution and close 
monitoring.  If a subject receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT 
elevations, follow the Guidelines for Management of Treatment Emergent 
Hepatotoxicity and discontinue simvastatin.  Insufficient data are available 
to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and 
pazopanib. 
Pravastatin or rosuvastatin is recommended if LDL and/or total cholesterol 
are elevated, with or without elevated triglycerides, because these agents 
are not CYP 3A4 substrates.  Atorvastatin may also be used with caution.  
If tryglycerides alone are elevated, fenofibrate may be considered.    
 
5.5.6 Antihypertensive  Agents  
Patients who develop blood pressures ≥ 140/90 mm Hg on at least 2 
occasions should be managed with oral antihypertensives including 
amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, or metoprolol by their treating 
physician. 
5.5.7 Diuretics
Diuretics such as furosemide may be used for the management of 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.

physician.  Severe episodes of edema, such as congestive heart failure, 
pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion, or pulmonary edema may 
require additional measures such as percutaneous drainage or 
hospitalization.  
5.5.8 Electrolyte  Supplementation  
Electrolytes should be repleted according to standard institutional 
protocols.   
5.5.9 Growth  Factors
Erythropoietin or darbopoietin are permitted at the discretion of the 
treating
 physician.  Filgrastim and PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta) should not 
be used in place of protocol-specified dose reductions or delays for 
myelosuppression, nor should they be used prophylactically because of 
concern for myelosuppression from a prior cycle of chemotherapy.  
For treatment of febrile neutropenia, the use of colony-stimulating factors 
should not be routinely instituted as an adjunct to appropriate antibiotic 
therapy.  The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors may be 
indicated, however, in subjects who have prognostic factors that are 
predictive of clinical deterioration such as pneumonia, hypotension, multi-
organ dysfunction, sepsis syndrome, or fungal infection.  Investigators 
should use discretion in initiating colony-stimulating factors in these 
settings. 
 
5.5.10 Topical  Agents
Topical steroid creams may be used to manage pruritic skin toxicity at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  Non-alcohol-based topical emollients 
such as Aquaphor may be used for hand-foot syndrome or desquamating 
rashes.  Non-alcohol-based moisturizers may be used for dry skin. 
5.5.11 Anti-viral  Agents
It is recommended that patients be treated with prophylactic Valtrex 
(valacyclovir hydrochloride) 500 mg daily, however final decisions 
regarding this will be up to treating physician discretion.
5.6 Concomitant  Medications
Concomitant medications  are any prescription medications or over-the-counter 
preparations used by the patient within 28 days of initiating study treatment, 
during study treatment, and up to 28 days following study termination.  
All patients will receive prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole double 
strength (sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg) by mouth 3 times a 
week.  If a patient is allergic to this antibiotic it can be substituted per physician 
recommendation.  The details of all concurrent medications including vitamins

(eCRFs).   
All medications must be reviewed for potential interaction with study drug 
therapy.  All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as supportive 
interventions (such as analgesic use, paracentesis, etc.) received by patients from 
screening until the end of study visit will also be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRFs. 
Concomitant use  of pazopanib and simvastatin (Zocor) increases the risk of ALT 
elevations and should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring.  If a 
subject receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT elevations, follow the 
Guidelines for Management of Treatment Emergent Hepatotoxicity and 
discontinue simvastatin.  Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of 
concomitant administration of alternative statins and pazopanib (see section 8.2.8 
and Appendix II).
Concomitant use of any of the following is PROHIBITED while on this study:
5.6.1 Subjects  may not receive other anti-cancer therapy [cytotoxic, biologic, 
radiation, or hormonal (other than leuprolide or other GnRH agonists)] 
while on treatment in this study.
5.6.2 Medications  that inhibit CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma 
pazopanib concentrations; therefore, co-administration of strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors is PROHIBITED beginning 28 days prior to the first dose of 
study drug until discontinuation from the study.  Strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors include (but are not limited to):
5.6.2.1 Antibiotics:  clarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin
5.6.2.2 HIV: protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, 
nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir)
5.6.2.3 Antifungals:   itraconzaole, ketoconazole, voriconazole
5.6.2.4 Antidepressants:   nefazodone.
Please refer to Appendix II for a more complete listing of these agents.  Those 
who have taken medications that are known strong inducers or inhibitors of 
CYP3A4 within 28 days before registration will be excluded from the study.   
Please refer to Section 8 for details regarding drug interactions for temozolomide 
and pazopanib.
5.7 Toxicity  Management and Dose Modifications
5.7.1 Assessing  toxicity
Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03.  
Toxicity will be formally assessed at scheduled clinic follow up 
appointments every one to two weeks, as well as by investigator review of 
weekly laboratory testing; in the interim, toxicity may be assessed via 
patient contact with the study coordinator and/or clinical staff should new 
symptoms arise between visits.

NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   29 -5.7.2 Treatment rules for toxicity for phase I AFTER the DLT period
Protocol therapy will be delayed, dose-reduced, or discontinued based 
upon the most severe toxicity encountered in the previous cycle and/or 
laboratory parameters on the scheduled day of treatment.  For treatment-
related delays in protocol therapy, the longest permitted interval of 
treatment interruption is 28 days to remain on study.  For non-treatment-
related delays, the maximum permitted interval is 8 weeks to remain on 
study.  General principles of toxicity management are as follows:
5.7.2.1 Temozolomide  and pazopanib will be dose-adjusted according to 
attribution of toxicity.  In equivocal cases, the decision may be 
made by treating investigator with approval from the DMC.
5.7.2.2 Individual dose modifications will be made according to the 
system showing greatest degree of toxicity using NCI CTCAE 
version 4.03. 
5.7.2.3 Asymptomatic  changes in laboratory values require dose 
modification only if assessed to be treatment-related, clinically 
relevant,
 and represent a change of ≥ 2 grades from baseline. 
5.7.2.4 If  toxicity occurs, supportive care medications should be applied to 
ameliorate signs and symptoms (refer to Section 5.5) before 
toxicity grade is determined. 
5.7.2.5 A  patient will be removed from protocol therapy if either of the 
two study drugs is discontinued.  
5.7.2.5.1 Temozolomide  will be discontinued if it is not tolerated 
at a dose of 50 mg/m2 daily.
5.7.2.5.2 Pazopanib  will be discontinued if it is not tolerated at a 
dose of 200 mg daily.
5.7.2.6 A  patient will be removed from protocol therapy if treatment with 
either of the two study drugs is held for toxicity for longer than 28 
days (1 cycle).
5.7.2.7 Once  a dose has been reduced for toxicity, it should not be re-
escalated. 
5.7.2.8 In obese patients, all dosing is to be determined by the patient’s 
actual body weight.  
5.7.2.9 If  there is more than one indication for dose modification, use the 
more strict dose modification (i.e. modify according to the most 
severe toxicity). 
5.7.3 Patient  dose level adjustments for toxicity in Phase II
For patients enrolled in the phase II portion, the following adjustments 
should be made in the appropriate drug (depending on attribution of 
toxicity) based upon the patient’s starting dose and the guidelines below in 
Section 5.7.4.  As stated above, if either study drug is discontinued, a 
patient will be removed from study.

5.7.4 Dose modifications for toxicity
Held doses of either drug will be considered as omitted.  For example, if 
pazopanib is held for one week starting cycle 2 day 8, the next dose of 
temozolomide the following week will still be considered cycle 2, day 15 
(rather than delaying the cycle and repeating the day 8 dose).

5.7.4.5 For  any toxicity (regardless of grade), despite optimal supportive 
care, that is felt by the treating investigator to represent a risk to 
the patient’s safety, additional dose reduction, treatment delay, or 
treatment discontinuation is permitted at the discretion of the 
treating investigator with approval from the Principal Investigator 
and DMC. 
5.8 Duration  of Therapy
Patients will receive 2 cycles of protocol therapy prior to radiographic assessment 
for response or progression.  Patients with clinical signs or symptoms of rapid 
disease progression prior to completing 2 cycles of protocol therapy may be 
removed from the study by the treating physician.  Patients without disease 
progression at the time of response assessment will continue on the study, with 
repeat assessments after every 2 cycles (8 weeks +/- 7 days) until one of the 
criteria for treatment discontinuation is met. It is recommended that 
temozolomide treatment be discontinued after 1 year, due to risk of 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) . Patients can continue on Pazopanib.  If 
patient is receiving benefit from combination treatment after one year, it is up to 
the treating physician’s discretion whether or not the patient continues 
Temozolomide.
5.8.1 Criteria  for discontinuing study treatment
When a patient is discontinued from treatment, the reason(s) for 
discontinuation will be documented on the appropriate eCRFs.  Individual 
patients will continue on study therapy until any of the following occurs:
5.8.1.1 Unacceptable  toxicity despite optimal supportive care and dose 
modifications (refer to Sections 5.6 and 5.7),
5.8.1.2 Disease  progression by RECIST (version 1.1),
5.8.1.3 The  patient or his/her legally authorized representative requests to 
discontinue protocol therapy or withdraws consent.
5.8.1.4 The  decision is made by the treating physician to discontinue 
treatment due to one of the following:
5.8.1.4.1 Patient non-compliance or lack of follow-up.
5.8.1.4.2 Patient requires exclusionary concurrent treatment.
5.8.1.4.3 Physician assessment that continuation of protocol 
   therapy would be detrimental to the patient.

 for toxicities deemed by the treating investigator as 
unacceptable.  These toxicities include but are not limited to: 
5.8.2.2 Recurrent grade 3 or any grade 4 hemorrhage.
5.8.2.3 Gastrointestinal perforation requiring medical or surgical therapy.
5.8.2.4 Wound  dehiscence requiring medical or surgical therapy.
5.8.2.5 Grade 4 hypertension despite optimal medical management
5.8.2.6 Grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction to either study drug, or Grade 3 
reaction that recurs despite optimal supportive care.
5.8.2.7 Any  Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is deemed serious and/or life-
threatening by the treating investigator after review with the 
Principal Investigator.
5.8.2.8 Any  irreversible (lasting ≥ 2 weeks despite optimal supportive 
care) Grade 3 or 4 toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, 
asymptomatic Grade 3 hypophosphatemia or Grade 3 
hyponatremia, anemia, lymphopenia, or fatigue)
5.8.2.9 Any  toxicity requiring treatment delay for > 28 days or 
discontinuation of either study drug.
5.9 Follow-Up
After treatment discontinuation, patients will be followed every 6 months for 1 
year in clinic and/or via phone for survival follow-up.  The study will end 30 days 
after the last patient discontinues therapy and completes the protocol-defined 
follow-up period.
  
6.0 ENDPOINT  ASSESSMENT
6.1 Phase  I
6.1.1 Primary  Endpoint
The primary objective for the phase I portion of this trial will be to 
determine the MTD of temozolomide and pazopanib combination in 
patients with advanced PNET.  The primary endpoint will be toxicity, as 
assessed after 28 days of treatment (or completion of 1 cycle of therapy).  
Toxicity will be assessed at scheduled clinic follow up appointments every 
one to two weeks, as well as by investigator review of weekly laboratory 
testing; in the interim, toxicity may be assessed via patient contact with 
the study coordinator and/or clinical staff should new symptoms arise 
between visits.  The MTD will be the level at which ≤ 1 out of 6 patients 
experience a DLT (the highest dose level below the MAD).  This will be 
the dose for the phase II portion of the study.  Toxicity will be assessed 
according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03.

6.1.2.1 Determine  the safety and toxicity profile
One secondary objective for the phase I portion of this trial will be 
to determine safety and toxicity profile of the combination of 
temozolomide and pazopanib in this population.  The endpoint for 
this objective will be toxicity, which will be assessed at scheduled 
clinic follow up appointments every one to two weeks, as well as 
by investigator review of weekly laboratory testing; in the interim, 
toxicity may be assessed via patient contact with the study 
coordinator and/or clinical staff should new symptoms arise 
between visits.  Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI 
CTCAE version 4.03.
6.1.2.2 Describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination of 
temozolomide and pazopanib
Once the MTD is reached in the phase I portion of the study, this 
cohort will be expanded to include an 6 additional patients who 
will have PK studies performed.  We will examine the effect of 
pazopanib on the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide.  Full PK 
profiles will be taken after a single dose of temozolomide on Day 1 
and again on Day 2 after administration of the combination of 
temozolomide and pazopanib.  On Day 1, Cycle 1, the patient will 
have a time = 0 sample, take their dose of temozolomide, and then 
have samples drawn at the following times:
6.1.2.2.1 Day 1, Cycle 1
Time = 0 (prior to temozolomide dose) 10 min (+/- 5

triple quadruple API3000 LC-MS/MS after sample preparation by 
solid-phase extraction.  The plasma temoxolamide concentration 
versus time relationships will be modeled using the SAAM II 
software system (SAAM Institute, Seattle, WA) implemented on a 
WindowsTM-based PC as described by Argiris et al.  Cmax and 
Tmax will be taken as the observed values.
These 6 patients in the PK cohort will be included in the phase II 
analysis.  These patients will have correlative studies including 
MGMT.  These 6 patients will be evaluated for phase II endpoints. 
6.1.2.3 Observe  the ORR
For all patients enrolled in the phase I portion of the study, we will 
describe the ORR as the best overall response recorded from the 
start of the study treatment until the end of treatment based on 
RECIST (version 1.1) criteria.
6.2 Phase  II
6.2.1 Primary  Endpoint
The primary objective for the phase II portion of this trial will be to 
determine the ORR.  All enrolled patients will undergo contrast-enhanced 
CT or MRI imaging at baseline and after every 2 cycles of protocol 
therapy until study discontinuation. Patients will be assessed 
radiographically for response or progression after 2 cycles (8 weeks ± 7 
days) of study treatment. After 1 year of protocol therapy, patients may 
switch to imaging every 12 weeks (+/- 7 days) per treating physician 
discretion. Centralized RECIST measurements may be performed for 
some sites, depending upon feasibility.  The schedule and methods of 
radiographic evaluation are described in Section 7.0.  
6.2.2 Secondary  Endpoints
6.2.2.1 Determine  PFS, OS, DCR, and DOR.
For these endpoints, all enrolled patients will undergo contrast-
enhanced CT or MRI imaging at baseline and after every 2 cycles 
of protocol therapy until study discontinuation.  Please see Section 
6.3 for definitions.  
6.2.2.1.1 PFS will be defined as will be defined as the time from 
the first study treatment to the first occurrence of 
progression or death.
6.2.2.1.2 OS  will be defined as the time from first study treatment 
until death from any cause.
6.2.2.1.3 DCR will be defined as CR + PR +SD

a larger cohort of patients.
All patients enrolled in the phase II portion of the trial will be 
evaluated for toxicity throughout the course of their participation 
on study and through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.
 
6.2.3 Exploratory/Correlative  Endpoints
Exploratory objectives of this study will look at different types of 
correlations.  We will examine the relationship between tumor blood flow 
(as measured by perfusion functional computed tomography) and overall 
response.  We will also correlate the expression of tissue MGMT as 
measured by immunohistochemistry with PFS. 
6.2.3.1 Correlate the expression of tissue MGMT with PFS.
Immunohistochemistry for MGMT expression will be performed 
on all patients enrolled in the phase II portion of the study (the 6 
patients in the PK cohort will also be included in these exploratory 
studies).  
MGMT expression will be measured  in a blinded fashion utilizing 
mouse monoclonal antibodies to MGMT.  Nuclear MGMT will be 
scored as either present or absent in tumor cells and correlated with 
treatment outcome (PFS).
6.3 Definitions
Target and non-target lesions will be defined by RECIST guidelines (version 1.1).
6.3.1 Measureable  disease
Measurable lesions are defined as measurable in at least one dimension 
with clearly defined margins; at least one diameter must be greater than 
0.5 cm.  Bone lesions are excluded.
6.3.2 Non-measureable  disease
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions and bone 
lesions, are considered non-measurable disease.
6.3.3 Target  lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified 
as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.    Target lesions 
should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either 
by imaging techniques or clinically).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference by which

a short axis of ≥ 15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as 
target lesions.  The short axis measurement should be included in the sum 
of lesions in calculation of tumor response. Nodes that shrink to < 10 mm 
short axis are considered normal. 
6.3.4 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these 
lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be 
noted throughout follow-up.  
6.4  Evaluation  of response to therapy
The following criteria (RECIST version 1.1) will be used to define disease 
response to therapy based upon radiographic measurements using contrast-
enhanced CT or MRI imaging with contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less in slice 
thickness:41
Table 8:   Definitions & Evaluation of Response

 1 For unequivocal progression on the basis of non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to 
merit discontinuation of therapy. The designation of overall

or PR of target disease will be extremely rare.42
2 In the uncommon scenario of a mixed response with response or stable disease in target 
lesion(s) but progression in non-target lesions only, assessment of overall 
response will be made by the treating investigator and confirmed with the 
Principal Investigator and DMC. 
 
6.5 Evaluation  of best overall response
At study completion, each patient’s case will be reviewed to determine a best 
overall response to therapy.  Based on RECIST, the best overall response is the 
best
 response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of 
treatment, taking into account any requirement for confirmation.41, 42  In general, 
the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.  Patients with a global deterioration of 
health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective tumor 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  The best overall response 
will be defined as follows: 
Table 9:  Best Overall Response Definitions
Best Overall Response
Target Lesion Non-Target Lesion New Lesion Overall Response
CR CR No CR
CR Non CR/Non-PD No PR
PR Non-PD No PR
SD Non-PD No SD
PD Any Yes or No PD
Any PD Yes or No PD
Any Any Yes PD
6.6 Confirmation  of disease response or progression
The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating 
the response rate observed.  The Principal Investigator will confirm the objective 
response for each patient, and the confirmed responses will be reviewed by the 
DMC prior to reporting the results.  
In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it will be made clear 
when reporting the outcome that the responses are not confirmed.  To be assigned 
a status of PR or CR by RECIST, changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks 
after the criteria for response are first met.41, 42  In the case of SD, follow-up

minimum interval of 8 weeks (± 7 days).  
6.7 Criteria  for study completion
6.7.1 Phase  I
The phase I portion of the study will close to accrual when the MTD is 
confirmed in a cohort of at least 6 patients and the additional 6 patients for 
the PK cohort have been enrolled.  The study may also be closed 
prematurely if more than 1 of 3 patients at cohort Level -3 experience a 
DLT so that the MTD cannot be determined.  At the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator and the DMC, the study may be terminated early for 
failure to enroll an adequate number of patients or for significant, 
unexpected toxicities.
6.7.2 Phase  II
The phase II portion of the trial will be completed when all patients have 
been enrolled and all data for the study endpoints have been collected.   At 
the discretion of the Principal Investigator and the DMC, the study may be 
terminated early for failure to enroll an adequate number of patients or for 
significant, unexpected toxicities.

3 Toxicity will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE version 4.03.
4 If serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, then creatinine clearance should be calculated and ≥  30 mL/min
5 For baseline, patients must have urine protein to creatinine ratio < 1 OR a 24-hour urine protein < 1 g.  For treatment cycles, only a urine protein/creatinine ratio is required.
6 Required for females of childbearing potential (within 14 days) – see definition of child-bearing potential in Section 3.2.
7 Imaging with CT or MRI (whichever test is used for a particular patient at baseline should be the same that is used throughout for disease assessment).  Response will be assessed 
every 2 cycles (8 weeks +/- 7 days). After 1 year of protocol therapy, patients may switch to imaging every 12 weeks (+/- 7 days) per treating physician’s discretion.
8 Temozolomide will be administered on Days 1-7(+/-1 day) and 15-21(+/-1day) of each cycle.  Please refer to Section 5.2 for further details.
9 Pazopanib will be administered continuously starting Cycle 1, Day 1 until study discontinuation.  Please refer to Section 5.2 for further details.
10 All patients will receive prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole double strength (sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg) by mouth 3 times a week.
11 Patients will continue on treatment until disease progression (or until removed from study for other reasons, as outlined in Section 5.8.1).  
12 Patients removed from the study for disease progression who have no ongoing toxicity will undergo one last off-treatment visit for response.  Survival follow-up will continue 
every 6 months for 1 year in clinic and/or via phone ; survival follow-up may occur either in clinic or via phone contact.  Additional follow-up may be required for patients 
experiencing toxicity at the time of treatment discontinuation.  .
13 Patients in the PK cohort only will have PK samples drawn on Days 1-3 of Cycle 1.  Please refer to Sections, 6.1.2.2and 12.1 for details.
14 Correlative studies will only be done on the 6 patients in the PK cohort, as well as all patients enrolled to the phase II portion of the study.  
15 Copy of pathology report is sufficient for registration.  However a sample of tissue from a recent biopsy will be required for the 6 patients enrolled in the PK cohort and all 
patients in the phase II portion of the trial
16 Please refer to Section 12 for details regarding tissue requirements.  Tissue from the most recent biopsy will be obtained for study purposes – patients will not undergo repeat biopsy for 
correlative studies. This applies to both PK cohort and Phase II patients 
17 If baseline labs (chemistries, Mg, Phos, and CBC) were completed within 48 hours prior to start of treatment, they do not need to be repeated for Cycle 1 Day 1.
18 If serum chromogranin is completed within 14 days of treatment, it does not need to be repeated for Cycle 1 Day 1.
19 EKG will be performed at baseline (within 14 days of initiating study treatment) and then Day 1 of every cycle beginning with Cycle 2 – EKG does NOT need to be repeated at Cycle 1 
Day 1.
20 Assessments will be completed +/- 3 day from treatment Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 unless otherwise noted. Imaging will be assessed every 2 cycles (8 weeks +/- 7 days). 
21 For Cycle 4 and beyond, Day 15 labs may be completed at a local facility if more convenient for patients, per treating investigator’s discretion.
22 The drug diary (completed by the patient during each cycle) should be collected on Day 1 of the next cycle. Patients should be instructed to complete the drug diary every day and bring 
it to their visit on Day 1 of the next cycle.
23For patients who discontinue Temozolamide  after 1 year of treatment, D15 laboratory tests  (WBC, ANC, hemoglobin, platelet, Electrolytes & renal function tests [Na, K, Cl, CO2, 
BUN, Creatinine, Mg, Phos] and AST, ALT, alk phos, total bilirubin)  are not required to be done.

Version Date:January 24, 2018   48 -8.0 DRUG  FORMULATION AND PROCUREMENT
8.1 Temozolomide
8.1.1 Other  Names
Temodar®, TMZ, Temodal®, methazolastone
8.1.2 Classification  – type of agent
Temozolomide is a cytotoxic alkalyting agent.
8.1.3 Mode  of Action
Temozolomide is not directly active but undergoes rapid non-enzymatic 
conversion at physiologic pH to the reactive compound MTIC.  The 
cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA.  
Alkylation (methylation) occurs mainly at the O6 and N7 positions at 
guanine.
8.1.4 Storage and Stability
Temozolomide capusles are packaged in amber glass bottles and should be 
stored at 25°C (temperature excursions between 15-30°C are permitted).  
Refer to the product label for storage and stability information.  
8.1.5 Protocol  Dose
The starting dose for the phase I portion of this trial will be 150 mg/m2 
taken orally on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each cycle (1 cycle = 28 days).  The 
dose will be escalated (or de-escalated) according to the toxicities 
observed in each cohort of patients.  The MTD, once determined in the 
phase I portion, will be the recommended dose for the phase II portion of 
the trial. The MTD has been identified at dose level -2: Temozolomide 75 
mg/m2 per day p.o. days 1-7 and 15-21. As of 12.15.15, all patients 
moving forward will be treated at this dose.
8.1.6 Preparation
Temozolomide is supplied in white opaque, preservative-free capsules in a 
variety of dosage strengths.
8.1.7 Protocol  Administration
Temozolomide will be administered orally on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each 
28-day cycle.  Capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. 
Absorption is affected by food.  Temozolomide may be administered on 
an empty stomach or at bedtime to reduce nausea and vomiting.  A dose 
should not be repeated if vomiting occurs after administration.  Capsules 
should not be opened or chewed.  Contact with skin should be avoided if 
capsules are accidentally opened or damaged.

                                    Votrient (Pazopanib) commercial available supply with auxiliary 
label will also be provided by Novartis. The study drug should be 
administrated and stored according to the instructions specified on 
the drug labels.  
                                   (Note: Sites will start using the commercial supply when they finish the 
previous clinical supply).
8.2.7 Protocol  Administration
Pazopanib should be taken orally without food at least 1 hour before or
2 hours after a meal. The tablets should be swallowed whole and must not 
be crushed or broken. The time of day the tablets are taken should be 
relatively constant. If a dose is missed, the patient should take the dose as 
soon as possible, but not if there are less than 12 hours before the next 
dose is due. If the next dose is due in less than 12 hours, the patient should 
skip the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled.  If vomiting 
occurs after taking pazopanib another dose is not permitted on that day. 
The patient should resume taking pazopanib at the next scheduled dose.  If 
vomiting persists, the subject should be instructed to notify the 
investigator.
8.2.8 Incompatibilities
Results from drug-drug interaction studies conducted in cancer patients 
suggest
 that pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and 
CYP2D2 in vivo, but had no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19.  
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   51 -The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 
ritonavir, clarithromycin) may increase pazopanib concentrations and 
should be avoided.  Grapefruit juice should be avoided as it inhibits 
CYP3A4 activity and may also increase plasma concentrations of 
pazopanib. A list of CYP3A4 inhibitors is provided in Appendix II.  
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may 
decrease pazopanib concentrations and should be avoided.  Pazopanib 
should not be used in patients who cannot avoid chronic use of strong 
CYP3A4 inducers.  A list of CYP3A4 inducers is provided in Appendix II.  
Concomitant use  of pazopanib with agents with narrow therapeutic 
windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not 
recommended.  A list of these agents is provided in the Appendix II.
Concomitant use  of pazopanib and simvastatin (Zocor) increases the risk 
of ALT elevations and should be undertaken with caution and close 
monitoring.  If a subject receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT 
elevations, follow the Guidelines for Management of Treatment Emergent 
Hepatotoxicity and discontinue simvastatin.  Insufficient data are available 
to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and 
pazopanib.
Please refer to the development core safety information in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information about interactions with 
simvastatin, CYP3A4 inhibitors, impact on drugs eliminated through 
UGT1A1 and OATP1B1, and the use of pazopanib with drugs known to 
increase the gastric pH. Please also refer to Appendix II of this protocol.

9.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
The study design is a phase I/II, open-label, non-randomized dose-escalation study to 
determine the MTD, safety profile, pharmacokinetics, response rate, and overall survival 
with the combination of temozolomide and pazopanib in patients with advanced 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.  
The MTD determined in phase I will be the recommended Phase II dose.  Once the MTD 
is determined, the study will proceed to a single-arm, open-label Phase II to evaluate 
efficacy endpoints.  Data will be pooled from patients enrolled at both study sites. 
9.1 Phase  I Endpoints
The primary endpoint in Phase I is MTD and RP2D determination for the 
combination of temazolamide and pazopanib in patients with advanced pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor.  This will be achieved using a standard “3+3” dose 
escalation as detailed in Section 5.2.  Secondary endpoints in Phase I include 
determining the safety and toxicity profile of the combination of temozolomide 
and pazopanib, describing the pharmacokinetics, and observing the ORR.  
Patients who are removed from study for reasons other than disease progression 
(i.e. for toxicity or patient preference) will be censored for measurement of 
secondary endpoints at the time of their latest objective tumor assessment. 
9.1.1 Sample  Size of Phase I
Between 9 and 12 patients will be accrued in phase I.  The MTD of the 
regimen will be determined using standard “3+3” phase I methodology.

NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   53 -9.1.2 Phase  I Statistics
Safety will be assessed through a summary of adverse events and 
laboratory test results.  Safety analyses will include all patients who 
receive at least one dose of study regimen.  Verbatim description of 
treatment-related adverse events will be mapped to thesaurus terms.  
Adverse events assessed as related to study drug and serious adverse 
events will be summarized similarly.  Adverse events leading to treatment 
discontinuation will also be summarized.  The safety analysis will include 
a tabulation of all toxicities by grade.  The frequency of toxicities will be 
tabulated separately for each treatment dose level.  Treatment safety and 
toxicity will be evaluated using NCI CTCAE v 4.0 with scheduled 
assessments every week for the first cycle and then biweekly thereafter.  
The statistical analysis for the secondary objectives of phase I will be 
descriptive in nature.  The pharmacokinetics of temozolomide alone 
(Cycle 1 Day 1) and in combination with pazopanib (Cycle 1 Day 2) will 
be described in a population of 6 patients enrolled at the MTD.  C max and 
Tmax will be taken as the observed values.  At a minimum, for 
temozolomide, the following PK parameters will be determined:  maximal 
serum concentration (C max); observed time to achieve Cmax (T max); 
minimum (trough) serum concentration (C min); elimination half-life (t1/2); 
elimination clearance (CL E); volume of distribution at steady-state (V SS), 
and area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity 
(AUCinf).  These parameters will be summarized for each person and each 
day, and each constant will be compared between Day 1 and Day 2 using a 
Wilcoxon signed rank test.  The plasma temozolomide concentration 
versus time relationships will be modeled using the SAAM II software 
system.  The 6 patients enrolled at the MTD to form the PK cohort will be 
included in the phase II analysis for all other endpoints. 
9.2 Phase  II Endpoints
9.2.1 Sample  Size of Phase II
The sample size estimate for phase II is based upon a two-stage Simon’s 
optimal design.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be the objective 
response rate (partial or complete response).  A Simon (1989), optimum 
two-stage design will be employed.  A 19% response rate precludes 
further study whereas a 39% response rate would indicate that further 
investigation of the treatment is warranted (i.e., P0=0.19 and P1=0.39 in 
the Simon terminology).  Using α and β  errors of 0.10 and 0.20, 
respectively, 11 patients will be enrolled in the first stage and this will 
include the 6 patients in the PK cohort.   If 2 or fewer responses are 
observed, the trial will be terminated.  Otherwise, an additional 16 patients 
will be enrolled in the second stage and if ≤ 7 responses are observed 
among the 27 patients, the agents will not be considered worthy of further 
testing; whereas, if 8 or more responses are observed the drugs will be

Version Date:January 24, 2018   54 -considered sufficiently active to justify further study.  This design has 
80% power under the alternative hypothesis and provides a 65% 
probability of early stopping if the true response rate is only 19%.   
Therefore, a maximum of 27 patients will be accrued to the phase II 
portion of the study.  
9.2.2 Response  Rate Statistics
Radiological response will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach 
of
 including all enrolled patients.  After every 2 cycles of protocol therapy, 
patients will undergo imaging studies to assess for response to therapy 
using RECIST.  At study termination, each patient’s case will be reviewed 
to determine a best overall response to therapy by RECIST.  A descriptive 
analysis of evidence of antitumor activity will be provided based on 
radiographic assessments of activity.  The proportion with PFS at 6 
months will also be calculated based on RECIST criteria.
9.2.3 Toxicity  Profile Statistics
Safety will be assessed through a summary of adverse events and 
laboratory test results.  Safety analyses will include all patients who 
receive at least one dose of study regimen.  Verbatim description of 
treatment-related adverse events will be mapped to thesaurus terms.  
Adverse events assessed as related to study drug and serious adverse 
events will be summarized similarly.  Adverse events leading to treatment 
discontinuation will also be summarized.  The safety analysis will include 
a tabulation of all toxicities by grade.  The frequency of toxicities will be 
tabulated separately for each treatment dose level.  Treatment safety and 
toxicity will be evaluated using NCI CTCAE v 4.03 with scheduled 
assessments every week for the first cycle and then biweekly thereafter.  
9.3 Exploratory  Endpoints
Exploratory endpoints in this phase I/II trial will be assessed in all patients 
enrolled in the phase II portion of this study.  As noted above, patients who are 
removed from study for reasons other than disease progression (i.e. for toxicity or 
patient preference) will be censored for measurement of secondary endpoint, PFS 
at 6 months, at the time of their latest objective tumor assessment.  Exploratory 
endpoints include:
Correlate  the expression of tissue MGMT as measured by IHC with PFS. 
9.3.1 Exploratory  Study Statistical Analyses
9.3.1.1 MGMT expression
Changes in MGMT over time will be assessed using repeated 
measures
 analysis of variance; pre-treatment levels and changes in 
levels from baseline to day 30 will be related to response using a 
Wilcoxon rank sum test, and to PFS and OS using a proportional 
hazards regression model.

Version Date:January 24, 2018   55 -9.4 Replacement Policy
A patient may be replaced if protocol therapy is discontinued due to early disease 
progression, defined as occurring within the first 28 days of therapy.  Patients will 
not be replaced if taken off study due to toxicity, however, if a patient is taken off 
study during their DLT period for a reason unrelated to study treatment, another 
patient may be added to that cohort. 
9.5 Statement  of Feasibility
The Northwestern University GI Oncology program derives study patient 
populations from patients currently undergoing treatment or evaluation at the 
Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (RHLCCC), as well as from a 
broad referral base in the Chicago and Midwest area.  The weekly 
multidisciplinary GI Tumor Board at RHLCCC provides additional means to 
identify potential study subjects.  Based upon these resources, we anticipate 
monthly accrual of approximately 2-3 patients with advanced PNET.  Estimated 
time of study completion is 2.5 years.  Dr. Halla Nimeiri, the Principal 
Investigator of this proposal, has experience leading and designing clinical trials 
in GI oncology. She is also an active member of the ECOG GI committee. She 
has received an NCCN grant in the past for evaluating temsirolimus and sorafenib 
in HCC. As of June2017, she is being replaced by Dr.Sheetal Kircher as Principal 
Investigator of this study. The co-investigators on this study proposal are all 
members of the RHLCCC with strong clinical research backgrounds in the 
development and implementation of clinical trials in gastrointestinal 
malignancies. Dr. Benson is the director of the GI oncology program and the chair 
of the ECOG Gastrointestinal and Data Monitoring Committees.  The group 
includes well developed research infrastructure including research nurses and 
nurse practitioners, data managers, biostatisticians, and research pharmacists. 
Safety monitoring and oversight will be provided by the RHLCCC Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) in accordance with the Data Safety Monitoring 
Plan (DSMP) of the RHLCCC . Additional details regarding how this study will 
be monitored can be referenced in Appendix IV. 
10.0 ADVERSE  EVENT MONITORING & REPORTING 
This trial will be conducted in accordance with the DSMP of the RHLCCC
((http://cancer.northwestern.edu/CRO/data/Data andSafetyMonitoringPlanMay2014.pdf). 
The level of risk attributed to this study requires High Intensity Monitoring, as outlined in 
the DSMP.  
10.1 Adverse  Event Monitoring
Collection and reporting of adverse event (AE) data is required as part of every 
clinical
 trial, and is done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in this study as 
well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  Toxicity will 
be assessed daily during treatment, and at least twice weekly (if not more 
frequently) after treatment until count recovery (as described in Section 7.0).  All 
adverse events will be reported on the appropriate eCRF (as outlined in 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   56 -Appendices V and VI).  Additionally, certain serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of patient 
safety and care.  
All patients experiencing an AE, regardless of its relationship to study drug, will 
be monitored until one of the following occurs: 
10.1.1 The  AE resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the AE return to 
baseline.
10.1.2 Any  abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline.
10.1.3 There  is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the 
changes observed.
10.1.4 Death.
10.2 Definitions  & Descriptions
10.2.1 Adverse  Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study 
treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporarily associated with the use of an experimental intervention, 
whether or not related to the intervention. 
Recording of AEs  should be done in a concise manner using standard, 
acceptable medical terms. In general, AEs are not procedures or 
measurements, but should reflect the reason for the procedure or the 
diagnosis based on the abnormal measurement. Preexisting conditions that 
worsen in severity or frequency during the study should also be recorded 
(a preexisting condition that does not worsen is not an AE). Further, a 
procedure or surgery is not an AE; rather, the event leading to the 
procedure or surgery is considered an AE.
If a  specific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded as the AE whenever possible.  However, a complete 
description of the signs, symptoms and investigations which led to the 
diagnosis should be provided. For example, if clinically significant 
elevations of liver function tests are known to be secondary to hepatitis, 
“hepatitis” and not “elevated liver function tests” should be recorded. If 
the cause is not known, the abnormal test or finding should be recorded as 
an AE, using appropriate medical terminology (e/g/ thrombocytopenia, 
peripheral edema, QT prolongation).
10.2.2 Severity  of AEs
All non-hematologic adverse events will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.03. The CTCAE v4 is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   57 -If no  CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as 
follows:
10.2.2.1 Mild (grade 1):  the event causes discomfort without 
  disruption of normal daily activities.
10.2.2.2 Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects 
  normal daily activities.
10.2.2.3 Severe (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to 
  perform normal daily activities or significantly affects his/her 
  clinical status.
10.2.2.4 Life-threatening (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at 
  the time of the event.
10.2.2.5 Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death.
10.2.3 Serious  Adverse Event
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence i.e. an undesirable sign or 
symptom or medical condition that at any dose results in one of the 
following outcomes: 
10.2.3.1 Death ; if death results from progression of the disease, the disease 
progression should be reported as an SAE itself.
10.2.3.2 A life-threatening adverse event ; the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event (this does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).
10.2.3.3 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
10.2.3.4 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions.
10.2.3.5 An adverse event that requires inpatient hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥  24 hours,  unless 
hospitalization is for:
10.2.3.5.1 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied 
       indication, not associated with any deterioration in 
       condition (specify what this includes).
10.2.3.5.2 Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study 
and has not worsened since the start of study drug.
10.2.3.5.3 Treatment  on an emergency outpatient basis for an 
event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE 
given above and not resulting in hospital admission.
10.2.3.5.4 Social  reasons and respite care in the absence of any 
deterioration in the patient’s general condition.
10.2.3.6 Is medically significant or is an important medical event, 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   58 -              Important medical  events are those that may not meet any of the 
above criteria, but that are clearly of major clinical significance in 
the judgment of the investigator.  They may jeopardize the subject, 
and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes noted above.  Examples might include:  allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, convulsions that may not result in hospitalization, or 
development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
10.2.5 Exceptions  to AE & SAE Definitions
Generally speaking, any adverse event that results in hospitalization or 
prolonged
 hospitalization should be documented and reported as an SAE, 
as described above.  Likewise, any condition responsible for surgery 
should be documented as an AE if the condition meets the criteria for an 
AE.  However, for the purposes of this study, neither the condition, 
hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as AEs 
or SAEs under the following circumstances:
10.2.5.1 Hospitalization  or prolonged hospitalization is for a diagnostic or 
elective surgical procedure for a preexisting condition.  Surgery 
should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome 
was uneventful.
10.2.5.2 Hospitalization  or prolonged hospitalization is required to allow 
efficacy measurement for the study.
10.2.5.3 Hospitalization  or prolonged hospitalization is required for study-
directed therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as 
judged by the principal investigator.
10.2.5.4 Hospitalization  or prolonged hospitalization is due to social 
reasons (i.e. awaiting transport home).
10.2.6 Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subject or Others (UPIRSO)
In order for an adverse event to be reported to the Northwestern University 
IRB, it must qualify as a UPIRSO.  In order to qualify as a UPIRSO, the 
event must meet all three  of the following criteria:  
10.2.5.1 The  event must be unanticipated in terms of nature, severity, or 
frequency (i.e. not described in study-related documents such as 
the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc.).  
10.2.5.2 The  event must place the research subject or others at a different 
or greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm).
10.2.5.3 The  event must be at least possibly related to participation in the 
study.

NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   59 - 10.3 Reporting  of SAEs
All SAEs, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within 30 days 
of the last administration of temozolomide and/or pazopanib must be reported to 
the principal investigator upon discovery or occurrence.  Additional expedited or 
routine reporting may be required, depending on the nature of the SAE (as 
outlined below). Please also refer to Table 7 – Summary of Hematologic & Non-
Hematologic Dose Modifications for Pazopanib – for additional information 
regarding toxicities that should be reported as SAEs.
10.3.1 Reporting  to the QAM/DMC
All SAEs must be reported to the assigned QAM within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. Completion of the NU CRO SAE form is 
required (available as stand-alone document).
The completed form should assess whether or not the event qualifies as a 
UPIRSO. The report should also include:
10.3.1.1  Protocol description and number
10.3.1.2  The patient’s identification number
10.3.1.3  A description of the event, severity, treatment, and 
outcome (if known)
10.3.1.4  Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics
10.3.1.5  The hospital discharge summary (if available/applicable)
All SAEs will be reported to, and reviewed by, the DMC at their next 
meeting.
10.3.2 Reporting  to the Northwestern University IRB
The following information pertains to the responsibilities of the lead site (Northwestern 
University). Additional participating sites should follow their local IRB guidelines for 
reporting to their local IRBs.
10.3.2.1  Any death of an NU subject that is unanticipated in nature 
and at least possibly related to study participation will be 
promptly reported to the Northwestern University IRB within 24 
hours of notification.  
10.3.2.2  Any death of an NU subject that is actively on study 
treatment (regardless of whether or not the event is possibly 
related to study treatment)
10.3.2.3 The following SAEs will be reported to the NU IRB within 5 
working days of notification:
10.3.2.2.1 Death  of a non-NU subject that is unanticipated in 
nature and at least possibly related  to study 
participation
10.3.2.2.2 Other  UPIRSOs
10.3.2.4  The following SAEs will be reported to the NU IRB at   the 
  time of annual continuing review:
10.2.3.4.1 All deaths of NU subjects that were not previously 
reported.

NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   60 -10.2.3.4.2All deaths of non-NU subjects that are deemed to be 
unanticipated in nature and unrelated to participation.
10.2.3.4.3All other SAEs not previously reported to the IRB as 
UPIRSOs
10.3.3 Reporting  to Novartis
The principal  investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse 
events to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epidemiology 
Department (DS&E). 
All events  reported to the FDA by the investigator are to be filed utilizing 
the Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form). 
To ensure  patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, 
occurring:
10.3.3.1 After  the patient has provided informed consent and until atleast 
30 days after the patient has stopped study treatment/participation.
10.3.3.2 After  protocol-specified procedures begin (e.g., placebo run-in, 
washout period, double-blind treatment, etc.) and 30 days after the 
patient has stopped study treatment.
10.3.3.3 After  the start of any period in which the study protocol interferes 
with the standard medical treatment given to a patient (e.g., 
treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in treatment 
to a fixed dose of concomitant. medication) and until 30 days after 
the patient has stopped study treatment.
All events  must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on a 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form (NU SAE form); all applicable sections 
of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough 
report. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE 
to each specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), 
complete the SAE Report Form (NU SAE form) in English, and send the 
completed, signed form by fax to (fax: 877-778-9739) within 24 hours 
to the oncology Novartis DS&E department with the provided FAX 
cover sheets (available as stand-alone documents).
This includes serious, related,  labeled (expected) and serious, related, 
unlabeled (unexpected) adverse experiences. All deaths during treatment or 
within 30 days following completion of active protocol therapy must be 
reported within 24 hours.
Any SAEs  experienced after this 30 days period should only be reported to 
Novartis if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug. 
Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must 
be reported as follow-up to the original episode within 24 hours of the 
investigator receiving the follow-up information. An SAE occurring at a 
different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  The 
end date of the first event must be provided.
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   61 -The original  copy of the SAE Report and the fax confirmation sheet must 
be kept within the Trial Master File at the study site.
Follow-up information  is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE 
Report Form was sent, using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a 
follow-up to the previously reported SAE, and giving the date of the original 
report. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original 
event should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it 
occurs. The follow-up information should describe whether the event has 
resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was 
broken or not (if applicable), and whether the patient continued or withdrew 
from study participation.
If the SAE is  not previously documented in the Pazopanib Investigator 
Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to 
the Novartis study drug, a DS&E associate may urgently require further 
information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting. Novartis 
may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all 
investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has 
been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as 
per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.
To ensure  patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on 
study treatment must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of 
its occurrence.
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities or maternal and 
newborn complications.
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and 
reported by the investigator to the oncology Novartis Drug Safety and 
Epidemiology (DS&E) department. Pregnancy follow-up should be 
recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the 
possible relationship to the Novartis study treatment of any pregnancy 
outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the 
SAE Report Form (NU SAE form).
10.3.4  Reporting to NCCN
10.3.4.1 All  SAEs must also be reported to NCCN via fax at 215-358-7699 
or e-mailed to ORPReports@nccn.org
10.3.4.2 The  NU CRO SAE form will be used to report SAEs to  NCCN. 
This form will include a full written summary, detailing relevant 
aspects of the adverse events in question. Where applicable, 
information from relevant hospital case records and autopsy 
reports should be included.

11.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT 
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent 
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol.
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki.
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent 
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required 
by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential 
information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that 
the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient 
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB 
approved consent form.
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form 
should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion.
11.2 Amendments
The Principal Investigator will  formally initiate all amendments to the protocol 
and/or informed consent. All amendments will be subject to the review and 
approval of the appropriate local, institutional, and governmental regulatory 
bodies, as well as by Janssen Scientific Affairs. Amendments will be distributed 
by the lead institution (Northwestern) to all affiliate sites upon approval by the

access to his/her original records to permit verification of proper entry of data. 
The study may also be subject to routine audits by the Audit Committee, as 
outlined in the DSMP. 
11.9 Publication Policy
All potential publications and/or data for potential publications (e.g. manuscripts, 
abstracts, posters, clinicaltrials.gov releases) must be approved in accordance with 
the policies and processes set forth in the Lurie Cancer Center DSMP. For trials 
that require high intensity monitoring, the assigned QAM will prepare a 
preliminary data summary (to be approved by the DMC) no later than 3 months 
after the study reaches its primary completion date (the date that the final subject 
is examined or receives an intervention for the purposes of final data collection 
for the primary endpoint). If the investigator’s wish to obtain DMC-approved data 
prior to this point (or prior to the point dictated by study design), the PI must send 
a written request for data to the QAM which includes justification. If the request 
is approved, data will be provided no later than 4 weeks after this request 
approval. The data will be presented to the DMC at their next available meeting, 
and a final, DMC-approved dataset will be released along with any DMC 
decisions regarding publication. The investigators are expected to use only DMC-
approved data in future publications. The investigators should submit a copy of 
the manuscript to the biostatistician to confirm that the DMC-approved data are 
used appropriately.  Once the biostatistician gives final approval, the manuscript 
may be submitted to external publishers.
 
12.0 PATHOLOGY  REQUIREMENTS – CORRELATIVE STUDIES
12.1 Pharmacokinetics  (PKs)
12.1.1 Timing
After determination of the MTD, the last cohort of the phase I portion will 
be expanded to include an additional 6 patients who will undergo PK 
testing to evaluate the effect of pazopanib on the pharmacokinetics of 
temozolomide.  The MTD has now been identified at dose level -2 (75 
mg/m2 per day p.o. days 1-7 and 15-21 of Temozolomide and 400 mg per 
day p.o. days 1-28 of Pazopanib). As of 12.15.15,all patients moving 
forward will be treated at this dose. As stated above, the PKs are 
mandatory for this cohort. 
The schedule and dosing for these 6 patients will be as follows: 
12.1.1.1 Day  1, Cycle 1
 Patients will not take either study drug prior to arriving to the 
clinic.  Patients will have a time = 0 sample drawn, and then be 
instructed to take their dose of temozolomide.  Patients will then 
have PK samples drawn at 10 min (+/-5 min), 30 min (+/-5 min), 
1 hour (+/-5 min), 2 hours (+/-5 min),, 3 hours (+/-5 min),4 
hours(+/-30 min), 6 hours (+/-30 min), 8 hours(+/-30 min),, and 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   66 -24 hours(+/-1 hour) post-dose (drawn on Day 2. This will be the 
same sample as the pre-dose PK sample of Day 2 provided Day 2 
drug administration is done within 1 hour of sample collection. 
One 3 ml sample is needed).
Pazopanib will be held on this day.  
12.1.1.2 Cycle  1, Day 2:  
  Patients will continue to take temozolomide as instructed but will 
not take pazopanib until instructed to do so in clinic.  Patients will 
have a time = 0 sample drawn and then be instructed to take their 
dose of pazopanib. This will be the same sample as the 24-hour 
post-dose PK sample of Day 1, provided Day 2 drug 
administration is done within 1 hour of sample collection. If this 
drug administration is delayed beyond one hour, then another 3 ml 
PK sample has to be collected for the pre-dose PK of Day 2).  
Patients will then have PK samples drawn at 10 min(+/- 5 min), 30 
min(+/- 5 min), 1 hour(+/- 5 min), 2 hours(+/- 5 min), 3 hours(+/- 
5 min), 4 hours(+/- 30 min), 6 hours(+/- 30 min), 8 hours(+/- 30 
min), and 24 hours(+/-1 hour) (done on Day 3) post-dose.
12.1.1.3 Cycle  1, Day 3: 
 Patients will not take either study drug prior to arriving to the 
clinic.  Patients will have 1 PK sample drawn (the 24 hours[+/- 1 
hour] post-pazopanib dose sample from Day 2) and then continue 
to take both temozolomide and pazopanib as instructed per 
protocol. 
12.1.2 Sample  collection
PK samples will be drawn in the outpatient setting.  Collect each blood 
sample (3 mL) in an evacuated blood tube containing lithium heparin.  
Invert the tube gently 4 or 5 times (avoid shaking).  Care must be taken to 
ensure that blood does not come in further contact with the stopper on the 
evacuated tube.  Blood samples should be kept in an ice water bath from 
the time of collection to the time of centrifugation, which should occur 
within 30 minutes of sample collection.  Samples at Northwestern 
University should be picked up by the Pathology Core Facility Clinical 
Trials Technician for processing and storage until they are ready to be 
analyzed.  Samples should be labeled with the patient’s study ID number 
and initials, as well as the date and collection time point (i.e. 30 min post-
dose).
12.1.3 Processing
Centrifuge samples in a laboratory centrifuge designed for separating 
plasma from cells at  approximately 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C.  
Transfer the plasma to 2 polypropylene tubes ( a primary and a back-up 
IRB #: STU00053541-CR0003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 7/15/2019 through 7/14/2020.
NU 11I03 
Version Date:January 24, 2018   67 -tube, approximately 0.75 mL per tube).  After aliquoting, 30 uL 8.5% 
phosphoric acid should be added to each mL of plasma being stored in the 
polypropylene tubes before freezing the samples (22.5 microL/0.75 mL).
Computer-printed labels will be generated at each study site for the 
polypropylene
 (storage) tubes detailing study ID number, patient study ID, 
date of collection, time of collection, and protocol therapy time point.  If it 
should be necessary to handwrite the information, only indelible ink 
should be used.  Apply the labels along the length of the tube.  Secure the 
labels by wrapping with clear tape.  
Apply the preprinted labels to the polypropylene tubes at room 
temperature at least 2 hours before refrigerating or freezing.  Adequate 
adhesion cannot be guaranteed if the labels are applied to cold tubes.  
Blood samples must be kept frozen at approximately -80°C after 
collection and until delivery/shipment is initiated.  
Sample collection details (i.e., patient study ID, date of collection, time of 
collection, and protocol therapy time point) should be indicated on a log 
sheet along with the times of last study drug dose(s).  A copy of the sheet 
should be submitted with the samples.   
12.1.4 Shipment
Plasma samples for the PK portion of the study will be shipped directly 
from study sites to Northwestern University for bioanalysis.  Samples 
should be stored as referenced above until shipment.  All samples for all 
patients on study may be batched and shipped upon completion of the 
enrollment phase to the PK cohort.  
One specimen from each pair of a sample should be included in the initial 
shipment.  Samples will be shipped overnight along with a copy of the log 
sheet via FEDEX on dry ice to Northwestern University at the address 
provided below.  The remaining set of samples will be saved at each study 
site until receipt of the first set of samples has been confirmed, then 
shipped to Northwestern University separately (in case of lost shipment or 
other complication).  
Shipment should only be initiated on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays

12.2 MGMT Analysis
12.2.1 Tissue requirements
From each patient, 5 unstained slides will be obtained.  Paraffin-embedded 
sections
 of 4 μm  from the most recent biopsy will be used for 
immunohistochemistry.  
12.2.2 Processing
For antigen retrieval, sections will be subjected to pretreatment with 45-
min pressure boiling in citrate buffer (pH 6.0).  Immunohistochemistry 
will be done using an autostainer (Dako Cytomation).  Sections will be 
incubated with a mouse monoclonal MGMT antibody, diluted in antibody 
diluent (Dako Cytomation), at room temperature for 60 min.  The reaction 
product will be revealed using Dako kit 50087 (Dako Cytomation). 
Sections will be counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin.  Initial 
experiments will be done with omission of the primary antibody.  Nuclear 
MGMT will be scored as either present or absent in tumor cells and 
correlated with treatment outcome (PFS).
All staining and analysis will take place in the Pathology Core 
Facility at Northwestern University.
12.2.3 Shipment
Pathology samples from biopsy will be shipped to:

adjusts dose escalations and 
de-escalations accordingly; 
indicates that if cohort Level 
2 (pazopanib = 800 mg) is 
too toxic, an additional 
cohort (pazopanib 600 mg) 
may be added upon DMC 
review and approval.Upon review, the study 
collaborators
 (NCCN and

pazopanib was approved by 
the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of patients with 
advanced RCC [Votrient PI, 
2012]. In 2012, pazopanib 
was FDA-approved for the 
treatment of patients with 
advanced soft tissue sarcoma 
who have received prior 
chemotherapy.  However, the 
efficacy of pazopanib for the 
treatment of patients with 
adipocytic soft tissue 
sarcoma or gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors has not been 
demonstrated [Votrient PI, 
2012].The additional language 
provides more data on the 
FDA approval of

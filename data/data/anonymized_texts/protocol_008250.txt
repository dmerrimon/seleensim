Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 70,000 children and adults worldwide2 and is the 
most common fatal genetic disease in persons of European descent.3 Based on the size of the 
population, CF qualifies as an orphan disease.4,5 Despite progress in the treatment of CF with 
antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is 
approximately 40 years .3,6 Although the disease affects multiple organs, most morbidity and 
mortality are caused b y progressive loss of lung function.7 
CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a defect in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an epithelial chloride ion (Cl
-) 
channel activated by cyclic AMP -dependent protein kinase A that is responsible for aiding in 
the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues .3 This function is 
defective in patients with CF due to a loss of either cell surface expression and/or function. 
More than 1900 mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified.8 Mutations in the CFTR 
gene have been classified based on the molecular and functional consequence of the mutation 
on the CFTR protein9,10,11 and can be generally considered to reduce the quantity of 
functional CFTR protein that reaches the epithelial cell surface or reduce the function of CFTR protein located at the cell surface. CFTR gene mutations that affect the quantity of 
functional cell surface CFTR protein include defects that reduce CFTR protein synthesis and defects that impede the cellular processing and delivery of CFTR proteins to the cell surface.  
CFTR gene mutations associated with minimal CFTR function include 
• mutations associated with severe defects in ability of the CFTR channel to open and 
close, known as defective channel gating or “gating mutations”; 
• severe defects in the cellular processing of CFTR and its delivery to the cell surface;  
• no (or minimal) CFTR synthesis; and  
• severe defects in channel conductance.  
The most prevalent mutation is an in -frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del- CFTR).
11 In the US, almost 87% 
of patients with CF have at least 1  copy of the  F508del- CFTR mutation and about 47% have 
2 copies.12 In the European Union, approximately 83% of patients with CF have 1 or 2  copies 
of the F508del- CFTR mutation, and approximately 38.7% of patients with CF in the United 
Kingdom have 2 copies.13 The F508del-CFTR mutation interferes with the ability of the 
CFTR protein to reach an d remain at the cell surface, as well as to open and close, resulting 
in decreased Cl- transport.14,15 The combined effect is a marked reduction in 
F508del-CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion that impairs fluid regulation and promotes 
accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the airway. The mucus build-up obstructs the airways 
and predisposes the patient to chronic lung infections.16 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 21 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Two complementary approaches to increase CFTR -mediated Cl- secretion in the airway 
epithelia have been studied.10 One approach is to treat with a compound that will modify the 
cellular processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein to increase the amount of  functional 
CFTR at the cell surface. This kind of compound has been termed a CFTR corrector. Another 
approach is to treat with a compound that increases the channel gating activity of protein kinase A-activated CFTR at the cell surface to enhance ion tran sport. This kind of compound 
has been termed a potentiator. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of 
the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required to ameliorate lung disease in patients with CF. A modest restoration of Cl
- secretion through the action of a 
potentiator and/or corrector could prevent the hyperabsorption of water across the apical surface of epithelial cells, al lowing proper maintenance of airway hydration. Adequate 
airway hydration could alleviate the cycle of mucus plugging, infection, and inflammation, which leads to irreversible structural changes in the lungs and, eventually, respiratory failure for patients with CF.  
VX-661 is a CFTR corrector that works by facilitating the processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR and other mutant CFTR forms, thereby increasing the amount of functional CFTR protein at the cell surface, resulting in enhanced chloride transport.
17 When added for 
more than 24 hours to human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells isolated and cultured from lung explants obtained from donors with CF (CF-HBE cells) who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, a concentration- dependent increase in levels of mature (i.e.,  plasma 
membrane) F508del -CFTR was observed. The increased trafficking of F508del-CFTR to the 
cell surface resulted in a significant increase in Cl
− secretion .17 VX-661 did not correct the 
processing and localization of other misfolded or normally folded proteins other than CFTR, suggesting that the mechanism of VX-661 action is selective for CFTR (CFTR corrector).
18 
Ivacaftor (also known as VX-770) is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical benefit in patients with CF. Results from several Phase 3 studies showed that ivacaftor is effective in the treatment of patients with CF who have mutations 
that result in gating defects as evidenced by sustained improvements in CFTR channel function (measured by reduction in sweat chloride concentration) and corresponding substantial, durable improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, and weight gain. Ivacaftor was also well tolerated, as evidenced by the rates and reasons for premature discontinuation and results of safety assessments.  
Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients as young as 2 years of 
age who have 1 of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, 
G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R, or  R117H. Please refer to the ivacaftor

characteristics for your region for the current approved use of Kalydeco.

 DESIGN 
8.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase  3, 2-part (Part A and Part B), open- label, multicenter study evaluating the PK, 
safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in subjects 
6 through 11 years of age with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Efficacy will also be evaluated in Part B. Part A is composed of 
2 weight-based cohorts, which will be enrolled simultaneously, and Part B is composed of a 
single cohort. Subjects who participate in Part  A may participate in Part B if Part B eligibility 
criteria are met.  
Part A 
Up to approximately 16 subjects total are planned for enrollment across Cohort 1 (subjects weighing <25  kg at baseline) and Cohort 2 (subjects weighing ≥25 kg at baseline ).  
Part A includes the following: 
• Screening Period (Day  -28 through Day -1) 
• Treatment Period (Day  1 through Day 14) 
• Washout Period (Day 14 to Day 28 [± 3 days])  
• Safety Follow -up Visit (14 [±  3] days after the last dose of study drug) 
Figure 8-1 depicts the schematic for the Part  A study design. After obtaining written 
informed consent (and assent, if applicable), Screening Visit assessments will be completed at any time during the p eriod of 4 weeks (Day  -28 through Day -1) before the first dose of the 
study drug (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects will be administered VX-661 
50 mg daily (qd) in combination with ivacaftor, either 75 mg (subjects <25 kg at baseline) or 
150 mg (subjects ≥25 kg at baseline), every 12  hours (q12h) for 14 days. A 2-week Washout 
Period (Day 14 to Day 28 [± 3 days] ) will be included in order to evaluate the off- drug 
response. A Safety Follow -up Visit is scheduled to occur 14 (±  3) days after the la st dose of 
study drug for all subjects, including subjects who permanently discontinue from study treatment for any reason.  
A review of safety, tolerability, and PK data will be completed by an internal Vertex team after Part A to select the VX -661 dose fo r Part B.

Part B 
Approximately 56 subjects are planned for enrollment. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, 
approximately 50 subjects are expected to complete Part  B.  
Part B includes the following: 
• Screening Period (Day  -28 through Day -1) 
• Treatment Period (Day  1 through Week 24 [±  5 days]) 
• Safety Follow -up Visit (4  weeks [± 7 days] after the last dose of study drug) 
Figure 8-2 depicts the schematic for the Part  B study design. After obtaining written 
informed consent (and assent, if applicable), Screening Visit assessments will be completed at any time during the period of 4 weeks (Day  -28 through Day -1) before the first dose of 
study drug (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects will be administered VX -661 
50 mg qd in combination with ivacaftor 75 mg  q12h (subjects <40 kg at baseline) or VX -661 
100 mg qd in combination with ivacaftor 150 mg  q12h (subjects ≥40 kg at baseline) for 
24 weeks.  No dose adjustments will be made throughout the duration of treatment in this 
study. At the Week  24 Visit, subjects who complete study drug treatment will be offered the 
opportunity to enroll in an extension study evaluating VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor (enrollment will be  based on the eligibility criteria specified within the extension study). 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment are not eligible to rollover into 
the extension study. 
A Safety Follow -up Visit is scheduled to occur 4 weeks (± 7 days) aft er the last dose of study 
drug. The Safety Follow-up Visit is not required for subjects who have enrolled in the 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 26 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   extension study within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects who permanently 
discontinue study drug treatment will have an Early Treatment Termination (ETT) Visit and 
a Safety Follow -up Visit.

8.1.1 Screening 
Part A and Part  B 
Screening Visit assessments are listed in  Table 3-1  (Part A) and Table 3-3 (Part B). 
The Screening Period will occur within 28 days before the first dose of study drug to confirm that subjects meet the selection criteria for the study. To participate in the study, the subject's parent or legal guardian must sign and date a study-specific informed consent form (ICF) and the subject must sign an assent form (if applicable) before any study- specific procedures can 
be performed. The ICF (and assent form, if applicable) w ill comply with all applicable 
regulations governing the protection of human subjects and will be approved by Vertex and the site's institutional review board (IRB).  
To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the Study Restrictions (Section 9.3) and use of concomitant medications ( Section 9.4).  
8.1.1.1 Repetition of Screening Period Assessments  
Part A and Part  B  
Repetition of any individual Screening Visit assessment(s) that do not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, with the following exceptions:  
• If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection of a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory test may be 
permitted after discussion with the Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 27 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • If a convincing al ternative etiology is identified for elevated transaminases, e xclusionary 
liver function test (LFT) levels may be retested within 14  days of the original Screening 
Visit date.  
If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and 
completed within the Screening Period window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 
8.1.1.2 Rescreening  
Part A and Part  B  
Subjects may be rescreened after discussion with, and approval from, the Vertex medical 
monitor or authorized designee to account for e xclusionary events that may not reflect the 
subject’s true baseline due to an acute event, which may resolve. Subjects who complete Part A or who discontinue treatment for other reasons than safety reasons and wish to 
participate in Part B, must be rescreened and meet all eligibility criteria before enrolling in Part B. Subjects who were not eligible to participate in Part A may be rescreened for Part B 
after discussion with, and approval from, the Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee. 
If a subject is rescreened, all Screening Visit assessments will be repeated except for CF 
genotyping and the ophthalmologic examination (if the ophthalmologic examination was performed within 3 months before the Rescreening Visit). If a subject is rescreened, the screening window will begin after the first rescreening assessment has been initiated.  
8.1.1.3 Extension of Screening Period Window  
Part A and Part  B 
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks after approval by the medical monitor  or authorized designee for the following reasons: 
• Repetition of the Screening Period assessments ( Section 8.1.1.1) 
• Unexpected operational or logist ic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria  
• Scheduling of the ophthalmologic examination ( Section 11.7.6)  
8.1.2 Treatment Period  
Part A and Part B  
Study drug will be dispensed to the subject’s legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) for administration to the study subjects on study days where a clinic visit is not scheduled, as described in Section 10.1. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the conclusion of a 
scheduled visit, the Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee will be notified, and the 
investigator will make every effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals 
to document the course of the abnormalities. 
Part A  
Table 3-2 lists the Treatment Period Visits and assessments for Part A. Subjects will be 
outpatients during the Treatment Period. All visits should occur within the windows specified.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 28 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   The duration of the Treatment Period is 14 days. The first dose of the study drug will be 
administered on Day 1, and the last dose of study drug will be the morning dose administered on Day 14 ( Figure 8-1). Dosing details are given in Section 10.2. Subjects must return to the 
clinical site on Day 21 for PK assessments (Table 3-2) . 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing will be asked to return to the clinical site for a Safety Follow -up Visit ( Section 8.1.5). 
Part B 
Table 3-4 lists the Treatment Period visits and assessments for Part B. Subjects will be outpatients during the Treatment Period. All visits should occur within the windows specified.  
The planned duration of the Treatment Period is 24 weeks. The first dose of the study drug will be administered on Day  1 and the last dose of study drug will be the evening dose 
administered the day before the Week 24 Visit. Dosing details are given in Sec tion 10.2. 
8.1.3 Washout Period  
Part A 
A 2-week Washout Period (Day 14 to Day 28 ± 3 days) will be included in order to evaluate 
the off-drug response.  
Part B 
Not applicable  
8.1.4 Safety Follow -up 
Part A  
Table 3-2 lists the Safety Follow -up Visit assessments for Part  A. Subjects will have a Safety 
Follow-up Visit 14 (± 3) days after the last dose of study drug.  
Part B 
Table 3-4 lists the Safety Follow -up Visit assessments for Part B. Subjects will have a Safety 
Follow-up Visit 4 weeks (±  7 days) after the last dose of study drug. The Safety Follow-up 
Visit is not re quired for subjects who have enrolled in the extension study within 28 days 
after the last dose of study drug.  
8.1.5 Early Discontinuation/Early Treatment Termination  
Part A  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing will be asked to return to the 
clinical site 14 (± 3) days after their last dose of study drug for a Safety Follow -up Visit. 
Safety Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in  Table 3-2.  
Part B 
If the subject prematurely discontinues study treatment, an ETT Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the subject decides to terminate study treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow -up 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 29 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Visit, approximately 4  weeks ± 7 days after their last dose of study drug. The assessments 
performed at the Safety Follow -up Visit are listed in  Table 3-4.  
If the ETT Visit occurs 3  weeks or later after the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit 
will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will not be 
required.  
During the course of study conduct, if local health authorities decline to approve, or if 
clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of CF in a corresponding adult population, pediatric subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may be discontinued after communication to investigators and IRBs/ independent ethics committees (IECs) of the risks/benefits related to the safety and efficacy observed for the subset of adult subjects. If subjects are discontinued from the study, an ETT Visit should occur as soon as possible after the last dose of study drug and a Safety Follow-up Visit should occur approximately 4 weeks ± 7 days after the last dose of study drug. 
If the subject withdraws consent for the study no further evaluations should be performed, 
and no additional data should be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 
8.1.6 Lost to Follow -up 
Part A and Part  B 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if both of the following occur: 
• Subject misses 2  consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is 
subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3 documented attempts by telephone 
within 2 weeks after the second missed visit). 
• Subject does not respond within 2 weeks to a registered letter sent after the 3  attempted 
telephone contacts. 
8.1.7 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
Part A 
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be formed using the  
 (Section 12.3.5.2) . The IDMC objectives and 
operational details will be defined in a separate docum ent (the IDMC Charter), which will be 
finalized before the first subject is screened in Part B. The IDMC will conduct a planned review of study data for the purpose of safety monitoring as outlined in the IDMC Charter. 
Part B 
The IDMC objectives and operational details will be defined in a separate document (IDMC 
Charter), which will be finalized before the first subject is screened. The IDMC will conduct regular planned reviews of study data for the purpose of safety monitoring as outlined in the IDMC Charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   8.2 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
8.2.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase  3, 2-part (Part A and Part  B), open- label, multicenter study evaluating the PK, 
safety, and tolerability of multiple  doses of VX- 661 in combination with ivacaftor in  subjects 
6 through 11 years of age with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation. Efficacy will also be evaluated in Part B. Part  A is composed of 
2 cohorts and Part B is composed of a single cohort. The open- label design is considered 
adequate to evaluate the PK and safety of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor in this 
pediatric population. Subjects will be divided into 2 weight-based cohorts in Part A so that 
the relationship between VX-661 PK and body weight can be explored a cross the entire 
weight range expected in the 6 to 11 year old population.  
The subjects studied are from the population that is expected to benefit from VX-661 in 
combination with ivacaftor. Part B is designed to evaluate the long term safety, tolerabilit y, 
and PK, as well as efficacy, of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor in the pediatric CF 
population. This design is in harmony with guidelines for the study of human subjects, especially children, and balances safety concerns with potential benefits for  the individual. 
8.2.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration 
8.2.2.1 VX-661 Dose  
Part A 
The 50 mg qd dose of VX-661 has been selected for evaluation in pediatric subjects 6 through 11 years of age in Part A of this study. A population PK model was used to simulate VX -661 exposure in subjects weighing 15 to 40 kg to represent the pediatric 
population in this study. The simulations indicate that a 50 mg qd dose in subjects weighing 15 to 25 kg and 25 to 40 kg will yield exposures comparable or lower to those observed at the 100 mg qd dose in adults, which has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious. 
Therefore, the dose selected for Part A is expected to be safe in pediatric subjects 6 through 11 years of age.  
Part B 
A review of safety, tolerability, and PK data was compl eted by an internal Vertex team after 
Part A to select the VX -661 dose for Part B. The PK data in Part  A were consistent with the 
predictions from the population PK model. Consequently, this model was used to simulate exposures for different VX -661 doses in weight ranges expected for subjects 6 through 
11 years of age. Based on these simulations, VX-661 doses of 50 mg  qd in subjects weighing 
<40 kg and 100 mg  qd in subjects weighing >40 kg were selected for Part  B to match the 
exposures observed at the dose of 100 mg qd in subjects 12 years and older. These exposures were shown to be safe and efficacious in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies (VX11-661-101, VX13-661-103, VX14 -661-106, and VX14 -661-108). 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 31 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   8.2.2.2 Ivacaftor Dose 
Part A  
Ivacaftor doses have been selected to provide similar exposures to those observed at the 
efficacious dose in adults. Based on population PK simulations, an ivacaftor dose of 75 mg q12h in subjects 6 through 11 years of age weighing <25  kg and a dose of 
150 mg q12h in subjects 6 through 11 years of age weighing ≥25 kg is expected to yield 
similar exposures to those observed in adults administered 150 mg  q12h.  
Therefore, the ivacaftor doses chosen for the pediatric population in this study (6 through 
11 years of age) are:  
• 75 mg q12h in su bjects <25 kg at baseline  
• 150 mg q12h in subjects ≥25 kg at baseline  
Part B 
For Part B, it was desired to provide similar IVA exposures to those observed at the 
efficacious dose in adults while maintaining the same TEZ:IVA  ratio in adult and pediatric 
populations. Following review of the safety, tolerability, and PK data from Part A, additional population PK simulations of IVA were performed to evaluate the impact on IVA exposures of increasing the weight cutoff from 25 kg to 40 kg to maintain consistency with TEZ dosing 
and the adult TEZ:IVA ratio. As expected, these simulations demonstrated that lowering the IVA dose from 150 mg  q12h to 75 mg  q12h in subjects weighing between 25 kg and 40 kg 
lowered predicted IVA exposures. However, IVA exposures were similar to those observed at the efficacious dose in adults. Additionally, the majority of subjects still achieved IVA 
exposures exceeding the model -predicted EC
90 calculated  for ppFEV 1 in the G551D gating 
population. 23  Given that the IVA EC 90 for G551D exceeds that for F508del and other 
mutations that are responsive to IVA in vitro (that is, these same exposures are predicted to exceed the EC90 for these mutations by even more than for G551D)
 24, increasing the IVA 
weight cut off f
rom 25 kg to 40 kg is not predicted to  impact efficacy.  
8.2.2.3 Study Drug 
Duration  
Part A 
Based on the PK of VX-661 and ivacaftor in adults, dosing for 14 days in Part A is considered sufficient to achieve steady -state exposures of VX -661, ivacaftor, and their 
metabolites.  
Part B 
The 24-week duration of dosing in Part B was chosen to provide an adequate assessment of long-term safety.  
8.2.3 Rationale for Study Assessments  
The safety and PK assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug development and are generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of subjects with CF. Ophthalmologic examinations were added to the standard safety assessments.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 32 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Ophthalmologic Examinations: A juvenile rat toxicity study performed to support dosing of 
ivacaftor in subjects <2 years of age demonstrated lens opacities in some animals .19 Prior 
studies in rats and dog
s of older age did not demonstrate similar findings. Given substantial 
differences between human and rat lens development, the finding is of unlikely relevance to 
humans. Periodic ophthalmologic examinations for children aged 11 years and younger receiving ivacaftor are being performed to confirm this interpretation. The overall data acquired to -date does not suggest an association between ivacaftor treatment and cataract 
development; however, a potential association has not been fully excluded. 
Spirometry: Since lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients 
with CF, CF lung disease is the desired primary target of VX-661/ivacaftor combination therapy. Spirometry (as measured by FEV
1) is the most widely implemented standardized 
assessment to ev aluate lung function. 
Nutritional Status (measured by weight and BMI): Malnutrition is common in patients with 
CF because of increased energy expenditures due to lung disease and fat malabsorption. Given that VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor is a syste mic therapy, it has the potential to 
improve extrapulmonary manifestations of CF, including those in the gastrointestinal system. Improved nutritional status, defined as an increase in weight and/or BMI, is considered an appropriate endpoint for therapies targeting CFTR and was used in previous clinical studies of CFTR-targeted therapies (Studies  VX08-770-102 and VX08-770-103). To evaluate the 
effect of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor on growth, change in weight and BMI will be 
determined.  
As children gain weight and height as part of normal growth, adjustment for age and sex is necessary to assess changes in nutritional status in a population of boys and girls in varying stages of growth. To evaluate the effect of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor on growth 
and nutrition adjusted for age and sex, weight- for-age, height- for-age, BMI- for-age, and the 
respective z -scores will be determined. Height and weight will be collected at the study visits 
indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
Sweat Chloride:  In patients with CF, the underlying CFTR ion transport defect results in 
elevated sweat electrolyte levels.25,26 The sweat chloride test (quantitative pilocarpine 
iontophoresis) is the
 most common diagnostic tool for CF. A sweat chloride concentration of 
≥60 mmol/L is considered to be diagnostic of CF, whereas <40 mmol/L is considered 
normal. Based on the mechanisms of action of VX-661 and ivacaftor, the sweat chloride test was included in this study as a measure of the effect of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor on CFTR activity.  
CFQ-R: The CFQ -R is a frequently used CF- specific instrument that measures the 
health-related quality of life of patients with CF.27,28,29 As VX-661 in combination with 
ivacaftor is a sys
temic therapy, it has the potential to improve respiratory symptoms as well 
as other extrapulmonary manifestations of CF. These improvements can be captured by the non-respiratory symptoms domains of the CFQ- R. Linguistically validated versions of the 
CFQ-R
30,31 are available, thereby allowing consistent interpretation of the results in this 
global study. The CF
Q-R will be used to capture and evaluate the impact of VX-661 in 
combination with ivacaftor on patient report of respiratory symptoms and other aspects of health-related quality of life.

with the medical monitor or authorized designee. See the Study Reference Manual for a more complete list of 
medications prohibited/restricted in the study.  
Detailed restrictions for fluid and food intake during study drug administration are presented 
in Section 10.2. 
9.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Part A and Part  B 
Subjects will abstain from all restricted concomitant medications as described in the exclusion criteria ( Section 9.3). 
Information regarding all prior and concomitant medications, including the subject's CF medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies administered from 4 weeks before the Screening Period through the Safety Follow- up Visit will be re corded in 
each subject's source documents and electronic case report form (eCRF).  
• It is recommended that subjects remain on their stable medication regimen for CF from 4 weeks before Day  1 through Day 14 ( Part A) or through Week 24 ( Part B) or, if 
applicable, through the Safety Follow- up Visit. Stable medication regimen is defined as 
the current medication regimen for CF (except for commercially available CFTR 
modulators ) that subjects have been following for at least 4 weeks before Day  1. Subjects 
must not initiate long -term treatment with new medication from 28  days before Day 1 
through the Safety Follow -up Visit unless discussed and approved by the Vertex medical 
monitor. Guidelines for stable medication regimens for CF are as follows: 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 41 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   o Subjects who are t aking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled 
antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
o Subjects who are on inhaled cycling antibiotics should continue on their prior 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of inhaled cycling antibiotics in the cycle.  
o Subjects who alternate 2  different antibiotics monthly should remain on the same 
schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of 1 of the inhaled alternating antibiotics.  
• Subjects may receive doses of prednisone (or prednisolone) of up to 10 mg/day 
(chronically), or prednisone (or prednisolone ) 60 mg qd for up to 5 days with tapering 
down to 10 mg/day within 2  weeks, without prior approval of the medical monitor. 
• Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments 
performed according to the guidelines provided in  Section 11.6.1. 
• Concomitant use of medications known to prolong the QT interval should be used with 
caution during the study, even though the effect of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor 
on the QT interval has been evaluated in a thorough QT study, which demonstrated no prolongation of the QT interval. Consideration should be given to obt aining an ECG 
when concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval is administered. 
9.5 Removal of Subjects  
Part A 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, and subjects may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, 
noncompliance (study drug dosing or study procedures), or administrative reasons. 
Part B 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treat ment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or 
Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided the subject has not withdrawn consent.  
Part A and Part  B 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return 
all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit, if applicable (see Section 8.1.5 [Part B]), and a Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable (see 
Section 8.1.5), and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs. 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 42 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations will be performed and 
no additional data will be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such wi thdrawal of consent. 
Subjects who are enrolled on the basis of a historical genotype result and whose screening genotype does not confirm study eligibility will be discontinued from study drug treatment, will undergo ETT and/or Safety Follow-up Visits per  Section 8.1.5, and will then be 
discontinued from the study. After discontinuation of study drug treatment, these subjects will not undergo any further assessments other than those performed at the ETT and/or Safety Follow -up Visits.  
9.6 Replacement of Subjects  
Part A and Part  B 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn for nonsafety reasons during the study drug treatment period(s) may be replaced at Vertex's discretion.

10.5 Missed Doses  
Part A and Part B  
If a subject misses a dose and recalls the missed dose within 6 hours, the subject should take his/her dose with food. If more than 6 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. For example, 
• if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00 hour, 
and the subject remembe rs at 12:00 hour that he/she forgot to take his/her dose, he/she 
should take the dose with food as soon as possible. 
• if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00 hour, and greater than 6  hours have elapsed beyond the sche duled dosing time (i.e., the time 
is past 14:00 hour), the subject would resume dosing with the evening dose at 
approximately 20:00 hour.

and amounts of (1) study drug received, (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects, and (3) study drug returned by the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials asso ciated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at 
the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee until inventoried by the study monitor. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the study. 
10.10 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug 
Part A and Part  B  
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects 
until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. At the end of the study, the study monitor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. If the study monitor authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with appli cable environmental regulations, 
institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented.  
10.11 Compliance  
Part A and Part  B  
For study drug doses administered at study visits, doses will be administered under the direct 
supervision of the investigator or designee.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 48 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   For study drug doses administered during the outpatient periods of the study, drug 
accountability will be assessed at each visit by counting returned dosage units. Discrepancies will be discuss ed with the subject and recorded in the source documents. If subjects 
demonstrate continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts, the investigator will contact the medical monitor to discuss discontinuing the subject from the study.  
10.12 Blinding and Unblinding 
Part A and Part  B  
This will be an open-label study; however, subjects and their legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) should not be informed of their study-related spirometry ( Part A and Part B), sweat chloride ( Part B)  
results during the Treatment Period.

The assessments described in Section 11.6.1 through Section 11.6.4 will be performed in 
Part B. 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 52 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   11.6.1 Spirometry  
Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines40 at 
the time points noted in T
able 3-1, Table 3-2, Ta
ble 3-3, and Table 3-4 according to the 
additional guidelines that follow. 
Pre-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who 
have 
• withheld their short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic 
(e.g., Atrovent) for more than 4 hours before the spirometry assessment; 
• withheld their long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) more than 12 hours before the spirometry assessment; and  
• withheld their once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide 
[Spiriva
®]) for more than 24  hours before the spirometry assessment. 
During the Screening Period, spirometry assessments may be performed pre- or 
post-bronchodilator. At all other visits, all spirometry assessments should be performed “pre-bronchodilator.” During the Treatment Period, spirometry assessments must be performed before dosing, unless noted otherwise. In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following: 
• If a subject's Day  1 spirometry is pre -bronchodilator, but on a subsequent visit, the 
subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post-bronchodilator spirometry will be 
obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled.  
• If on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry 
should be performed post-bronchodilator and all subsequent spirometric measurements 
(according to the Schedule of Assessments detailed in  Table 3-4)  should be performed 
post-bronchodilator. 
• Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as 
pre-bronchodilator or post-bronchodilator. 
The parameters listed below will be normalized using the standards of GLI .
38  
• FEV1 (L) 
• Forced vital capacity (FVC) (L)  
• FEV1/FVC (ratio)  
• Forced expiratory flow (FEF 25%-75%) (L/s) 
All sites will be provided with spirometers and associated materials to be used for all study 
assessment by the central spirometry service. Spirometry data will be transmitted to a centralized spirome try service for quality review.  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study- related spirometry 
results during the Treatment Period. 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 53 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   11.6.2 Sweat Chloride  
The sweat chloride test is a standard diagnostic tool for CF, serving as a bio marker of CFTR 
activity. Collection of sweat samples will be performed at visits specified in  Table 3-4 using 
an approved collection device ( Part B). Sweat samples will be sent to a central laboratory for 
testing and interpretation of results. Individual sweat chloride test results will not be 
disclosed to the study sites. Specific instructions for collection, handling, processing, and shipping of sweat chloride samples to the central laboratory will be provided separately.  
The sweat chloride test must be conducted predose relative to the morning dose of study drug 
during the Treatment Period. At each time point, 2 samples will be collected, 1 sample from each arm (left and right).  
In addition, sweat collection must be performed at the Screening Visit (Table 3-1 [ Part A] 
and Table 3-3 [ Part B]) if an eligible sweat chloride value is not available in the subject’s 
medical record (NOTE:  for subjects who are heterozygous for t he F508del-CFTR mutation 
and with a second CFTR allele with a gating defect that is clinically demonstrated to be ivacaftor responsive, this value may be obtained from a record collected prior to use of 
Kalydeco).  For subjects using a sweat chloride value documented in their medical record to 
establish eligibility, the sweat chloride test at the Screening Visit is optional.  
Collection of sweat chloride will not overlap with any other study assessments.  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study- related sweat 
chloride results during the Treatment Period.  
11.6.3 Weight, Height, and BMI  
Weight, height, and BMI (derived) will be assessed. Weight and height will be measured with shoes off at time points noted in Table 3-2 and  Table 3-4. Weight and height will be 
measured before the dose of the study drug during the Treatment Period.  
In addition, w eight, height, and BMI (derived) will be assessed  at the Screening Visit 
(Table 3-1 [ Part A] and Table 3-3 [ Part B]). 
11.6.4 Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised  
Subjects will be asked to complete the CFQ -R in their native language. The CFQ- R will be 
completed before dosing at visits noted in Table 3-4. The version and format of CFQ- R will 
be based on age at baseline, regardless of whether the subject changes age during the study. The questionnaires provide information about demographics; general quality of life, school, work, or daily activities; and symptom difficulties (pertaining to CF). Copies of the CFQ- R 
used in this study will be  provided in the Study Reference Manual. Validated translations of 
the CFQ-R, if available, will be provided for participating centers in non- English-speaking 
countries (if applicable) .
30,31 The CFQ -R should be completed before the start of any 
assessments schedu
led at that visit.  
11.7 Safety 
Part A and Part  B  
Safe
ty evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of 
vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations (PEs). 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 54 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   11.7.1 Adverse Events 
Part A and Part  B  
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. 
Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for 
documenting, grading, and reporting AEs. A separate document that details AE CRF completion guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided.  
11.7.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Part A and Part  B  
Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory with the exception of urine pregnancy tests, which will be analyzed at the clinical site . Blood samples requiring a 4 -hour 
fast for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected on Day 1 and Day 14 in Part A. Fasting is not required at other time points unless specified otherwise (see Section 10.2). All 
blood samples will be collected while subjects are in a seated or supine position. Specific instructions for the collection, processing, and shipment of samples will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual.  
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected as shown in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, Table  3-3, and Table 3-4.  Laboratory test results that are abnormal and 
considered clinically significant will be reported as AEs (see Section  13.1).

that preclude participation in the study, as deemed by the investigator, for a subject to rec eive 
study drug on Day 1. 
Pregnancy testing for female subjects of childbearing potential who are not abstinent 
(Section 11.7.8.1): 
Part A 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the 
Screening Visit (serum test), on Day  1 (urine test), and at the Safety Follow- up Visit (serum 
test). 
Part B 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the 
Screening Visit (serum test), on Day  1 (urine test), and every study visit thereafter (serum 
test). 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 56 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Part A and Part  B 
If a urine pregnancy test is positive on Day 1, study drug will not be administered and the 
pregnancy will be confir med with a serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin test. If 
confirmed, the subject is not eligible for the study.  
For pregnancy tests conducted after dosing, if a serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin test is positive, the pregnancy will be reported and the subject will be permanently withdrawn from study drug dosing as discussed in Section 11.7.8.2. If a pregnancy test is positive, the procedures outlined in Section 11.7.8.2 will be followed.  
CF genotype ( Screening Period only ): CF genotyping will be performed on all subjects to 
confirm the genotype documented in the subject's medical record. This assessment does not need to be repeated in the case of rescreening or for confirmed subjects in Part A who wish to participate in Part B. In subjects with the R117H  mutation, linkage to poly- T tract 
polymorphisms will also be determined from a second specimen. Specific instructions will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Alcohol Screening ( Part A Only): Subjects may undergo random urine alcohol testing if 
deemed appropriate by the investigator.  
Additional Evaluations : Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged by the investigator to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for 
management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon a s possible after 
the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local  laboratory value . 
11.7.3 Liver Function Test Parameters  
Part A and Part  B  
Liver Function Testing 
Liver function testing (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin) must be performed as noted in Table  3-2 and Table 3-4 for serum chemistry while subjects are 
receiving study drug treatment a nd at the Safety Follow-up Visit. These blood samples 
should be processed and shipped immediately per the Laboratory Manual. 
Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3  × ULN and clinical 
symptoms must be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by the 
central laboratory within 48  to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close 
monitoring of ALT and AST levels, as clinically indicated. In addition, if ALT or AST is >5 × ULN, repeat follow-up levels must be obtained within 7 ± 2 days. 
If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory liver function testing, a local laboratory may be used. Elevations in LFTs at the local laboratory must be reported immediately to the 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 57 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   medical monitor, and the subject m ust have the tests repeated and sent to the central 
laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study Drug Interruption  
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), 
and the medical monitor m ust be notified, if any of the following criteria is met: 
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or 
clinical jaundice  
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression. 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels have improved, study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours confirms the initial elevation . Subjects in whom treatment is 
discontinued for elevated transaminases should have their trans aminases monitored closely 
until levels normalize or return to baseline.  
Resumption of Study Drug 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation has been identified, study drug may be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. 
Approval of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation occurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 
11.7.4 Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, and P ulse Oximetry  
Part A and Part  B  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and 
select study visits (Table 3-1, Table 3-2, Table 3-3 , and Table 3-4 ). At other visits, 
symptom-directed PEs and symptom- directed vital sign assessments can be performed at the 
discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider
. 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes/ears/nose/throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations will be reported as AEs.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, and respiration rate. These will be assessed following a 5 -minute rest in the seated or supine 
position. 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 58 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to 
the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lu ng function. These will be 
assessed following at least a 5 -minute rest in the seated or supine position. 
11.7.5 Electrocardiograms  
Part A and Part  B  
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3-1, Table 3-2, Table 3-3, and Table 3-4 ). Additional 
standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated.  
The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supine position for at least 5  minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
• The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such 
as blood draws. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening and Safety Follow -up 
Visits. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and 
maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45  msec from the 
baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs 
will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value 
(>45 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until 
QTcF values from 2  successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the r epeat 
measurement.  
If the QTcF value remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from the average of the 3 predose values on Day 1 or ≥500 msec) on repeated measurement or is noted on >2 occasions with no identified alternative etiology for the increased QTcF study drug, then 
discontinuation from study drug treatment may be required after discussion with the medical monitor. Subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for increased QTc should have their QTc monitored closely until it normalizes or returns to  baseline.  
Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in a separate document (ECG Manual). 
11.7.6 Ophthalmologic Examination 
Part A and Part  B  
Subjects will undergo an ophthalmologic examination performed by a licensed ophthalmologist at the Screening Visit ( Part A and Part B ) and at the Week  24 Visit OR the 
Safety Follow -up Visit ( Part B only), which includes 
• measurement of best corrected distance visual acuity of each eye  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 59 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp  
The screening ophthalmologic examination must be completed and the results reviewed to 
determine subject eligibility . This examination does not have to be repeated if there is 
documentation of an examination that met protocol criteria and that was within 3  months 
before the start of the Screening Period. Subjects with documentation of bilateral lens removal do not need the ophthalmologic examination. 
If a cataract, lens opacity, Y -suture, or lamellar rings are identified and determined to be 
clinically significant by the ophthalmologist at the Screening examination, the subject is 
ineligible for study entry (see  Section 9.2). If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and 
determined to be clinically significant by the ophthalmologist after dosing, the subject and Vertex medical monitor will be notified. After discussion with the principal investigator who collaborates with the Vertex medical monitor, the subject may elect to continue or 
discontinue study drug treatment. If the subject discontinues study drug treatment, the subject should complete the ETT and Safety Follow- up Visits (see Section 8.1.5). If the subject 
continues study drug treatment, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered . 
In addition to the Screening Visit examination, an ophthalmologic examination will be performed by a licensed ophthalmologist at or within 28 days before the Week  24 Visit OR at 
or within 35 days before the Safety Follow -up Visit ( Part B only). For subjects who 
discontinue treatment after receiving at least 1  dose of study drug, the ophthalmologic 
examination may be completed at the ETT Visit OR at or within 35 days before the Safety 
Follow-Up Visit (if applicable [ Section 8.1.5]). Subjects who have documentation of bilateral 
lens removal are not required to complete the eye examination at the Week 24 Visit, the ETT Visit, or Safety Follow -up Visit. 
Additional ophthalmologic examinations may be conducted at the discretion of the investigator. The medical monitor should be notified of the results of any additional ophthalmologic examinations. 
In addition, at screening, the following history will be obtained for all subjects:  
• history of steroid use 
• history of trauma to the eye 
• any family history of glaucoma, congenital cataracts, or cataracts arising later in life  
11.7.7 Spirometry  
Refer to Section 11.6.1 for the spirometry assessment.  
11.7.8 Contraception and Pregnancy  
Standard contraception- and pregnancy-related information and requirements are provided 
below. It should be noted that some of this information and requirements may have limited applicability in this pediatric population.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 60 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   11.7.8.1 Contraception 
Part A 
The effects of VX -661 monotherapy or in combination with ivacaftor on conception, 
pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. Neither VX-661 nor ivacaftor showed 
any genotoxic potential in a standard battery of in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) studies. VX-661 and ivacaftor were each found to be nonteratogenic in reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits.
19,20 Subjects should follow the contraception requirements outlined in this study 
protocol. Hormona
l contraception is not an acceptable method of contraception for female 
subjects though it is acceptable for the female partners of male subjects.  
At this stag
e in the development of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, participation in 
this study requires a commitment from the research subject and his/her partner to use at least 1 effective method of birth control. Acceptable methods of contraception for participants of this study and their partners are listed below. Methods of contraception should be in successful use from signing of consent, approximately 28 days before the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted), and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented 
through examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas 
deferens by ultrasound or medical record before the first dose of the study drug. 
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential, per the following: 
o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy 
o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). Females who fall into this category are consider ed not to be of childbearing potential only as long as 
they have not had their first menstrual period. If a female achieves menarche during the study, she will need to provide consent for compliance (proper method of contraception or abstinence).  
o NOTE: Al l other female subjects  who have had their first menstrual period will be 
considered to be of childbearing potential. 
• Same sex relationships.  
Acceptable contraceptive methods:  
Acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects or male partners of female subjects 
include the following: 
• Vasectomy 6  months or more previously, with a documented negative postvasectomy 
semen analysis for sperm.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 61 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Condom and spermicide.  
• In countries where spermicide is not available, condom without spermicide will be 
considered acceptable.  
• Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contraception.  
Acceptable contraceptive methods for female subjects  include the following: 
• Bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6  months previously. 
• Continuous use of an intrauterine device (non-hormone- releasing) for at least 90  days 
before the first dose of study drug. 
• Barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical cap, or female condom) and spermicide.  
• In countries where spermicide is not available, barrier contraception without spermicide will be considered acceptable.  
• Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contraception.  
• NOTE: Hormonal contraceptives will not be considered as an effective method; however, 
female subjects are not required to discontinue hormonal contraceptives. 
Acceptable contraceptive methods for female partners of male subjects:  
• Bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6  months previously. 
• Continuous use of an intrauterine device for at least 90 days bef ore first dose of study 
drug. 
• Barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical cap, or female condom) and spermicide.  
• In countries where spermicide is not available, condom without spermicide will be considered acceptable.   
• Local regulations may require use of an additional acceptable method of contraception. 
• Hormonal contraceptives, if successfully used for at least 60 days before first dose of study drug.  
Additional notes:  
• Acceptable methods of contraception listed above are examples. Local requirement s may 
prohibit the use of some of these examples. Please contact the medical monitor with any 
questions. 
• A female condom cannot be used with male condom (as a double method of 
contraception) due to risk of tearing. 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with 
a partner of the opposite sex. 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 62 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according 
to local regulations and/or requirements. 
• Male subjects must not donate sperm after the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, and for 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant during the study through 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
• Male subjects whose female partner becomes pregnant through well-documented in vitro 
fertilization (donated sperm) or banked sperm (collected before the subject received study 
drug) must be compliant with the contraception requirements. In this scenario, the male subject and his female partner must commit to using barrier methods of contraception (to ensure there is no exposure of the fetus to study drug) for the duration of the study and until 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through 
90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
• Unique situations that may not fall within the a bove specifications should be discussed 
with the medical monitor.  
Part B 
Participation in this study requires a commitment from the subject and his/her partner to use 
at least 1 acceptable method of contraception, which must be used correctly with every act of 
sexual intercourse. Methods of contraception should be in successful use from at least 14 days before the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug.  
For female subjects using oral hormonal contraceptives: 
1. The oral hormonal contraceptives should be in successf ul use from at least 60  days before 
the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
2. Female subjects who change their method of contraception to hormonal contraceptive during Study 113 must use a second form of approved contraception for at least 60 days after beginning oral contraceptives.  
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
• If the male is infertile (e.g.,  bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented 
through examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound before the first dose of the study drug. 
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential, per the following: 
o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorec tomy/salpingo -oophorectomy. 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 63 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). If a female 
achieves menarche during the study, she will need to follow acceptable methods of contraception or abstinence.  
For subjects for whom contraception methods are not waived due to at least 1 of the reasons cited above, the following are acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects and their female (non -study) partners, and for female subjects and their male (non- study) partners:  
Table 11-3 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
• Male vasectomy 6  months or more previously, with a documented negative post -vasectomy semen analysis 
for sperm.  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide (either as a single product if commercially available 
and/or as allowed according to local regulations; otherwise condom and spermicide as separate products). 
• Female bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6 months previously.  
• Female diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge, each with spermicide (where available). 
• Female continuous use of an intrauterine device (non -hormone releasing or hormone releasing) for at least 90 
days before the first dose of study drug 
• Female combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) or progestogen- only oral hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation if successfully used for at least 60  days before the first dose of study 
drug or with a second form of approved contraception for at least 60 days after beginning hormonal  
contraception.  
 
Important notes:  
• Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these acceptable methods listed above. Please contact the medical monitor with any questions. 
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according 
to local regulations and/or requirements. 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active.  
• Female condom used with male condom (as a double method of contraception) is not an acceptable method of contraception due to risk of tearing; a different acceptable method 
of birth control must be used as described in Table 11-3.  
• Male subjects must not donate sperm after the first dose of study drug, throughout the 
study, and for 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
during the study through 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
Other situations that do not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the 
Vertex medical monitor on an individual basis.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   11.7.8.2 Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during 
study treatment and within 90 days after the last dose of the study drug. 
If a female subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, study drug must be permanently discontinued immediately. For male subjects, study drug does not need to be permanently discontinued if the female partner's pregnancy resulted from donated sperm or sperm banked before study drug exposure ( Section 11.7.8.1) . The investigator must notify the medical monitor and Vertex 
GPS within 24 hours of the site's knowledge of the subject's (or partner's) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. 
If the subject is confirmed to be on study drug, the subject or partner will be followed until 
the end of the pregnancy and the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow-up activities. Preg nancy itself does not constitute an AE. 
12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), and PK data analysis details will be provided in the Clinical Pharmacology Analysis Plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study.  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
Part A 
Sample size calculations were conducted to estimate the precision in deter mining VX -661 
clearance in pediatric subjects in the 2 weight -based cohorts. The method used 
noncompartmental analysis -based PK parameters, such as clearance and volume, in adults 
with the assumption that there is similar variability in clearance in adults  and pediatric 
subjects 6  through 11 years of age within each weight group. The calculations indicate that 
data from 8  subjects will allow 80% power to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the 
geometric mean estimate of clearance for VX -661 in each pediatric subgroup (cohort).  
Part B 
Planned enrollment is approximately 56 subjects. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, approximately 50 subjects are expected to complete Part  B. An important safety endpoint is 
the incidence of AEs.  Table 12-1 presents estimates of the probability for observing at least 
1 subject with an AE for the given incidence (θ) and sample size. With a total sample size of 50 subjects (compl eter), there is a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in at least 1  subject if the 
true incidence rate is 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate is 10%. The probabilities have been calculated by assuming a binomi al 
distribution for the number of AEs using SAS
®.

12.2 Analysis Sets  
Assignment of subjects to analysis sets will be done before the clinical data lock for the 
study. The analysis set will be defined separately for Part A and Part B.  
Safety Set (Part A and Part B)  
The Safety Set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Full Analysis Set (Part B Only)  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include subjects who carry the intended CFTR mutations (see 
Section 16) and received at least 1  dose of study drug. The FAS will be used for all efficacy 
analyses. 
PK Set (Part A and Part B) 
The PK Set is defined as subjects who received at least 1  dose of study drug and for whom 
the primary PK data are considered to be sufficient and interpretable.  
All Subjects Set (Pa rt A and Part B)  
The All Subjects Set is defined as subjects who are eligible for study enrollment and received 
a subject identification number, or were dosed. All subject data listings will be presented using the All Subjects Set, unless otherwise specifi ed. 
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of safety and efficacy data. The Vertex Biometrics department or a designated contract research organization (CRO) will analyze the data derived from this study. S AS Version 9.2 or higher will be used 
to generate all statistical outputs (tables, figures, listings, and data sets).  
Statistical analysis and presentation details will be provided in the SAP for the study. Details of additional supportive efficacy and safety analyses not included in the protocol may be provided in the SAP. 
12.3.1 General Considerations  
Data from Part A and Part B will be analyzed separately.  
All individual subject data for those who were eligible for study enrollment and received a 
subject identification number, or were dosed, will be presented in data listings.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 66 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Continuous variables  will be summarized by the treatment group (VX -661 50 mg qd 
+ ivacaftor 75 mg q12h, VX-661 50 mg qd + ivacaftor 150 mg q12h) and overall for Part A 
and by treatment gro up (VX-661 50 mg  qd + ivacaftor 75 mg q12h, VX-661 100 mg  qd 
+ ivacaftor 150 mg q12h) and overall for Part B using the following descriptive summary statistics: number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP.  
Categorical variables  will be summarized by the treatment group (VX-661 50 mg qd 
+ ivacaftor 75 mg q12h, VX-661 50 mg qd + ivacaftor 150 mg q12h) and overall for Part A and by treatment group (VX-661 50 mg  qd + ivacaftor 75 mg q12h, VX-661 100 mg  qd 
+ ivacaftor 150 mg q12h) and overall for Part B using counts and percentages. Percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place.  
Treatment emergent (TE) period  for Part A will correspond to data from the first dose of 
study drug in Part A to the Safety Follow -up Visit or 14 days after the last dose in Part A for 
subjects who do not have a Safety Follow- up Visit. Similarly, the TE period for Part B will 
correspond to data from first dose of study drug in Part B through the Safety Follow- up Visit 
or 28 days after the last dose in Part B for subjects who do not have an Safety Follow-up Visit. 
Baseline for Part A is defined as the most recent nonmissing measurement (scheduled or 
unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Part A. For ECGs, baseline will 
be the average of the 3  pretreatment measurements on Day 1. For sweat chloride, the baseline 
value will be the mean of asses sment values on the left and the right arm at the most recent 
time point prior to the first dose of study drug. The measurement end time should also be before dosing to be considered in the calculation for baseline sweat chloride. Baseline for Part B will be similarly defined.  
Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline value – baseline value.   
Relative change from baseline will be calculated as 100 x (post -baseline value – baseline 
value)/ baseline value.   
12.3.2 Background Characteristics  
Subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medications, study drug exposure, and other background characteristics will be summarized by the treatment group (VX-661 50 mg qd + ivacaftor 75 mg q12h, VX-661 50 mg qd + ivacaftor 150 mg q12h) and overall for Part A and by treatment group (VX-661 50 mg  qd + 
ivacaftor 75  mg q12h, VX-661 100 mg  qd + ivacaftor 150 mg q12h) and overall for Part B. 
All summaries described above will be based on the Safety Set for Part A and t he FAS for 
Part B, unless otherwise specified.  
12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition 
Part A 
The number and percentage of subjects in the following categories: All Subjects Set and Safety Set will be summarized. In addition, the number and percentage (based on Safety Set) of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., completed treatment, completed study; with a 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 67 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   breakdown of the reason for study discontinuation or treatment discontinuation) will be 
summarized.  
Part B 
The number and percentage of subjects in the following cat egories: All Subjects Set, FAS, 
and Safety Set will be summarized. In addition, the number and percentage (based on FAS) of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., completed treatment, completed study; with a breakdown of the reason for study disconti nuation or treatment discontinuation) will be 
summarized.  
12.3.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic, background (e.g., medical history), and baseline characteristics will be summarized separately for Part A and Part B. Important Protocol deviations will be provided as a subject data listing.  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized: sex, race, ethnicity, age, weight, height, BMI, region, pp FEV
1, sweat chloride, and score of CFQ- R 
respiratory domain.  
No statistical tests will be carried out to evaluate any baseline imbalance between treatment 
groups. 
12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications used in this study will be coded by using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced.  
Part A 
Medications in Part A will be categorized as the following:  
• Prior medication:  any medication that started before the first dose of study drug in 
Part A, regardless of when it ended. 
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE period 
for Part A. 
• Post-treatment medication: medication continued or newly received after the TE period 
for Part A. For those subjects from Part A who enrolled in Part B, medications that 
continued or were newly received on or after the first dose of study drug i n Part B will 
not be considered as post- treatment medication.  
A given medication can be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; 
or prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partial missing 
start/end date or time and it cannot be determined whether the medication was taken before first dose, concomitantly, or post-treatment, it will be considered as prior, concomitant, and post-treatment.  
Prior and post- treatment medications will only be listed and not summarized. The 
concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively based on the Safety Set.   

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 69 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   For Part B, assessment of efficacy is a secondary objective. The rest of the section will 
describe efficacy analysis of data from Part B.  
12.3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variables  
Not Applicable 
12.3.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variables  
Part A 
Not applicable 
Part B 
A summary of observed values and change from baseline by treatment group (VX-661 
50 mg qd + ivacaftor 75 mg q12h, VX-661 100 mg  qd + ivacaftor 150 mg q12h) and overall 
will be provided for all secondary efficacy variables based  on FAS.  
Absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 :  
Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 will be analyzed using a restricted maximum 
likelihood (REML)- based mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) approach that 
would include 'treatme nt', 'visit', and 'treatment by visit' interaction as fixed, categorical 
effects and 'baseline ppFEV 1' as continuous, fixed covariate. A n unstructured (co)variance 
structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. If the model fails to converge, a 
compound symmetry covariance structure will be considered. The degrees of freedom of the 
denominator will be approximated by the Kenward-Roger’s method.41 The estimated mean 
change from
 baseline through Week 24 within each treatment group and the overall t reatment 
will be calculated using appropriate contrasts. The corresponding LS means, P  value and the 
95% CI will be calculated and presented in a table. The primary assessment of efficacy will be based on these estimates.  
The estimated 
mean changes at post -baseline visits within each treatment group and the 
overall treatment will also be presented. The least squares (LS) means, P values and the 95% 
CIs will be presented in a table. The LS means (95% CI) for change from baseline at each visit will be plotted  for the individual treatment groups and the overall treatment group. 
Additional supportive analysis and sensitivity analysis may be described in the SAP. 
Relative change in ppFEV
1 from baseline through Week 24 : Analysis of this variable will 
be performed using the same approach as described for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from 
baseline.  
Absolute change in weight (/weight -for-age z- score) from baseline at Week  24: Analysis 
of this variable will be similar to that for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline. The 
MMRM will use baseline weight (/weight- for-age z-score) as covariate instead of baseline 
ppFEV 1. For this variable, the assessment of efficacy will be primarily based on Week  24.  
Absolute change in height (/height -for-age z- score) from baseline at Week  24: Analysis 
of this variable will be similar to that for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline. The 
MMRM will use baseline height (/height- for-age z-score) as covariate instead of baseline 
ppFEV 1. For this variable, the assessment of efficacy will be primarily based on Week  24. 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 70 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Absolute change in BMI (/BMI -for-age z- score) from baseline at Week  24: Analysis of 
this variable will be similar to that for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline. The 
MMRM will use baseline BMI (/BMI -age z-score) as covariate instead of baseline ppFEV 1. 
For this variable, the assessment of efficacy will be primarily based on Week  24.  
Absolute changes in sweat chloride from baseline through Week  4 and through 
Week 24: Analysis of this variable will be performed using the same approach as described 
for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline. The MMRM will use baseline sweat 
chloride value as covariate instead of baseline ppFEV 1. The estimated mean change from 
baseline through Week 4 and Week 24 within each treatment group and the overall treatment 
will be calculated using appropriate contrasts. The corresponding LS means, P  value, and the 
95% CI will be calculated and presented in a table. For this variable, the assessment of efficacy will be primarily based on the estimates for mean change from baseline through 
Week 24. Note that for each scheduled sampling time point, 1 sample from each arm would 
be obtained. The data analysis will use the average of the results from the 2  samples. 
Absolute change in t he CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline through 
Week 24: Analysis of this domain will be similar to that for the absolute change in ppFEV
1 
from baseline. The MMRM will use the baseline CFQ -R respiratory domain score as a 
covariate instead of baseli ne ppFEV 1.  
12.3.4 Safety Analysis

13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, 
Severity Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
13.1.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a preexisting condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1.  
13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs, will be assessed 
and those deemed a clinically significant worsening from baseline documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more 
of the following: 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 75 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the d ose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of 
whether the study a ssessment results are clinically significant will be made by the 
investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the clinical status of the subject indicates a life -threatening  AE. 
13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points:  
• For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, withdrawal of consent) 
• For enrolled subjects wh o have a Safety Follow -up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up 
Visit 
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, the earliest  of: 
o 28 days after the last dose of study drug, or 
o prior to the first dose of study drug in the extension study ( Part B). 
All subjects will be queried, using non-leading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and 
source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject's source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: 
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity 
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and non-serious AEs. 
The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 76 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Pr ogram, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
August 2012). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life-thr eatening.” In 
considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear i n the CTCAE will be determined 
according to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening 
(Grade 4) Any adverse drug experience that places the subject, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death  
 
13.1.1.5 Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to 
the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2.  
Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality 
Classification  Definition  
Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled 
out, and/or the event re -appeared on re- exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly rel ated There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as charac teristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the A E. The action 
taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 77 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/ Resolved 
With Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
13.1.1.8 Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospitalization, surg ery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of 
treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs 
after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 78 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurred  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and "severe,” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is  based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through 
the Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to 
Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAE s that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are 
considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours. 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Fo rm”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the Clinical Trials SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the Vertex Clinical Trials SAE Form.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 80 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (i.e., efficacy assessments) will require 
IRB/IEC notification before imple mentation, except where the modification is necessary to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the required regulatory authorities.  
When circumstances require an immediate departure from procedures set forth in the 
protocol, the investigator will contact Vertex to discuss the planned course of action. If possible, contact will be made before the implementation of any changes. Any departures from protocol will be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log.  
13.2.4 Access to Records  
The investigator will make the office and/or hospital records of subjects enrolled in this study 
available for inspection by Vertex or its representative at the time of each monitoring visit and for audits. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copying, as required by applicable laws and regulations, by officials of the regulatory health authorities (FDA and others). The investigator will comply with applicable privacy and 
security laws for use and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol.  
13.2.5 Subject Privacy  
To maintain subject confidentiality and to comply with applicable data protection and 
privacy laws and regulations, all CRFs, study reports, and communications relating to the study will identify subjects by assigned subject numbers and access to subject names linked to such numbers shall be limited to the site and the study doctor and shall not be disclosed to Vertex. As required by applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which the study is 
being conducted, the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the CRFs/SAE forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including the IRB/IEC, may also request access to all study records, including source documentation, for inspection. 
For sites p articipating in the study in the US, and in accordance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act and associated regulations (“HIPAA”), an executed 
HIPAA authorization shall be obtained by the site from each subject (or the legal representative of the subject) before research activities may begin. Each HIPAA authorization shall comply with all HIPAA requirements including authorization allowing the site access to and use of the subject’s personally identifiable health information, authorization for the site to disclose such information to Vertex, the FDA and other parties requiring access under the Protocol, and statements as to the purpose for which such information may be used and for how long. 
13.2.6 Record Retention  
The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH GCP guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 81 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   records, custody will be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and 
Vertex will be notified.  
13.2.7 Study Termination 
At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this study at any 
particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRBs/IECs may terminate the study at their center.  
Conditions that may lead to reasonable cause and warrant termination include, but are not 
limited to:  
• Subject or investigator noncompliance 
• Unsatisfactor y subject enrollment 
• Lack of adherence to protocol procedures 
• Lack of evaluable and/or complete data  
• Potentially unacceptable risk to study subjects  
• Decision to modify drug development plan 
• Decision by the FDA or other regulatory authority 
Written notifica tion that includes the reason for the clinical study termination is required. 
13.3 Data Quality Assurance  
Vertex or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the qualifications of each investigator, inspect clinical study site facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation. 
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into a CRF by study site personnel using a secure, validated web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. 
Vertex will have read -only access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database.  
13.4 Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to comply with GCP guidelines. On- site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness 
and clarity, cro ss-checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters 
will be performed. 
The study will be monitored by Vertex or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal 
visits from a representative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 82 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the 
investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. 
13.5 Electronic Data Capture  
Vertex will provide the study site s with secure access to and training on the EDC application 
sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct information in the CRFs on the 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
A CRF will be completed for each enrolled study subject. It is the investigator's 
responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject's CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject's participation in the study and will docume nt the dates and details of study 
procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user's  identification information and the date and time of 
any correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, including any changes made to the CRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival 
CRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator's study 
file.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   16 APPENDIX A: CFTR ALLELE MUTATIONS  
Subjects can either be homozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation, or heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation.  
Heterozygous subjects must have F508del  on 1 allele and a second CFTR allele that meets at 
least 1 of the following criteria:  
• Encodes a mutation predicted to have residual function  
• Encodes a mutation with a gating defect clinically demonstrated to be 
ivacaftor-responsive (subjects are eligible for Part A and may be eligible for Part B if 
clinical benefit has been demonstrated in  the corresponding adult population) 
• Encodes a mutation that is not likely to respond to VX-661 and/or ivacaftor therapy (subjects are not eligible for Part B)  
The lists below represent acceptable mutations for the second CFTR allele  for heterozygous 
subjects.

%PI: percentage of subjects who are pancreatic insufficient; SwCl-: sweat chloride.  
Notes: CFTR mutations that are not likely to respond to VX -661 and/or ivacaftor therapy were defined using 
3 major sources: biological plausibility for the mutation to respond (i.e.,  class), evidence of clinical severity on 
a population basis based on the patient registry CFTR2 (average sweat chloride >86  mmol/L, percentage of 
patients with pancreatic insufficiency [%] is >50%), and in vitro testing (mutations that responded with chloride 
transport <10% of wild -type CFTR were considered minimal function and nonresponsive). The clinical severity 
criteria (average sweat chloride >86  mmol/L, %PI >50%) do not specifically apply to the individual subjects to 
be enrolled in this study, but were used to classify the mutation status.  
a PI frequency is consistent with a residual function mutation, but this mutation is included because of SwCl - 
data and biological rationale, which suggests that this type of mutation should be severe and not responsive.  
b Unpublished data.  
c PI frequency is consistent with a residual function mutation, but this mutation is included because of SwCl - 
 data, low baseline in vitro conductance, and failure for ivacaftor to improve conductance by at least 10% 
 over baseline.

The power calculations are based on specific aim 1, with regards to changes in progesterone.  
 
SA1: To determine if vaccination with IIV prior to ovulation (day 11 of menstruation) is associated 
with changes in post -ovulation serum reproductive (progesterone and estradiol) hormone 
concentrations. -H 1: Post -vaccination serum progesterone concentrati ons will be lower in the 
month after vaccination than measured prior to vaccination.  
 
We are planning to study 30 adult non -pregnant women each year. Based on the results from the 
first 30 student enrollees, we estimate the log (base 10) mean (SD) serum co ncentration of 
progesterone during the luteal phase of menstruation prior to vaccination is 0.71 ( ± 0.51), and 0.58 
(± 0.54) post vaccination. This difference of -0.13 on the log (base 10) scale corresponds to a median 
ratio of 0.74 in other words, a 26% d ecrease in median progesterone levels after vaccination. The 
observed correlation in these log concentration values was 0.60. For a total sample size of 90 
women (base task order and 2 option years), assuming similar standard deviation in log (base 10) 
pre- and post - vaccination values as observed in the initial sample of 30, the following table shows 
to the power to detect a given median post -vaccination to pre -vaccination concentration ratio for 
several pre - and post - concentration correlation values. The se results are based on a type -1 error 
level of .05.

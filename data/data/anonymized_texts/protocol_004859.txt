Replication of the RECOVER-II Anticoagulant Trial in Healthcare Claims 
Data [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
January 25, 2021 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
1.RCT Details
This section provides a high-level overview of a published RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicateas closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.
1.1 Title 
Treatment of Acute Venous Thromboembolism with Dabigatran or Warfarin  (RECOVER II) 
1.2 Intended aim(s) 
To compare the risk of symptomatic, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with symptomatic deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) or  pulmonary embolism (PE) for dabigatran 150 mg versus warfarin. 
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  
The primary outcome of the study was symptomatic, recurrent VTE or death rela ted to VTE  
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
Assuming a primary event rate of 2% at 6 months follow-up and with a noninferiority margin of 2.75, it was determined that 
2,550 patients would be needed to capture at least 46 events and achieve 90% power to conclude noninferiority of 
dabigatran over standard therapy at one-sided alpha level of 0.025.  
1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding 
Major bleeding; RR=  0.69 (95% CI 0.36–1.32) 
1.6 Trial estimate 
RR = 1.08 (95% CI 0.64-1.80) comparing dabigatran vs warfarin (Schulman et al., 2014)

5. Cohort Identification  
 
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score -matched, retrospective cohort study design comparing 
dabigatran to warfari n users . The patients will be  required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 days 
before initiation of dabigatran to warfarin (index date) . We will restrict the analyses to patients with a diagnosis of proximal DVT 
or PE. 
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation 
 New use of dabigatran, exposure, and warfari n, comparator, is defined as no use in 180 days prior to index date . 
 5.2.1  Eligible cohort entry dates Market availability of dabigatran in the U.S. for treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism started on April 7, 2014  
• For Medicare: April 7, 2014 – December 31, 2017 (end of available data)  
• For Marketscan: April 7, 2014 – December 31, 2018 (end of available data)  
• For Optum: April 7, 2014 – March 31, 2020 (end of available data)  
 
5.2.2  Specify inclusion/exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define the index date . 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are provided in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables:  
 
Study drug:  
The study exposur e of interest is initiation of dabigatran. New i nitiation will be defined by no use of dabigatran or warfarin in the 
prior 6 months before treatme nt initiation (washout period). 
 Comparator: 
New initiators of warfarin, defined by no use of dabigatran or warfarin in the prior 6 months.  6.2 Covariates: 
• Age 
• Sex 
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days pr ior to 
and including index date  
 Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient  overlap 
between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment  and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B).  
  6.3 Outcome variables and study follow -up:  
 6.3.1  Outcome variables 
 Primary Effectiveness outcomes of interest: (definitions provided in Appendix A): 
 
• Primary Outcome:  VTE and cause -specific mortality  
• Secondary Outcome:  Individual components 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
oHospital admission for VTE (principal diagnosis position)
oCause-specific m ortality
§Inpatient mortality identified using discharge status codes from hospitalization for VTE
Safety outcome of interest: 
1.Major bleeding
6.3.2  Study follow-up 
Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of 
cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of dabigatran and comparator and will continue until the earliest 
date of the following events: 
•The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes,
•The date of end of continuous registration in the database,
•End of the study period,
•Measured death event occurs,
•Nursing home admission
oNursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little tono data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for
cohorts for the same reason.
•The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index drug (dabigatranand comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 10 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in ma in
analyses).
•The date of augmentation or switching from exposure to comparator or vice versa or augmentation/switching to any otherNOAC (e.g. switching from dabigatran to rivaroxaban would be a censoring event);
oA dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion
oAn added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
For the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching and treatment discontinuation 
will be replaced with a maximum allowed follow-up time of 180 days.

In order to complete the initial power analysis, the dummy outcome of a 90-day gap in database enrollment will be used. This 
outcome is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stage. Complete a 1:1 PS-matched comparative analysis using this outcome. PS should include only 3 covariates: age, sex,  and combined 
comorbidity index. Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008).  
•Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators and FDA. Reviewers evaluate the results of theanalyses described above in Sections 7 and 8, including numbers of patients, patient characteristics, follow-up time, and reasonsfor censoring by treatment group, as well as overall rates of outcomes and study power. These parameters are re-evaluated andreported in the subsequent sections, after incorporating feedback and refining the protocol.
•Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators, FDA, and assigned members of advisory board.

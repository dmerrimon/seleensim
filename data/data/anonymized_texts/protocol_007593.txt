1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
CLP 10023. B Protocol Synopsis  
Registry  Title:  SMART – A prospective, multicenter registry  assessing the embolization 
of neurovascular lesions using the Penumbra SMART COIL® System  
Objective:  The primary objective of this registry  is to gather post market data on the Penumbra 
SMART C OIL® System  (Smart System ) in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms 
and other malformations.  
Registry  Design:  This is a prospective, multi -center registry  of patients treated in accordance with the 
cleared indications for Smart, Penumbra Coil 400TM (PC 400), and Penumbra 
Occlusion Device (POD®). Data for each patient are collected in accordance with the 
standard of care at each participating hospital  through one -year follow -up.  
Patient 
Population: Approximately 1,000 patients with intracranial aneurysms or other malformations 
treated by Smart  at up to 100 centers will be enrolled.  
Sample Size 
Justification: Approximately 1,000 patients will be enrolled in this post market registry. Assuming 
an observed rate of 8.3% for the primary endpoint of re- treatment at follow -up, the 
sample size precision is ± 2% for this endpoint. Assuming an observed rate of 1.7% for the primary endpoint of procedural device -related serious adverse events at 
immediate post- procedure, the sample size precision is ± 1% for this endpoint. These 
precision estimates are based on binomial 95% confidence intervals. The sample size provides an adequate level of precision for these primary endpoints. 
Inclusion 
Criteria:  Patients enrolled in this registry  must sign the Informed Consent Form  and be treated 
according to the cleared indication s for Smart, PC 400, and POD, which include the 
embolization of:  
1. Intracranial aneurysms 
2. Other neurovascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations and 
arteriovenous fistulae  
Exclusion 
Criteria:  1. Life expectancy less than one year  
2. Smart, PC 400, or POD account for l ess than 75% of total number of coils 
implanted  
3. Patient previously enrolled in the SMART Registry  
4. Participation in another clinical investigation that could confound the 
evaluation of the registry  device  
Endpoints:  1. Retreatment through  follow -up  
2. Procedural device- related serious adverse events  
3. Ability to achieve adequate occlusion immediate post procedure 
4. Number of times re- access with guidewire was required due to catheter 
kickout  
Registry  Period:  It is anticipated patient enrollment will take 3 years. All patients are to be assessed in 
accordance with the standard of care at each participating hospital through one year 
follow -up.

2. INTRODUCTION 
 
Intracranial aneurysms are a significant health problem in the United States with 
an estimated 1% to 6% of the adult population harboring cerebral aneurysms.1,2  
The annual risk of rupture of an intact intracranial aneurysm is estimated to be approximately 1.9%.
2 If an intracranial aneurysm ruptures, blood leaks into the 
highly sensitive subarachnoid space around the brain, resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH is known to be a major risk factor for a stroke due to the 
irritation of the outer layer of the nearby blood vessels surrounding the brain.  This condition is associated with a high rate of mortality; close to half of ruptured aneurysms result i n death within six months.
2-4 Patients who survived the initial 
SAH are at significant risk of subsequent re-rupture.  Various reports indicate that if left untreated, there is a re-bleeding rate of more than 50% within the first six months from initial pr esentation of a SAH.
4,5 
 Even if an intracranial aneurysm does not rupture, it can lead to severe complications.  As the aneurysm grows, it can press on nerves, put pressure on brain tissue, or interfere with other arteries or veins. Blindness, paralysis, and other morbidities often result.  Thrombus can also form within the aneurysmal sac, 
break off, travel downstream, and cause an ischemic stroke. It has been reported that 2.2% to 23% of patients with unruptured aneurysms may eventual ly 
experience a rupture.
7,8 The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial 
Aneurysms evaluated the natural history of 1,937 unruptured aneurysms in 1,449 patients with a mean follow -up of 8.3 years.
8 It reported that 2.2% of these 
patients had a confir med rupture during follow-up, but 66% of them were fatal.  
Juvela et al. reported on the long term natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in a series of 142 patients.
7 With a median follow-up of 19.7 years, 
23% of the patients experienced a S AH, which corresponds to an annualized rate 
of 1.3%. The cumulative rate of SAH tended to increase with time, with a rupture rate of 10.5% at 10 years, 23% at 20 years, and 30.3% at 30 years after diagnosis. Approximately half of the  SAH patients did not survive. Thus, regardless of the 
rate of occurrence, fatality associated with this event is high in this cohort.
7, 8 
 Prior to 1995, the traditional treatment for intracranial aneurysms was surgical clipping, in which the skull is surgically opened so metal clips can be applied to the aneurysm’s neck to occlude it from the parent artery to prevent a rupture.
1 
This treatment, while effective, is high risk, highly invasive, requires an extended hospital convalescence, and is technically difficult to perform in certain regions of the brain (such as the posterior circulation).  Thus, this treatment modality is not a viable option for a significant number of patients, particularly during the acute phase of SAH, when the presence of cerebral edema and evolving thrombi formation render aneurysm access difficult, if not impossible.   In the early 1990’s, an endovascular treatment technique for intracranial aneurysms was first introduced by Guido Guglielmi, who used electrolytically detachable platinum coils to pack and embolize the aneurysmal sac.
9, 10 The 
 
Penumbra SMART COIL® Registry  
CLP 10023.B Confidential     Page 5 of 19 
rationale was to exclude the aneurysm from the circulation and thus reduce the 
risk of a rupture and SAH.  The Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) was not universally accepted at firs t but gained significant credibility after obtaining 
approval from the FDA for the intracranial aneurysm indication.  Moreover, a few well-conducted, prospective, randomized studies of both ruptured and unruptured 
aneurysms have demonstrated that angiograp hic and clinical outcomes from this 
treatment modality were equivalent, if not better, than those obtained from surgical clipping.
6,8,11,12 Results were found to be similar for both treatments 
regardless of the inter -study differences in definitions for th ese outcome 
measures.6,8,11,12 The most important landmark study was the International 
Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) in which a total of 2,143 patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were randomized to either neurosurgical clipping or endovascular GDC coiling. The results showed that at one year follow-up, 30.6% of the patients treated by neurological clipping were either functionally dependent or dead as vs. 23.7% of those treated by GDC coiling, which resulted in a risk reduction rate of 22.6%. And thus, embolic coiling has now become the standard of care worldwide for endovascular occlusion for both incidental and ruptured intracranial aneurysms.   
 
In light of the natural history of the disease, the primary focus for management of an intracran ial aneurysm must be to prevent its rupture and sequelae.   
 
The Penumbra S MART  COIL
® System  (Smart  System ), a new generation of 
detachable coils, is the latest in Penumbra’s line of embolization tools .  It has 
recently received 510k clearance in the U.S. and  CE Mark in Europe.  This coil 
system is specifically designed to promote aneurysm embolization . 
 Coil technology has evolved considerably since the initial introduction of the GDC coil over 25 years ago.  In recent history, coil development has mostly focused on the delivery system, or pusher technology, and detachment. The new Smart  System  not only addresses improvements in the delivery system, but 
importantly incorporates new technology into the actual coil implant itself.  Smart  
technology enables an  individual coil to become progressively softer as it is 
deployed, utilizes advanced materials to improve stretch resistance, and incorporates new processes to create accurate complex  and helical  shapes.  
 Current coils available to physicians have three principal levels of softness, 
standard, soft and e xtra soft. A conventional coil currently has only one level of 
softness, derived from using smaller platinum filaments than a standard coil to 
make soft and e xtra soft coils.  The level of softness of the Smart coils is 
determined not only by the diameter of the platinum filament, but also by a proprietary structural element inside the coil.   This unique development enables 
the Penumbra Smart  System  to become progressively softer along the length of a 
singl e individual coil as it is being deployed.  For example, deployment of a 
standard Smart coil begins with an atraumatic soft 2D loop, becomes standard for 
the body of the coil, and finishes with a soft proximal end. This progressive 
 
Penumbra SMART COIL® Registry  
CLP 10023.B Confidential     Page 6 of 19 
softness enables the coi l to be densely packed into a delicate lesion while 
maintaining catheter position and mitigating catheter kick -back at the end of 
delivery, which can preclude the successful complete embolization of the lesion. 
In addition, Smart  uses the latest ultra high  molecular weight polymers for stretch 
resistance, which are 3 times stronger than current stretch resistant materials such 
as polypropylene (found in most 10- system coils).  
 The Penumbra Coil 400
TM (PC400) system received  510k in the U.S. and has CE 
Mark . 
 PC400 fundamentally differs from other embolic products for treatment of brain 
aneurysms by offering the largest outer diameter coil available. PC400 has up to 
four times more volume per unit length than most other embolic coils available while still maintaining a soft and compliant feel.  Together, these characteristics represent the potential to improve the ability to densely fill larger aneurysms  and 
other neurovascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulae , thus triggering the healing process.  
 Penumbra Occlusion Device (POD
®), was developed to address a specific clinical 
need to rapidly and precisely occlude a target vessel. Current options for vessel occlusion are limited. Coils designed for aneurysms are not ideally suited for 
vessel embolization due to their tendency to migr ate with antegrade flow .  Other 
options, such as vascular plug technology for larger vessels , require access with 
large diagnostic catheters or even larger bore sheaths.   POD utilizes technology that delivers both variable sizing and softness to provide a solution for rapid and precise embolization of the target vessel. The technology achieves this range of features through the design of a distal anchoring segment, thereby immediately anchoring the device in a range of vessel diameters. The proximal segment of the POD achieves dense occlusion by packing a softer, smaller diameter segment tightly behind the anchored portion.   All three systems  (Smart, PC 400, and POD) above consist of: an implantable 
Coil constructed of 92% Platinum and 8% Tungsten round wi re, an attached 
detachment pusher, and a detachment handle (packaged separately) . The 
detachment pusher is comprised of a shaft with a radiopaque positioning marker, 
a distal detachment tip, and a pull wire. The d etachment handle is used to detach 
the coil  implant from the detachment pusher. All three systems are  designed for 
endovascular embolization of aneurysms and other neurovascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulae.  The i ntended 
users for this device are phy sicians who have received appropriate training in 
interventional neuroradiology.    These devices provide a comprehensive product family for the management of intracranial aneurysms and  other neurovascular abnormalities such as 
arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulae.

CLP 10023.B Confidential     Page 10 of 19 
5.5.1 Protocol Deviation  
Any deviations from the protocol identified during monitoring or through other 
means should be clearly documented. These include but are not limited to: 
• Subject does not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Incomplete or missing data  
• Failure to sign informed consent 
• Improperly  signed or incomplete informed consent 
• Delayed reporting of serious, device related, or unexpected  adverse 
events  
• Out of window visits or assessments 
 
5.5.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since this a post market registry , we will only be collecting Adverse Events 
(AEs) related to the procedure or device , unanticipated adverse device effects 
(UADE),  and all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) from the time of consent 
through registry  exit. If an AE  occurs that is not related to the procedure or 
device, it is not reportable under this Protocol.  
 
5.5.2.1 Definitions  
• Adverse Event (AE)  : An AE is any undesirable clinical event 
occurring to a patient, during a clinical trial, whether or not it is considered related to the device. This includes a change in a patient's co ndition or laboratory results which has or could have a 
deleterious effect on the patient's health or well- being.  
 
• Adverse Device Effect (ADE):  An adverse device effect related to 
registry  device(s).  
 
• Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  A SAE is an event that:  
a. Led to death  
b. Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the patient that: 
− Resulted in life -threatening illness or injury 
− Resulted in permanent impairment of a body structure or a 
body function 
− Required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization  
− Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to arrest permanent impairment to body structure or a body function 
− Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) : An event that has 
an Adverse  Device Effect, the specificity or severity of which is 
 
Penumbra SMART COIL® Registry  
CLP 10023.B Confidential     Page 11 of 19 
not consistent with the with the risk information described in the 
Instruction for Use or the clinical protocol.  
 
5.5.2.2 Relationship to the Registry  Device  
An AE is considered to be device- related when it is reasonable to believe 
that the event may have been caused by or is related to the device. Following definitions will be used to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of registry  device. Any g rading for relatedness  
other than ‘unrelated’ will be considered device related.  
• Definite:   The temporal sequence is relevant and the event abates 
upon device application completion/removal, or reappearance of the event on repeat device application  
• Probable:   The temporal sequence is relevant or the AE abates 
upon device application completion/removal or the AE cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s condition or comorbidities.   The AE is related or most likely associated with the 
device  
• Possib le: The temporal sequence between the device and the AE is 
such that the relationship is not unlikely or there is no contradicting evidence that can reasonably explain the registry  subject’s 
condition.  There is a possibility of a relationship between the AE 
and the device 
• Unrelated:   The AE is not associated with the device.   There is no 
relation between the AE and the device 
Similar grading will be used for assessing the relationship to procedure.  
5.5.2.3 Adverse Event Severity  
For the purposes of this trial, the investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event . 
• Mild:  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with 
the patient’s usual activity or is transient, resolves without treatment and with no sequelae 
• Moderate:  interferes with routine activity and/or requires 
symptomatic therapy  
• Severe:  Severe discomfort and significant impact on the subject’s 
ability to perform routine activities despite symptomatic therapy  
 Minimum requirements of data to be recorded are: type of event, duration of event (start through end), severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome and, if appropriate, causality.  
 
 
Penumbra SMART COIL® Registry  
CLP 10023.B Confidential     Page 12 of 19 
The Investigator is required to report any device or procedure  related AE, UADE 
and/or SAEs  to the Sponsor or its designee as soon as possible, but no later than 
24 hours after the event is known.  All serious adverse events or serious device 
effects must document an explanation of any medical treatment administered.  The form must be completed and submitted  to the Sponsor or its designee within 
five working days.   
 An event need not be reported as a SAE  if it represents  only a relapse or an 
expected change or progression of the condition that was the cause of treatment without any other symptoms and signs than t hose present before treatment. This 
type of event is considred an AE, and may not be reportable. 
 When appropriate, the IRB /EC shall be informed by the investigator about serious 
adverse events and adverse device effects associated with t he use of the product, 
and Penumbra is responsible for informing the Health Authorities and other investigators of such events as appropriate. 
 
5.6 Withdrawal of Approval 
 
The investigator shall report to Penumbra immediately if, for any reason, the approval to conduct the investigation is withdrawn by the IRB /EC. The report will 
include a complete description of the reason(s) for which approval was withdrawn. The investigator shall submit all reports in a timely manner.

8. ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS  
 
8.1 IRB/EC Approval  
 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the registry is conducted according to any conditions imposed by the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC), and all other applicable regulations. It is the responsibility of th e investigator to obtain approval of the registry  protocol from 
the IRB /EC and to keep the IRB /EC informed of any unexpected serious adverse 
events, serious adverse device effects, and amendments to the protocol , as 
applicable. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be filed by the 
investigator and copies sent to the Sponsor or its designee.  
8.2 Patient Information and Consent  
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to give each patient full and adequate verbal and written information regarding the objective and procedure of the registry  and the possible risks involved and to obtain signed informed consent 
from all patients prior to inclusion in the registry  unless the patient's health 
condition does not allow informed consent, in which case the state and national procedures will be applied. For patients being treated in emergent cases (i.e. ruptured aneurysm), patients will be allowed to be enrolled if they sign consent no longer than 1 calendar day after the procedure or if a legally authorized representative signs the informed consent form on the patient’s behalf. The 
original, signed consent is filed with the patient registry  records, and a copy is 
provided to the patient or legally authorized representative.  
8.3 Patient Data Protection  
 
The patients will be identified in the eCRFs with a unique patient identifier .  Only 
the investigator will have acce ss to individual patient data, as will the Sponsor or 
its designee for monitoring purposes only. Furthermore, the patients should be informe d about the possibility of inspection of relevant parts of the hospital 
records , including angiograms and other imaging scans, by the Sponsor or other 
health authorities, including the FDA. 
 9. STATISTICAL PROCEDURES  
 
9.1 Sample Size Justification  
  Approximately 1,000 patients will be enrolled in this post market registry. Assuming an observed rate of 8.3% for the endpoint of re- treatment at follow -up, 
the sample size precision is greater than ± 2% for this endpoint (95% CI: 6.6% to 10.0%).
14-21 Assuming an observed rate of 1.7% for the primary endpoint of 
procedural device- related serious adverse events at immediate post -procedure 
 
Penumbra SMART COIL® Registry  
CLP 10023.B Confidential     Page 16 of 19 
(data on file at sponsor), the sample size precision is greater than ± 1% for this 
endpoint (95% CI: 0.93% to 2.5%). These precision e stimates are based on 
binomial 95% confidence intervals. Hence, the sample size provides an adequate level of precision for these primary endpoints.  
9.2 General Statistical Methods  
 
This registry  is a single -treatment design. Hence, descriptive statistics will 
provide a basis for the majority of the analyses with a 95% two- sided confidence 
interval presented. For binary outcomes, the 95% two-sided confidence intervals 
will be calculated using bino mial intervals. For numeric measures, a confidence 
bound for the mean or mean change from admission will be constructed.   Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all baseline variables, effectiveness variables,  and safety variables, as 
appropriate. Continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, range, and median). Frequency counts and percentage of patients within each category will be provided for categorical data.  
 Results collected at multiple visits will be summarized at each visit for which they are collected. Summaries for all measures will include all observed data for each visit.  
 
9.3 Safety  
 
Tabulations of adverse events will be presented with descriptive s tatistics at 
immediate post procedure and follow-up visits. Adverse event incidence rates will be summarized by category and seriousness of the adverse event. Events will also be reported by relationship to the device.   
10. PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION 
 
The results of this registry  may be offered for pu blication and/or presentation. The 
investigators and the Sponsor shall collaborate in the writing o f the registry  to 
ensure accuracy.  The investigator agrees to use this data only in connection with 
this registry  and will not use it for other purposes without written permission from 
the Sponsor.

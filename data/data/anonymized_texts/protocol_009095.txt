Study design  
 
This multicenter Phase 2 clinical study will consist of a Main Period and the subsequent optional open- label extension (OLEX) Period. The Main Period will have a prospective, 
randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging, design with two treatment stages. In stage 1, the 
dose groups 20 units (U), 50 U, and 75 U will be investigated. Once all subjects of stage 1 completed Day 30±7 Follow -up Observational Visit V4, a dose escalation meeting (DEM) 
will be held. Stage 2 will be performed only if no safety concerns hav e been raised during 
DEM and will investigate the dose groups 20 U and 100 U. Subjects do not cross over from stage 1 to stage 2. A total number of up to 240 subjects with moderate to severe GFL at maximum frown as assessed by the investigator using the 4- point FWS is planned to be 
randomly assigned to one of up to four NT 201 dose groups (stage 1: 20 U, 50 U, 75 U and, if applicable, stage 2: 20 U and 100 U). 
 
Study procedures will be identical in both stages. The subjects will receive intramuscular inject ion of NT 201 according to their respective randomized dose groups administered at 
Merz Phrumaceuticals GmbH 
M602011015 SOP/245/EN -CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 
Version 2.0 (21-JUL-2023) 
the Baseline Visit V2 (Day 1) of stage 1 or stage 2. The injectio n at Baseline Visit V2 (Day 
1) of stage 1 or stage 2 and the following Observatio nal Visits (up to V15) comprise the 
main period (MP) ofthe study. 
Additio nally, subjects who have relapsed to basel ine status, will have the option to receive 
a follow -u ti·eatment with the market a roved dose of 20 U NT 201 for their GF 
This injection and the subsequent 
constitutes an optional open-label extension (OLEX) period in this study. 
MP 
Stage 1 of the study 
fu stage 1 of the study , eligible subjects, who had a success ful Screening Visit Vl (Day -
3 to -14), will be randomized at the Baseline Visit V2 (Day 1) to one of three dose groups 
of 20 U (n=30), 50 U (n=60) or 75 U NT 201 (n=60) according to the randomizat ion ratio 
1:2:2 . 
Once all emolled subjects for stage 1 have had their Day 30±7 Follow -up Obse rvatio nal 
Visit V 4, a blinded evaluation of safety data will be perfonned in a DEM. Based on the 
stage 1 data, a decis ion to proceed with stage 2 of the study with a dose group of 100 U NT 
201 will be made. 
Stage 2 of the study 
fu the case where no safety concems have been raised during DEM, stage 2 of the study 
will be started . After successful scree ning eligib]e subjects will be emolled and randomized 
at the Baseline Visit V2 (Day 1) to one oftwo dose groups of 20 U (n=30) or 100 U NT 
201 (n = 60) according to randomizatio n ratio 1:2. 
The obse1vation period for each subject (in stage 1 and stage 2) will be at least 180 days . 
Subjects who have relapsed to baseline status of their GFL based on the investigator's 
assess ment on the FWS at maxim um frown up to Day 180, shou ld complete the End of MP 
study visit at Day 180 of the study. Subjects who have not relapsed to baseline status of 
their GFL at Day 180 (V9) will continue to be obse 1ved for up to 180 addit ional days. For 
subjects who have relapsed to baseline status of their GFL betwee n Day 180 and Day 360 
the End ofMP can be perfo1med at each ofthe respective Obse1vational Visits. If no relapse 
to baseline status is meas ured, the End ofMP will be perfo1me d at Day 360 (V15).

Optional OLEX:  
 
Subjects who have relapsed to baseline status of their GFL in the MP will have the option 
to receive a follow- up treatment with the market approved dose of 20 U NT 201 for their 
GFL between Day 180 and Day 360. An OLEX Follow -Up Visit V16 will be performed 
30 days after the optional injection to document the occurrence of adverse events (AEs)/adverse event of special interest (AESIs).  
 
Study duration for each subject (in stage 1 and stage 2) will be at least 180 days, plus the individual duration of screening (up to 14 days), plus OLEX follow -up for subjects who 
elect to receive an optional follow -up treatme nt. The overall maximum study duration will 
be up to 390 days in case the subject will receive an optional follow -up treatment plus the 
individual duration of screening (up to 14 days) for each subject.  
 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be requested to come to the End of MP study visit. Please note that subjects who receive the optional follow- up treatment but do not attend the OLEX Follow -Up Visit V16 for any reason will 
not be considered as discontinued prematurely from the study.

4 INTR ODUCTION 
4.1 Study background 
Investigational product SOP/245/EN -CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 
Version 2.0 (21-JUL-2023) 
Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT /A) is synthesized by a wild-type strnin of the 
anaero bic bacterium Clostridium botulinum . BoNT /A is a pa1i of a high molec ular weight 
complex, which is fo1med by several hemagglutinins and other non-toxic non­
hemagglutinin proteins. 
BoNT /A acts selective ly on perip heral cholinergic nerve endings, resulting in a temporaiy 
reduction in muscle contract ion. Over the years , a lot of indicatio ns in the field of aesthetic 
dennatology and plastic surge 1y were found for BoNT /A prepai·atio ns such as 
hype rfunctional GFL due to muscle overactivity and ai·e treated commonly in daily practice 
and reseai ·ch [Imhof 2013 , Jones 2010 , Nestor 2011, Nettai· 2011 , Prager 2013 , 
Tamburic 2012]. 
NT 201 (United States Adop ted Name [USAN]: incobotulin umtoxinA) is a highly purified , 
freeze-dried fo1m ulation of BoNT / A and was first a roved on 31-MA Y-2005 in Gennan . 
, lll 
Cosmetic (Canada only for aesthetic use) and Xeomeen (Belgium and Mexico only). 
Medical back ground 
Ve1iical GFL betwee n the eyebrows ai·e cause d by contraction of the conugator muscles 
locate d above both eyebrows and the proce ms muscle at the root of the nose [Canuthers 
1996]. In subjects suffering from expressio n related GFL due to muscle overactivity , facial 
lines in this ai·ea beco me static lines fixed in the skin at rest early in the aging process. 
E ective manage ment o acia mes reqmres approac es mc u mg aest etic an 
surgical de1mato logical treatme nts such as peels, laser resurfac ing, fillers, and surgical 
treatments such as rhytidecto my, eyebrow lift, and blepharoplasty [Cather 2002]. Since 
surgical techniques involve risks and recove1y time, and rejuvenation and filler techniques 
may not achieve fully satisfacto1y results, minimally invasive local injection treat ment with 
BoNT /A rapidly becaine the standai ·d treatme nt when the first represe ntative of this dmg 
dass was approve d for treatment of GFL.

BoNT /A treatment is a minimally invasive aesthetic procedure and at 7 million was the 
leading non-surgical cosmetic procedure in 2016 in the USA [ American Society of  Plastic 
Surgeons 2017] . 
 
GFL are the historically first and most frequently treated aesthetic indication.  
 
Treatment of GFL mainly targets the corrugators and procerus muscles [ Carruthers  1996 ]. 
The usual number of injection sites ranges from five to seven, with men typically requiring 
more sites and a higher dose [ Jones 2017] . In GFL, local muscle relaxation is manifested 
as a reduction in the corresponding facial lines. The approved standard dose of NT 201 in this indication is 20 U [ Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH 2017 , Merz  Pharmaceuticals LLC 
2018] . According to the EU summary of product charact eristics (SmPC) the dose may be 
increased by the physician to up to 30 U if required by the individual needs of the patients. According to the American Consensus group about 30% of panel members use higher doses than the approved dose [ Carruthers  2004b ].

4.3 Risk-benefit assessment SOP/245/EN -CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 
Version 2.0 (21-JUL-2023) 
There is an increasing demand for longe r druratio n of effect follow in 
BoNT / A because this si ificantl influences atient satisfac tion. 
Previous studies have indicated that a longer duration of effect might be achieved with 
increasing <loses of BoNT / A while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. Doses of up 
to 80 U in the ti-eatme nt of GFL in 1:Il~ ere shown to be safe and well tolerated 
[Canuthers 2005a , Canuthers 2005 ~ ]. 
fu general, NT 201 is safe and well tolerated in the approved indicatio ns including facial 
aesthetic indicat ions such as GFL and upper facia l lines (please refer to the cune nt IB). 
Doses of up to 64 U NT 201 in the indicatio n u er facia l lines have been found tobe safe 
and well tolerate d and are ah-eady approved in the EU. And, 
as outlined above, there is literat ure evidence that <loses of up to 80 U are safe. Therefo re, 
75 U is a reaso nable highes t <lose in the first stage of the design. 
The mechanism of action and potentia l AEs following treatme nt with BoNT/A are well 
know n and qualitative ly no new AEs are expec ted in this study. Common undesirab le 
effects after NT 201 injectio n include local, generalized, or proced ural AEs such as 
injection site hematoma, injectio n site e1ythema, and ecchymosis . Local AEs are usually 
mild and tem orai in nature and enerall resolve s ontaneousl without intervention.

M602011015 SOP/245/EN -CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 
Version 2.0 (21-JUL-2023) 
Most of the complicatio ns of BoNT/A injectio ns are related to needle misplacement 
[Alimohammadi 2017 , Brodsky 2012, Rohrich 2003 ]. Deta iled knowledge of the exact 
anatomical relationships betwee n the muscles to be in' ected is ve1 im 01iant to avoid the 
deve lo ment of adverse effects. 
For this study only investigato rs experienced in the treatment of GFL with BoNT/A will 
be selec ted. To ensure exact placement of the injectio ns to targeted muscles , training of 
investigato rs during the investigato r meetings will focus on individual anatomy of the 
unde rlying facia l musculature and the physiologic interactio ns of the muscles. Moreove r 
precise and standardized injectio n techniqu e will be demonstrate d during these trainings. 
fu this respect, it should fmther be considered that treatme nt areas and injection points are 
in line with the approved label claims in the EU SmPC and the US presc ribing info1mat ion 
(PI) as well as with international guidelines. Hence, the study design will not induce further 
proce dure relate d risks. 
fu conclusio n the sponsor believes that this clinical study M6020 11015 is carefully 
designed to minim ize risks and to maximize potential benefits for the subjects. Based on 
available evidence, the benefit-risk-balance is considered as positive. 
The COVID -19 pandemic may impact the conduct of this clinical trial. Subjects may no 
longer be able to come to the investigatio nal site for planned safety and efficacy follow up 
visits due to quarantines, site closures, or travel limitations. Since ensuring the safety of 
the subjects is paramount , mitigation meas ures will be implemented. Subjects' safety will 
be monitored via phone calls at planned visit dates based on subjects' consent. Efficacy 
based on investigator assess ments will not be possib le under the circumstances mentioned 
above , however subjects' self-assess ments can also be perfonned safely at home. 
Therefore, subjects will be asked ifthey consent to perfo1m their self-assess ments at home. 
On-site visits should be perfo1med at the earliest possib le date the subject is able to safely 
come to the site again. fu conclusion the measures as outlined above are deemed 
appropriate to assure the safety of trial subjects and reduce the amount of missing data due 
to COVID -19 pandemic .

4.4 Justification of  doses  
 
 
 
 
In everyday practice some physicians do already use higher doses than the approved dose 
of 20 U in the treatment of GFL. According to the Consensus Recommendations on the use of BoNT/A in facial aesthetics [ Carruthers 2004b] 30% of the panel members use doses of 
up to 120 U in the treatment of GFL. 
 
The doses in this study were chosen in reference to publications and common use in aesthetic medicine.

Version 2.0 (21-JUL-2023) 
This mult icente r Phase 2 clinical study will consist of a Main Period and the subsequent 
optio nal open-label extension (OLEX) Period. The Main Period will have a prospec tive, 
rando mized, double-blind, dose -ranging, design with two treatment stages . fu stage 1, the 
<lose groups 20 U, 50 U, and 75 U will be investigated. Once all subjects of stage 1 
completed Day 30±7 Follow -up Obse rvational Visit V4, a DEM will be held. Stage 2 will 
be perfo1med only if no safety concems have been raised during DEM and will investigate 
the <lose groups 20 U and 100 U. Subjects do not cross over from stage 1 to stage 2. A total 
numbe r ofup to 240 subjec ts with moderate to seve re GFL at maximum frown as assessed 
by the investigator using the 4-point FWS is planned to be randomly assigned to one of up 
to four NT 201 <lose groups (stage 1: 20 U, 50 U, 75 U and, if applicable , stage 2: 20 U and 
100 U). 
Study proced ures will be identical in both stage - . Tue subjects will receive 
intram uscular injectio n of NT 201 acco rding to ~ e randomized <lose groups 
admin istered at the Baseline Visit V2 (Day 1) of stage 1 or stage 2. Tue injection at Baseline 
Visit V2 (Day 1) of stage 1 or stage 2 and the following Observatio nal Visits (up to V15) 
comprise the MP ofthe study. 
Additio nally, subjects who have relapsed to base line status in the MP, will have the optio n 
to receive a follow-u treatment with the market a roved <lose of 20 U NT 201 for their 
GF 
This injection and the subseque nt follow-up visit

MP: 
Stage 1 of the study 
fu stage 1 of the study , eligible subjects, who had a successfu l Screening Visit VI (Day -
3 to -14), will be rando1nized at the Baseline Visit V2 (Day 1) to one ofthree <lose groups 
of 20 U (n=30), 50 U (n=60) or 75 U NT 201 (n=60) acco rding to the randoinizat ion ratio 
1:2:2 . 
Once all emolled subjects for stage 1 have had their Day 30±7 Follow- up Observatio nal

In addition to the blinded safety data evaluation (once all subjects of stage 1 completed 
Day 30±7 Follow -up Observational Visit V4), an interim analysis will be performed once 
complete 180- day data (V9) of stage 1 are available. Data will be unblinded for sponsor 
staff and vendor data management and biostatistics staff only with regard to stage 1 
subject’s assignment to treatment groups. The blind for subjects in stage 2 will be maintained. Stage 2 subjects, if applicable, will not be included in the 180- day interim 
analysis. For more details see Section 12.4.7.2.  
An interim analysis of complete Stage 1 MP data will be performed as soon as data until and including the End of  MP visit V15 from Stage 1 subjects’ are completely available 
(except for missingness due to premature study discontinuation or intermittently missing visits). The analysis of Stage 1 MP data will serve to get further insights regarding duration of effect and occurrence of TEAEs over the entire Main Period of up to 360 days. Knowledge gained form the interim analysis at End of MP of Stage 1 will be useful to decide whether it is still meaningful to motivate affected Stage 2 subjects to re -assume on -
site vis its depending on the number of missing visits for the primary efficacy variable. 
Since ensuring the safety of subjects is paramount, this analysis will be valuable to balance the potential risks of further onsite visits against benefits such as avoidance of missing data and premature study discontinuations. Investigators and subjects, site staff and blinded monitor will be kept blinded throughout for both stages until final unblinding. The blind for subjects in Stage 2 will be completely maintained.  
 
Stage 2 of the study 
 
In the case where no safety concerns have been raised during DEM (see Section 12.4.7.3), stage 2 of the study will be started. After successful screening, eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized at the Baseline Visit V2 (Day 1) to one of two dose groups of 20 U (n=30) or 100 U NT 201 (n = 60) according to randomization ratio 1:2. 
 
 
The observation period for each subject (in stage 1 and stage 2) will be at least 180 days. 
Subjects who have relapsed to baseline status of their GFL based on the investigator’s assessment on the FWS at maximum frown up to Day 180, should complete the End of MP study visit at Day 180. Subjects who have not relapsed to baseline status of their GFL at Day 180 (V9) will continue to be observed for up to 180 additional days. For subjects who have relapsed to baseline status of their GFL between Day 180 and Day 360 the End of MP can be performed at each of the respective Observational Visits. If no relapse to baseline status is measured, the End of MP will be performed at Day 360 (V15).

6.2 Discussion of study design, including choice of control groups  
 
This prospective, randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging, multicenter, phase 2 clinical 
study is designed to investigate the safety and duration of effect of different NT 201 dose 
groups following the treatment of GFL. 
 
The recommended dose of 20 U NT 201 used in the US and the 20 to 30 U used in the EU for the treatment of GFL has been proven effective and safe in numerous clinical st udies 
and there is a long term experience in clinical practice. In this study, higher doses of NT 201 (50 U, 75 U, and 100 U) are compared to this currently approved dose. The focus of the study is the safety and duration of effect.  
 
To reduce the risk of subjects, a two -stage design was  chosen and the highest  dose   (100 
U) is only investigated when acceptable safety based on predesigned criteria was proven for the 50 U and 75 U doses (see Section 12.4.7.3). To ensure blinding and comparability of the results, subjects will be enrolled in the 20 U dose group in both stages. 
 
The DEM will be performed when all enrolled  subjects  for  stage  1  have  had  their Day 30±7 Follow -up Observational Visit. Selection of this time p oint ensures timely decision 
on the continuation with stage 2 as well as an accurate measurement of safety as the treatment will already have reached its peak  effect.  
 
Both stages use a randomized double -blind design. Although an unblinded interim analysis  
will be performed on the 180-day data of stage 1 subjects, the blind will be maintained for investigators, subjects, site staff and monitors to ensure unbiased continuation of the study.  
 
Subjects will be enrolled regardless of gender, age, ethnic background and pre -treatment 
status to represent the average target population that is seeking GFL treatment.  
 
Wash out  period  for  BoNT/A  treatment  in  the  targeted  areas  before  the  study  is  12 months, ensuring that no BoNT/A activity from former treatments is  left. 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is duration of effect. The observation period of up to one year, represents a reasonable time that the IP will have worn off in most of the 
treated subjects, considering the higher doses applied, and ensuring that the primary efficacy endpoint can be measured in a reasonable number of subjects.  
 
subjects who have relapsed 
to base
line status in the MP will have the option t o receive a follow -up treatment with  the 
market  approved dose of 20 U NT 201 for their GFL  between  Day 180 and Day 
360.

7 S TUDY  POP ULATION 
 
7.1 Selection of study  population 
 
Subjects with moderate (score = 2) to severe (score = 3) GFL at maximum frown as 
assessed by the investigator and subject using the 4 -point FWS at screening will be enrolled 
in this study. 
 
Treatment -naïve subjects or pre -treated (non -naïve) su bjects may enter the study. Pre - 
treated subjects must not have received treatment with BoNT of any serotype in the facial area within the last 12 months before injection. 
 
To support the recruitment process, recruitment advertisements approved by the responsible IECs/IRBs will be published as required. 
 
Distribution of gender  
 
No stratification regarding gender is planned. Subjects will be recruited regardless of their gender, ethnicity and age. This study population will therefore be expected to be a representative sample of the target population for the indication of moderate to severe GFL.  
 
7.2 Inclusion criteria  
 
Only subjects meeting all of the following inclusion criteria at the Screening Visit V1 (Day -3 to - 14) and/or the Baseline Visit V2 (Day 1) (as indicated below) will be considered for

7.4 Removal of subjects from treatment or  assessment  
 
7.4.1  Discontinuation of subject’s study  participation  
 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the informed consent form, the subject 
may end his/her participation in the study at any time without any penalty or loss of benefits 
to which the subject is otherwise entitled (see Section 7.4.3). Both the fact and the reason(s) why the subject’s participation in the study was prematurely discontinued must be recorded in the source documentation (e.g. subject file) and the electronic case report form (eCRF). Date and discontinuation circumstances should be stated. 
 
The investigator must discontinue the subject’s study participation at any time, if any of the following occurs: 
 
• Withdrawal of informed consent. 
• Pregnancy prior to injection of IP (in case of pregnancy after a subject has received 
an injection the subject can continue with applicable study visits until the end of the study but without any invasive procedure, e.g. injections, blood draw, or any other interventional procedure). However the subject is free to discontinue the study at any time.  
 
• Any AE for which treatment continuation would constitute an unacceptably high risk 
for the  subject.  
 
Deviations from this study protocol, or conditions comprising exclusion criteria established 
in Section 7.3 that arise after the subject has been included in the study may (but will not 
necessarily) lead to the discontinuation of subject’s study participation. All such conditions must be properly documented. 
 
Subjects who discontinue the study because of AEs will be treated according to standard clinical procedures and will be followed up until the End of MP if no optional tr eatment 
was received or the OLEX Follow -up Visit V16 if optional treatment was received (see 
Section 6.1) as described in Section 10.1. All pertinent information concerning the AE will 
be documented in the source documentation as well as in the eCRF AE report form. 
 
Following discontinuation the End of MP is to be documented. The investigator is required to make every effort to contact subjects lost to follow -up, and all such efforts are to be 
documented in the source documentation (e.g., times and dates of telephone contact, copies of letters). Please note that subjects who receive optional follow -up treatment but do not 
attend the OLEX Follow -Up Visit V16 for any reason will not be considered as  
discontinued prematurely from the study.

7.4.2  Premature termination or suspension of the study or 
closure/suspension of a study  site 
 
The study or a study site can be prematurely terminated or suspended by the sponsor. Reasons for termination of the study or closure of a study site may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Subject enrollment is  unsatisfactory. 
• The risks and benefits of continuing the study have been reassessed, and the risks 
outweigh any potential benefit s. 
 
• The incidence of AEs constitutes a potential health hazard to the subjects.  
• New scientific data on the IP(s) do not justify a continuation of the study. 
• The investigator or study site exhibits serious and/or persistent non- adherence to the 
clinical study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH–GCP, and/or applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
• The sponsor decides to terminate the study at any time for any other reason.  
Furthermore, the study may be prematurely ended if the regulatory authority or the 
IEC/IRB has decided to withdraw or suspend approval for the study, the study site, or the investigator. 
 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, the investigator must inform the subjects and ensure appropriate follow -up treatment. Within the timeframes 
noted in applicable regulations, the sponsor will promptly inform the investigators, study sites, the IEC/IRB, and regulatory authorities of the termination or suspension of the study, as well as provide reasons for the action.  
 
7.4.3  Provision of care for subjects after discontinuation of the  study  
 
After study discontinuation, the subjects will be treated by their physician according to their medical condition and standard treatments in the country concerned.

subject is given to the investigator via the IWRS or is given to the investigator on a printed . . . ' . . . 
The investigator must administer the IP to the subject during the injection visits only. IP 
must not be handed over to subjects. 
The IWRS will assign IP to each subject at baseline or at Vl 5 for the optional follow-up 
treatment. If an IP vial shou ld be broken , or becomes unusable for any reason, the 
medication-box / vial must be replaced from the site stock of study medication and the 
medication number and reason for unusability will be recorded in the IWRS. 
The study medication must be labeled according to regulato1y requirements in the 
paiticipat ing count ries. The label will includ e as minimum infonnation the naine and 
address of the sponsor, study reference numb er, European clinical trial database 
(EudraC T)/ Investigational new drng (IND) number, medication numb er, the dosage f01m, 
route of admin istration, quantity of dosage units, batch number, directions for use, storage 
conditi ons, period of use, and the waining 'For clinical study use only' . German labels will

8.1.4  Accountability for investigational  product(s)  
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator or pharmacist according to local law to ensure 
that a current record of inventory/drug accountability is maintained. Inventory records must 
be readily available for inspection by the unblinded study monitor and are open to inspection by the FDA or other regulatory authorities at any time. Each shipment o f 
materials for the study will contain an ‘IP supply and return form’ to assist the investigator in maintaining up- to-date and accurate inventory records. This form includes the following 
information: study number, dates, quantities, batch number, expiration date, and the medication number assigned to the IP. 
 
Upon receipt of the IP(s), the investigator - pharmacist according to local law - must 
visually inspect the shipment and verify the number and condition of the IP(s), and acknowledge the receipt in the IWRS. An ‘IP supply and return form’ must be completed and signed by the investigator or authorized site staff or pharmacist according to local law. The original completed and signed form must be filed with the inventory/drug accountability records. Instead of paper forms IWRS print-outs can be used, if applicable. 
 
To ensure proper storage and to verify the inventory, a drug supply inspection will be conducted at regular intervals by the unblinded monitor. The results of the inspection will be made available to the authorized individuals (e.g., unblinded monitor, auditor, and regulatory authorities) on request throughout the study. 
 
For further details, see Section 8.2.5. 
 
8.1.5  Destruction of investigational  product( s) 
 
Any used syringes, spillages, or other materials that have been in contact with the IP must be disposed adequately. Any reconstituted IP if (partially) used or unused must be 
inactivated appropriately at the site, e.g. by autoclaving  
.

fu cases where reconst ituted product has been spilled, diy, absorbent material should be 
used. If the product comes into contact with skin, the affected area should be abunda ntly 
rinsed with wate r. If product gets into the eyes , they shou ld be rinsed thoroughly with 
plenty ofwate r or with an ophthalmic eyewas h solution. If prod uct comes into contact with 
a wound or damaged skin, the area should be rinsed thoroughly with plenty of water and 
appropriate medical steps accor ding to the <lose injected shou ld be taken. 
Upon the completion or tennination of the study , all used and unused vials of IP must be 
retumed to the sponsor or another authorized party. Destiuctio n of IP(s) at the study site 
may be allowed if written authorization is provided by the sponsor. If destiuctio n at the 
study site is agree d upon, then a ce1tificate of destiuctio n must be given to the sponsor.

20 U or 100 U with a randomizat ion ratio 1 :2. Randomized subjects disco ntinued from the 
study will not be replaced . 
Randomizat ion in blocks of appropr iate size and by IWRS will ensure appro priate conti ·ol 
of sti·ati ficatio n. Tue block size will not be disclosed to investigators until the study is 
unblinded. Subjects will receive a subject /screening number through the IWRS , as well as 
a randomizatio n number, if randomized.

The investigato r will enter the subject in the IWRS and confüm successful scree ning. Tue 
IWRS will then assign to each subject a randomizat ion number and the unique medicatio n 
numbe r of the IP kit tobe used for injection. The screening, randomization , and medicat ion 
numbe rs will be recorded in the eCRF . 
The unblinded study nurse /phaimacist responsible for preparatio n of the IP will add a 
sticker with the medication number (provided in the IP kit) on the ready for use syringe to 
ensure conect assig nment to the subject by the investigato r or a printed note accompa nying 
the syringe stating subject/sc reening number and medicatio n number. 
Subjects who are withdraw n prematurely will retain their screening and randomizatio n 
numbe rs, if applicable. 
The rando mization schedules for stage 1 and 2, respectively, will be sealed and locked at 
the sponsor's site and will not be access ible to any blinded functio ns in the study prior to 
applicab le unblinding. 
As all subjects will receive 20 U ofNT 201 in the optional follow-up treatme nt, no fmiher 
randomizatio n is required. The unique medicatio n number of the IP kit for the optional 
follow-up treatme nt as assigned to the subject by IWRS will the recor ded in the eCRF. 
8.2.2 Selection of doses in the study 
In the present study 20 U, 50 U and 75 U NT 201 are used in stage 1 and 20 U and 100 U

Version 2.0 (21-JUL-2023) 
Subjects (in stage 1 and stage 2) who have relapsed to baseli ne statlls in the MP will have 
the optio n to receive a follow -up treatme nt with the market approved <lose of 20 U NT 201 
for their GFL betwee n Day 180 and Day 360. 
For more detai ls see Section 8.1.1.2 and Sectio n 8.2.1. 
8.2.4 Duration of treatment per subject 
There is one planned study ti-eatment at the Base line Visit V2 (Day 1) of stage 1 and stage 
2 and one optional follow-up ti·eatme nt for subjects who have relapsed to baseline status of 
their GFL in the MP. Tue overall study duratio n for each subject will be at least 180 days, 
plus the individual duration of screening (up to 14 days), plus 30 days OLEX follow-up for 
subjects who elect to receive an optional follow-up ti·eatme nt. Tue overall maximum study 
duration could be up to 390 days for subjects who receive an optional follow -up ti·eatment, 
plus the individual duration of screening (up to 14 days) for each subject. 
8.2.5 Treatment compliance 
The IP(s) will be admin istered by inh'amuscular injectio n perfo 1med by the investigato r 
during the subject's visit to the investigationa[ site. Thus, füll treatme nt complia nce is 
assured for each individual subject. 
At the beginning of the study , the site will receive dmg accountabi lity fo1ms to docume nt 
how and when IP is administered to subjects, or remains unused. These fonns will be made 
available to the authorized individuals (e.g., monitor, auditor) and will include the 
following infonnation: study number, dates , quantities , and the medicat ion number 
assigned to the IP and study subjects. IWRS print outs can also be used for docume ntation. 
8.2.6 Treatment of overdose 
An overdose is defined as any deviation from the speci fied <lose in the protocol ( <loses that 
are higher than recommended) . Any overdose must be recorded in the IP section of the 
eCRF and the source docume nts. Any case of overdose leading to AEs, SAEs or AESis 
must be reported to the CRO in an expedited manner using the appropr iate repoiting fo1m 
(see Sectio n 10.1). 
As ti·eatment with IP is perfonned exclusively in a clinical setting under the supervision of 
ti·ained medical perso nnel, the risk of overdose in this study is estimated tobe ve1y low.

There is no significant information regarding overdose from clinical studies in adults with 
GFL as they will be treated in this clinical study. In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating physician should closely monitor the subject for any AE/SAE and 
document the quantity of the excess dose. Excessive doses of NT 201 may be expected to produce neuromuscular weakness with a variety of symptoms. Signs include acute symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis with prominent bulbar palsies such as diplopia, dysphonia, and dysphagia, which would typically occur 12 to 72 hrs after exposure [ Arnon 
2001] . Furthermore, signs and symptoms of overdose can result in ptosis, generalized 
muscle weakn ess and paralysis of respiratory muscle leading to aspiration pneumonia. 
Clinical cases of iatrogenic botulism after BoNT injection were reported for four adult patients whose clinical signs were consistent with those of naturally occurring botulism [Chertow 2006] . 
 
Symptoms of overdose are not immediately apparent following injection. By the time symptoms of intoxication are observed, treatment with anti -toxin will no longer be 
effective because the neurotoxin has already ir reversibly blocked the transmitter release. 
Compounds releasing acetylcholine (e.g., physostigmine, guanidine, 3,4- diaminopyridine) might be helpful. However, there is no experience with a specific antidote to BoNT including NT 201 in the clinical management of overdose. A published case report describes the successful treatment of dysphagia with intranasal neostigmine [ Marchini 
1997] . 
 
Subjects should be advised to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as swallowing difficulties, speech or breathing problems occur. Subjects will receive a subject 
card with contact information in case of emergency (see Section 3.3.3) if additional information on the scope of the study should be required. 
 
Should accidental injection or oral ingestion occur, the subject should be medically supervised for several weeks for signs and symptoms of excessive muscle weakness or paralysis. Symptomatic treatment may be necessary. Respiratory support may be required where excessive doses cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Antitoxin would not reverse any BoNT -induced effects already apparent by the time of antitoxin administration.  
 
8.3 Previous and concomitant  therapies  
Before enrollment, the subject’s m edical history should include a detailed list of all 
medications (including rescue medication) that the subject was taking for a period of at least 30 days prior to screening. The record should include the drug name (trade or generic), route of administration (e.g., intravenous, oral), total daily dose/unit (expressed in mg, mL, or IU), indication, the start and stop date (day, month, and year) for each

facilitate consistent conditions for all subjects all make-up and evident jewehy has tobe 
removed from the face prior to any clinical assess ment s and self-assess ment s. The study 
staff will ensure the subject can perfo1m assessments independentl y at a place with 
adequate lighting and without disturban ce at the beginnin g of the respective study visit. 
Furthennore , a minor will be provided so that subject s can control respecti vely for their 
- GFL appearance. 
If on-site visits due to COVID -19 restrictions are not possible , efficacy live assess ment s 
by the investigator cannot be perfo1med and will inevitably lead to missing data. 
Subjects who prov ide their consent for self-assess ment of efficacy at home will be re­
instrncted on how to perfonn their self-assess ment s durin g the safety call. Subjects will be 
reminded to wear no make-up and evident jewehy durin g self-assess ment. Moreover, 
subject s will be requested to perfo 1m their self-assess ment at a lace with adequate lighting 
and without disturbance and to use a minor to assess their GFL a earance . 
• ub · ects will be asked to fill in, sign and date the questionnaire 
at the time of the planned study visit dates, if possible durin g/sho1tly after the 
respective saf~ument s sent to the subjects (FWS PhotoGuide , comp leted 
questionnaire- ) will be retumed to the investigational site at next possib le 
on-site visit. 
Tue eCRF should be updated by the site staff to collect reasons for missing data: For each 
planned study visit that was not perfo 1med at the study site, the site staff should document 
whether it was perfo1med as viitual visit due to COVID-19 pandem ic, not perfo1med due 
to COVID -19 pandem ic or not perfonned (due to other reasons). Also , it should be 
documented if a subject is disco ntinu ed from the study due to COV ID-1 9 pandemic.

documented. Previous treatments with BoNT treatment of an e and for an bod 
in the glabellar area must be recorded regardless of time of application 
. A review of this info1mat ion will allow the investigato r to assess whether 
t e su ~ect s ould be enrolled. Other data will be collected as required, inclu ding 
info1mation obtained from physical examinations, vital signs, and body weight and height 
measurement (see below). If counseling of subjects is deemed necessaiy , either before 
enrollme nt or during the study, counseling will be made available by the investigato r 
involving other medical specialists, if necessa1y.

9. 1.1. 1 Facial Wrinkl e Scale (FWS) SOP/245/EN -CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 
Version 2.0 (21-JUL-2023) 
The FWS is a widely used 4-point standar dized assess ment scale for the assess ment of the 
severity of GFL, which has been used in severa l studies investigating facial wrinkle 
treatment [ Ascher 2004 , Canuthers 2004a , Rzany 2006] including respective GFL studies 
with NT 201 [Canuther s 2013, Hanke 2013]. Analogue invest igator (investigato r's FWS) 
and subject (subject's FWS) versions will be used (see Section 16.4). 
9.1.1.1.1 lnvestigator's Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS) 
A photo guide comprising sample photos of each of the four grades will suppo1i the rating 
by FWS toget her with descr iptors for the four severity grades . Tue investigator must use 
the FWS photo guide toget her with the respec tive severity grade descriptors for each 
assess ment.

Investigators must pass the prior training qualification for use of the FWS before their first 
study rating. 
 
Ratings at Baseline Visit V2 (Day 1), Day 30±7 (V4), Day 120±7 (V7), Day 180±7 (V9) and the End of MP in an individual subject should be performed by the same investigator. For the sake of consistency all efforts should be taken that all FWS assessments in an individual subject will be performed by the same investigator. 
 
9.1.1.1.2  Subject’s Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS)  
 
The subject will self -assess GFL at maximum frown according to the subject’s 
FWS together with the photo guide as reference. The descriptors for each scale grade will be provided together with instructions on how to perform the assessments on a separate subject rating sheet. The site staff will be trained during the investigator meeting or the site initiation visit on how to instruct the subject on the self- assessment.

9.2 Visit  schedule  
 
Study proce dures will be 
identical in stage 1 and stage 2 (if applicabl e). 
 
The purpose of the Screening Visit V1 (Day - 3 to - 14) is to determine subject eligibility 
for study participation. The screening evaluation must be completed between Day -14    to -3 prior to Baseline. Subjects who fail screening are allowed to be re -screened one time. 
Subjects who are re- screened will be assigned a new screening  number. 
 
Baseline is defined as Day 1, which is the day of randomization and first administration of the IP.  
 
The clinical study protocol allows a window of ±7 days in scheduling of study visits for all post- baseline visits, except V3, where only a ±1 day window is allowed. The IP(s) should 
be injected at the study site by the investigator trained and experienced in aesthetic BoNT  
treatment.  Following administration  of IP(s),  subjects  will be observed

have occuned since the admin istration of study treatment. 
for all subjects who relapsed to baseline based on the investigato r's assess ment on the FWS 
at maximum frown. 
If planned on-site visits cannot be perfo1med due to COVID -19 situation, safety data will 
be collected via phone calls and the subjec ts will do their self-assessme nts at home if they 
previo usly consented to this procedure . 
fu addition, on-site visits shou ld be perfonned at the earliest possible date that the subject 
is able to safely come to the site again. Any miss ing visit data and the reason should be 
documented as instrncted in Section 9 .1. 
Additio nally, subjects (in stage 1 and stage 2) who have relapsed to baseline status in the 
MP will have the option to receive a follow- up treatment with the market approve d dose of 
20 U NT 201 for their GFL betwee n Day 180 and Day 
360. An OLEX Follow-up Visit V16 will be perfo1med for all subjects who receive the 
optio nal follow- up ti·eatme nt. 
Unscheduled visits may be required in the case of AEs or premature discontinuation of the 
study. fu this case, a final assessment will be perfo1med as soon as poss ible. If additional 
safety follow-up is necessaiy after this assessme nt, subjects may be contacted by telep hone 
or assesse d in the clinic, depe nding on the nature of the follow-up required.

10 SAFETY ASSESS MENTS  
 
10.1 Definition of an adverse  event  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Thus, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (including intercurrent illness); deterioration of a p re-existing illness; accident; any suspected drug 
reaction; or a clinically relevant change of laboratory values whether or not considered related to the IP(s) or study procedure. 
 
Changes in efficacy variables (e.g., subject -reported outcome variables [questionnaires and 
scales] during the course of the study) need not be documented as AEs, because these changes will be recorded as efficacy variables. Elective treatments planned before screening and which are documented in the subject’s source data are usually not regarded as AEs.  
 
The period of observation for an AE extends from the time when the informed consent form was signed until the End of MP if no optional treatment was received or the OLEX Follow- up Visit V16 if optional treatment was received (see  Section 6.1). Any medical 
occurrence during the observation period is an AE and has to be documented in the subject’s file. For screening failures AEs are not to be documented in the eCRF. For randomized subjects that experienced AEs during the screening period these have to be entered into the eCRF. Non- serious AEs will not be followed up after the End of MP or the 
OLEX Follow-up Visit V16 if optional treatment was received. 
 
Pre-existing conditions noted in the medical history should not be reported as an AE, unless 
the condition worsens or the disease reoccurs during the observation period. To determine whether a condition has worsened, it is compared to the condition of the subject at screening. Abnormal laboratory values obtained during the subject’s screening period will only meet AE criteria if newly detected and if considered clinically significant. However, if laboratory values resulting from pre -existing conditions worsen to clinical relevance 
during the course of the study AE criteria are met. 
 
Data pertaining to AEs will be collected during each study visit on the basis of the subject’s spontaneous report, through investigator inquiry, or discovered in the course of examinations performed during the visit.  If on-site visits are not possible due to COVID -19 pandemic and the subject provides 
his/her consent to safety assessments on the phone, safety assessments (AEs, change in medication and non- drug treatment, and occurrence of pregnancy) will be performed via 
phone calls and the results documented in the source data first and in the eCRF subsequently (see also Section 11.2).

Template: tem -csp-v3.0-20150713  
File name: CSP_M602011015_v2.0_20230721   .  
For all adverse events that are collected during telephone visits, it is up to the medical 
judgement of the investigator to refer a subject to a specialist if deemed necessary, thus 
ensuring the safety of the subject and the accuracy of the data.  The investigator will assess and record any AE in detail in the source documentation and 
on the eCRF AE report form. The following information must be recorded: 
 
• AE diagnosis or main symptom. 
•  
• Date of  onset.  
 
• Date of  worsening. 
• Intensity (maximum observed; see Section 10.1.1).  
• Causal relationship (not related, related).  
• Serious (yes or no). 
• Outcome (see Section  10.1.3).  
• AE leading to discontinuation of the study (yes or no). 
• Stop date.  
After completion of all scheduled visit assessments the investigator must document any 
AEs arising from these assessments.  
 
In case of an SAE, or AE of special interest the 
investigator must also complete an SAE report form or AE of special interest report form and report it to the CRO immediately, as described in Section 10.2. 
 
Treatment of overdose with IP(s) is described in Section 8.2.6. 
 
10.1.1  Definition of  intensity  
 
The clinical intensity of an AE will be classified on the basis of its associated  signs and 
symptoms, as follows: 
 
Mild:  Signs and symptoms that can be easily tolerated. Symptoms can be 
ignored and disappear when the subject is distracted.  
 
Moderate: Signs and symptoms that cause discomfort and interfere with normal 
functioning, but are tolerable. They cannot be ignored and do not disappear 
when the subject is distracted.

Template: tem -csp-v3.0-20150713  
File name: CSP_M602011015_v2.0_20230721   . Severe:  Signs and symptoms that affect usual daily activity and incapacitate the 
subject, thereby interrupting his/her daily activities.  
 
The definitions above are difficult to apply for some data (e.g., clinically relevant 
laboratory values that are documented and evaluated on the eCRF AE report form). In such situations, the investigator should make a judgment based on clinical experience. 
 
10.1.2  Definition of causal relationship with investigational  product(s)  
 
An AE is considered to be ‘related’ to IP(s) if a causal relationship between the IP(s) and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out). 
 
The expre ssion ‘reasonable causal relationship’ is meant to imply that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (ICH E2A guideline). Otherwise, the AE should be considered as ‘not related.’ 
 
10.1.3  Categories of  outcome  
 
The reportable outcomes and/or sequelae of an AE are as follows: 
 
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving. 
• Not recovered/not resolved.  
• Recovered/resolved with  sequelae.  
• Fatal.  
• Unknown. 
If there is more than one AE, only the AE leading to death will be recorded as having a ‘fatal’ outcome.  
 
10.2 Definition of a serious adverse  event  
 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, at any dose, that: 
 
• Results in  death.  
• Is life -threatening.8 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization, or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.

Template: tem -csp-v3.0-20150713  
File name: CSP_M602011015_v2.0_20230721   . • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
8 The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe.  
 
• Consists of any other medically important condition.9 
In case of death, an autopsy report should be submitted (if available). The date and cause 
of death should be recorded. 
 
Hospitalizations for elective treatments planned before screening and which are documented in the subject’s source data are usually not regarded as SAEs. 
 
All SAEs that occu r during the study period whether considered to be related to IP(s) or 
not, must be reported by telefax or e -mail within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. SAE 
report forms are provided in the investigator’s site file. 
 
Although all information required for completion of an SAE report form may not be 
available within the specified time period, an initial report should be submitted if the 
following minimum information is available: 
 
• An identifiable subject (number).  
• A suspect  product. 
• An identifiable reporting source (investigator/study site  identification).  
• An event or outcome that can be identified as serious.

file. 
 
The AE form in the eCRF as well as the pages for medical history / concomitant diseases 
and for previous / concomitant medication and non- drug treatment are to be faxed/sent 
along with the AESI reporting form.

10.4 Expected adverse  events  
 
Expected AEs are those listed in the reference safety information of the current IB [ Merz  
Pharmaceuticals GmbH 2018] . 
 
10.5 Unexpected adverse  events  
 
An unexpected AE is an AE not previously reported in nature, severity, or incidence in the 
reference safety information of the current IB [ Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH  2018] . 
 
10.6 Pregnancy  
 
Each pregnancy that starts during the study must be reported by the investigator to the CRO within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Pregnancies and pregnancy follow -up should 
be reported on a pregnancy monitoring form. Pregnancy follow -up should describe the 
outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary or spontaneous discontinuation; details of the birth; the presence or absence of any congenital abnormalities, birth defects, maternal or newborn complications, and their relation to the IP(s). Each normal pregnancy is to be reported as a non -serious AE (drug exposure  before or during pregnancy). Any abnormal 
pregnancy or pregnancy outcome is to be reported as SAE (on an SAE - form).  
 
In case a pregnancy occurs prior to injection, the subject must not receive any injection treatment an d the End of MP will be conducted right away without any invasive procedures 
(such as blood drawing) performed. 
 
If a pregnancy occurs after a subject has received injection, the subject can continue with applicable study visits until the end of the study but without any invasive procedure (e.g. injections, blood drawing). However, the subject is free to discontinue the study at any time.

File name: CSP_M602011015_v2.0_20230721   .  
11 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Inspections by regulatory authority representatives and IECs/IRBs are possible at any time, 
even after the end of study. The investigator is to notify the sponsor immediately of any 
such inspection. The investigator and institution will permit study- related monitoring, 
audits, reviews by the IEC/IRB and/or regulatory authorities, and will allow direct acc ess 
to source data and source documents for such monitoring, audits, and reviews. 
 
11.1 Standardization  procedures  
 
Standardization procedures will be implemented to ensure accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable data, including methods to ensure standardization among sites (e.g., training, newsletters, investigator meetings, monitoring, central laboratories, centralized evaluations, and validation methods). 
 
This study will be monitored regularly by qualified monitors from the CRO according to ICH-GCP and the respective Standard operating procedures (SOPs) (see Section 11.4).  
 
11.2 Source documentation requirements  
All data collected from a subject during the course of this clinical study should be retained 
in the respective source documentation (e.g. subject file). This includes a copy of the letter 
sent to the subject’s primary physician about the subject’s participation in the study (provided the subject has a primary physician and has agreed to the general practitioner being informed). The source documentation must also contain a descriptive statement on the informed consent procedure (see Section 3.3.2 ). The investigator must also confirm by 
written statement in the source documentation that all inclusion criteria and all exclusion criteria were checked prior to randomization of the subject. In addition to this statement, the subject’s meeting or non- meeting of the in - and exclusion criteria and eligibility criteria 
have to be traceable on the basis of the documentation in the subjects file. The childbearing potential of female subjects must be noted in the source documentation. The site will keep a source data location list which will outline for the different data categories including electronic data (e.g. demographics, medical history, and AEs etc.) which document serves as source for these data (e.g. subject file, laboratory report). Scales assessed by investigators and subjects on paper forms will be considered 
as s
ource data and will be transferred into the eCRF by the site.  
 
If a study site is using an electronic system for documenting source data, a member of the site staff must print out the source data after each visit. The paper print- outs  must overlap, 
if possible (i.e., must contain at least the last row of data from the subject’s previous visit). If it is not possible to obtain overlapping paper print-outs, the completeness of source data must be ensured by other suitable means. The print -out must be  signed and dated  by a 
member  of the site staff who can confirm  the accuracy  and 

Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH   SOP/245/EN - CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL

File name: CSP_M602011015_v2.0_20230721   .  
completeness of data in the paper print -out. The monitor will also sign and date after 
verifying the source data. The paper pri nt-out should be stored in the investigators site file. 
If source data information is entered retrospectively, this must be done directly on the paper 
print- out and should be initialed and dated. The same applies to any corrections of initial  
data.  
 
If the  site is using a validated computer system including audit trail with a separate access 
for the monitor (i.e., the monitor can only access the data of the study subjects), then no 
such paper print-outs are required.  To assure subject’s safety, sites that are temporarily closed for subject on- site visits or have 
subjects under a Stay -at-Home -Order or subjects who choose not to come to the site due to 
the pandemic will monitor subject’s safety via phone calls at planned visit dates . 
  During the next on- site visit, subject’s consent to the phone visit and / or the self -
assessment must be confirmed by the investigator and the subject in a signed supplemental ICF according to the procedures described above, including the requirements for traceability.   If safety assessments were performed via phone, it must be documented in the eCRF that the visit was virtually conducted by phone due to COVID -19 pandemic. If a planned visit 
cannot be performed at all, it must be documented in the eCRF whether this was due to COVID-19 pandemic or due to other reasons.   Every effort should be made to contact subjects via phone or letter. At least 3 documented attempts to contact the subject should be made. All the attempts are to be documented in the subject’s source documentation. 
 
11.3 Data management  
 
Data required according to this protocol is to be recorded in the web -based eCRFs 
(electronic data capture system) . All 
users who will enter data into the eCRF will be previously trained. After the successful completion of the training all participants will receive a training certificate, which will be a prerequisite for the access to the eCRF. The access to the eCRF is password -controlled 
and conforms with CFR part 11. 
 
Plausibility checks will be performed according to a data validation plan. Inconsistencies in the data will be queried to the investigators via the electronic data capture system; answers to queries or changes to the data will also be documented i n this system directly 
by an authorized member of the investigator’s site staff. The audit trail in the electronic data capture system documents all changes. Edit checks will generate automatic queries during data entry when a field is not populated according to specifications defined in the data validation plan.

File name: CSP_M602011015_v2.0_20230721   .  
Manual queries (to be answered by site staff) can be raised during source data verification, medical or safety review and data management review.  
 
AEs, medical history/concomitant diseases and non -drug treatment will be coded according 
to the MedDRA version in effect at the time the database is closed.  
 
Laboratory data will be received electronically and merged with the eCRF data (but not uploaded into the EDC system). Plausibility checks will be  performed to ensure correctness 
and completeness of these data. The data management / biostatistics vendor  
will be responsible for data -processing. 
 
After all necessary data for DEM (when all enrolled subjects for stage 1  have had their Day 
30±7 Follow -up Observational Visit V4) have been entered, a database snapshot will be 
taken.  
 
For the final analysis, after all data are entered and all queries are solved, the database will be closed. After database close, unblinding will take place. In case of any changes to the data after database close, these changes will be documented according to respective SOP.

An analogous procedure will be applied prior to the interim analysis after 180 days (V9) 
of stage 1. Once the data is cleaned, a database snapshot is saved.  
 
11.4 Monitoring  
 
This study will be monitored regularly by a qualified monitor from the CRO according to 
GCP guidelines and the respective SOPs. During these visits, the monitor will prepare the study site for the conduct of the study, check for subject eligibility, for the integrity of the source data with the eCRF entries, for compliance with the clinical study protocol, ICH - 
GCP principles, the Declaration of Helsinki, and regulatory authority requirements. Monitoring will also be aimed at detecting any misconduct or fraud. 
 
In addition, the monitor will check whether all AEs and SAEs have been reported appropriately within the time periods required. 
 
The investigator and all staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor by providing any missing information whenever possible. The investigator must be available to answer questions arising during regular monitoring visits. In addition, the investigator is required to: 
 
• Have all data properly  recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF prior to 
each monitoring visit.  
 
• Have the source documentation available at the monitoring visits.  
• Record all IP(s) dispensed in the eCRF and the drug inventory records.  
Regular monitoring tasks will be performed by a blinded monitor. Compliance with the IWRS randomization and inventory/drug accountability will be monitored by an unblinded monitor. 
 
All subjects who are screened, but not included in the study, will be listed on the subject screening/enrol lment log.  
 
Monitoring will be systematic, prioritized, and risk -based. Further details of monitoring 
activities will be provided in the monitoring manual, which describes the procedures to identify, evaluate, control, and report risks to critical processes and data on an ongoing basis throughout all stages of the trial’s life -cycle.  
 Off-site and centralized monitoring are already conducted during the study as described in 
the monitoring manual and will be continued to be performed while on -site mo nitoring 
visits are not possible due to COVID -19 restrictions. If no on- site source data verification 
[SDV] is possible due to COVID -19 restrictions, a “data confirmation call” will be 
arranged with the site and documented. During this call, site personnel will be

asked to read aloud selected data from the source data to the study monitor; the study monitor will compare these data with the eCRF entries. During the next on- site visit, the 
CRA will verify the data fields confirmed via phone when reviewing the source data in 
person to complete the SDV process on- site and will tick the respective SDV -data fields in 
the eCRF at that time. Details of “data confirmation call” will be provided in the monitoring manual.   During COVID -19 pandemic the monitors are  in close contact with site staff to monitor 
the local situation and well- being of study subjects and staff. On- site monitoring visits will 
be done as soon as possible.

11.5 Auditing 
 
Audits will be performed according to the corresponding audit program, which will include 
the possibility that a member of the sponsor’s quality assurance function may arrange to visit the investigator in order to audit the performance of the study at the study site, and all study documents originating there. Auditors will conduct their work independently of the clinical study and its performance. 
 
Audits may also be performed by contract auditors. In this case, the sponsor’s quality assurance function will agree with the contract auditor regarding the timing  and extent of 
the audit(s). For audits at the study site, the monitor will usually accompany the auditor(s).

12 STATIS TICAL  METHODS  
This section describes the statistical analyses intended at the time of study planning. 
Further details on the statistical and analytical aspects will be presented in the SAP.  
 
Any deviations from planned analyses, the reason(s) for such deviation(s), and all 
alternative or additional statistical analyses that may be performed before database close 
or unblinding, respectively, will be described in amendments to the clinical study protocol or the SAP. All deviations and/or alterations will be summarized in the clinical study  report.  
 
12.1 Determination of sample  size 
 
 
 
In total, 60 subjects in the high dose groups are deemed required for the objectives of the 
study. For the low dose group, 30 subjects suffice in case the study stops after stage 1 as the side effects and efficacy of a dose of 20 U are well characterized in previous studies. 
 
12.2 Analysis sets  
 
Safety evaluation set 
 
The SES is the subset of all subjects who were exposed to study medication. 
 
Full analysis set  
 
The FAS is the subset of subjects in the SES for whom any efficacy variable is available (i.e., all subjects who have a baseline and at least one post -baseline value of any efficacy 
variable).

Analyses will be performed after all subjects of stage 1 have had their Day 180 assessments (interim analysis) and after all subjects of stage 1 and stage 2 (if applicable) have had their 
last visit (End of MP or OLEX Follow -Up Visit V16, as applicable). If not otherwise 
specified the data from stage 1 and stage 2 in the 20 U groups will be pooled in case stage 2 is started. Otherwise, the dose groups will be presented as randomized for stage 1 only.

To get early insights, into duration of effect of NT 201 based on the  primary efficacy 
parameter and the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) over the entire Main Period of 360 days, it is planned to perform an interim analysis of complete MP data from Stage 1, where doses up to 75 U were administered. 
 
12.4.1 Efficacy variables  
 
The efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS (see Section 12.2).  
 
Statistical tests will be two -sided hypothesis tests for between -treatment differences in 
general. Continuous variables (values and changes from baseline) will be summarized by N, mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum. For qualitative variables, absolute and percent frequencies (N, %) and, if applicable, shift tables will be displayed. Confidence limits will be given, where appropriate. 
 
12.4.1.1  Primary efficacy  variable  
 
The primary endpoint is the duration of effect defined in Section 12.3.1.1. This will be described by Kaplan-Meier Curves per group and the respective medians of times.  
 
pairwise log -rank  tests will 
be applied to compare differences between high dose groups and the 20 U group to explore statistical significance. The 20 U group data will be pooled from stage 1 and 2, if applicable.  
 
For the primary endpoint a Cox proportional hazards regression will be applied with covariates dose group (20, 50, 75, 100 U) , center , and baseline FWS score at maximum 
frown as assessed by the investigator . Here, the pooled 20 U group will be used as reference 
group. To explore potential stage effects, a sensitivity analysis will use dose groups 20 (stage 1), 20 (stage 2), 50, 75 and 100 U with 20 (stage 1) as reference group. Depending on the outcome further exploration might be needed
 
 
 
12.4.1.2  Secondary efficacy  variables  
 
The secondary duration of effect variables will be analyzed in analogy to the primary variable. However, the  Cox proportional hazards  regression analysis will be limited to 
pooling the 20 U groups of both stages. 
 
For the percentages of subjects fulfilling the criteria as described in the secondary efficacy variables two -sided 95% Pearson-C lopper confidence intervals will be computed for 
responder rates in each dose group.

12.4.7.1  Discontinuations and missing data 
 
With relevance to efficacy objectives treatment will be applied only once and hence cannot 
be discontinued. Therefore, no premature discontinuation from treatment can occur. 
Missing values likewise occur at random or because the subject completes the study early 
due to relapse to baseline. The latter will not impact the primary analysis of duration of 
effect since this was completely captured. Hence, for any Kaplan -Meier analysis and 
inferential statistics intermittent missing data will be ignored and monotone missingness be considered as censored.

Due to t
he COVID -19 pandemic, a considerable amount of missing data is expected for 
subjects from Stage 2. Restrictions related to COVID -19 in both the US and in Germany 
(temporarily closed sites , stay -at-home orders, quarantines imposed to subjects suspected 
to be infected) may make it impossible for many subjects to attend all planned on- site visits. 
Since live assessments by investigators cannot be performed remotely, this will inevitably 
lead to missing data. 
Handling of missing data due to the COVID -19 pandemic in the final statistical analysis 
will depend on the number and pattern of missing values, which will be thoroughly 
described in the clinical study report. Decisions on any additional analyses to account for missingness due to COVID -19 will be made at the latest during the BDRM for the final 
analysis and described in an amendment to the SAP, which will be finalized prior to database close for the final analysis (see also section 12.4.7.6).  
 
12.4.7.2  Interim  analyses  
 
12.4.7.2.1  Dose Escalation  Meeting  
 
A blinded evaluation of safety data will be performed in a DEM when all enrolled subjects for stage 1 have had their Day 30±7 Follow -up Observational Visit V4. Based on the stage 
1 data, a decision to proceed with stage 2 of the study with a dose group of   100 U NT 201 will be made. The evaluation includes blinded safety data of stage 1 subjects of the 20 U, 50 U, and 75 U NT 201 dose group up to Follow-up Observational Visit V4, Day 30±7.

File name: CSP_M602011015_v2.0_20230721   . For more de tails, see Section 12.4.7.3. 
 
For this DEM the following data will be presented overall for the pooled blinded data: 
 
• Subject disposition and demographic data 
 
• Listings of medical history, concomitant diseases, previous and concomitant 
treatments  
 
• Incidences of TEAEs, TEAESIs, TESAEs, and related TEAEs by SOC and PT 
 
• Listings of TEAE, TEAESIs, TESAEs, Deaths and AEs leading to premature discontinuation 
 
12.4.7.2.2  Interim analysis  after Day 180 of stage 1 
 
An interim analysis of complete 180- day data (V9) of stage 1 will be performed. This 
interim analysis will serve to get early insights regarding the benefit- risk assessment and 
duration of effect of the dose groups investigated in the stage 1. However, it is not the aim of this analysis to decide on premature termination of the study. 
 
Data will be unblinded for sponsor staff and vendor data management and biostatistics staff only as required for the sake of the interim analysis. 
 
For data of Stage 1 until Day 180, the blind will  not be broken until a BDRM focusing on 
the interim analysis has convened, the first version of the SAP has been finalized, and a database snapshot has been saved. After the blind is broken, the statistical analysis of Stage 1 Day 180 results will proceed. 
 
The study will be continued and investigators, subjects, site staff and monitors (except the unblinded monitor responsible for IWRS compliance) will be kept blinded  with regard to 
stage 1 subject’s assignment to treatment groups. Stage 2 subjects, if app licable, will not 
be included in the 180 -day interim analysis. The blind for subjects in stage 2 will be 
maintained. Moreover, the blindness of investigators and subjects, site staff and blinded monitor will be maintained throughout for both stages until f inal unblinding. 
 
For the remaining data, the blind will not be broken until the final BDRM has convened, the final version of the SAP has been finalized, and the database has been closed. After the blind is broken, the overall statistical analysis of results will proceed. The SAP might be amended to stage 2 specific aspects before unblinding of stage 2. 
 
As the blind of the subjects of Stage 2 will be maintained and procedures for Stage 2 will be very advanced when results are disseminated there is no impact on validity of stage 2 data and the credibility of study results.

no multip

12.4.7.5  Examination of  subgroups  
 
Subgroup analyses will be specified in the SAP. 
 
12.4.7.6  Additional analyses due to outbreak of COVID -19 pandemic  
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, a considerable amount of missing data is expected for 
subjects from Stage 2 (see also section 12.4.7.1). This especially applies to efficacy variables that are based on live assessments by investigators, which cannot be perfor med remotely. 
The primary as well as several secondary efficacy parameters will be affected. It should be noted that under specific circumstances, subsequently missing live ratings on the FWS by the investigator are likely to introduce bias to the assessment of the primary and secondaryduration of effect variables. If relapse to baseline status is first assessed only after several intermittently missing follow -up visits due to canceled on- site visits, the time to 
relapse will be overestimated.  
 Data from Main Period of Stage 1 are in contrast not affected by this or any other kind of 
bias caused by COVID -19 pandemic because Stage 1 subjects did not miss any MP visits 
due to COVID -19 outbreak. Therefore, conduct of separate analyses of data from Sta ge 1 
and Stage 2 subjects will likely be necessary in addition to pooled analyses as planned for the final analysis of the study; this decision will be taken at the latest during the BDRM for the final analysis (see below).  However, for reasons outlined in the following, it appears 
reasonable to perform an interim analysis of Main Period data from Stage 1 as soon as MP data from all Stage 1 subjects are available and cleaned.  
  As described in the newly added section 12.4.7.2.3 above, the additional interim  analysis 
of complete MP data from Stage 1 will focus on the assessment of duration of effect of NT 201 according to the primary efficacy parameter and on occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), especially treatment -related TEAEs, over the  360 Day follow -up

File name: CSP_M602011015_v2.0_20230721   . period. Efficacy and safety data from Stage 1, where doses up to 75 U were applied, can 
give further insights into the efficacy and safety profile of NT 201. Depending on the future development of the COVID -19 pandemic and related restrictions in both countries this can 
be very valuable to decide whether resumption of on- site visits for Stage 2 subjects with 
intermittently missing on -site visits still appears meaningful and might outweigh the specific 
efforts and risks associated with travelling during the COVID -19 pandemic. Insights from 
the interim analysis at End of MP of Stage 1 might be valuable to decide whether affected Stage 2 subjects should be motivated to re -assume on- site visits after a certain time period 
with missing efficacy  data according to investigator’s assessments. 
 Any further additional statistical analyses planned to analyze the impact of missingness (see also section 12.4.7.1) and/or potential bias on data assessment due to COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. heterogeneity of Stage 1 and Stage 2 subjects due to COVID -19 related restrictions) 
will be decided upon at the latest during the BDRM for the final analysis.  Depending on the amount of missing data and pattern of missingness, this might include separate analyses of Stage 2  subjects only. Any additionally planned analyses will be 
thoroughly described in an updated version of the statistical analysis plan, which will be finalized prior to database close for the final analysis. 
 
13 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEP ING 
By signing and dating the eCRF, the investigator will confirm that all investigations have 
been completed and conducted in compliance with this clinical study protocol, and that reliable and complete data have been entered into the eCRF.  
 
13.1 Corrections to data  
 
All data required by this clinical study protocol are to be recorded in the eCRF as soon as possible. However, direct entries are not allowed; data must be transcribed from the source documentation (e.g., subject file, questionnaires and scales) to the eC RF. 
 
If corrections are necessary, an authorized member of the investigator’s site staff will enter the correct data into the web -based eCRF. The audit trail in the EDC system documents all 
changes. Edit checks issue automatic queries during data entry when a field is not populated to specifications defined in the data validation plan. Manual queries (to be answered by site staff) can be raised during source data verification, medical or safety review, and data management  review.  
 
The data management / biostatistics vendor will 
be responsible for data processing. Final database close will occur only after quality assurance procedures have been completed.

Upon closure of the study, the inve stigator must maintain all study -site records in a safe 
and secure location. The investigator is responsible for the integrity, retention, and security 
of all study- related records. The investigator must ensure that any reproductions of the 
original records are legible and provide a true and accurate copy of the original. Accurate, complete, and current records must be stored in such a way as to permit easy and timely retrieval for the sponsor or any applicable regulatory authorities. 
 
Essential documents should be retained until at least two years after the last approval of a marketing application (whether pending or contemplated) in an ICH region, or at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of IP clinical development. However, 
these documents are to be retained for a longer period, if required by applicable regulatory 
requirements or by agreement with the sponsor. 
 
Essential documents at the study site include (among other documents): 
 
• Source documentation (e.g. subject file, questionnaires and  scales).  
 
• Subject identification code list (respective template provided to the investigator along 
with the Investigator’s site file, at the beginning of the study), which identifies the 
subject by number, name, and date of birth. 
 
• A signed copy of the final clinical study protocol and any amendment.  
• CDs/DVDs with PDF -files containing subjects’ eCRF data and audit trail (preferably 
provided to site during close -out visit), and any associated subject -related source  data 
(or, where applicable, authorized copies of source data).  
 
• Signed informed consent forms.  
• Copies of site investigators’ and co-workers' curricula vitae.  
• Copies of all direct correspondence with the IEC/IRB and with the regulatory authority(ies). 
 
• Copies of laboratory norm al ranges and  methods 
• Copies of study supply receipt forms and drug inventory forms.  
• Copies of all correspondence between the investigator and the monitor, and between 
the investigator and the sponsor.

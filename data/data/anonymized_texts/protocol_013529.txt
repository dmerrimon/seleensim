 1. OBJECTIVES 
 
The overall goal of this proposal is to determine if atorvastatin administration attenuates deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in men and women r eceiving Anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction precedes the development of congestive heart failure (CHF), a major contributor to cardiovascular (CV) events, and t he 2nd leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality for 7-year survivors treated with adjuvant chemothera py for breast cancer.
1-7 This heightened 
incidence of CV events threatens to offset cancer-related survival and raise healthcare expenditures 
for breast cancer survivors. An intervention that reduces LV dysfunction and CHF would be 
significant .1-7  
 Anthracycline-based  chemotherapy is an important component of therapy for those with advanced disease;
8 for breast cancer alone, 5-year survival exceeds 70% after Ant hracycline-based adjuvant 
therapy.9 Not only is doxorubicin an essential element in modern therapy  of breast, soft tissue 
sarcomas and other solid tumors,i,ii it is thought to be an essential element of curative combinati on 
chemotherapy for acute leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin ’s lymphoma, and many childhood 
cancers.iii,iv Thus, for many individuals with advanced stages of cancer, Dox orubicin serves as an 
important part of their medical regimen.   
 
The cytotoxic anti-tumor effects from Anthracycline-based adjuv ant therapy are related to its 
interactions with the enzyme topoisomerase-IIα, production of double-strand DNA breaks, and the generation of intracellular cytotoxic free radicals.
10 Unfortunately, in cardiomyocytes, these cytotoxic 
free radicals promote oxidative and nitrosative stress that, in  combination with other Anthracycline-
based adjuvant therapy effects (inflammation and neurohormonal activation), promote LV dysfunction, myocardial replacement fibrosis, CHF, and CV events.
11 Primary prevention strategies that reduce 
Anthracycline-based chemotherapy mediated myocellular oxidative /nitrosative stress could diminish 
LV dysfunction and the subsequent CHF often experienced by pati ents after Anthracycline-based 
adjuvant therapy. No such strategies currently exist. 
 
In the secondary prevention setting, the notion that modulating  Anthracycline-based chemo therapy 
mediated oxidative/nitrosative stress can preserve LV function has been applied to women with poor 
resting LV function in need of Anthracycline-based adjuvant the rapy.12,13 In these women, intravenous 
pre-treatment with dexrazoxane, a free iron binding agent that reduces the generation of reactive 
oxygen and consequent nitrogen species, decreases further LV dy sfunction and CV events.12,13 This 
therapy is not utilized for primary prevention because of its expense, associated side effects, and the potential concern it may reduce anthracycline-mediated tumor regression. 
 
Several lines of evidence suggest that generic, inexpensive, oral 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase i nhibitors (statins) may prevent cardiomyocyte injury during and 
after Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy.
14 This class of drugs is used commonly to treat 
hypercholesterolemia, but also reduces oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and 
circulating neurohormones.15,16 In animal models, statins diminish LV dysfunction and 
oxidative/nitrosative stress afte r Anthracycline-based chemothe rapy.14 In our pilot studies, we find that 
LV injury occurs early (in the first 6 months of Anthracycline- based chemo therapy administration), and 
LV performance is preserved in men and women receiving Anthracycline-based --chemo therapy 
when statins are co-administered for pre-existing CV disease during these 6 months.19 Unlike some 
cardioprotective medications, statins do not promote hypotension, and recent data indicate that breast cancer recurrence does not increase among 18,000 5-year survivo rs receiving statins during and after 
treatment for breast cancer.
18 
 Given the propensity of statins to ameliorate LV dysfunction an d reduce CHF and other CV events, we 
seek to conduct a clinical trial to determine if statin therapy attenuates the early onset of LV 
dysfunction in men and women treated with Anthracycline-based c hemotherapy for breast cancer or 
lymphoma. Accordingly, we propose the following.  
 
10 
NCI Version Date 03/27/20 20   WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 Primary Objectives 
 
Specific Aim 1: To determine if atorvastatin administration preserves LVEF 24 months after initiation 
of Anthracycline-based chemo-therapy for breast cancer or lymph oma.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To determine if baseline to 6-month differences in LVEF predict baseline to 24-month 
differences in LVEF after Anthracycline-based chemotherapy and concomitant atorvastatin therapy. 
 To achieve these aims, we will perform a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of 
0 or 40 mg of atorvastatin/day in 278 individuals scheduled to receive Anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy for treatment of Stage I-III breast cancer or lymp homa
 Stage I-IV  with a projected > 2 
year life expectancy. We will use innovative noninvasive magnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) 
procedures to accurately measure LVEF. In addition, we will measure LV volumes, myocardial strain, 
fibrosis, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and wall thickness, all factors that can influence LVEF by 
altering LV pre-load, after-load, and contractility.19,20 Advanced serum biomarkers will be measured 
that assess for the presence of oxidative/nitrosative stress, systemic inflammation and circulating 
neurohormones that also may influence LVEF.   
This study will test a new clinical paradigm to manage cancer patients scheduled to receive 
anthracyclines: primary prevention of Anthracycline-based chemo therapy-related LV dysfunction using 
pre-treatment with low-cost statins. In addition, this trial will be the first systematic collection of data regarding the mechanism(s) and time course by which LV dysfunct ion and subsequent CHF evolve in 
individuals given Anthracycline-based chemotherapy for breast c ancer or lymphoma. These data will 
be useful to physicians trying to determine the optimal cardiac protection strategies when 
administering chemotherapeutic regimens to their breast cancer or lymphoma patients. The objective 
of this research is to use inexpensive medications to preserve CV health and thereby improve overall 
survival in the growing number o f breast cancer and lymphoma pa tients.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
Specific Aim 1: 
 
To document the effect of atorvastatin on cognitive function using a battery of neurocognitive tests (HVLT, Rey-Osterreith Figure, COWA, Trail-making Parts A and B, Digit Span and Grooved Pegboard) in breast cancer and lymphoma patients receiving an anthracycli ne. 
 
Specific Aim 2: 
 
To document the effect of atorvastatin on self-reported quality of life using validated questionnaires (PROMIS including: General form, Cog Concerns, Cog Abilities, F atigue, Pain intensity and 
interference, Sleep Disturbance, Physical Functioning and Social Functioning) in breast cancer and lymphoma patients receiving an anthracycline.

 2. BACKGROUND 
 
This study is significant in that it addresses:  
1) A prevalent clinical problem. CHF and CV events (34,000 annu al events in the US) together are the 2nd 
most common cause of morbidity and mortality in women who recei ve adjuvant treatment for breast 
cancer.21 Administration of Anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a major factor related to development of 
CHF in this population.22   
2) A therapeutic intervention to counter the mechanism(s) by wh ich Anthracycline-based chemo therapy 
injures the heart. To date, no therapies are routinely given to cancer patients to prevent oxidative and 
nitrosative stress, systemic inflammation, LV replacement fibrosis, and neurohormonal activation–all initiated on receipt of Anthracycline-based  chemotherapy. Identifying a therapeutic intervention to address underlying mechanisms of Anthracycline-based chemotherapy-relat ed LV dysfunction would be a significant 
clinical innovation. 
3) The concept of pre-treatment and primary prevention of myoce llular injury in cancer survivors.  Existing 
clinical strategies for Anthracycline-based chemotherapy-related CHF are based on post-event clinical management. This study will test a new clinical paradigm : primary prevention of Anthracycline-based 
therapy-related LV dysfunction using low-cost statin pre-treatment.  
4) The evolution of CHF and other subclinical CV disease in cancer and lymphoma survivors. The studies 
planned in this proposal will record the evolution of subclinic al processes observed in other large 
epidemiologic investigations of CHF and CV disease. These data will provide important new information on how cancer or lymphoma survivors develop LV dysfunction that often precedes adverse CV events.  
5) CV healthcare expenditures in patients with cancer. Over $80 0,000,000 per year in the US is spent 
providing CV-related care for patients experiencing LV dysfunction and CHF after treatment for breast cancer or lymphoma.
3 We will test the effectiveness of a generic, cost-efficient (2  to 5 cents/day), widely 
available medication that may prevent LV dysfunction in patients receiving Anthracycline-based chemotherapy for cancer.  
6) NHLBI and NCI mandates including: a) the NHLBI strategic plan goal to improve understanding of the 
clinical mechanisms of CV disease and thereby enable better pre vention, diagnosis and treatment; and b) 
the NCI’s commitment to determine actionable strategies to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality in 
patients with cancer.  
 
In this section, we document the significant background data/information substantiating these statements.  Today, CV events including primarily CHF are the 2
nd leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 5-year 
survivors of breast cancer.1-7 Because both the number of long-term survivors and the use of complex cancer 
treatment regimens are increasing, the prevalence of CHF and CV  events is growing in all patients receiving 
Anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The long-term consequences of  CHF and CV events after breast cancer 
and treatment for lymphoma are staggering:  
 In 236,000 breast cancer survivors treated and followed between 1975 and 2002, CV event rates increased 
by 25%, offsetting a 15% decrease in cancer-related mortality.
3,6  
 Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) da tabase of 66- to 80-year-old women 
(n=7,724) treated for adjuvant breast cancer, the incidence of CHF ranged from 29% to 38% depending on 
the adjuvant treatment regimen received.23  
 In a study of 63,566 women with breast cancer aged >65 years, CV disease was the leading cause of death 
(15.9%) followed by breast cancer (15.1%) in 5-year survivors; and, of those women who died as a result of 
CV disease, only 25% had existing comorbid CV disease at their breast cancer diagnosis.23 Similar findings 
were reported in women below the age of 65 years.24 
 In 179 breast cancer survivors experiencing a stroke (from a cohort of 11,045), events were 2.5 fold higher 
in those receiving versus not receiving chemotherapy containing primarily Anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy.22,25 
 
These findings suggest breast cancer survivors with no prior history of CV disease exhibit high rates of CV 
events, and a relationship exists between breast cancer therapy and survivors’ subsequent CV events.

2.1.  Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy’s cytotoxic tumor effects also injure cardiomyocytes by 
promoting peroxynitrite 
o(ONOO-) induced stress.   
Anthracyclines interact with the enzyme topoisomerase-IIα and produce double-strand DNA breaks that inhibit tumor 
cell DNA synthesis, 
transcription, and replication.
31 
This class of agents also generates oxygen- and nitrogen-derived free radicals 
that are highly cytotoxic for 
malignant cells.
32   
  Generation of oxygen- and 
nitrogen-derived free radicals can be harmful to 
cardiomyocytes. In healthy 
cardiomyocytes, nitric oxide (NO) is beneficial (green, Fig. 1); however, after Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy, the increased 
bioavailability of NO and 
superoxide (O
2-) promotes 
preferential production of ONOO
- that induces 
myocellular injury (red, Fig. 
1).32 Unlike most other organs, 
the heart has few free radical 
scavengers, so it is particularly susceptible to injury from free radical production.
32 
   Several studies have linked the production of peroxynitrite (Fig. 1) after anthracycline exposure to both 
cellular myocyte (tension) and global (catheter-based measures of derivatives of pressure and time [dP/dt], 
LVEF, stroke volume, and cardiac output) abnormalities of LV my ocardial performance.32-34 In C57BL/6J mice 
receiving single intraperitoneal doses (up to 20 mg/kg) of doxo rubicin (DOX, an anthracycline), myocardial 
apoptosis, levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) exp ression, mitochondrial superoxide generation, 3-
nitrotyrosine (NT) formation (a downstream byproduct of elevated peroxynitrite), myocardial dysfunction, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were all elevated.
32 These elevations were attenuated by peroxynitrite 
scavengers.32 DOX-induced cell death and nitrotyrosine formation were also a ttenuated by iNOS inhibitors or 
in iNOS knockout mice.32 These studies indicate that Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy promotes oxidative 
and nitrosative stress, thus initiating a cascade of events mediated by peroxynitrite formation that injures 
myocytes and promotes overall LV dysfunction . 
 
2.2  Statin pre-treatment re duces nitrotyrosine production (rel ated to elevated peroxynitrite formation; 
red, Figure 1) and subsequent LV dysfunction during and after A nthracycline-based adjuvant therapy. 
Five days after a single intraperitoneal injection of DOX at 20 mg/kg, LV function (measured as a change in 
dP/dt) was reduced in mice receiving DOX alone but not in mice receiving placebo or DOX + fluvastatin (Fig. 2B; red vs. blue and green bars).
14 DOX animals had increased myocellular lipid peroxidation and n itrotyrosine 
formation (a byproduct of elevated levels of peroxynitrite; Fig . 2A, red bar), increased tumor necrosis alpha 
(TNFα, a marker of systemic inflammation), and myocellular apop tosis (p<0.05 for all).14 Mice given fluvastatin 
had lower cardiac expression of nitrotyrosine, an absence of LV dysfunction (Fig. 2B; green   
Figure 1: Mechanisms by which anthracycli ne chemotherapy causes cardiotox icity. Doxorubicin increases 
oxidative and nitrosative stress , leading to increased peroxyni trite (ONOO). Peroxynit rite reacts further in 
both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, leading to myocardial injury, contractile dysfunction, endothelial 
dysfunction and heart failure.

 bar), and no increases in markers of systemic inflammation (TNF α) or 
myocellular apoptosis.14  
  In a recent study of 40 patients scheduled to receive Anthrac ycline-based 
adjuvant therapy, those randomized to receive atorvastatin (40 mg per day 
before and during Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy) had no decrease 
in LVEF at 6 months, but those randomized to receive Anthracycl ine-based 
adjuvant therapy without statins had an 8% reduction in LVEF (Table 1).17 In 
other patients at high risk for CV events not receiving Anthrac ycline-based 
adjuvant therapy, pre-treatment with statin therapy before coronary artery 
interventions or elective surgery reduces subsequent CV events by reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and 
circulating neurohormones.
38-40 
These data suggest that statin pre-
treatment may attenuate LV 
dysfunction upon receipt of 
Anthracycline-based adjuvant 
therapy .   
  
 
2.3. Statins are well-tolerated and 
do not interfere with cancer 
therapy response rates or 
breast cancer recurrence after treatment for stage I-III breast  cancer. 
Degreef et al. found that statins were highly tolerated and contributed to lowering of adverse serum lipid 
levels during cancer treatment.41 Statins plus classical cytotoxic agents in breast cancer cell lines often 
enhance anti-cancer effects.42 Statins appear to stimulate apoptotic cell death in breast cancer cells and 
inhibit cancer cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle at the G1S phase and inducing apoptosis.43 
Statins did not increase breast cancer recurrence in a population-based prospective cohort study of 18,769 women diagnosed with stage I-III invasive breast carcino ma.

 We measured LV volumes, EF and circumferential strain; aortic PWV (a measure of aortic stiffness that 
contributes to LV after-load; and serum troponin I (TnI); before and 1, 3, and 6 months after initiating 3-month 
courses of low to moderately dosed Anthracycline-based adjuvant  therapy in 51 individuals with breast cancer, 
leukemia or lymphoma. Participants averaged 52±2 (range 19 to 81) years in age; 65% were women, and 20% 
were black. LV end systolic volume (LVESV), aortic PWV, and serum TnI increased, and LVEF and circumferential strain decreased after Anthracycline-based adju vant therapy (Fig. 3, in color). These findings 
persisted after adjustment for age, gender, race (white-black),  doxorubicin (DOX) equivalent chemotherapy 
dose, CV co-morbidities, cancer diagnosis (breast vs. not breas t), and resting cardiac or vascular function 
(p=0.032 to 0.0001 for all).
47 Change in LV or aortic function parameters was not DOX equival ent dose-related 
(r=0.01 to 0.05; p=0.85-0.92 for both). In a separate study, we substantiated early decreases in LVEF and increases in PWV after Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy will be compared to a control population after accounting for age, sex, cardiac output, cancer diagnosis, card ioactive medications, and underlying clinical 
conditions known to influence PWV, such as hypertension or diabetes (p<0.0001).
19 The 3- to 6-month 
increase in PWV was similar in effect to aging the vascular sys tem by 15 years. C ardiac dysfunction occurs 
early after relatively low to moderate doses of Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy, and persists 6 months 
after initiation (3 months after completion) of Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy.     
 
In a retrospective study from our institution, statin therapy appears to preserve LVEF after exposure to 
Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy . Preservation of left ventricular ejection fraction with statins 
during receipt of anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy. J Am Coll 
Cardiol 2012;59:E986.51      In 50 participants (33 women, 17 men; aged 
48±14 years), we performed blinded MR I measurements of LVEF prior to 
and 6 months after initiation of Anthracycline-based adjuvant t herapy for 
patients with breast cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma. 14 individu als received 
a statin for guideline-based indications and 36 did not. Statin  therapy was 
38±31 mg (range 5-80 mg) atorvastatin (n=6) or simvastatin (n=8 ). The 
cumulative anthracycline dose and DOX equivalent doses ranged f rom 30-
450 mg/m2 with means of 193±95 mg/m2 and 201±99 mg/m2 in statin and 
non-statin users, respectively. At baseline, the LVEF was 57±5%  and 57±9% 
for those taking and not taking a statin, respectively. In a mu ltivariable model 
accounting for age, gender, co-morbidities (DM, HTN, HLD), and the dose of 
anthracycline, the LVEF decline after statin use was -0.5% comp ared to -
7.8% in non-statin users (Fig. 4; p=0.0005). Moreover, in those  receiving 40-
80 mg/day of a statin, LVEF increased 2%; it decreased 3% after low (5-20 mg/day) dose statin (p<0.03).  
 
These data indicate that patients on statins for other guideline-based indications may be protected against 
deterioration in LVEF after Anthracycline-based therapy. 
 
Observational studies suggest that cognitive changes associated with statin use are uncommon and only 
temporarily affect cognition. Higher doses and advanced age were more associated with the predilection to 
develop cognitive decline. In our study, a moderate dose of ato rvastatin (40 mg) per day will be utilized, and 
assessments of cognitive functioning across primary domains and  cognitive symptoms will be collected using 
standardized methods from ongoing studies in the NCORPs. Subjec tive cognitive complaints are reported 
during chemotherapy by almost 70% of women;75,84,85 75% of breast cancer patients evaluated a year after 
adjuvant chemotherapy performed below age, education, and gende r-adjusted means on a variety of 
neurocognitive tests.86 Structural changes in cortical and subcortical brain regions ha ve been identified; 
however, the cause and cognitive correlation are unknown.87,88 Finally, cognitive deficits associated with LV 
dysfunction and CVD are well-documented,89,90 therefore, possible cardio-protective effects of statin therap y on 
cognition and quality of life, which can be negatively impacted  by deterioration in cognition, are important to 
assess. Based on studies of c hemotherapy and cognition, cardio-function and cognition and statin therapy and 
cognition, we propose a battery of validated neurocognitive measures to evaluate memory (verbal and non-verbal), attention/concentration, working memory, language, psy chomotor speed, processing speed, and 
executive functions, according to procedures utilized currently  in the NCORP network by Stephen Rapp, PhD, 
Figure 4: In a multivariable model 
adjusted for age, gender, co-
morbidities, and the anthracycline 
dose, those who received statin had an LVEF decline of 0.5% compared to the

mood, pain, social and physical functioning and sleep) will be assessed with brief, well-validated self-report 
questionnaires. 
 
3. SUMMARY OF STUDY PLAN 
 
3.1. Overview of Study and Study Design 
We propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 40 mg of atorvastatin 
(Lipitor®) or  placebo per day in 278 men and women age > 21 ye ars old scheduled to receive 
Anthracycline-based chemotherapy for Stage l-lll including infl ammatory Breast Cancer, or 
lymphoma Stage I-IV with a > 2 year life expectancy. Innovative  noninvasive MRI measures of LV 
volumes, EF, myocardial strain, PWV, arterial wall thickness, a nd other serum markers plus key 
patient reported outcomes including cognition and quality of li fe measures will be collected at 
baseline, 6 and 24 months after initiating treatment with Anthracycline-based therapy. In addition, participants will be contacted by telephone to assess medicatio n compliance/toxicities and Quality of 
Life at 12 and 18 months. Patients completing at least 24 months but no longer than 27 months of 
study medication will be followed for an additional 30 days after the last dose of study medication to 
evaluate any study related adverse events.  3.1.1  COVID-19 - Due to the inability to obtain a final 24 month assessment (rel ated to social 
distancing because of Coronavirus) of the primary outcome measu res for the Prevent study, this 
study has been amended to provide additional study drug to rema ining participants for an additional 
3 months.   This provision extends the window of opportunity to  collect the final study outcome 
measures within 27 months of beginning the study at a time when social distancing is not required due to the presence of the coronavirus in our communities.  This amendment allows for final study related assessments to be accomplished with participants still receiving the study drug.  Our 
statistical analyses which is ongoing  to examine the  change i n outcomes over time allows the exact 
time between baseline and follow up to be accounted for (I.e. the exact number of days between visits). This modification to allow patients to have their final measurements after 24 months (I.e. 27 months) will not negatively impact our ability to evaluate the stated hypotheses and outcomes for this 
study.   Moreover, this change we will ensure that to the best of our ability we will  evaluate the efficacy of the study drug on patients who take the drug until their final outcome assessments, as 
was the intention of our trial.  
 
3.2. We will use the established NCORP structure of the Wake Forest NCORP Research Base (WF 
NCORP RB). We will recruit from NCO RP Community sites and/or NC I NCORP Research Bases 
with appropriate MRI facilities that treat modest numbers of breast cancer and lymphoma patients with Anthracycline-based therapy. Importantly, the PI has visit ed and conducted interviews with all 
participating NCORP Community sites and/or NCI NCORP Research B ases to verify their MRI and 
breast cancer and lymphoma recruitment capabilities.  
  3.3. MRI was selected to provide the endpoints of left ventricular v olumes, LVEF, myocardial strain and 
PWV because of its: 
 
 Reliability (>90% of the valuable subjects in the Jackson Hear t Study for which Dr. Hundley 
serves as the Co-PI of the core lab and the preliminary cancer studies mentioned in Section 
C.1.), 
 Reproducibility (<2% discordance for repeated measures in the pilot data from the cancer 
participants), 
 Accuracy (its ability to detect informative changes indicative of both CV disease and 
forecasting prognosis), 
 Translational capability (its association with large NHLBI eff orts to assess CV disease and 
thereby make additional comparisons), and 
16 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
  Versatility (in that with a single imaging modality one cannot  only collect information 
regarding the measurement of LVEF but also the factors such as pre-load and after-load that 
can also impact the measurement of LVEF). 
 
Importantly, all sites have been verified as to the performance  of these procedures via onsite 
interviews and case image recovery. 
 
Ultrasound and radioisotope studies can be used to assess cardiac function. These measures, 
however, exhibit high variance, are operator-dependent, and are difficult to obtain in individuals with unfavorable body habitus. Radioisotope studies require exposure  to ionizing radiation. Catheter-
based assessments of left ventricular and vascular structure or  function can be acquired but these 
techniques are associated with the risks of an interventional p rocedure. Thus, we selected MRI for 
this study.

4.2.13 Pregnant or breast feeding. Due to unknown risks and pot ential harm to the unborn fetus a 
negative serum pregnancy test withi n 10 days prior to enrollmen t is required in women 
with child-bearing potential. For this reason women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of bi rth control; abstinence 
(not having sex), oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD ), DeProvera, tubal ligation, 
or vasectomy of the partner (with confirmed negative sperm coun ts) in a monogamous 
relationship (same partner). An acceptable, although less relia ble method involves the 
careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel and/or cervi cal cap or sponge prior to 
study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should  a woman become pregnant 
or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, s he should inform her study 
physician immediately.  Due to the potential effect of atorvastatin  when excreted in breast milk, women who are 
currently breast-feeding are not eligible for this study.  
4.2.14   Breast patients with tissue expanders are not allowed with the exception of tissue 
expanders made of material that are  MRI compatible. Check with the MRI technician to

4.4. Recruitment and Retention Plan 
4.4.1 Over 600 breast and lymphoma patients should be eligible for enrollment among the 
NCORP sites, approximately 14% of whom will be males. Assuming conservatively that 
17% (1 in 6) of the patients will consent to the study, we expe ct ~100 patients to be 
enrolled annually once the study is active at all planned sites. We will enroll 278 patients. We anticipate 28% of our cohort will drop out, so we expect 200  individuals to complete the 
study. In addition to NCORP sites, study enrollment will be opened to Alliance site members in which study coordinators, imaging expertise, and pat ient populations are 
readily available.  
 
 4.4.2. At each site, specific recruitment plans may include th e following according to the site’s 
institutional policy: screening clinic charts; tumor registry d ata; referral sources such as 
patient advocate groups, retirement communities, churches, support organizations, 
community organizations, newspapers, radio; or patient recruitm ent posters and recruitment 
letters. 
 
 4.4.3. The research PI or designee at each WF NCORP Research B ase NCORP, which may 
include the clinic physician, resident, research nurse or resea rch assistant, will review 
cancer registry and medical chart information to identify patie nts eligible for this protocol.  
Patients identified using these methods will be asked to join t he study during their next clinic 
visit/consultation. 
 
19 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 Accrual is expected to be 8 patients per month. Targeted accrual should be met in 
approximately 3 years for the 5 year study. A maximum of 278 pa tients will be enrolled on 
this trial. Patients will be followed for at least 24 months. P atients completing at least 24 
months of study medication but no longer than 27 months will be  followed for an additional 
30 days after the last dose of study medication to evaluate any study related adverse events. After the Final  assessment, the patient is no longer followed and data is no longer collected. 
 5. AGENT ADMINISTRATION
 
 
 5.1. Dose Regimen and Dose Groups : 
 
Group 1 (one 40 mg atorvastatin tablet each morning by mouth fo r at least 24 months but no longer 
than 27 months) and Group 2 (one placebo tablet each morning by mouth for at least 24 months but 
no longer than 27 months).  
  5.2. Atorvastatin/Placebo  Administration   
 
Patients will be 1:1 randomized to receive the study agent, (on e 40 mg atorvastatin tablet daily by 
mouth for at least 24 months but no longer than 27 months) or a placebo (one tablet daily by mouth for at least 24 months but no longer than 27 months). The study agent or placebo should be started within 48 hours (2 days) prior to first chemotherapy treatment.  The patient must receive 2 doses prior 
to first chemotherapy treatment. When possible those 2 doses may be given at least 12 hours apart. If necessary, due to time constraints, the patient may be given two tablets at the same time at least 
90 minutes prior to first chemotherapy treatment.
98  
 
Either agent will be taken once any time of day, with or without food, 7 days per week, on an 
outpatient basis, for a total of at least 24 months but no longer than 27 months.  The atorvastatin pills 
and matching placebo pills used for this study will be provided free of charge to the patient.   
 5.3. Run-in Procedures. N/A 
  
5.4 Contraindications
  
Active liver disease, which m ay include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase 
levels, or hypersensitivity to any  component of this medication. 
 
5.5. Concomitant Medications   
Atorvastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant  administration of this statin with 
inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of 
interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variabili ty of effect on CYP 3A4. The following 
CYP 3A4 inhibitors are not allo wed:  Boceprevir, Clarithromycin , Cyclosporine (oral), Darunavir plus 
ritonavir, Fosamprenavir, Fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, Gemfibr ozil, Grapefruit juice >1 liter per day, 
Itraconazole, Lopinavir plus ritonavir, Nelfinavir, Saquinavir plus ritonavir, Telaprevir, Tipranavir plus 
ritonavir.  It is also recommended due to possible reactions to  not use Rifampin and Digoxin.   
 5.6 Medication Modification  
 
5.6.1 Medication Modification for Myalgias  
 Grade 1 Myalgias – If needed patient may take NSAIDs/analgesics at the discretion of the treating physician. Frequently this type of skeletal pain is not relieved with these medications. 
 
20 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 Grade 2 or 3 Myalgias -  Study medication should be held and patient instructed in the u se 
of NSAIDS/analgesics per treating physician orders. ALT, AST and CK should be drawn 
within 24 hours.  
 If labs are in acceptable range (ALT and AST are < 3 x ULN and  CK < 2.5 x ULN) 
study medication should be resumed.  
 If Grade 2 or 3 myalgias redevelop, study medication should be  discontinued. Patient 
will be considered off study medi cation but will continue to be followed. 
 If ALT and/or AST are >3 x ULN and/or CK >2.5 x ULN study medi cation should be 
discontinued. Patient will be considered off study medication but will continue to be 
followed. 
Any patient with suspected rhabdom yolysis/compartment syndrome of lower 
leg or rupture of tendon should stop the study medication immediately. The treating physician should assess the patient and order CK isoenzymes and/or other labs as deemed necessary. Patient will remain on study (off study medic ation) and be followed 
as usual. 
5.6.2    Medication Modification for Elevated ALT, AST and/or CK Lab s 
5.6.2.1   Elevated baseline ALT, AST and/or CK  
At one and three months (+ or – 7 days) additional labs will be  drawn on patients with a 
baseline AST/ALT between ULN and < 3 x ULN and CK between ULN a nd < 2.5 x ULN. Labs 
are only repeated if baseline labs were above normal but within  eligibility limits.  
 
5.6.2.2   Elevated ALT, AST and/or CK while taking study medication  
 If AST, ALT is > 3 x ULN and/or CK is > 2.5 x ULN while patient  is taking study medication 
lab should be repeated in 1 week. If still elevated in 1 week, study medication should be 
stopped and AST, ALT, CK repeated in 6 weeks.  
 At 6 weeks the site PI/treating physician should review labs an d patients clinical status. If 
labs are within eligibility range patient may be re-challenged with study medication. The decision regarding re-challenging the patient is at the site PI /treating physician’s discretion. 
 
5.6.2.3   General Medication Modification  
 
Contact Robin Rosdhal RN OCN at (336) 713-6519 for any medicati on related issues. This 
includes but is not limited to the patient experiencing difficu lty with their medication regimen 
due to chemotherapy treatment and delays or interruptions in ta king study medication.  
 
5.7 Adherence  
 
5.7.1 Adherence will be estimated as: 1) the proportion of expected pills taken while on treatment 
and 2) the proportion of the total number of pills that could b e taken if the participant 
completed the study. We will calculate and report the mean adhe rence across all individuals 
as well as the proportion of patients who were 75% adherent (us ing both definitions of 
adherence). The primary analyses will include all randomized pa rticipants, regardless of 
adherence. Secondary analyses will be done using participants who were at least 75% 
adherent, separately using each definition.  
 
5.7.2 To determine patients’ adherence with the study agent, a medica tion diary will be utilized. It 
will be given to the patient by staff with instructions on how to complete. Every other month, 
medication diaries will be collected to verify medication usage. In addition, at 6 and 24 
21 
NCI Version Date 03/27/20 20 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 months any remaining bottle(s) o f study agent will be collected  from the patient and a pill 
count will be performed to verify the patient-recorded information in their medication diary.   
 
6.  PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
 6.1 Atorvastatin (Lipitor):  The dosing for this study will be a daily dose of 40mg for at least 24 months 
but no longer than 27 months. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. Pharmaceutical tests of atorvastatin  suggests aggressive dosing of HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce lipid levels and card iovascular mortality and morbidity to a 
significantly greater extent than standard statin doses, accord ing to the PROVE IT and REVERSAL 
trials. However, in our study, dosage has been set at 40mg daily in consideration of cancer chemotherapy treatment.     
 
Pharmacological Description: Atorvastatin is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. Atorvastatin is an 
inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) re ductase. This enzyme catalyzes 
the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. 
 
Atorvastatin calcium is [R-(R*, R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-ß, δ-dihydroxy-5-(1-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-1Hpyrr ole-1-heptanoic acid, calcium sal t (2:1) trihydrate. The empirical 
formula of atorvastatin calcium i s (C33H34 FN2O5)2Ca•3H2O and i ts molecular weight is 1209.42. 
Its structural formula is: 
 
 
 
 
 
Atorvastatin calcium is a white to off-white crystalline powder  that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of 
pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble i n distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate 
buffer, and acetonitrile; slightly soluble in ethanol; and freely soluble in methanol. Lipitor tablets for 
oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin a nd the following inactive ingredients: 
calcium carbonate, USP; candelilla wax, FCC; croscarmellose sod ium, NF; hydroxypropyl cellulose, 
NF; lactose monohydrate, NF; magnesium stearate, NF; microcryst alline cellulose, NF; Opadry 
White YS-1-7040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titan ium dioxide); polysorbate 80, NF; 
simethicone emulsion.  ProHance
® (Gadoteridol) Injection is a nonionic contrast medium for magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), available in vials for intravenous injection into either a vein or currently placed central line 
(port-a-cath) to help identify structures within the body durin g a MRI scan.  
  The ProHance
® injection dose is 0.15 mmol/kg, infused at 1 ml/sec, followed b y a saline  
flush of 20 ml. If the IV gauge is small, the infusion rate may  be decreased and is not critical.

 patients [n=2423]), constipation (In pre-marketing and open ex tension studies with a median 
 follow-up period of 18 months, constipation was reported in 6. 6% of enrolled patients 
 [n=2423]), nausea (In pre-marketing and open extension studies with a median follow-up 
 period of 18 months, nausea was reported in 5.4% of enrolled patients [n=2423])  
 Neurologic: Headache (In pre-marketing and open extension studies with a median follow-up 
 period of 18 months, headache was reported in 7.4% of all pati ents enrolled [n=2423])  
 Respiratory: Upper respiratory infection (9%) 
 Muscle Pain (Myalgia):  Soreness usually in upper arms and shoulders or hip and thighs 
 about 6%.  
 
Less Common 
 Confusion  < 2% 
 
Rare but Serious Events 
 Hepatic: Cholestatic hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (1%)  
 Musculoskeletal: Compartment syndrome of lower leg, disorder of muscle (20 to 40  mg/day, 
0.02% to 0.08%; 80 mg/day, 0.53% to 0.9%), rhabdomyolysis, rupt ure of tendon 
 Endocrine:  Diabetes < 0.25% or 1 per 400. 
 
ProHance® 
 
Most Common Events 
 headache, nausea, vomiting, itching, watery eyes, skin rash, facial and/or tongue swelling,  
 wheezing, chest tightness, or troubled breathing, hypotension (a decrease in blood 
pressure) may occur in about 2% of patients. 
 
Less Common 
 Extravasation happens in one out of every 250 to 500 procedure s. <0.2 to 0.4% 
 
Rare but Serious Events 
 renal failure   
 nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)  
 confusion  
 
The MRI contrast agent is used to help identify structures within the body on a MRI scan.  Minor reactions 
{principally headache, nausea, vomiting, itching, watery eyes, skin rash, facial swelling, thickening of the 
tongue, wheezing, chest tightness, or troubled breathing, hypotension (a decrease in blood pressure)} may 
occur in about 2% of patients.  Serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported in about 1 in 
400,000 patients who receive these agents.  All standard of care, medications and monitoring will be provided during this MRI scan. You may still participate in thi s study if a) you cannot receive Gadolinium-
contrast because you have known allergies to this contrast or h ave other severe drug allergies or b) you 
are not allergic to gadolinium-contrast but choose not to recei ve this contrast due the risks associated with 
the procedure. 
23 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
  
 Sometimes contrast may leak out of the IV and into the fatty t issue around a vein which is called an 
extravasation (x TRAH vuh SAY shun).  This happens in one out of every 250 to 500 procedures.  
Nonionic contrast is not likely to cause tissue damage and the contrast is reabsorbed.  If extravasation 
occurs, MRI staff will manage according to established protocol s at Wake Forest Baptist Health. 
 
 In very rare circumstances associated with dialysis and comple te renal failure, gadolinium in very high 
doses has been reported to be associated with nephrogenic syste mic fibrosis (NSF), a condition that 
causes hardening of tissue under the skin and potentially death.  To minimize the risk of developing this 
disorder, this study complies with all FDA criteria for adminis tration of gadolinium. Dialysis patients are 
excluded from receipt of gadolinium contrast as part of this study.  As a consequence, an estimation of 
your kidney function obtained within a month of your MRI scans will be used to identify potential risk to 
study participation as defined by the FDA.  Those with a glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min will not receive contrast as part of this study.        
 Recent medical literature publications have reported that pati ents receiving gadolinium contrast may 
accumulate gadolinium in parts of the brain long after the last  administration. Currently available 
information has not identified any adverse health effects resul ting from this accumulation of gadolinium 
based contrast agents. Participants will be notified of any new  information related to gadolinium-based 
contrast as it becomes available.  
MRI Sedation 
In the event a patient is claustrophobic (extreme discomfort or  fear of small spaces) they may be 
offered an intravenous injection of a sedative medication to make the patient drowsy, relaxed and 
comfortable during the MRI scan. This is at the discretion of t he site physician. Bec ause sedatives may 
decrease alertness and cause lightheadedness or dizziness, the patient must have another adult drive 
them home from the clinic if they are given sedation. 
 Possible risks and side effects of frequently used sedative medications may include: 
 
Most Common Events  may occur in about 2% of patients. 
 dizziness  
 headache 
 Less Common 
 unusually fast/slow/irregular heartbeat, 
 fainting,  
 confusion, 
 mental/mood changes, 
 trouble breathing, 
 muscle twitching and involuntary movements, 
 Rare but Serious Events 
 throat discomfort, 
 skin rash and hives.

 6.8.3 Randomization Process 
   See Section 12.1 
 
6.9. Unblinding Methods   
 In the event a patient on this study develops a toxicity (adve rse event or severe adverse event) for 
which the patient’s physician or other health care professional feels that it is in the patient’s best 
interest to know what drug they are taking (active study drug o r placebo), the following procedure 
should be followed: 
 
 Step 1: The patient’s physician or a designated health care professional should call the Wake 
Forest University Baptist Medical Center Physician Access Line at (336) 716-7654 and ask that 
Dr. Glenn Lesser, Director of the WF NCORP Research Base, be co ntacted immediately either 
in his office, by pager, or at home. In the event Dr. Lesser cannot be reached, the PAL operator should contact Dr. Kate Weaver, Director, Symptom Treatment Protocols, in her office, by pager, or at home. If neither Dr. Lesser nor Dr. Weaver can be reached, the PAL operator should contact Dr. David Herrington, Co-Investigator, in his office, by pager, or at home.  If Dr. Lesser, 
Dr. Weaver or Dr. Herrington cannot be reached, the PAL operato r should contact Dr. Joseph 
Yeboah, Co-Investigator, in his office, by pager, or at home. 
 
 Step 2: Once contact has been made, the patient’s physician or  health care professional should 
explain the reason for the request to unblind the treatment arm that the patient is on. If the  
Research Base representative feels that the toxicity (AE/SAE) i s possibly, probably or definitely 
related to the study drug, then the next step will be followed.  
 
 Step 3: The responsible Research Base representative will call  the pharmacist @ Biologics, Inc. 
(phone: 1-800-850-4306). There is an “on-call” service provided  24 hours a day, seven days a 
week for the Chemical Drug Trials unblinding service. The Biologics pharmacist may contact the 
patients’ physician and/or health care professional directly wi th the unblinding information. 
Written documentations of the unblinding process will be sent to the Research Base Principal Investigator by Biologics, Inc.  
 Step 4: In the event that the patient’s treatment is unblinded, that patient will be taken off study 
with no further study follow-up. Appropriate procedures for gra ding toxicities, assigning causality, 
and reporting severe adverse events (if applicable), should be followed. The event will be reviewed by the WF NCORP Safety and Toxicity Review  Committee and reviewed by the 
NCORP Research Base Data Safety and Monitoring Board.   Record the details of the adverse event and/or unblinding in the site source documentation and 
complete appropriate AE forms. 
 
  Unblinding Study Participants at Study Completion 
Study participants may be unblinded at the conclusion of the st udy if all patient specific data for the 
requesting site are completed and submitted to the Data Managem ent Center (DMC) and all of the 
primary study outcomes have been determined and the final data set is cleaned and prepared for 
analysis. Site members can obtain unblinding information by sending an email request to the WF 
NCORP Administrator or Data Management Supervisor with a list o f PID #s. After confirming with the 
DMC that patient specific data for all patients at the requesting site have been received, completed and entered into the RB database, the Research Pharmacy will be  notified. An email from the 
Research Pharmacy containing the unblinding information will be  sent directly to the requesting site.

     Unused drug should be destroyed on site following site institut ional policies and procedures. 
 
 7. CLINICAL EVALUATIONS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 7.1 Schedule of Events 
At each participating Research Base site, medical charts will b e screened to determine potential 
eligibility by physicians (including residents or fellows, if a pplicable), research nurses, or clinical 
research associates. This information should be recorded on the  Screening Form. Patients identified 
as potentially eligible will then be asked to consider joining the study. Patients meeting initial eligibility 
criteria and who agree to participate in the study will sign informed consent and then undergo a baseline nurse exam, laboratory tests and quality of life tests. At baseline, 6, and 24 months (or within 
27 months), the entire battery of neurocognitive tests and ques tionnaires will be administered by a 
trained and certified examiner. At 12 and 18 months participants will be contacted by phone to assess 
toxicities and medication comp liance. Quality of Life Questionn aires will be completed via mail.
 
Patients will be instructed in the self-administration of the s tudy agent. Patients will take one pill daily 
beginning within 48 hours (2 days) prior to the start of chemotherapy. It may be helpful if the patient 
receives 2 doses prior to first chemotherapy treatment and those 2 doses be at least 12 hours apart. 
If necessary however due to time constraints, the patient may be given 2 tablets at the same time at least 90 minutes prior to first chemotherapy treatment. Potenti al side effects and risks are described 
in Section 6.2. Adverse event r eporting is described in Section  10. Study outcomes will be assessed 
at baseline, after 6 months and at the end of 24 month (or within 27 months). Patients completing at least 24 months of study medication but no more than 27 months will be followed for an additional 30 
days after the last dose of study medication to evaluate any st udy related adverse events. 
  
 7.2. Screening/ Baseline Evaluations
 
Due to the scheduling complexity of protocol requirements prior  to the start of the first chemotherapy 
treatment, screening and baseline procedures and randomization may be performed at the sites 
discretion once the patient has signed the consent. The patient should be registered within 30 days of screening labs. 
          Subjects will be checked for height, weight, waist cir cumference, heart rate and blood pressure. 
 Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated at the data center. Patient physical exam including 
peripheral edema, smoking status and family history will be col lected by study personnel.  
 
Waist  circumference Measuring Directions  
 Patient should be instructed to not hold their breath. 
 The measuring tape should be secure but not tight. 
 The area being measured can be found by placing the hands on t he waist and moving them 
downward until the top curve of the hip bone can be felt. 
 The area being measured can be found by placing the hands on t he waist and moving them 
downward until the top curve of the hip bone can be felt. 
 Place the tape measure around the top of the hip curve and wra p around at the level of the belly 
button. (This may not be the same level as the top of the pants .) 
 Record this measurement in inches on the flow sheet.   
 
Study personnel will download the CV Risk Calculator according to specifications in Appendix 3.  After collecting the appropriate information, it will be entered in t he CV Risk Calculator. Note: If the patient is 
< 40 years old, data cannot be entered in CV Risk Calculator. T he result will be documented on the 
flow sheet and the Physician Statin Update Letter to be mailed to the treating and primary care 
physician. If the study participant should have statin therapy initiated, the study coordinator 
should complete the Open Label Form (Appendix 12) and submit to  the Data Management 
Center.

Serum and blood derived biomarkers - A blood sample of approximately 4 tablespoons will be taken 
from a vein in the arm/central line for lab analysis.  
 
Statins exert pleiotropic effects (modulation of systemic infla mmation and the neurohormonal axis) that 
in other models of heart failure influence LV function,57,58 and have been modulated in pilot animal 
studies.14 In this study, we will determine the relationship between Anth racycline-based therapy 
administration, statin use and biomarker evidence of systemic i nflammation59 and neurohormonal axis 
activation.60 We will associate these relationships with changes in both LV and vascular function. 
 
Labs for future testing -  Participants who consent to have blood stored for future resea rch will have 
an additional 1 tablespoon of blood drawn. These labs will be picked up and processed by LabCorp. 
Blood samples will be shipped and stored with a unique identifier and will not include any information 
protected by HIPAA regulations. LabCorp’s Bio-repository for bl ood samples is located in Kannapolis, 
North Carolina.  
 
MRI Variables -  MRI exams will be accomplished according to previously publish ed techniques  
described on the Research Base website under “Helpful Guides” l ocated in the Appendices section.  
Our research group and Dr. Hundley (PI) has extensive experienc e developing and utilizing these 
techniques in single center or multi-center efforts including t he Jackson Heart Study (Dr. Hundley is 
Co-PI for the core lab) and the MESA study.  
 
LVEF is the primary outcome because it is the most widely clini cally implemented assessment of LV 
performance, and is used to guide therapeutic intervention. LVE F has limitations as it can vary 
dependent on LV pre-load or after-load. To account for these limitations we are utilizing MRI to measure 
LVEDV (pre-load) and PWV (after-load). Also, we will perform ad vanced assessments of LV contractility 
including myocardial strain which is utilized in other NHLBI st udies (such as MESA). This will allow us 
to measure systolic performance independent of LV pre-load and enable cross.  Aortic distensibility will 
be assessed as an exploratory aim. 
 
The MRI is for study purposes only, the imaging results will no t be reviewed at the site. The WF 
NCORP Research Base will send a clinical update when the MRI is reviewed and/or alert the site study staff if an unrecognized myocardial infarction was identi fied. 
                              
At baseline, if a routine standard of care ECHO or MUGA is obta ined and available at the time of 
enrollment, the LVEF result should be documented on the enrollment form.  If the LVEF result is available after enrollment, record the result on the flow sheet . . 
 An MRI should be obtained between 5 and 7 ½ months. All anthrac ycline therapy should be completed 
and tissue expanders (if applicable) removed before obtaining the cardiac MRI. For time periods outside of these ranges, special permission for extenuating cir cumstances (e.g., significant healthcare 
issue warranting hospitalization) may be obtained by direct con tact with Dr. Hundley, the study PI. If it 
is determined a patient cannot have a 6 month (5-7 
1/2 month) MRI, the patient will continue on study 
as per protocol.   
The 24 – 27 month MRI should be obtained within 30 days prior t o the last dose of study medication. 
For time periods outside of these ranges, special permission for extenuating circumstances (e.g., 
significant healthcare issue warranting hospitalization) may be  obtained by direct contact with Dr. 
Hundley, the study PI.    
Due to unknown risks and potential harm to the unborn fetus and  because some methods of birth 
control are not 100% reliable, it is suggested that women of ch ildbearing potential take a pregnancy 
test prior to each MRI exam, as written in the informed consent  form. It is also suggested that a 
33 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 negative serum or urine pregnancy test be performed within 10 days of each MRI exam. Each site 
should follow their institution’s policies. 
 
MRI may be performed without contrast but it is preferred contr ast be used to better define the cardiac 
structures.  If the site has a signed contract with Bracco and ProHance is supplied, the site will be responsible for maintaining a careful record of the inventory a nd disposition of the ProHance

received.  
  
Neurocognitive Function 
     
Cognition and Quality of Life  
Once eligibility has been established the neurocognitive test b attery and the study questionnaires will 
be completed. Individual components of the full battery are des cribed below. Tests have been selected 
to represent a range of cognitive abilities which have been rep orted in the literature to be affected by 
chemotherapy including attention , verbal memory, working memory , executive functions, speed of 
mental processing and verbal fluency. An abbreviated battery co nsisting of two tests has been 
developed for the baseline assessment to reduce participant bur den (see below). All cognitive testing 
will be performed by a trained and certified research assistant blinded to treatment assignment. The 
WF NCORP Research Base has conducted training workshops and produced videos for administering 
this cognitive test battery for our completed trials among irradiated brain tumor patients and breast cancer patients exposed to chemotherapy, and maintains a string ent certification process (Section 
8.2).   An abbreviated  battery of the cognitive tests and shorter vers ions of quality of life questionnaires will 
be used at baseline to reduce participant burden and due to time constraints related to the start of the first chemotherapy treatment. The shorter battery includes the same tests  in the longer version used 
at 6 and between 24 - 27 months to ensure we have adequate cons istency across assessment points.  
Each cognitive test has adequate psychometric properties and ha s been used in cancer research 
including large national and international clinical trials (Ahl es & Saykin, 2002; Mehta et al., 2002; 
Meyers et al., 2004). The entire cognitive test battery takes 1 0 minutes to administer at baseline and 
30 minutes to administer at 6 months and 24 months..It will be administered with the questionnaires 
which takes 10 minutes at baseline 6 months and 24 months. 
 
Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA) 
The COWA (Benton & Hamsher, 1976) measures speed of mental processing, verbal fluency, and 
executive function. Subjects are  asked to name as many words as  possible all beginning with a 
specified letter.  A total of three trials are administered, each with a different letter (C-F-L).  The score 
on the COWA is the total number of words named across the three  trials minus repetitions.  The 
COWA has two equivalent forms (C-F-L and P-R-W) that will reduc e practice effects. Internal 
consistency reliability (alpha=0.83) and test-retest reliabilit y (r = 0.74) are excellent (Ruff et al., 1996). 
 Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) 
The HVLT-R measures verbal learning and memory.  It consists of a 12-item word list which is read to subjects on three successive learning trials. Free recall score s are recorded for each learning trial.  
After a 20-minute interval during which subjects complete other  non-interfering tasks and 
questionnaires they are asked to recall the target words. Lastl y, a yes/no recognition task is then 
presented in which subjects are asked to identify all target words by responding “yes,” and to reject 12 non-target words by responding “no.” The HVLT has six equivalen t alternate forms (Brandt, 1991) to 
minimize confounding by practice effects. Test-retest reliabili ty of the HVLT is quite good (0.74).  The 
test is brief, taking only 10 minutes to administer, and it is well-tolerated by compromised (geriatric and 
dementia) populations. Scores for immediate recall (total of th ree trials), delayed recall (total number 
of words recalled after 20 minutes), and recognition (total number of words correctly identified) will be the variables derived from the HVLT-R.  
34 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 Trail Making Test, Parts A & B (TMT-A, TMT-B) 
Part A of the TMT(Reitan, 1958)  measures attention and visual motor skills and processing speed and 
requires subjects to connect 25 numbered circles in the proper sequence (1-2-3-…) as quickly as 
possible. TMT-B is similar except subjects are required to conn ect dots in an alternating numerical and 
alphabetical sequence (1-A-2-B-…). TMT-B with its added complex ity and set shifting requirements is 
a widely used measure of executive function. The score for TMT-A and TMT-B is the total time in 
seconds required to complete the task. Scores can also be generated for number of errors and number of circles correctly connected. The TMT has excellent re liability and validity (Reitan, 1992). 
 
Digit Span Test (DST) 
The DST (Wechsler, 1981) assesses attention and working memory.   It requires respondents to repeat 
back gradually increasing spans of numbers. Seven series of two  spans of each length are presented 
and repeated backwards.  A total score is the sum of the longes t span backwards. 
  
Self-Report Questionnaires: 
The Patient Reported Outcomes Meas urement Information System (P ROMIS) is a collection of well-
validated, brief, fee-free instruments assessing key patient re ported outcomes related to this study. 
Each PROMIS scale has excellent psychometric properties (reliab ility and validity) and are being used 
in many clinical trials and observational studies. For this study, we will include the short forms for:  
 PROMIS Applied Cognition – General Concerns – Short Form 4a (4 items)  
 PROMIS Applied Cognition – Abilities – Short Form 4a (4 items)  
 
PROMIS Fatigue – Short Form 4a (4 items)  
 
PROMIS Mood – Emotional Distress - Anger – Short Form 5a (5 ite ms)  
       Emotional Distress - Anxiety – Short Form 4a (4 items)  
 Emotional Distress - Depression – Short Form 4a (4 items)  
  
PROMIS Pain Intensity - Short Form 3a (3 items) 
 PROMIS Pain Interference - Short Form 4a (4 items)  PROMIS Sleep Disturbance - Short Form 4a (4 items) 
 
PROMIS Physical Function - Short Form 4a (4 items)  PROMIS Ability to Participate in  Social Roles and Activities - Short Form 4a (4 items)  
 
The total administration time for these questionnaires is 10 mi nutes. 
 
 7.3. Evaluations During Study Intervention 
Study participants in both statin and placebo groups will have a Cardiac MRI (see Section 7.2 for 
pregnancy testing prior to MRI exams), and blood drawn for a ca rdio profile, lipids, CK, ALT, AST, 
Total Bilirubin, glucose, TSH, Hematocrit (only if gadolinium c ontrast is administered for the MRI) and 
neurohormonal biomarkers at screening/baseline, 6 months and between 24 - 27 months. Biomarkers studied include ultrasensitive troponin I (for myocellular inju ry); C-reactive protein, interleuken-6, 
tumor necrosis factor-a (systemic inflammation); and renin and aldosterone (circulating 
neurohormones). Additional blood samples will be drawn on parti cipants who consented to have 
blood stored for future research.  
 
See section 5.6.1 for Modification of Study Medication related to Myalgias which may require 
additional labs at 1 and 3 months.

month. A pill count is required when the patient is seen at 6 m onths, 24 months or at any ti me the patient discontinues 
the study medication. 
K -  1 Month Post Final Assessment cont act form - Patients completin g 24 - 27 months of study medication should be 
followed for an additional 30 days after last dose of study med ication for related adverse events.  
 
7.8. Off Treatment Criteria  
Participants may stop taking atorvastatin for the following rea sons: completed the protocol-prescribed 
intervention, adverse event or serious adverse event, inadequat e agent supply, concomitant 
medications, medical contraindication, or interruption of chemo therapy due to adverse events or 
death. 
Participants will continue to be followed, if possible, for safety reasons and in order to collect endpoint 
data according to the schedule of events.  The study is designe d to account for drop-outs due to poor 
health or death or loss to follow-up; thus, there will be no replacement of subjects that must drop out 
of the study after enrollment.  
 7.9 Off-Study Criteria 
Participants may go ‘off-study’ for the following reasons: the protocol intervention and any protocol-required follow-up period is completed, adverse event/serious a dverse event, lost to follow-up, 
concomitant medication, medical contraindication, withdraw cons ent, or death.   
 
Since the study inception and development of the inclusion/excl usion criteria, guidelines regarding the 
potential administration of statins have been released by the A CC/AHA on November 12, 
2013.  These new guidelines suggest the use of a calculator to assess cardiovascular risk with 
subsequent initiation of statin therapy based on that risk.  Co ncomitant with the release of the 
guidelines, however, have been several articles suggesting that the calibration of the calculator was somewhat imperfect, particularly in regards to data from both t he Nurses’ Health and Physicians’ 
Health studies.    
 
38 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 As a result of these controversies, the study investigators elected to leave the initial entry and 
exclusion criteria intact.  Importantly however, their respecti ve primary care physician will be mailed a 
letter raising their awareness to the publication of these guidelines.  If the study participant and their primary care physician elect to initiate statin therapy, they w ill be counseled to stop their study drug 
and notify the respective investigators at their study site.  T hey will still be allowed to participate in all 
other aspects of the trial as an open label statin user.  Data analyses regarding intention to treat as 
well as treatment effect will be performed.    
 
8. PROTOCOL SPECIFIC TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 
 8.1 MRI Training 
 Refer to the “Helpful Guides” located on the Research Base website in th e Appendices section.  
 The study PI presented the MRI protocol for review and discuss ion with the MRI technologists 
 and associated study coordinators during the Investigator meet ing held at the 2013 Annual 
 Research Base NCORP Meeting. 
Prior to the start of participant enrollment into the study, Wake Forest University Medical Center 
cardiology imaging specialists observe and continue MRI trainin g at each of the study locations.   
 
Each site will be required to submit 2 satisfactorily performed  studies to the image coordinating center 
at Wake Forest before initiating the study.   8 . 2   NEUROCOGNITIVE TRAINING  
   8.2.1 Certification Requirement 
Certification for the administration of the neurocognitive battery and questionnaires will include self-study, internet-based training, didactic presentations, role-played administrations, and Q&A and feedback. All training will be sup ervised by experienced test 
administrators (Dr. Rapp at WFUSM, Robin Rosdhal RN OCN, Site Coordinator or other trained/certified administrator who will be responsible for cer tifying test administrators.) They 
will also be responsible for helping staff maintain certificati on by having regular meetings to 
discuss the procedures and providing supplemental training as needed. 
  
 
Bilingual staff must be certified to administer neurocognitive battery to non-English speaking patients. Certification procedure must be completed by staff pr ior to patient enrollment.   
 
   8.2.2 Certification Procedures  
All neurocognitive assessments will be conducted by trained and  certified research 
personnel.  Training and certification procedures must be compl eted by research staff prior 
to patient enrollment. Certificat ion for administration of the neurocognitive battery will include 
viewing of a training video on the Wake Forest University Healt h Sciences website, 
reviewing the content of the protocol-specific test booklets including all aspects of 
administration and scoring, a didactic presentation of each tes t and questionnaire to be 
administered, and role-playing of administrations with Q&A and feedback. All training will be supervised by experienced test a dministrators (Dr. Stephen Rapp , psychologist and co-PI of 
this study, and other trained/certified administrators designat ed by the WF NCORP 
Research Base.)   There are 3 ways to become certified: 1) Training and certifica tion on-site by WF NCORP 
certified personnel, contact NCORP@wakehealth.edu; 2) Training and certification at the 
annual meeting of the WF NCORP Research Base, held each fall (c ontact the Research 
Base Administrative Secretary at (336) 716-0891 for date of nex t meeting; 3) By sending in a 
recorded presentation  and administration booklet to NCORP@wakehealth.edu  for 
39 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 certification review. Alliance sites that have current credentialing for Alliance neurocognitive 
studies may choose #3 for WF certification. 
 
Periodic re-certifications will be required if it has been more than 6 months since the staff member administered the tests. This procedure has been successfully used in our studies of cognitive effects of cancer and its treatments as well as by Dr. Rapp and his team in large scale, multi-site clinical trials and observational studies (e. g., WHIMS, CoSTAR, SPRINT, 
Look AHEAD, LIFE, MESA). 
 
9. SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT  
 
  9.1 Storage of Blood for Future Research Testing (if applicable) 
 
At baseline, 6 months and 2 years an additional 2 tubes of bloo d will be collected on patients who 
have given consent to store blood for future research testing.  
 These future tests may include searches for combinations of genetic nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with susceptibility to a fall in LVEF in patients receiving chemotherapy. At present, planned testing is not specified and thus not included in our s pecific aims. All blood samples will be 
de-identified and stored in LabCorp’s Bio-repository located in Greenfield, IN. Only researchers approved by Dr. Greg Hundley, the principal investigator at Wak e Forest School of Medicine will 
receive the sample.  Lab supplies and instructions for blood st ored for future research testing will be 
provided by LabCorp.  (See Appendix 10 for further lab instructions). 
 
Labs for future research testing should not be drawn and sent t o LabCorp  until specific 
consent for future research testing has been verified and eligi bility established. 
        9.2 Lab Corp: Routine Labs required Per Protocol  
Lab Corp will be utilized for all labs . LabCorp couriers will deploy to each site from local LabCorp 
facilties for specimen pick-up as samples are drawn. All specim ens should be collected in containers 
provided by LabCorp. Note storage times and temperature instruc tions for each test.                                        
 
Eligibility and baseline labs (Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Triglycer ides, Glucose, Creatine Kinase, 
TSH, ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, Hematocrit [only if gadolinium contrast is to be administered for the MRI procedure] and BHCG if applicable) will be drawn an d analyzed by LabCorp. Once 
eligibility has been determined the remaining protocol labs (He matocrit preferred within 8 
hours but acceptable to within 40 hours of MRI for patient’s receiving gadolinium contrast) CRP, Troponin 1, Aldosterone, IL-6, TNF-a, and Renin will be drawn and sent to LabCorp.  
 
9.3 Collection and Handling Procedures 
Refer to Appendix 10 for instructions. 
 
10. REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS   
    
 A list of serious adverse events that have occurred or might o ccur that are related to this study 
intervention can be found in Section 6.2. 
 Serious Adverse Event reporting begins after the informed consent is signed. 
 Serious Adverse Events occurri ng within 30 days of study compl etion must be reported via FDA

10.1 Protocol Specific Reporting for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
 
  DEFINITION: ICH Guideline E2A and Fed. Reg. 62, Oct. 7, 1997 define serious adverse events as 
those events which meet any of the following criteria? 
 Results in death 
40 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
  Is life threatening (Note: the term life-threatening refers to an event in which the patient was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to  an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe). 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing  hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial  disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
 Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect 
 Events that may not meet these criteria, but which the investi gator finds very unusual and/or 
potentially serious, will also be reported in the same manner. 
  
 Grades 4 and 5 expected (solicited) and unexpected (unsolicited) SAEs that meet the 
above definition for SAEs and/or regardless of attribution (i.e . regardless of whether 
they are related to this study intervention or not) should be r eported to the RB DMC 
using the FDA Form 3500 (MedWatch).  
 
 Site staff and/or Principal Investigators will report to the R B Data Management Staff within 
24 hours of discovering the details of all unexpected severe, life-threatening (grade 4) 
and/or fatal adverse events (grade 5) if there is reasonable su spicion that the event was 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to the study interven tion.  
 
Otherwise, the MedWatch should be sent to the RB DMC by fax or email within 10 working days 
of discovering the details of the SAE. 
 
   D a t a  E l e m e n t s  t o  i n c l ude on the MedWatch are:

10.2 Guidelines to determine grade and severity of AEs and/or S AEs 
Identify the adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.03.  The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each 
adverse event listed.  A copy of the CTCAE can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm#ctc_40 
 
AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE grade associated wi th the AE term.  AEs that do not 
have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to t he general guidelines for grading 
used in the CTCAE v4.03. as stated below. 
  
Grade Severity Description  
1 Mild Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 
2 Moderate Moderate; minimal, loc al or noninvasive intervention  
indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL*. 
3 Severe Severe or medically significant but not immediately li fe-
threatening; Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**. 
41 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 4 Life threatening Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated. 
5 Fatal Death related to AE. 
  
          Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 
 *  Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceri es or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc. 
 * *  Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 
 
The Research Base Grant PI, Safety and Toxicity Review Committee and/or Study Chair will take appropriate action to inform the membership and statistical per sonnel of any protocol modifications 
and/or precautionary measures, if this is warranted. 
 
The RB DMC is responsible for communicating AEs/SAEs to the FDA, the drug sponsor, WF IRB, the 
WF Safety and Toxicity Review Committee (STRC) and/or other reg ulatory agencies as appropriate per 
agency reporting requirements. 
 
Institutions must comply with their individual Institutional Re view Board (IRB) policy regarding 
submission of documentation of adverse events. All MedWatch reports should be sent to the local IRB in accordance with the local IRB policies. 
 
 10.3 Follow-up of SAEs  
  Site staff should send follow-up reports as requested when additional information is available. 
Additional information should be entered on the MedWatch form i n the appropriate format.  Follow-
up information should be sent to the RB Data Management Center as soon as available.

Source documents are the original signed and dated records of p articipant information (e.g., the 
medical record, shadow chart) whi ch may include electronic docu ments containing all the information 
related to a participant’s protocol participation. Source documents are used to verify the integrity of the study data, to verify participant eligibility, and to verif y that mandatory protocol procedures were 
followed. An investigator and other designated staff are required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate documentation that records all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation for each individual participating in the study. All data recorded in the research record (including data recorded on CRFs) must originate in the partici pant’s medical record, study record, or 
other official document sources. 
 
Source documents substantiate CRF information. All participant case records (e.g., flow sheets, 
clinical records, physician notes, correspondence) must adhere to the following standards:

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1. Study Design/Endpoints  
This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that randomizes 278 participants into 1 of 2 treatment arms: Group 1 (one 40 mg atorvastatin tab let each morning by mouth for 24 
months) or Group 2 (one placebo tablet each morning  by mouth for at least 24 months but no more 
than 27 months) with the goal of having at least 200 remaining at the trial’s end for final assessments (assuming an approximate 28% loss to follow-up). A permuted blo ck randomization stratified by 
cancer type (breast vs lymphoma) and planned Anthracycline-based therapy doses of Doxorubicin < 
or ≥ 240 mg/m
2 or Epirubucin < or ≥ 400mg/ m2; close to the median dose of our pilot studies) will 
ensure treatment group balance is achieved within strata.  As i n all our pilot studies and clinical 
practice, Doxorubicin and Epirubicin doses will be assessed to account for receipt of different anthracyclines.  The primary endpoint in this trial is LVEF, and thus the primary efficacy analysis will 
examine whether the statin therapy can attenuate the reduction in LVEF in patients with breast 
cancer or lymphoma who receive Anthracycline-based therapy. Pri mary endpoints include LVESV, 
LV end diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV mid-wall circumferential strain, T1-ECV (a measure of 
replacement fibrosis), PWV, aortic wall thickness, CRP and TNF-α, serum lipoprotein levels, and circulating neurohormones.  
 
  12.2. Primary Aims 
Specific Aim 1: To determine if atorvastatin administration preserves LVEF 24 – 27 months after 
receipt of Anthracycline-based therapy for breast cancer and ly mphoma. 
  Specific Aim 2: To determine if baseline to 6-month differences in LVEF predi ct baseline to 24- 27 
month differences in LVEF after Anthracycline-based therapy and  concomitant atorvastatin therapy. 
 12.3. Analysis Plan 
The primary hypothesis for Specific Aim 1 is that statin use wi ll protect against a harmful reduction in 
LVEF measured over 24 – 27 months for patients with breast canc er or lymphoma who receive 
Anthracycline-based therapy. All randomized patients will be used in the analysis to compare groups 
(“intent to treat” approach). Since LVEF is measured on a continuous scale and this is a randomized 
trial, our primary analysis will fit an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that compares the 24- 27 month values of LVEF between groups adjusting for the baseli ne (pre-treatment) levels of LVEF 
and stratification factors. Note that patients are stratified b y planned dose and that is the stratification 
that will be used in the analysis, even if the patient ends up getting a different dose. This analysis will 
address the first specific aim.  To address the second primary aim, we will examine whether the early treatment effect of statin use (6 months post randomization) predicts the long-term (24 – 27 m onth) effect of statins. Pilot data 
(Section 2) suggest that Anthracycline-based therapy injury occ urs early and concomitant statin use 
attenuates this early Anthracycline-based therapy-mediated inju ry. We will fit an ANCOVA model 
that compares the 24- 27 month LVEF values for the treated and control groups and will also include covariates for the baseline LVEF and 6-month change in LVEF values. We will examine the treatment by 6-month LVEF change interaction to determine whether the correlation between early and late changes in LVEF differs by treatment.  Thus, this model will have 4 terms of interest: the main effect for treatment, the main effect for the change in LV EF after 6 months, the main effect for 
baseline pre-treatment LVEF, and the treatment by change in LVEF after 6-month interaction. If the interaction is non-significant, w e will examine the model with the 3 main effects. Since there may be 
limited power to test this interaction, we will use a 0.15 thre shold for testing significance of the 
45 
NCI Version Date 03/27/2020 WF NCORP RESEARCH BASE 98213 
 
 interaction term in the model. 
 
After primary efficacy analyses, additional analyses of the primary hypotheses will be done to assess 
relationships between treatment and outcome. We will fit ANCOVA  models that consider the 24-27 
month LVEF measure as the outcome, the baseline LVEF measure as  a covariate, and other 
patient-level characteristics (e.g. age, cancer type, stage, and race) in order to control for other baseline covariates possibly related to LVEF in the model.  Int eractions between the treatment and 
covariates will be examined to determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across 
subgroups (e.g., black/white race by treatment interaction). Finally, we will conduct a repeated measures ANCOVA model that incorporates the intermediate (6-mon th) LVEF measurement into the 
model. We anticipate examining different covariance structures.  Past experience suggests that a 
compound symmetry structure is usually appropriate; we will als o examine whether an unstructured 
covariance is needed. We will fit these models using a mixed mo dels approach, where the individual 
patient will be treated as a random effect in the model and the treatment indicator as patient characteristics (and baseline LVEF) will be considered as fixed  effects. A mixed models approach for 
modeling the longitudinal data will allow for appropriate inference to be made in the presence of missing data (i.e., patient drop-outs) if the missing data are missing at random (MAR). Below, we describe methods to address MAR assumptions. Diagnostics and residual plots will be reviewed to 
ensure that all assumptions are met. If not, transformations of the outcome data will be considered, 
where the order of the priority in choosing a transformation wi ll be to satisfy the (1) linearity 
assumption, (2) homogeneity assump tion (homoscedasticity), and (3) normality assumption.  
 
  12.4. Potential Analytic Concerns in Primary Efficacy Analyse s 
Lost to Follow-up: We designed this study to recruit 278 total patients so that 200 are available at 
the end of the study. Thus, we will need to consider how to ana lyze data from the 78 patients who 
may drop out. To examine whether the missing data are either mi ssing completely at random or 
missing at random, we will compare the baseline characteristics  of those who drop out and those 
who complete the trial. If there is no evidence of informative missing data, analyses will be done 
using the repeated measures ANCOVA with a mixed models approach  (PROC MIXED in SAS). 
However, if there is evidence that the missing data are informative and treatment-related (e.g. if 
there are fewer dropouts in the statin group or if missingness is related to other medical outcomes that are strongly associated with the outcome of interest) and not MAR, then we will use more 
sophisticated statistical methods.
78-80 One possible approach is to model the probability of dropping- out 
for each participant conditional on their baseline characteristics and treatment assignment. These probabilities would then be used to stratify participants (both  completers and drop-outs) before making 
treatment comparisons. Thus each stratum would contain participants with similar predicted probabilities of trial completion (although only a subset would  be completers). The final treatment effect 
estimates could be made using the completers with weights assig ned to them based on the ratio of 
drop-outs to completers within each stratum. This approach and other methods for handling missing 
data have been by previously described by Dr. D’Agostino.
78-80 
 
 12.5. Secondary Analyses: Once the primary efficacy analysis is completed, secondary efficacy 
variables will be examined to provide insight into mechanisms b y which statins may influence LVEF. 
These include: LVESV and strain (reflective of LV contractility ), LVEDV (reflective of LV pre-load), 
PWV and aortic wall thickness (reflective of LV after-load), an d LVECV (a measure of myocellular 
replacement fibrosis). In addition, we will measure a series of  subclinical biomarkers, including 
serum lipids (LDL, TC, HDL), glucose, serum troponin I, CRP, IL -6, TNF-α, renin, and aldosterone at 
the 6- and 24-27 month endpoints. For each, we will fit ANCOVA models that will examine the 24-27 
month endpoints adjusted for baseline assessments, followed by ANCOVA models  
  that also include patient-level characteristics. Next, we will fit repeated measures ANCOVA models 
that incorporate intermediate (6-month) time point assessments.  This approach will be repeated for 
the cognitive and patient reported outcomes.  The latter analyses will also include data for the 12 
and 18 months follow-ups.

 12.6. Power and Sample Size considerations for the primary hypothesis 
For the primary hypothesis, sample size and power calculations can be made based on direct 
comparisons between the expected changes in outcome means in th e different treatment groups. 
These calculations need to account for the proportion of the va riance in the primary efficacy of 
outcome (LVEF) explained by the other terms in the model (i.e.,  baseline values). To adjust for the 
proportion of variance explained by the baseline measurement wh en estimating the variance for the 
follow-up outcome measure, we used the formula [V follow-up adjusted for baseline covariates  = V follow-up  (1-r2)], 
where r2 is the square of the correlation between the baseline and foll ow-up measure. Our primary 
efficacy analysis is based on comparing the change in LVEF levels from baseline to 24 – 27 months, and r above is the correlation between these two measurements. These power calculations may be conservative, since intermediate assessments of LVEF at 6 months are not included. In other words, 
the mixed models approach (described in the additional analyses ) would likely provide greater power 
than the ANCOVA model used here , but further assumptions concerning the covariance structure to 
be used and correlation among intermediate measures would need to be made. Thus, we believe 
that the power described by the simpler method (ANCOVA) is adequate to address our hypotheses 
and is expected to be conservative. 
 
The following formula was used to describe the minimum detectable difference for the LVEF 
between the statin and placebo groups:   
    
 
In the above, r
2 is the percent of the variance of the follow-up outcome explained by the baseline 
measurement (LVEF), Z 1-α/2 is the value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the 
alpha level chosen (1.96, which corresponds to alpha=0.05 [two sided]), Z 1-β is the value from the 
standard normal distribution that corresponds to the power chos en for the study (here 80% and 
90%), and n=100 corresponds to the total number of patients studied for the statin group. We chose this sample size (100 per group) for power calculations to allo w for up to 78 patients out of the 278 
accrued to potentially drop-out. Note that this will somewhat conservative for the mixed models as 
those with partial data will also provide information.  Based o n preliminary data examining LVEF 
levels in comparable patients meas ured over a 6-month period we  found that the standard deviation 
was approximately 7.7 and the correlation between baseline and 6-months was 0.5. Since we do not 
know what the correlation will be after 2 years, Table 5 depict s detectable differences for different 
correlations and power values. In addition, we show detectable differences for key secondary 
variables for which we have preliminary data (LVEDV, LVESV, and  PWV).  
 
Thus, for example, we have 80% power to detect a difference of 2.6% in LVEF between groups if the correlation between the baseline and 24-month LVEF is 0.5. In p reliminary observational data, we 
saw a difference in LVEF between statin users vs. those who wer e not of 2.5% at 6 months. Thus, 
effect sizes of the magnitude in Table 5 are plausible and clin ically meaningful. 2-6 ml increases in 
LVESV, or 3-5% drops in LVEF (from a normal resting LVEF) have been associated with adverse 
CV prognoses in a recent large trial of patients with HF and a preserved resting LVEF.
81 In 483 
hypertensive patients aged 50±13 y ears, aortic PWV measures of 11 m/s were associated with odds 
ratio of 2.14 for cardiac events (p<0.0001).82 Other studies that have initiated generic therapies such 
as ACE inhibitors or beta blockers  with antioxidant properties have shown a reduced occurrence of 
CV events in cancer survivors.83 Importantly however, it remains  to be seen whether early initi ation 
of statin therapy reduces the onset of subclinical CV disease in patients with breast cancer or lymphoma.

 12.7.  Reporting and Exclusions 
We will measure the level of compliance in randomized patients. If a patient drops out of the study early due to an adverse event that may be related to statin use, they will be non-compliant for subsequent treatment, and thus still inform the primary endpoin t for our analyses, and their outcome 
will be considered as “non-compliant”.  For patients who drop out early due to a non-statin related adverse event or die during the study we will analyze them in t he following ways. 
 
        First we will conservatively assume that all drop-outs/ deaths are non-compliant.  Since there is a 
placebo group in this study we can assume that the rates would be similar between groups and still 
allow a comparison of compliance rates between groups.  Next, w e will consider two forms of 
imputation for secondary analyses.  The first will use early compliance data (if available) to determine a compliance rate and that value will be carried forw ard to the end (i.e., Last observation 
carried forward) and the second would be to use a multiple imputation procedure to impute final compliance rates for participants based on modeling the compliance rates for those with complete data.  
.  
 12.8. Evaluation of Toxicity 
      All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first dose of atorvastatin.      
12.9. Evaluation of Response 
All participants will be assessed for compliance once they are randomized to treatment and receive 
at least one dose of treatment.  The primary analysis will consist of all randomized patients who 
receive at least one dose of study drug.  Secondary analyses wi ll consist of patients who either 
complete the trial (with ≥ 75% compliance) or who drop out for adverse events that are related to the 
use of statins.  Patients who drop out for non-related adverse events or die for reasons not related to statin use will be removed from the secondary analysis. Adverse  events described by the Data 
Safety Monitoring Committee as related to statin use will be di fferentiated so as to render decisions 
regarding study drug compliance. 
 
12.10. Interim Analysis  
Interim reviews will be performed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee every six months to 
assess accrual, retention, compliance, the incidence of AEs, SAEs, diabetes and LV function measures.

Study DrugsPembrolizumab
Cetuximab
ObjectivesPrimary:
To  estimate the objective response rate of patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer treated with pembrolizumab 
and cetuximab.
To  estimate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) 
rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated 
with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.
To  examine the adverse event profile of combining 
pembrolizumab and cetuximab.
Secondary:
To  examine the PFS of patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.
To  determine the objective response rate by immune-
related response criteria (irRECIST) of patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer treated with pembrolizumab 
and cetuximab
To  examine the overall survival of patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer treated with pembrolizumab and 
cetuximab.
Exploratory:
To  identify tumor and peripheral blood biomarkers of 
response and/or resistance to the study treatment.
Study Design Phase Ib\II study, single arm, multi-institutional study. 
Target Accrual and Study DurationWe will target 42 eligible and treated patients, but will require at 
least 38 eligible and treated patients. An initial 9 patient phase Ib 
study is planned to ensure safety of the combination. This will be 
followed by further enrollment of 33 patients on the phase II study. 
It is expected that this study will enroll 1-2 patients per month. With 
this accrual rate, this study is anticipated to finish accrual in 4 years. 
Assuming a minimum of 6 months of follow-up in all patients, the 
study will take 4 years to complete in total.
Study ProceduresDisease Evaluation: CT chest/abd/pelvis (or acceptable alternative) 
every
 9 weeks (+/- 7 days)
Physical Examination (including vital signs, and body weight):

Statistical AnalysisSample Size Determination: We utilize two primary endpoints for 
this study: the proportion of patients achieving complete or partial 
RECIST objective response rate and the proportion surviving 
progression-free for at least six months.  While the addition of 
pembrolizumab to cetuximab may have cytotoxic effect, it may act 
primarily in a cytostatic fashion; therefore, it is important to 
consider both endpoints, and thus declare the agent worthy of 
further investigation if it shows activity on either endpoint. We 
utilize a single-stage version of the bivariate design of Sill, et al 
(2012). Based on historical data, the response rate for cetuximab 
alone in this patient population is approximately 20%, and the 
proportion of patients surviving progression-free for at least six 
months is approximately 30%.  We will target 42 eligible and 
treated patients, but will require at least 38 eligible and treated 
patients in order to have ≥80% power to detect activity based on 
response alone, ≥80% power to detect activity based on 6-month 
PFS alone, and ≥97% power if the regimen is active on both 
endpoints. This assumes independence of the two endpoints; slight 
losses of power occur for moderate dependence between the two 
endpoints.  Type I error is controlled at <0.10.
Randomization: The study is not randomized.
Efficacy Analysis: The primary endpoints of objective tumor 
response and 6-month PFS will be tested using an exact binomial 
test. 
Safety Analysis: The frequency of AEs will be tabulated by grade 
across all dose levels and cycles. All patients who receive any study 
treatment will be considered evaluable for toxicity.

1.1 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Metastatic colorectal  cancer remains a major problem worldwide. In the United States, it is 
estimated that there will be approximately 50,000 deaths secondary to colorectal cancer in the 
year 2015(1). The median survival of patients with metastatic disease stands near 30 months in 
recent trials (2, 3). Multiple agents are currently in use, including the cytotoxic drugs: 5-FU, 
oxaliplatin, irinotecan which are typically used in combinations denoted as FOLFOX and 
FOLFIRI. Multiple targeted therapies have also been approved, including the anti-angiogenic 
agents bevacizumab, aflibercept and ramucirumab, as well as the anti-EGFR targeting drugs 
cetuximab and panitumumab. There is no clearly superior strategy for order of administration, 
with progression free survival and response rates grossly similar regardless of the chemotherapy 
back-bone or monoclonal antibody utilized in therapy(3). The largest study to date demonstrated 
equivalent outcomes, including survival whether an initial anti-EGFR strategy or initial anti-
VEGF strategy was utilized(4).
1.2 EGFR  Inhibitors and Colorectal Cancer 
Cetuximab is  an IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR and approved for metastatic 
colorectal cancer. It possesses a high degree of activity as a single agent or in combination with 
chemotherapy, regardless of line of therapy in which it is utilized. Most commonly cetuximab is 
utilized as second or third line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The single 
agent response rate in molecularly selected patients (RAS wt) stands at approximately 20% with 
a median progression free survival of 4 months. This is identical for both cetuximab and the 
humanized monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, panitumumab (5). Increasingly data has shown that 
patients who previously derived benefit from anti-EGFR therapy and then discontinued for 
reasons other than progression, frequently benefit (with up to 30-50% response rates and 4-6 
month median PFS) through re-treatment after a holiday (6, 7). Clinically, the efficacy of anti-
EGFR therapy can be predicted in part based upon the absence of activating KRAS mutations 
(8). More recently, a preponderance of data has emerged to suggest that beyond the initially 
evaluated KRAS exons 2 and 3, additional mutations in KRAS exon 4 or NRAS may also predict 
for lack of benefit from EGFR inhibition(9). 
The side effect profile  of anti-EGFR therapies is well established. The most commonly witnessed 
adverse events in include rash (frequently acneiform), dry skin, diarrhea, and hypomagnesemia. 
Rash is by far the most common side effect, seen in almost 50% of patients, but typically grade I. 
Grade III rash is uncommon, occurring in ≤ 5% of patients(5). The STEPP study established that 
a strategy of pre-emptive skin treatment minimizes the risk of ≥ grade 2 rash to a substantial 
degree. In this study, in the intervention arm, beginning the day prior to therapy, moisturizers 
were applied to the face, feet, hands, neck, back and chest every morning, with topical steroids 
(1% hydrocortisone cream) applied to the same areas at bedtime. Sunscreen (PABA free, SPF ≥ 
15, UVA and UVB) was applied to sun exposed areas prior to going outdoors and doxycycline 
was taken twice daily (10). This treatment was continued for at least 6 weeks, reducing the 
incidence of ≥ grade 2 rash from 62% to 29%.

09/05/19 Page 16 of 90Pre-clinically, the  success of anti-EGFR inhibition has been additionally linked to immune 
mechanisms (11-13). The down-regulation of MHC Class I expression, which is associated with 
reduced antigen processing, is linked to poor survival and loss of inflammatory response in 
colorectal cancer (14). Decreased MHC Class I expression is also associated with EGFR over-
expression and activation of RAS signaling; the EGFR-RAS-MAPK pathway is known to be a 
driving pathway in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. Research for some time has suggested a link 
between effective cancer control through EGFR inhibition and an intact host immune system, 
though clinically this has been more difficult to establish. Interestingly, in preclinical models, 
EGFR inhibitors upregulate MHC Class I and II gene expression (15). Further, in various pre-
clinical models, EGFR inhibitors are capable of inducing a tumoral lymphocytic infiltrate. This 
is seen in colon cancer tumor spheroids, as well as murine models using the 7A7 murine anti-
EGFR antibody. In these same situations, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells abrogates the 
efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy (11). In recently data presented by Dr. Galon's group, the hepatic 
resection specimen of colorectal cancer patients who were treated with anti-EGFR therapy 
demonstrated the most robust CD3+, CD8+ and CD45RO+ lymphocytic infiltrates (as compared 
to chemotherapy alone)(16). In summary, the anti-EGFR anti-tumor effect is mediated in part 
through immune mechanisms and is capable of increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. As 
such, there is reason to think that an anti-EGFR targeting antibody may increase tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes, which might prove synergistic when combined with additional 
therapies which may limit intrinsic tumor immune suppression.
1.3 PD-1  and PD-L1: Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
The importance  of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various 
malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / 
FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in 
many solid tumors.
The PD-1  receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune 
control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related 
to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2). The structure of murine PD-1 has been 
resolved. PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig 
Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 
tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and 
an immune receptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Following T-cell stimulation, PD-1 
recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic 
tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ,  PKCθ and ZAP70 
which are involved in the CD3 T-cell signaling cascade. The mechanism by which PD-1 down 
modulates T-cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules

09/05/19 Page 17 of 90regulate an  overlapping set of signaling proteins. PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and Natural Killer 
cells. Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double 
negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells. The ligands for PD-1 
(PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, 
including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors. Both ligands are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region 
and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD-1 
ligand to PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T-cell receptor. PD-L1 is 
expressed at low levels on various non-hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. PD-L2 is thought to control 
immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-
cell function in peripheral tissues. Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor. PD-1 
has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in subjects with melanoma 
(MEL). This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
1.3.1 PD-1  and PD-1 Blockade in Colorectal Cancer
Immunotherapy has  seen limited success to date in colorectal cancer, including with new drugs 
targeting PD-1. At present, the predictors of checkpoint inhibition efficacy remain incompletely 
understood, though there is some suggestion of a correlation between benefit and a dense tumor 
infiltrating lymphocyte population and/or pronounced PD-L1 expression. In a small subset of 
colorectal cancer patients, those with MSI-H tumors, there is frequently a dense lymphocytic 
infiltrate, presumably secondary to increased mutational rates and the resultant immunogenic 
neo-antigens produced. Early data has suggested efficacy of PD-1 inhibition in this population, 
and ongoing studies are testing this hypothesis (17). However, MSI-H metastatic colorectal 
cancers are distinctly uncommon, comprising approximately 3% of all patients (18). A subset of 
non-MSI-H (MSS) colorectal cancers also display dense lymphocytic infiltrates, though most do 
not; recent TCGA data suggests a marked decrease in the expression of tumor neo-antigens as 
compared to that which would be expected based upon mutation frequency in colorectal 
cancers(19). This is consistent with pronounced depletion of neo-antigens via immunoediting in 
these tumors. Therapies which may increase the expression of tumor neo-antigens may allow for 
PD-1 inhibition to experience success in colorectal cancers
1.4 Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)  is a is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its 
ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory 
signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and 
activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune 
responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on

primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the 
suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved 
in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and 
disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF 
inhibitor.
1.4.1 Preclinical Studies with Pembrolizumab
A detailed  discussion of the preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of 
pembrolizumab can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4.1.1 Mechanism of Action
Binding of  the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T 
cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors 
and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune 
surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor 
and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition 
of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor 
models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.
1.4.1.2 Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab  was studied in 479 patients who received doses of 1 to 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Based on a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis, the mean [% coefficient of variation (CV %)] clearance (CL) is 0.22 L/day (28%) and 
the mean (CV%) elimination half-life (t1/2) is 26 days (24%). Steady-state concentrations of 
pembrolizumab were reached by 18 weeks of repeated dosing with an every 3-week regimen and 
the systemic accumulation was 2.1-fold. The peak concentration (Cmax), trough concentration 
(Cmin), and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state (AUCss) of 
pembrolizumab increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
1.4.2 Clinical  Studies with Pembrolizumab
The efficacy  of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) was investigated in a multicenter, open-label, 
randomized (1:1), dose comparative, activity-estimating cohort of Trial 1(20). Key eligibility 
criteria were unresectable or metastatic melanoma with progression of disease; refractory to two 
or more doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg or higher) and, if BRAF V600 mutation-positive, a BRAF 
or MEK inhibitor; and disease progression within 24 weeks following the last dose of 
ipilimumab. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease; a medical condition that 
required immunosuppression; and a history of severe immune-mediated adverse reactions with 
ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity requiring treatment with corticosteroids or Grade 3 
toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent 
dose) for greater than 12 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive 2 mg/kg (n=89) or 10 
mg/kg (n=84) of (MK-3475) every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression 
that was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a

of tumor status was performed every 12 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were 
confirmed overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded 
independent central review and duration of response.
Among the  173 patients enrolled, the median age was 61 years (36% age 65 or older); 60% male; 
97% White; and 66% and 34% with an ECOG performance status 0 and 1, respectively. Disease 
characteristics were BRAF V600 mutation (17%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (39%), M1c 
(82%), brain metastases (9%), and two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease 
(73%).
The ORR  was 24% (95% confidence interval: 15, 34) in the 2 mg/kg arm, consisting of 1 
complete response and 20 partial responses. Among the 21 patients with an objective response, 3 
(14%) had progression of disease 2.8, 2.9, and 8.2 months after initial response. The remaining 
18 patients (86%) had ongoing responses with durations ranging from 1.4+ to 8.5+ months, 
which included 8 patients with ongoing responses of 6 months or longer. One additional patient 
developed two new asymptomatic lesions at the first tumor assessment concurrent with a 75% 
decrease in overall tumor burden; (MK-3475) was continued and this reduction in tumor burden 
was durable for 5+ months.
There were  objective responses in patients with and without BRAF V600 mutation-positive 
melanoma. Similar ORR results were observed in the 10 mg/kg arm.
1.5 Risks  and/or Benefits
The most common adverse  effects of cetuximab include rash, hypomagnesemia, infusion 
reactions and diarrhea. Grade III/IV dermatologic reactions occur in up to 5% of patients with 
infusion reactions in up to 4.5%.
Pembrolizumab has  been well tolerated thus far, with the most common adverse effects (reported 
in ≥ 20% of patients) being fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite, 
constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.
Currently, there is  no published data on the combination of EGFR antibodies and anti PD-1 
therapy for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. At least two studies have combined anti-
EGFR TKIs and anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and erlotinib 
(EGFR TKI) have been combined in chemotherapy-naive advanced NSCLC (21). In the 21 
patients reported to date, this was well tolerated. While there was a 71% incidence of rash, there 
was no grade 3/4 rash. A 10% incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea as well as grade 3/4 transaminitis 
was observed. Though all but 1 patient had previous erlotinib resistance, 15% of patients were 
seen to have responses with a 24 week PFS of 51%. Similarly, safety and tolerability data have 
recently been reported on a phase I study of MEDI-4736 (anti-PD-L1)  and gefitinib (EGFR 
TKI)(22) . Generally, the treatment was well tolerated. Unexpected AEs did not emerge. There 
was an increase in grade 3 transaminitis, though only 2/15 (15%) of patients in the expansion 
cohort ultimately discontinued therapy due to AEs. Thus, there is reason to believe anti-EGFR 
inhibition can be safely combined with PD-1 inhibition and may have clinical efficacy in 
advanced cancer.

Anti-EGFR therapy has the  potential to increase a localized anti-tumor immune response and 
increase the expression of antigen presenting MHC molecules. Recently, in a syngeneic mouse 
model utilizing the CT-26 colon cancer cell line, combined MEK and PD-1 inhibition was shown 
to be of benefit, where PD-1 provided little benefit on its own (23). Thus, therapeutic strategies 
which jointly target the EGFR-RAS-MAPK pathway as well as block critical immune 
checkpoints may be of benefit for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. With this in mind, 
we propose a phase II study of cetuximab and pembrolizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer
2.1 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification
PK data  analysis of MK-3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB). Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 
release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days). This early PK 
and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing 
schedule.
A population  pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters 
of MK-3475 were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship between clearance 
and body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for other 
antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all 
body weights. MK-3475 has been found to have a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma 
indication. The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg 
Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure 
margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based 
on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose 
regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation 
revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure 
was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated 
changes in exposure between different indication settings.
The rationale for further  exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 
mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response relationships of 
pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg 
Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of 
pembrolizumab (as assessed by the population PK model) and 4) the assumption that the 
dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.
The choice  of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed 
dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in 
the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3)

4.1.1 Phase  Ib\II
There will  be an initial phase Ib cohort to examine the safety and tolerability of the combination. 
Study progress will be monitored regularly by the RPCI Phase I Committee. After up to 9 
patients are enrolled, and a minimum of 6 have completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy, 
the study will be suspended, and the safety/tolerability of the combination will be examined. At 
that time, the study team will decide what action to take, e.g., continue the study as is, make 
changes to the study with regard to treatment or dose modifications, or discontinue the study. 
Once analysis is complete and a safe treatment plan has been established, the phase II study will 
commence.
The Phase  II study will enroll patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are eligible for anti-
EGFR therapy (i.e. RAS wt, no known expanded KRAS or NRAS mutations, anti-EGFR therapy 
naïve or appropriate for anti-EGFR rechallenge). For the purposes of the study, a cycle will be 
defined as three weeks. Patients will be treated with cetuximab, administered weekly and 
pembrolizumab, administrated every 3 weeks as described in Section 6. A regimen of pre-
emptive skin care is recommended, as described in Section 6.4. Disease assessments will occur 
every 9 weeks to assess response, using RECIST v 1.1. As described in Section 6.1, after initial 
progressive disease, if fulfilling certain criteria, patients may continue on therapy with further 
response assessments in line with irRECIST criteria (Appendix D). Per  local policy, a consent 
addendum should be obtained to continue on treatment past progression. Progression free 
survival and objective response rate will be observed. Additional blood based biomarker tests 
will be performed prior to treatment, at 4 weeks (cycle 2, day 1) and 10 weeks (cycle 4, day 1). A 
mandatory biopsy will be performed prior to treatment; a secondary biopsy at approximately 10 
weeks (cycle 4, day 1) will be optional, but strongly encouraged. However, in order to obtain 
sufficient samples for informative analysis, for the final 10 patients of the study, both biopsies 
will be mandatory.

09/05/19 Page 26 of 906 TREATMENT  PLAN
6.1 Dosing  and Administration
The treatment regimen to be used in this trial  is outlined below:
Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 loading dose on day 1 cycle 1, followed by 250 mg/m2 intravenously 
weekly. Pembrolizumab 200 mg fixed dose intravenously every 3 weeks.  
Reported adverse  events (AEs) and potential risks are described in Section 1.5. Appropriate dose 
modifications are described in Section 6.1
A cycle  is defined as 3 weeks of treatment, with cetuximab administered weekly and 
pembrolizumab administered every 3 weeks, on day 1 of each cycle. Absent relevant limiting 
toxicities, pembrolizumab may be administered even if cetuximab is to be held on day 1 for 
cetuximab related AEs. Likewise, in the instance of pembrolizumab related AEs which require 
dose holding or discontinuation, cetuximab administration should continue as appropriate. 
Cetuximab will be administered prior to pembrolizumab on day 1, due to concern for infusion 
reactions. Pembrolizumab may be administered on Day 2 of any cycle in the event of a 
Cetuximab related infusion reaction; or any other adverse event at the discretion of the PI.
If cetuximab  is held for greater than 2 weeks for reasons other than cetuximab related adverse 
events, the 400 mg/m2 loading dose may be readministered upon resumption, at the discretion of 
the investigator.
6.1.1 Pembrolizumab
Dose Selection
Pembrolizumab 200  mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. 
Sites should make every effort to target  infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes  as 
possible. However, given the variability of infusion  pumps  from  site to site, a window  of 
5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).
The package insert  contains specific  instructions for  the preparation of the 
pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.
Timing of Dose Administration
Trial treatment  will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments 
have been completed (as detailed in Table 4  Schedule of Procedures and Observations). Of note, 
the results of laboratory tests which are send-out tests (including TFTs) are not necessary prior to 
treatment. Pembrolizumab is to be administered after cetuximab infusion is complete. Trial 
treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle 
due to administrative reasons.
All trial  treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.

1 For grade 2 diarrhea which is attributed to cetuximab and sub-optimally managed with anti-diarrheal agents, Pembrolizumab may 
be continued. Patients should be seen in clinical follow-up within 1 week with additional phone follow-up within 72 hours. If 
optimally managed with anti-diarrheal agents and it is not felt that the toxicity is clearly cetuximab related, Pembrolizumab should 
be held until toxicity resolves to Grade ≤  1.
2 For patients with liver metastasis who begin treatment with Grade  2 AST  or ALT, if AST or ALT increases by greater than or 
equal to 50% relative  to baseline  and lasts for at least  1 week then patients should be  discontinued.
3 Patients with intolerable  or persistent  Grade  2 drug-related AE  may hold study medication at physician discretion. Permanently 
discontinue  study drug for persistent Grade  2 adverse  reactions for which treatment with study drug has been held, that do not  
recover to Grade  0-1 within 12 weeks of the  last dose.
4 For these purposes, a severe toxicity is a toxicity which does not otherwise meet the criteria for grade 3 or 4, but which the 
investigator deems as being substantial enough to merit the holding of therapy. 
5 For an acneiform or maculopapular rash which is deemed to be clearly related to cetuximab, at the investigator’s discretion, 
pembrolizumab may be administered even for grade 3 rash, as long as the rash is showing signs of improvement and cetuximab is 
held as per protocol.
Dosing interruptions are  permitted in the case of medical  / surgical events or logistical  
reasons not related to study therapy  (e.g., elective  surgery, unrelated medical events, patient  
vacation, and/or holidays). Participants should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks 
of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise  discussed with  the Sponsor. The  reason for 
interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.

19. Additionally  refer to 6.3.2. Patients who are receiving additional supportive care measures require close 
follow-up, minimally within 72 hours by phone and 7 days in clinic.
6.2 General Concomitant Medications
Medications or  vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion  criteria  are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there  is a clinical  indication for one of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from  trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this 
with the Sponsor/ Merck Clinical  team. The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the participant's primary physician.
Participants may be pretreated for nausea and vomiting with appropriate anti-emetics.

6.2.2 Prohibited  Concomitant Medications
Participants are prohibited from  receiving the  following therapies during the Screening and 
Treatment  Phase  (including retreatment  for post-complete response  relapse) of this trial:
Antineoplastic  systemic chemotherapy  or biological therapy
Immunotherapy  not specified in this protocol
Chemotherapy  not specified in this protocol
Investigational  agents other than pembrolizumab
Radiation therapy
oNote:  Radiation therapy to  a symptomatic  solitary  lesion or to the brain may be 
allowed at  the investigator’s discretion.
Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
shingles.
Systemic  glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology (and as described for grade 3 
cetuximab AEs). The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after 
consultation with the Sponsor. NOTE: Brief courses of steroids to prevent allergic 
reactions (IV contrast dye) or for similar purposes are permitted, but should first be 
reviewed with the sponsor. 
Subjects who,  in the assessment  by the investigator, require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical  management should be removed from  the trial. Subjects 
may receive  other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.
The Exclusion  Criteria  (Section 5.2) describe  other medications which are  prohibited in  this trial.
6.3 Supportive  Care Guidelines for Pembrolizumab
Participants should  receive  appropriate  supportive care measures as deemed necessary  by the 
treating investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management  of adverse  
events with potential immunologic  etiology are outlined below and in greater detail  in the

Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.: I 274515
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
09/05/19 Page 32 of 90ECI Guidance  Document.  Where  appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or 
intravenous corticosteroids as well as additional  anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not 
improve  with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several  courses of steroid tapering 
may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each 
disorder, attempts should be made  to rule out other  causes such as metastatic  disease  or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might  require  additional supportive care. The treatment  
guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related 
to pembrolizumab.
Note: If  after the evaluation the event  is determined not to be related to the study drug, the 
investigator is instructed to follow  the ECI reporting guidance  but does not need to follow 
the treatment  guidance  (as outlined in the ECI Guidance  Document). Refer to Section 6.1.1for 
dose modification.
It may be  necessary to perform  conditional  procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography  as part of evaluation  of the event. Suggested conditional  procedures, as 
appropriate, can be  found in the ECI Guidance Document.
Note: All  adverse events, regardless of grade, that are considered Events of Clinical Interest 
should be reported regardless of etiology.
6.3.1 Pneumonitis
For  Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.
For  Grade 3-4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids. Administer additional 
anti-inflammatory measures, as needed.
Add  prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid 
administration.
6.3.2 Diarrhea/Colitis
Participants should  be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). Diarrhea from Pembrolizumab most commonly 
presents at 6 weeks or later during therapy. If cetuximab is suspected as the etiology, particularly 
if early onset within the first 6 weeks, anti-motility agents and close f/u along with appropriate 
cetuximab management should be instituted.
All  participants who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. Anti-motility agents (e.g. loperamide, 
diphenoxylate/atropine) may be utilized initially.
For  Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, first initiate above supportive measures and initiate or 
intensify anti-motility agents. Close clinical f/u is necessary (i.e. follow-up via phone 
within 72 hours and in clinic within 7 days). If cetuximab is held and symptoms are still 
not improving promptly, or there is suspicion for Pembrolizumab toxicity, consider GI

related colitis is high and/or endoscopy cannot be performed promptly, administer oral 
corticosteroids. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/ colitis that persist for > 1 week, treat with 
intravenous steroids followed by high dose oral steroids.
When  symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.
6.3.3 Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus or ≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia
Type  1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM), if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
 Grade 3 or higher hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic 
acidosis (DKA)
For  T1DM or Grade 3-4 Hyperglycemia
Insulin  replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus 
and for Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or 
ketonuria. 
Evaluate  patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated 
hemoglobin, and C-peptide.
6.3.4 Hypophysitis
For  Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.
For  Grade 3-4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by oral 
corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones 
may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.
6.3.5 Hyperthyroidism  or Hypothyroidism
Thyroid disorders  can occur at any time during treatment: Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based 
on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.
Grade  2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4 hypothyroidism):
In  hyperthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are suggested as initial 
therapy.
In  hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or 
liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.
Grade  3-4 hyperthyroidism:
Treat  with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by oral corticosteroids. When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over

For  Grade 3-4  events, treat with intravenous glucocorticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.
When symptoms improve to  Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.
In addition , the event must be reported as a Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) ECI, if the patient 
meets the laboratory criteria for potential DILI defined as:
An  elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) lab value that is 
greater than or equal to three times (3X) the upper limit of normal (ULN) and
An  elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to two times (2X) ULN 
and at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lab value that is less than 2X ULN,
As  a result of within-protocol-specific testing or unscheduled testing.
6.3.8 Neurologic
For  Grade 2 events, consider treatment with corticosteroids, as appropriate.
For  Grade 3-4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. If condition worsens, consider 
IVIG or other immunosuppressive therapies, as per local guidelines.
When symptoms improve to  Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.
6.3.9 Ocular
For  Grade 2 events, treat with topical steroids, such as 1% prednisolone acetate 
suspension and iridocyclitics.
For  Grade 3-4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to

containing creams, in combination with oral anti-pruritics.
For  Grade 3-4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.
***Both pembrolizumab and  cetuximab can cause a significant incidence of grade 2 / 3 rash. For 
a ≥ grade 3 maculopapular rash (grading predominantly determined by degree of BSA 
involvement), which is strongly felt to be related to cetuximab and which is tolerable to the 
patient, additional supportive measures may be instituted with weekly clinical follow-up, without 
the initial addition of systemic corticosteroids. Pembrolizumab must be held, however, as noted 
above. This course of action should be discussed with the PI.
NOTE: Refer  to the ECI Guidance Document (Section 3.9.1: Immediate Evaluation for Potential 
Skin ECIs) for detailed evaluation and reporting requirements.
6.3.12 Other  ECIs
The following  AEs, regardless of grade, are considered ECIs and should be reported to the 
Sponsor (see Section 10.4.1)
Myocarditis
Pericarditis
Pancreatitis
Any additional Grade 3 or higher event which the investigator considers to be immune-
related.
oFor  Grade 2 events, or Grade 1 events that do not improve with symptomatic 
treatment: Systemic corticosteroids may be indicated.
oFor  Grade 3-4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over no 
less than 4 weeks.
6.3.13 Infusion  Reactions
Signs and  symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve 
completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. Table 3  shows treatment guidelines for 
participants who experience an infusion reaction associated with administration of

09/05/19 Page 37 of 906.3.14 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations
Diet
Participants should maintain a  normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
Contraception
Pembrolizumab may  have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm. Non-pregnant, non-
breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are 
considered highly unlikely to conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically 
sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for 
greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the 
duration of the study. The two birth control methods can be: two barrier methods or, a barrier 
method plus a hormonal method, to prevent pregnancy. Participants should start using birth 
control from study Visit 1 (prescreening visit) throughout the study period up to 120 days after 
the last dose of pembrolizumab and 180 days after the last dose of cetuximab.
The following  are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by 
the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents).
Participants should  be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in the 
study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the 
study and during the follow-up period defined in Section 8. If there is any question that a 
participant will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that participant 
should not be entered into the study.
Use in Pregnancy
If a participant  inadvertently  becomes pregnant  while on treatment  with pembrolizumab, the 
subject  will immediately be removed from  the study. The site will contact  the subject  at least 
monthly and document  the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to Merck 
without delay and within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck if the 
outcome is a serious adverse experience  (e.g., death, abortion, congenital  anomaly, or other 
disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn). Refer to Section 10.4.1
The study  investigator will make  every effort  to obtain permission to follow the outcome of 
the pregnancy and report  the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. If a male 
subject  impregnates his female  partner the study personnel  at the site must be informed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to Merck and followed as 
described above and in Section 10.4.1.

09/05/19 Page 38 of 90Use in Nursing Women
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab  is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because  of the potential for serious adverse  reactions in the 
nursing infant, subjects who are  breast-feeding are not eligible for enrollment.
6.4 Supportive  Care Guidelines for Cetuximab
6.4.1 Dermatologic  Management and AEs
A regimen  of pre-emptive skin care is recommended for all patients on the study, as this has been 
demonstrated to decrease incidence of dermatologic AEs. They should be advised to continue 
this plan of care for the initial six weeks, with further continuation at the discretion of the 
investigator. The following components are to be included:
Twice daily moisturizers – thick, alcohol free emollients of the patients’ choice
Low potency topical corticosteroid twice  daily to face, neck, back, chest – e.g. 
hydrocortisone 2.5%
Prophylactic  oral antibiotics – e.g. doxycycline 100 mg po bid, minocycline 100 mg daily 
or acceptable alternative such as cephalexin 500 mg po bid, cefadroxil 500 mg po bid, or 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg po bid.
Broad  spectrum sunscreen (UVA/UVB) with SPF ≥ 15 applied  to sun-exposed areas 
regularly
Additional recommendations for skin care include:
Limit  excessive sun exposure
Avoiding  lotions, detergents with perfumes
Reduce  the frequency and duration of hot showers, and consider using lukewarm water
For grade  1 rash, reinforce skin care measures and consider adding topical antibiotics to skin 
care: Clindamycin 1% gel, Erythromycin 3% gel or cream, metronidazole 1% cream or 
equivalent products are recommended.
For grade  2 rash, consider  the addition of a medium to high potency topical corticosteroid to 
chest/back/extremities: e.g. Fluocinonide 0.05%, hydrocortisone valerate 0.2%.
For grade  3 rash, hold cetuximab. If intolerable, consider a short course of oral corticosteroids, 
prednisone 0.5 mg/kg, to a maximum of 40 mg daily x 7 days.
6.4.2 Hypomagnesemia
Anti-EGFR therapies  such as cetuximab have an established link to hypomagnesemia. 
Magnesium levels are to be monitored and levels replaced on therapy and up to 8 weeks after 
completion of therapy, as per practice standard.

09/05/19 Page 39 of 906.5 Duration  of Treatment
Participants may  remain on study and continue to receive treatment in the absence of disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity and withdrawal from study, intercurrent illness that prevents 
further administration of treatment, participant demonstrates an inability/refusal to comply with 
oral medication regime or, participant withdraws from study.
If radiologic imaging by  the site identifies PD by RECIST 1.1, subject management and tumor 
assessment will shift to irRECIST. Consent addendum should be obtained to continue on 
treatment past progression.  Imaging should be repeated ≤ 6 weeks later in order to confirm PD 
with the option of continuing treatment per below while awaiting radiologic confirmation of 
progression.
If repeat  imaging shows < 20% tumor burden compared to nadir, stable or improved previous 
new lesion (if identified as cause for initial PD), and stable/improved non-target disease (if 
identified as cause for initial PD), PD is not confirmed. Treatment may continue and 
subsequently follow regular imaging schedule. 
If repeat  imaging confirms PD (irPD) due to any of the scenarios listed below, subjects will be 
discontinued from study therapy (exception noted in Section 6.6).
In determining  whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, site study team 
should consider all target lesions as well as non-target lesions.
Scenarios where PD is confirmed at repeat imaging:
Tumor  burden remains ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir
Non-target disease resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative)
New  lesion resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative)
Additional  new lesion(s) since last evaluation
Additional  new non-target progression since last evaluation
In subjects  who have initial evidence of radiological PD by the site, it is at the discretion of the 
PI whether to continue a subject on study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained (irRECIST 
subject management). This clinical judgment decision should be based on the subject’s overall 
clinical condition, including performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory data. Subjects 
may receive study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if they are clinically stable as 
defined by the following criteria:
Absence  of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant progression of disease, 
including worsening of laboratory values
No  decline in ECOG performance status
Absence  of rapid progression of disease
Absence  of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
09/05/19 Page 40 of 90When feasible,  subjects should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed. This 
allowance to continue treatment despite initial radiologic progression takes into account the 
observation that some subjects can have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the 
start of immunotherapy, but with subsequent disease response. Subjects that are deemed 
clinically unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation of PD.
6.6 Treatment  Discontinuation
Upon treatment  discontinuation all end of treatment evaluations and tests will be conducted. All 
participants who discontinue due to an AE must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. 
Appropriate medical care should be provided until signs and symptoms have abated, stabilized, 
or until abnormal laboratory findings have returned to acceptable or pre-study limits. The final 
status of the AE will be reported in the participant’s medical records and the appropriate eCRF.
Reasons for treatment discontinuation should be classified as follows:
Death
Progressive disease
Toxicity;  treatment related or unrelated
Investigator  judgment
The  Investigator may discontinue a participant if, in his/her judgment, it is in the best 
interest of the participant to do so.
Noncompliance
Participant  voluntary withdrawal
A  participant may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. If a participant 
discontinues treatment, an attempt should be made to obtain information regarding the 
reason for withdrawal.
Sponsor  decision.
Intercurrent  illness that prevents further administration of treatment.
The  participant has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test.
The  participant is lost to follow-up.
Confirmed radiographic disease progression.
oNote : For unconfirmed radiographic disease progression, please see Section 6.5.
oNote : A participant may be granted an exception  to continue  on treatment 
with confirmed  radiographic progression if clinically stable  or clinically 
improved, please see Section 6.5. Consent addendum should be obtained to 
continue on treatment past progression.

35 administrations of study medication, whichever is later.
oNote : 24 months  of study  medication is calculated from  the date of first dose. 
Subjects who stop pembrolizumab  after  24 months  may  be eligible for up to 
one year of additional study treatment  if they progress  after stopping study 
treatment provided they meet the requirements detailed in Section 8.10.
The End  of Treatment and Follow-up visit procedures are listed in Section 8. After the end of 
treatment, each participant will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious 
adverse events will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment as described in 
Section 10.2). Participants who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have 
post-treatment follow-up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non-study 
cancer treatment, withdrawing consent or becoming lost to follow-up. After documented disease 
progression each participant will be followed by telephone for overall survival until death, 
withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.
6.6.1 Discontinuation  of Study Therapy after CR
Discontinuation of  treatment may be considered for participants who have attained a confirmed 
CR that have been treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab and had at least two 
treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared. Participants 
who then experience radiographic disease progression may be eligible for up to one year of 
additional treatment with pembrolizumab via the Second Course Phase at the discretion of the 
investigator if no cancer treatment was administered since the last dose of pembrolizumab, the 
participant meets the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is 
open. Participants will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule at the time of initial 
discontinuation.

Four 10 mL green-top heparinized tubes of blood will be collected pre-dose via venipuncture for 
biomarker analysis at multiple time points. These will be collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2 and 
4. All tubes will be sent to the Hematologic Procurement Laboratory, one tube (for flow 
cytometry) will be forwarded at ambient temperature to Dr. Minderman’s Laboratory in the 
Department of Flow and Image Cytometry at RPCI. Plasma and PBMCs will be separated within 
2 hours following extraction. These samples will be stored and analyzed by Dr. Minderman’s 
Laboratory.
The other three tubes will be processed in the Hematologic Procurement Laboratory. Plasma 
samples are to be processed at 4°C using a refrigerated centrifuge at approximately 3000 rpm for 
about 10 minutes with the plasma being aliquoted into 2 cryovials per time-point.  The samples 
will immediately be frozen at - 70ºC or below until analyzed.  PBMC’s will then be obtained by 
ficoll gradient as per the lab’s standard procedure.  Two of the tubes will be pooled and the 
PBMC’s will be frozen in Gibco Cell culture freezing media and will be stored in LN2 until time 
of analysis.  The remaining tube of PBMC’s will be frozen in RNA later and will be stored in -70 
degrees or below until analyzed.    The screw cap polypropylene cryogenic tubes will be labeled 
with the clinical study number, participant’s MR number, participant’s study number, protocol 
time point, protocol day, date and time of draw. Samples will be analyzed in RPCI’s Department 
of Flow and Image Cytometry:

8.13 Pathology
Fresh tumor  biopsies will be obtained on study, one within 30 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
one within 7 days of Cycle 4 Day 1; biopsy prior to C4D1 is preferred, but may be after C4D1, if 
necessary. Biopsies can be obtained from any tumor site, though a metastatic site is preferred, 
e.g. via US guided liver biopsy. Four tumor cores, preferably 16-18 gauge and 1 cm long, will be 
obtained at each time point, with one core being formalin fixed and paraffin-embedded for later 
IHC staining, and the remainder kept fresh at 4°C for further processing in Dr. Minderman’s 
laboratory.
8.13.1 Archived Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) Biopsy Samples
Note: Participants  for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or 
subject safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the 
Principal Investigator). This does not apply for the last 10 patients enrolled on the study, where a 
fresh biopsy will be mandatory.
The following  sections of tissue from the most recent neoplastic tissue that exists in the Paraffin 
Archive in the Department of Pathology (or outside institution) will be collected:
1. Ten  unstained sections cut at 4 microns on plus glass slides.
2. One  H&E stained section

9 EFFICACY  EVALUATIONS
9.1 Objective  Tumor Response
All protocol-defined imaging  studies must be performed at the investigative site or sponsor-
approved facility using protocol-defined parameters. The same method of assessment and the 
same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and 
during follow-up. Primary objective tumor response will be assessed according to irRECIST 
(Appendix D).
9.2 Target  Lesions
All measurable  lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, will be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions will be selected on the basis of their size. Lesions with the 
longest diameter (short axis for lymph nodes) and are ≥ 10 mm (CT and MRI), ≥ 15 mm lymph 
nodes, > 20 mm CXR and are for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinically) will be chosen. A sum of the longest diameter (short axis for lymph 
nodes) of all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. This 
will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable 
dimension of the disease.
Complete  Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any lymph nodes must 
have a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by repeat studies performed no less than 6 weeks after the criteria for response 
are first met.

10/21/2019
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 274515
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
09/05/19 Page 58 of 90Partial  Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by repeat studies performed no less than 6 weeks after the criteria for 
response are first met.
Progressive  Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as references the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression.
Stable  Disease (SD):  Neither a sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter while on study. 
Participants having a documented response with no confirmation of the response will be 
listed with stable disease.
9.3 Non-Target Lesions
All other  small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or lymph nodes ≥ 10 mm to < 15 mm short 
axis) and non-measurable lesions (i.e., leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, blastic bone 
lesions, or abdominal masses / abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not 
measurable by imaging) should be identified as non-target lesions and indicated as present in the 
source documents at baseline. The general location will also be documented on the images 
drawing a regularly-shaped Region of Interest. Measurements of the non-target lesions will not 
be performed, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up and 
evaluation.
Complete  Response: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level, if applicable. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm 
short axis).
Non-Complete  Response/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of 1 or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the upper limits of normal.
Progressive  Disease: Appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of non-target 
lesions is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should 
prevail and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time.
9.4 Evaluation of Response
Time point  response assessments will be performed every 9 weeks. To determine time point 
response, refer to Table 6 and Table 7 below.

Any Yes PD
1 Non-CR/non-PD  is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is used as endpoint for assessment of 
efficacy in trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
The best  overall response is the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence or study discontinuation, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmation. In general, the participant’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria and will be determined by 
combining the participant’s status of target lesions, non-target lesions, and new lesions.
Symptomatic  Deterioration: Participants with global deterioration of health status 
requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression 
at that time, and not related to study treatment or other medical conditions should be 
reported as progressive disease due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should 
be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to 
symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration that may lead to discontinuation of 
treatment include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as:
oWeight  loss > 10% of body weight.
oWorsening  of disease-related symptoms (e.g., worsening dyspnea, increasing 
pain/increasing requirement for narcotic analgesics).
oDecline  in performance status of > 1 level on ECOG scale.

A confirmatory assessment is required no less than 6 weeks after a PR or CR is deemed.
9.6 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements  should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same  method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.
Clinical  Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.
Chest  x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.
Conventional  CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body 
scans).
Use of  MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI 
is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. 
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the 
image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.

09/05/19 Page 61 of 90Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure 
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
Tumor  Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be 
considered in complete clinical response.
Cytology,  Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological  confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.
FDG-PET:  While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis 
of FDG PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:
Negative  FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.
No  FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the 
positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-
PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
FDG-PET  may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by disease-specific medical literature for the indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.

10 SAFETY  EVALUATION
10.1 Adverse Events
10.1.1 Definition
An adverse event  or adverse experience (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can 
be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, 
‘unlikely’, ‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’).
An AE  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
in other study-related documents.
10.1.1.1 Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known,  a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it 
should be reported as follow-up information.
10.1.1.2 Adverse  Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general,  AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have 
resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.
However, clinically  significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on 
the CRF.
10.1.1.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Only clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.).
APPROVED RPCI IRB
10/21/2019
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 274515
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
09/05/19 Page 63 of 90If the  clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with 
cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event 
CRF.
If the  clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or 
SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7 mEq/L should be recorded as 
“hyperkalemia.”
Observations of the same  clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or 
etiology changes.
10.1.1.4 Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Conditions)
A preexisting  medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on 
an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has 
changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
10.1.1.5 Overdose
Refer to Section 7.3.2 for a definition of pembrolizumab overdose.
If an adverse  event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of 
pembrolizumab, the adverse  event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if 
no other  seriousness criteria  are met.
If a dose of pembrolizumab meeting the  protocol definition of overdose  is taken without 
any associated clinical  symptoms or abnormal  laboratory  results, the overdose  is 
reported as a non-serious Event  of Clinical  Interest  (ECI), using the terminology  
“accidental  or intentional  overdose  without adverse effect.”
10.1.2 Grading and Relationship to Drug
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Version 4 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. CTEP
Version 4 of the CTCAE is identified and located at:
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.
AEs not  covered by specific terminology listed should be reported with common medical 
terminology, and documented according to the grading scales provided in the CTCAE Version 4.
The relationship of event to study drug will be documented by the Investigator as follows:
Unrelated:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the participant.

likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.
Possible:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by other factors such as the participant’s 
clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
Probable:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot 
be reasonably explained by other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
Definite:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably 
explained by other factors such as the participant’s condition, therapeutic interventions or 
concomitant drugs; AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, 
improves upon stopping the drug, or reappears on re-exposure.

10.2.1 Definition
A serious adverse  event (SAE) is any adverse event (experience) that in the opinion of either the 
investigator or sponsor results in ANY of the following:
Death.
A  life-threatening adverse event (experience). Any AE that places a participant or 
participants, in the view of the Investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from 
the reaction as it occurred. It does NOT include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.
Inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (for > 24 hours).
A  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
A  congenital anomaly or birth defect.
Important  Medical Event (IME) that, based upon medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.
Is  associated with an overdose
Is  a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)
10.2.2 Reporting  Serious Adverse Events
For the  time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment 
allocation/randomization, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, 
including death due to any cause that occurs to any participant must be reported within 24 hours 
to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety if it causes the participant to 
be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.
For the  time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through 90 days following 
cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the participant initiates new 
anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious 
adverse event, including death due to any cause whether or not related to the Merck product, 
must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global 
Safety.
SAEs identified  as an Unanticipated Problem by the Investigator must be reported. Please refer 
to Section 10.7.2 for details on reporting Unanticipated Problems.
Additionally, any serious  adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician to be related to the investigational drug, that is brought to the attention of the

must be reported immediately  to the Sponsor and to Merck.
10.3 Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs)
Refer to the  separate guidance document entitled “Event of Clinical Interest Guidance 
Document” for detailed instruction regarding identification, evaluation and management of ECIs 
and irAEs.
Participants should  be assessed for possible ECIs prior to each dose. Lab results should be 
evaluated and participants should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of an immune-
related event. If lab results or symptoms indicate a possible immune-related ECI, then additional 
testing should be performed to rule out other etiologic causes. If no other cause is found, then it 
is assumed to be immune-related.
Any Grade  3 or higher event that the investigator  considers to be immune-related should be 
reported as an ECI regardless of whether the specific event  term is in Table 10  and reported  
to Merck within 24 hours from the time the Investigator/physician is aware of such an 
occurrence.  Adverse  events that are both an SAE and an ECI should be reported one time as 
an SAE only, however the event  must  be appropriately identified as an ECI as well in in the 
database.

12 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
This is  a single-arm phase Ib\II study of pembrolizumab and cetuximab in patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer.
The primary objectives of this study are:
To  estimate the objective response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab
To  estimate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab
To  examine the adverse event profile of combining pembrolizumab and cetuximab
The secondary (exploratory) objectives of this study are:
To  examine the PFS of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with 
pembrolizumab and cetuximab
To  examine the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with 
pembrolizumab and cetuximab
To  determine estimate the objective response rate by immune-related response criteria 
(irRECIST) of patients with metastatic colorectal
To  explore peripheral blood and tumor biomarkers of response and/or resistance to the 
study treatment

09/05/19 Page 72 of 9012.1 Sample  Size Determination
We utilize  two primary efficacy endpoints for this study: the proportion of patients achieving 
complete or partial RECIST objective response rate and the proportion surviving progression-
free for at least six months. While the addition of pembrolizumab to cetuximab may have 
cytotoxic effect, it may act primarily in a cytostatic fashion; therefore, it is important to consider 
both endpoints, and thus declare the agent worthy of further investigation if it shows activity on 
either endpoint. We utilize a single-stage version of the bivariate design of Sill, et al (24) (2012). 
Based on historical data, the response rate for cetuximab alone in this patient population is 
approximately 20%, and the proportion of patients surviving progression-free for at least six 
months is approximately 30% (5). We set the following null and alternative hypotheses 
indicating inactivity or activity for the two endpoints.
Endpoint H0
(regimen
 inactive)H1
(regimen
 active)
Objective tumor response 20% 40%
6-Month PFS 30% 50%
We will  target 42 eligible and treated patients, but will require at least 38 eligible and treated 
patients in order to have ≥80% power to detect activity based on response alone, ≥80% power to 
detect activity based on 6-month PFS alone, and ≥97% power if the regimen is active on both 
endpoints. This assumes independence of the two endpoints; slight losses of power occur for 
moderate dependence between the two endpoints. Type I error is controlled at <0.10.  An exact 
binomial test will be used to compare the observed response and 6-month PFS percentages 
versus the null values in the table above.  Only patients who are not treated with study therapy 
will be replaced.
12.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Descriptive statistics  (as appropriate: n, percent, mean, median, min and max) will be used to 
summarize demographic and baseline characteristics.
12.3 Efficacy  Analysis
Objective tumor  response and six-month PFS will be tabulated and will be compared to the null 
values using exact tests. All treated patients with study therapy will be considered evaluable for 
response and 6-month PFS.  Patients who receive at least one full dose of both drugs and come

09/05/19 Page 73 of 90Objective tumor response using immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) will be tabulated.
Analysis of  secondary endpoints will be hypothesis generating and descriptive in nature. 
Distributions of PFS and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
12.4 Safety  Analysis
12.4.1 Adverse  Event
The frequency  of toxicities will be tabulated by maximum grade by preferred term within a 
patient across all cycles. All participants who receive any study treatment will be considered 
evaluable for toxicity.
12.5 Phase  Ib Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination of the Study
There will  be an initial Phase Ib cohort to examine the safety and tolerability of the combination.  
After up to nine patients are enrolled, and at least 6 have completed at least two cycles of 
chemotherapy, the study will be suspended, and the safety/tolerability of the combination will be 
examined. If ≥2 patients out of 6 (or ≥2/7, ≥2/8, or ≥3/9) patients have DLTs, the study will be 
modified or stopped after review of all safety data.  The Roswell Phase I Committee, Study PI, 
and study statistician will all be involved in the discussion. At that time, the study team will 
decide what action to take, e.g., continue the study as is, make changes to the study with regard 
to treatment or dose modifications, or discontinue the study. Should the study team elect to 
continue the study with additional modifications, the revised protocol must be submitted to the 
FDA for further review prior to implementation in the clinical study.
The dose  limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any ≥ grade 3 clinically significant toxicity, 
which is deemed possibly treatment related and occurs within the first 6 weeks of therapy. This 
will be exclusive of rash, fatigue and hypomagnesemia, but inclusive of grade 4 rash or 
hypomagnesemia which does not revert to grade ≤ 2 within 24 hours.
Following the  phase Ib cohort, no interim analyses for efficacy are planned for this study.  The 
study adds an agent (pembrolizumab) to a standard of care agent (cetuximab), so we expect 
efficacy to be at least as good as standard of care.
13 CORRELATIVE  DATA ANALYSIS
Biomarker Analyses : Pre- and post-treatment levels and changes from pre- to post-treatment in 
biomarkers will be summarized overall and by response and 6-month PFS categories using 
summary statistics (e.g., mean or median, with dispersion measures, and using transformed 
values as appropriate). Depending on the number of responses, logistic regression models may 
be used to compare response rates across pre-treatment biomarker levels.  Proportional hazards 
models may be used to examine progression-free survival and overall survival across biomarker 
levels.

14.1 Ethical  Principles
This study  will not be initiated until the protocol and informed consent document(s) have been 
reviewed and approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). Each participant (or legal guardian) shall read, understand, 
and sign an instrument of informed consent prior to performance of any study-specific 
procedure. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the participant is made aware 
of the investigational nature of the treatment and that informed consent is given.
The Investigator is  responsible for the retention of the participant log and participant records; 
although personal information may be reviewed by authorized persons, that information will be 
treated as strictly confidential and will not be made publicly available. The investigator is also 
responsible for obtaining participant authorization to access medical records and other applicable 
study specific information according to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
regulations (where applicable).
This study will  be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations of the state 
and/or country and institution where the participant is treated. The clinical trial should be 
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the Belmont Report: Ethical 
Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, consistent with 
good clinical practice and the applicable regulatory requirements and according to the guidelines 
in this protocol, including attached appendices.
14.2 Informed  Consent
The Investigator  (or IRB specified designee) is responsible for obtaining written consent from 
each participant or the participant's legally authorized representative in accordance with 
applicable GCP guidelines using the approved informed consent form, before any study specific 
procedures (including screening procedures) are performed. The informed consent form 
acknowledges all information that must be given to the participant according to GCP guidelines, 
including the purpose and nature of the study, the expected efficacy and possible side effects of 
the treatment(s), and specifying that refusal to participate will not influence further options for 
therapy. Any additional information that is applicable to the study must also be included. 
Additional national or institutionally mandated requirements for informed consent must also be 
adhered to. The participant should also be made aware that by signing the consent form, 
processing of sensitive clinical trial data and transfer to other countries for further processing is 
allowed.
The Investigator  shall provide a copy of the signed consent form to the participant and the signed 
original shall be maintained in the Investigator File. A copy of the signed consent form must be 
filed in the participant file. At any stage, the participant may withdraw from the study and such a 
decision will not affect any further treatment options.

15.1 Data Collection
Data entry into  the database is to be completed in a timely fashion (within 30 days) after the 
participant’s clinic visit. If an AE is considered serious it is captured on both the Adverse Event 
page and the Serious Adverse Event Source Form, which is handled in an expedited fashion.
Data management  activities will be performed using eClinical. eClinical is a suite of software 
tools that enables the collection, cleaning and viewing of clinical trial data. CRS data 
management will design the study-specific database and facilitate its development by the 
eClinical Information Technology team. Once the database design is approved by the 
Investigator, Statistician, and Clinical Research Coordinator, the database will be put into 
production and data entry can begin. Data can be entered and changed only by those with the 
rights to do so into the eCRFs (via the EXPeRT Module). eClinical is compliant with all relevant 
technical aspects of relevant GCP guidelines.
The  system can generate accurate copies of stored data and audit trail information in 
human readable form.
System  access is limited to authorized individuals through the controlled assignment of 
unique ID and password combinations.
The  system is designed to periodically force users to change their passwords and verifies 
that user ID and password combinations remain unique.
The  system automatically generates a permanent time-stamped audit trail of all user 
interactions.
When data  entry is complete, data management will review the data and will query any missing, 
incomplete, or invalid data points for resolution by the Clinical Research Coordinator and 
Investigator. Once all queries have been resolved, the data can be released to the statistician for 
analysis.
15.2 Maintenance of Study Documents
Essential documents will  be retained per RPCI’s policy for 6 years from the study termination 
date. These documents could be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the 
applicable local regulatory requirements or by an agreement with RPCI.
16 ADMINISTRATIVE  RULES
16.1 Revisions  to the Protocol
RPCI may  make such changes to the protocol as it deems necessary for safety reasons or as may 
be required by the U.S. FDA or other regulatory agencies. Revisions will be submitted to the 
IRB/ERC for written approval before implementation.

Response Criteria: irRECIST, Ann Oncol, 25 (suppl 4): iv369  doi:10.1093/annonc/mdu342.23 
(25).
1. Baseline
A. Measurable Lesion Definitions and Target Lesion Selection
Follow  the definitions from RECIST 1.1
Measurable  lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension with a 
minimum size of:
o10  mm in the longest diameter by CT or MRI scan (or no less than double the 
slice thickness) for non- nodal lesions and ≥ 15 mm in short axis for nodal 
lesions
o10  mm caliper measurement by clinical exam
o20  mm by chest X-ray
B. Non-measurable Lesion Definitions
Follow  the definitions from RECIST 1.1
Non-target lesions will include
oMeasurable  lesions not selected as target lesions
oAll  sites of non-measurable disease, such as neoplastic masses that are too 
small to measure because their longest uninterrupted diameter is < 10 mm (or 
< two times the axial slice thickness), i.e., the longest perpendicular diameter 
is ≥ 10 and < 15 mm.
oOther  types of lesions that are confidently felt to represent neoplastic tissue, 
but are difficult to measure in a reproducible manner. These include bone 
metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, malignant ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, ill-defined abdominal masses, skin lesions, etc.
C. Target and Non-target Lymph Node Lesion Definitions
Follow  the definitions from RECIST 1.1

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
09/05/19 Page 85 of 90D. Non-target Lesion Selection
All  lesions or sites of disease not recorded as target lesions should be recorded as 
non-target lesions at baseline. There is no limit to the number of non-target lesions 
that can be recorded at baseline.
E. Bone Lesions
Follow  the definitions from RECIST 1.1
Regardless  of the imaging modality blastic bone lesions will not be selected as target 
lesions. Lytic or mixed lytic-blastic lesions with a measurable soft tissue component 
≥ 10 mm can be selected as target lesions.
F. Brain Lesions
Brain  Lesions detected on brain scans can be considered as both target or non-target 
lesions.
G. Cystic and Necrotic Lesions as Target Lesions
Lesions  that are partially cystic or necrotic can be selected as target lesions. 
The  longest diameter of such a lesion will be added to the Total Measured Tumor 
Burden (TMTB) of all target lesions at baseline. 
If  other lesions with a non-liquid/non-necrotic component are present, those should be 
preferred.
H. Lesions with Prior Local Treatment
During  target lesion selection the radiologist will consider information on the 
anatomical sites of previous intervention (e.g. previous irradiation, RF-ablation, 
TACE, surgery, etc.).
Lesions  undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as target lesions unless 
there has been a demonstration of progress in the lesion.
I. No Disease at Baseline
If  a patient has no measurable and no non-measurable disease at baseline the 
radiologist will assign ‘No Disease’ (irND) as the overall tumor assessment for any 
available follow-up time-points unless new measurable lesions are identified and 
contribute to the TMTB.

09/05/19 Page 86 of 902. Follow-Up
A. Recording of Target and New Measurable Lesion Measurements
The  longest diameters of non-nodal target and new non-nodal measurable lesions, and 
short axes of nodal target and new nodal measurable lesions will be recorded. 
Together they determine the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) at follow-up.
B. Definition of New Measurable Lesions
In  order to be selected as new measurable lesions (≤ 2 lesions per organ, ≤ 5 lesions 
total, per time-point), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target 
lesion selection and meet the same minimum size requirements of 10 mm in long 
diameter and minimum 15 mm in short axis for new measurable lymph nodes. New 
measurable lesions shall be prioritized according to size, and the largest lesions shall 
be selected as new measured lesions.
C. Non-target Lesion Assessment
The  RECIST 1.1 definitions for the assessment of non-target lesions apply.
The  response of non-target lesions primarily contributes to the overall response 
assessments of irCR and irNon-CR/Non-PD (irNN).
Non-target lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments. 
Only  a massive and unequivocal worsening of non-target lesions alone, even without 
progress in the TMTB is indicative of irPD.
D. New Non-Measurable Lesions Definition and Assessment
All  new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new non-
measurable lesions and are followed qualitatively. 
Only  a massive and unequivocal progression of new non-measurable lesions leads to 
an overall assessment of irPD for the time-point.
Persisting  new non- measurable lesions prevent irCR.
3. irRECIST Overall Tumor Assessments
irCR : complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable lesions. Lymph 
nodes must  decrease to < 10 mm in short axis. Confirmation of response is not 
mandatory.

09/05/19 Page 87 of 90irPR : decrease of ≥ 30% in TMTB relative to baseline, non-target lesions are irNN, and 
no unequivocal progression of new non-measurable lesions.
irSD : failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD.
irNN : no target disease was identified at baseline and at follow-up the patient fails to 
meet criteria for irCR or irPD.
irPD : minimum 20% increase and minimum 5 mm absolute increase in TMTB compared 
to nadir,  or irPD for non-target or new non-measurable lesions. Confirmation of 
progression is recommended minimum 4 weeks after the first irPD assessment.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  7STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
effect of iloprost on the symptomatic relief of RP attacks in subjects with symptomatic RP 
secondary to SSc. The study will be piloting an  initial evaluation of iloprost, tes ting the study 
endpoints and logistics of study operations that include, among other things, an  ePRO diary for 
the evaluation of subject response to the treatment as well as the infusion workflow for this 
multi day treatment. Subjects are allowed to continu e receiving stable standard of care therapies 
for the management of symptomatic RP (eg, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin -converting 
enzyme inhibitors, statins, fluoxetine, and low dose acetylsalicylic acid ) or may participate 
without  the use of  background standard of care therapies.  
The study will enroll up to a maximum of  40 subjects.  Subject enrollment  may be halted by t he 
Sponsor at any time for any reason.  
The study consists of an up to 30 -day screening period during which subje cts will complete a daily 
ePRO diary to record information regarding all symptomatic RP attacks (eg, severity of symptoms, 
duration, and hand function). The up to 30 -day screening period consists of a 5 -day eligibility 
period and an up to 25 -day baseline e PRO diary completion period:  
• During the 5 -day eligibility period, eligible subjects will have a minimum of 10  symptomatic 
RP attacks, documented in the ePRO diary, occurring over at least 3 separate days of the 5 -day 
eligibility period.  
• During the baselin e ePRO diary completion period, eligible subjects must  complete the daily 
ePRO diary for a minimum of 10 days (up to a maximum of 25 days) until the day of 
randomization. It may be necessary to extend the baseline ePRO  diary  completion period 
beyond 10 day s in order to accommodate the preferred Monday to Friday dosing schedule. 
The ePRO symptomatic RP attack data from this time period will be used for the calculation 
of the baseline frequency of symptomatic RP attacks.  
Eligible subjects will be given the op tion to participate in a PK substudy . Subjects who participate 
in the substudy  will provide plasma samples for PK analysis. The samples will be analyzed for 
iloprost concentrations using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1 :1 ratio to iloprost injection for IV use or placebo . 
Randomization will be stratified based on the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors at screening. 
Study drug administration will begin on Day 1, and subjects will receive study dr ug for 
5 consecutive days ( eg, Monday through Friday) as an IV infusion over 6  hours each day  via a 
peripheral line  (NovaCath ™ Integrated IV Catheter System) or a peripherally inserted central 
catheter (PICC) using an infusion  pump . 
Subjects must have a systolic blood pressure 85 mmHg (sitting position) prior to study drug 
administration  each day of administration . On Day 1, study drug will be initiated at a starting dose 
of 0.5 ng/kg/min, and dose increases will occur every 30 minut es (5 minutes) in increments of 
0.5 ng/kg/min up to 2.0 ng/kg/min or the individual tolerated dose. If dose -limiting adverse events 
(eg, headache, flushing, jaw pain, myalgia, nausea, or vomiting) occur that cannot be tolerated by 
the subject, then the do se will be reduced in a step wise manner by 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes 
(5 minutes), until a tolerated dose is determined. If symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting 
adverse event occurs during administration of iloprost at the starting dose (ie, 0. 5 ng/kg/min), the 
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  8infusion will be reduced to 0.25 ng/kg/min. If the dose of 0.25 ng/kg/min is not tolerated due to 
symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting adverse event occurs , the study drug will be 
discontinued and reinitiation of the infusion can be  attempted after the event has resolved or been 
treated. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to and after 
all dose changes. If the subject experiences symptomatic hypotension or any other adverse event 
that cannot be tolerated, as determined by the Investigator, during administration of study drug, 
the dose will be reduced or the infusion will be stopped until the symptoms resolve, at which point 
the study drug should be reinitiated at a previously tolerated dose. T he maximum tolerated dose 
will be  maintained for the remaining 6 -hour da ily period. At the end of the 6 -hour infusion period, 
the dose will be stopped. Subjects will be monitored for up to 1 hour after completion of study 
drug infusion (ie, vital signs wil l be obtained 15 minutes [ 5 minutes] and 1 hour [ 15 minutes] 
after completion of the infusion).  
On Days 2 to 5 , the infusion will be started using the highest infusion rate tolerated on the previous 
day without up - or down -titration, unless the subject d oes not tolerate the infusion or adverse 
events occur that cannot be tolerated by the subject and necessitate a reduction in the dose. Vital 
signs will be measured prior to study drug administration and at 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to 
and after all dose changes during the infusion. Additionally, vital signs will be monitored at 
15 minutes (5 minutes) and 1 hour ( 15 minutes) after c ompletion of the 6 -hour infusion.  
During the treatment  period  (Days 1 to 5 ), while subjects receive study drug, the ePRO diary will 
not be completed. No study assessments will be performed on the 2 days following the end of 
treatment (Days 6 and 7, eg, Sa turday and Sunday) to allow the subject to rest and return to a 
schedule  of normal daily living activity  following the 5 days of infusions.  
Subjects will be contacted via telephone on Day 8 to ensure they resume completion of the  daily 
ePRO diary; subject s will complete the diary from Day 8 through Day 21. On Day 22,  subjects 
will return to the clinic for post -treatment evaluations. A follow -up visit will occur 30 days after 
the last administration of study drug (Day 3 5).  
Subjects who discontinue study drug early will remain in the study (unless the subject withdraws 
consent) and complete  the daily  ePRO diary from Day 8 to Day 21 including  clinical laboratory 
assessments on the remaining missed infusion days as well as post-treatment study assessments.  
The total duration of the study  for a subject  will be up to approximately 9 weeks.  
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Iloprost injection  for IV use  and matching placebo will be supplied in vials  packaged in a blin ded 
study drug kit ( 10 vials per kit) . The iloprost and placebo vials will be identical, except 100 mcg 
of iloprost will be added to the active study drug vials.  The drug product must be diluted with 
sodium chloride 0.9% in a drug reservoir (IV bag) prior to use.  
Subjects will receive the study drug IV infusion s for 5 consecutive days  (eg, Monday to Friday) . 
Study drug will be administered after dilution as an IV infusion over 6 hours each day via a 
peripheral line (NovaCath Integrated IV Catheter System) or a PICC  using an infusion  pump. 
(Note: In some instances where the site chooses to use a PICC, it may be necessary to confirm 
placement of  the PICC with an x -ray).

Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  9EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
The primary efficacy parameter is the change in the weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks 
from baseline . 
The exploratory  efficacy parameters  include change s from baseline to the end of the efficacy 
follow -up in the following:  
• Severity of RP attacks  as determined by the severity of  RP attack symptoms (pain, numbness , 
tingling, and/or discomfort ) (using a Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] )  
• Raynaud’s Condition Score   
• Hand function as assessed by the CHFS   
• Duration of symptomatic RP attacks  
• NRS  for worst pain associated with symptomatic RP  
• Patient assessment of overall improvement in symptomatic RP  
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES:  
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of iloprost:  
• Stead y state  plasma concentration just before infusion is stopped  
• Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time of dosing to the last 
time point with measurable concentration  
• AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity  
• Percentage of AUC obtained by extrapolation  
• Plasma terminal elimination half -life  
• Plasma clearance  
• Volume of distribution  
SAFETY VARIABLES:  
Safety parameters will include all adverse events, physical examination findings, vital sign 
measurements  (heart rate and blood pressure) , 12-lead electrocardiogram  findings, and standard 
clinical laboratory measurements  (chemistry  and hematology) . 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
All efficacy analyses are intended to provide an initial description of the clinical profile of iloprost 
and to inform the design  and logistics  of future studies.  
The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population is defined as all randomized subjects  who initiate 
infusion of study drug. The mITT Population is the primary efficacy analysis population.  
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  10The Per -Protocol (PP) Population is defined as subjects in the mITT Population who complete  at 
least Day  21 without any major protocol deviations. The PP Population will be used for sensitivity 
analyses of the primary efficacy variable.  
The Safety Population is defined as all randomized  subjects who  initiate infusion of study drug. 
The Safety Population will be used for all safety analyses.  
Primary efficacy analysi s 
The baseline weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks is defined as the average number of 
weekly symptomatic RP attacks occurring during the 10 - to 25 -day baseline ePRO diary 
completion period. The double -blind weekly symptomatic RP attacks is defined as the average 
number of weekly  symptomatic  RP attacks during Days 8 to 21. The primary efficacy parameter 
is the change in the weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks from baseline (ie, the mean 
number of weekly symptomatic RP attacks during Days 8 to 21 compared to during the 10 - to 
25-day baselin e ePRO diary completion period).  
The primary analysis will be performed bas ed on an analysis of covariance  model, including 
randomized treatment group and randomized stratification (ie, use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
at screening) as factors and basel ine weekly  frequency of  symptomatic RP attacks as a covariate. 
The treatment comparisons will be estimated together with th e 95% confidence interval and 
p-value. The site effect will be explored as necessary. For subjects in the mITT Population with 
interm ittent missingness during the baseline or double -blind intervals, multiple imputation will be 
used assuming data are missing at random; for those subjects with truncated follow -up, methods 
will be used assuming missingness is not at random.  
The primary ana lysis is formally based on a 3 -category decision guideline  for future clinical study 
evaluation of iloprost . Specifically, the decision guideline for this study is based on whether the 
difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekl y frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is less than X, is from X to Y, or is at least Y, where X is 
the threshold that would be exceeded with 90% probability when the true difference between 
iloprost and placebo in the change in the weekly fre quency of symptomatic RP attacks from 
baseline is 6.65, and where Y is the threshold that would be exceeded with only 2.5% probability 
when the true difference between iloprost and placebo in the change in the weekly frequency of  
symptomatic  RP attacks fro m baseline is 0.  
Note that these categories based on the thresholds X and Y should not be interpreted as providing 
strict decision rules, but rather as guidelines that will be factored into a broader scientific  and 
clinical assessment of the benefit -to-risk profile of IV iloprost. This broader assessment will 
include consideration of safety, supportive efficacy endpoints, and relevant infor mation external 
to this study.  
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  11The decision guidelines for this study include the following:  
• If the difference betwee n iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is less than X, then iloprost is not plausibly more 
efficacious than placebo; its utility in this indication should be reconsidered unless the 
endpoin ts support further development.  
• If the difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is between X and Y, then iloprost is plausibly more 
efficacious than placebo.  
• If the differenc e between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is at least Y, then iloprost would be statistically 
significantly more effective than placebo, with the strength of evidence meeting the stand ard 
requirement of a 0.025 one -sided (0.05 two -sided) false -positive error rate.  
Sample size determination  
The study will enroll up to a maximum of 40 subjects.  
If 12.0 is the standard deviation of the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic Raynaud attacks, then with 20 patients per arm, X is 1.785 and Y is 7.438.  
The operating characteristics for this 3 -category decision guideline, when 12.0 is the standard 
deviation of the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptoma tic Raynaud attacks 
and the sample size is 20 patients per arm, are as follows:  
1. Regarding the false -positive error rate of the screening procedure, if IV iloprost truly provides 
no improvement in the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptoma tic Raynaud 
attacks, then the probability of bringing IV iloprost forward to a Phase 3 study is 32%. 
However, there is only a 2.5% chance of reaching the false positive conclusion that IV iloprost 
provides a statistically significant improvement in efficac y relative to a placebo control.    
2. The false -negative error rate is low. If the true difference between IV iloprost and the placebo 
control groups in the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptomatic Raynaud 
attacks is 6.65, then there is on ly a 10% chance that IV iloprost would be discarded, and thus 
a 90% chance that it would be evaluated in a subsequent confirmatory Phase 3 study; 
furthermore, the probability that IV iloprost will have a statistically significant improvement 
in efficacy (a t one -sided p<0.025) relative to the placebo control is 21%.  
Exploratory  efficacy analysi s 
Descriptive analyses based on point estimates and confidence intervals will be used for 
exploratory endpoints.  
Analysis of p harmacokinetic s  
The PK Population will i nclude all subjects in the PK substudy who receive study drug and for 
whom at least 1 PK parameter can be determined and who have at least 1 value above the lower 
limit of quantification.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  12Descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, standard deviation, minim um, median, maximum, and 
coefficient of variation [CV]) will be used to summarize PK concentrations and parameters. 
Geometric mean and geometric CV will also be used to summarize specific parameters.  
Additional PK/pharmacodynamic analysis may be performed as an exploratory analysis, if 
applicable.  
Analysi s of safety  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population. Subjects will be analyzed by the 
treatment received.  
Safety measures will be summarized descriptively. Qualitative variables will be summarized using 
counts and percentages by treatment group at each study visit. A treatment -emergent adverse event 
(TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with a start date and time on or after the administration of 
study drug. Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. Tables will be provided for 
overall incidence and incidence by SOC and preferred term for TEAEs, drug -related TEAEs, 
TEAEs  by maximum severity, serious adverse events, and TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation. Laboratory and vital signs parameters will be presented using descriptive 
statistics for observed values at each visit and changes from baseline, as appropriate.

1.1 Overview of Systemic Sclerosis  
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a heterogeneous disease whose pathogenesis is characterized by 
3 hallmarks: small vessel vasculopathy, production of autoantibodies, and fibroblast dysfunction 
leading to increased deposition of extracellular matrix.1 The pathogenesis of SSc involves 
autoimmune mechanisms, which contri bute to vascular damage, mainly to small arteries and 
arterioles, and excessive accumulation of collagen and other extracellular matrix components in 
the skin and internal organs.  
Systemic sclerosis  is an orphan disease. Incidence rates and prevalence est imates are fairly similar 
for Europe, the United States, Australia, and Argentina, suggesting a prevalence of 150  to 
300 cases per million with a lower prevalence noted in Scandinavia, Japan, the U nited Kingdom , 
Taiwan, and India.2 The data consistently re port prevalence estimates that equate to less than 
100,000 persons in the United States .  
The clinical manifestations and the prognosis of SSc vary, with the majority of patients having 
skin thickening and variable involvement of cardiovascular, gastrointe stinal, musculoskeletal , and 
pulmonary systems.3 Subsets of SSc can be discerned, (eg, limited cutaneous  SSc, diffuse 
cutaneous  SSc, and without skin involvement  [sine SSc] ).1  
1.1.1 Raynaud’s Phenomenon  in Systemic Sclerosis  
Vascular dysfunction is one of the earliest manifestations of SSc and is thought to be a m ajor factor 
in its pathogenesis .4,5,6 Occlusive vasculopathy is the hallmark lesion of all forms of SSc and is 
seen in different organs involved, such as skin, lungs, kidneys, etc.7,8 
Raynaud’s phenomenon  (RP)  is the most common manifestation of vascular abnormalities in SSc 
and is a universal feature of SSc disease, affecting more than 95% of p atients.9,10,11  
Raynaud’s phenomenon  is characterized by abnormal functioning of the cutaneous vessels 
involved in the thermal regulation of blood flow. The distinctive features of RP include pain, 
numbness , tingling , and discoloration of digits due to vaso spasms  (typically occur ring after 
exposure to cold temperatures or stress ). Hand impairment is nearly universal in SSc patients. 
Raynaud’s phenomenon  secondary to SSc is also associated with significant disability  and 
psychological impact.12 In addition to pain, annoyance, and functional disability of RP attacks, 
many patients with SSc report that they change their daily routine to accommodate their RP and 
may have significant anxiety associated with their disease, often expressing fears  of digital 
ulcers  (DUs) and auto -amputation.  
1.1.2 Digital Ulcers  in Systemic Sclerosis  
Digital ulcers  are a frequent external manifestation of vasculopathy in SSc.13 Many factors are 
implicated in the pathogenesis of DUs in the setting of SSc. These include 1) impaired afferent 
vasomotion (highlighted by the intimal hyperplasia of arterioles), 2) disrupted microvasculature 
including capillary and lymphatic, 3) leucocy te and platelet activation and adherence to injured 
endothelium , and 4) hemorhe ological alterations typical of SSc.8 The disease is also character ized 
by insufficient angiogenesis and defective vasculogenesis contributing further to tissue ischemia.14

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  22Ischemic DUs are generally due to aberrant vasculopathy and usually occur on the pulp of the 
fingers.  Digital ulcers  are defined as a denuded area of d e-epithelized tissue.15 Ulcers can also 
occur over bony prominences such as proximal or metacarpophalangeal joints with 
well-demarcated borders and may be caused by traumatic and ischemic causes. The majority of 
the published data has focused on ischemic DU s. Digital ulcers  occur in up to 58% of patients with 
limited or diffuse SSc and often occur early in the disease course.16,17,18 A 30% annual incidence 
of SSc DU s has been reported in the literature, suggesting ~20,000 adult patients experience DUs 
secondary  to SSc yearly in the United States  (based on current U nited States Census data).19 Of 
those patients who experience a DU, more than half have persistent or recurrent DUs for at least 
6 months.16,17,18,19  
Several studies have shown that the lesions heal slowly , lead to substantial pain and functional 
disability , and are associated with complications such as scarring, loss of distal tissue, infection, 
gangrene, and amputatio n. These symptoms lead to reduced quality of life, an increased frequency 
of hospitalization, and decreased survival.9,17,20,21 
1.1.3 Current Management of R aynaud’s Phenomenon  and D igital Ulcers  in Systemic 
Sclerosis  
Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved therapies to trea t RP or 
DUs secondary to SSc. Management of RP or DUs in SSc includes nonpharmacologic, 
pharmacologic, and surgical interventions. Multiple pharmacologic agents are used in clinical 
practice to counteract RP and prevent/reduce th e burden of DUs ( eg, calcium channel blockers, 
angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin -converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, alpha -adrenergic 
blockers, and serotonin inhibitors ), although many lack supportive data and none are approved for 
such use in the  United States. Management of SSc vascular diseases includes vasodilators 
(including medications approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension  [PAH]  such as prostacyclin  
analogs, endothelin receptor  antagonists, phosphodiesterase -5 (PDE5) inhibitors, and so luble 
guanylate cyclase stimulators). Phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitors, prostacyclin  analogs (iloprost), 
and bosentan have been endorsed by the 2016 updated European League Against Rheumatism 
(EULAR) recommendations for the treatment of SSc.22 None of these d rugs are approved for SSc 
RP or DU in the United States.  
In general, immunosuppressive therapies are not effective for vasculopathy associated with SSc, 
as highlighted in PAH and scleroderma renal crisis.23 
In addition to the above strategies aimed at speci fic intervention, established SSc DUs often require 
treatments for secondary effects, such as use of opioids and other analgesics for pain and 
aggressive use of systemic and local antibiotics for infection.24 Efforts to promote  healing are often 
unsatisfact ory, and surgical intervention resulting in permanent tissue loss may be necessary. Thus, 
there remains a clear, unmet medical need for a pharmacological therapy that will treat and affect 
the natural course of DU s in SSc.  
1.2 Overview of Iloprost  
Iloprost, a stable analog of prostacyclin, has been used for over a decade as an inhaled formulation 
to treat PAH ( both within and outside of the United States)  and as an intravenous  (IV) formulation 
for occlusive arterial diseases ( outside of the United S tates) due to its pharmacological effects on 
vascular cells and platelets .25,26 Iloprost is a potent prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonist. 
Pharmacology studies have shown that iloprost increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate

Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  23(cAMP ) levels in human platelets of various species through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, 
leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation. In addition, iloprost has been shown to cause 
vasodilation through stimulation of the IP receptor on smooth muscle cells.  The commercially 
approved forms of iloprost (Ilomedin® and Ventavis®) consist of 2 diastereoisomers that contrast 
in conformation of a methyl group at the carbon 16 position. The current commercial formulation 
uses a fixed racemic mixture of 16(S) and 16( R) diastereoisomers (47:53). The 16(S) is 
substantially more potent than the 16(R) in vasodilating and inhibiting collagen -induced platelet 
aggregation.  
1.2.1 Regulatory Status of I loprost  
The inhaled formulation of iloprost received marketing authorization in the European Union in 
September 2003 , and Schering AG began commercializing the product (Ventavis) in early 2004.  
Ventavis is indicated  for the treatment of PAH to improve a composite endpoint consisting of 
exercise tolerance, symptoms, and lack of deteri oration. Studies establishing effectiveness 
predominately included patients with N ew York Heart Association  Functional Class III  to IV 
symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (65%) or PAH associated with connective 
tissue diseases (23%).  
The IV formulation of iloprost was first approved in the early 1990s in Europe and has since 
received marketing approvals in 30 European and non -European countries under the tradename 
Ilomedin. The approved indications for Ilomedin in the E uropean Union include 1) treatment of 
patients with severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), particularly those at risk of 
amputation and in whom surgery or angioplasty is not possible; 2) treatment of advanced 
thromboangitis obliterans (Buerger ’s disease) with critical limb isch emia in cases where 
revasculari zation is not indicated; 3) treatment of patients with severe disabling RP unresponsive 
to other therapies; and 4) treatment of moderate or severe primary and secondary PAH, such as 
New York Heart Associatio n functional classes III and IV.  
1.2.2 Rationale for Iloprost for the Treatment of Symptomatic Raynaud’s Phenomenon 
Secondary  to Systemic Sclerosis  
Iloprost is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin. Iloprost may improve outcomes and restore function 
lost due to SS c by enhancing cutaneous blood flow, reducing microvascular inflammation, 
reducing/reversing fibrosis , and decreasing platelet aggregation.27,28,29,30,31,32 
1.2.3 Summary of Iloprost Mechanism of Action  
Iloprost is thought to dilate systemic arterial vascular beds through stimulation of the IP receptor 
on smooth muscle cells. Iloprost has been shown to inhibit vasoconstriction induced by 
arachidonic acid and phenylephrine.33,34 Pharmacology studies have sho wn that iloprost also 
increases the cAMP levels in human platelets of various species through stimulation of adenylate 
cyclase, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and adhesion.30,31 Iloprost is thought to have 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. It reduces neutrophil adh esion and chemotaxis, 
and has been shown to down -regulate the intracellular expression of  interleukin -6 and tumor 
necrosis factor -alpha in human monocytes.35,36 Iloprost has been suggested to possess antifibrotic 
effects, as it has been shown to prevent bleo mycin -induced fibrosis and reverse established right 
ventricular fibrosis in animal models.28,32

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  241.2.4 Clinical Pharmacology  
Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  studies have been conducted with iloprost in health y volunteers and in a 
variety of patient populations using different formulations and routes of admini stration. The PK 
and systemic exposures associated with these formulations and routes of administration are very 
well characterized in the literature. A vast majority of the clinical pharmacology and clinical 
studies published in the literature are with th e IV formulation of iloprost.  
In PK studies in animals, there was no evidence of interconversion of the 2 diastereoisomers of 
iloprost. In human PK studies, the 2 diastereoisomers were not individually assayed.  
Iloprost has a short half -life of 20 to 30 minutes  and has linear PK following IV administratio n at 
doses of 1 to 3 ng/kg/min . Approximately 60% of iloprost is bound to plasma protein (75% to 
albumin). The total plasma clearance of iloprost in healthy individuals is 20 m L/min/kg .37  
In vitro studies reveal that cytochrome P450 -dependent metabolism plays only a minor role in the 
biotransformation of iloprost. Iloprost is metabolized principally via β -oxidation  of the carboxyl 
side chain. The main metabolite is tetranor -iloprost, which is found in the urine in free and 
conjugated form. In animal experiments, tetranor -iloprost was pharmacologically inactive. 
Clearance in normal subjects was approximately 20 mL/mi n/kg. A mass -balance study using IV 
and orally administered [3H] -iloprost in healthy subjects (n=8) showed recovery of 81% of total 
radioactivity over 14 hours postdose, with 68% and 12% recoveries in urine and feces, 
respectively. In patients with liver c irrhosis, the mean clearance in Child -Pugh B subjects (n=5) 
was approximately 10 mL/min/kg. For p atients requiring intermittent dialysis (n=7) , the mean area 
under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to 4 hours was 230 pg*h/mL compared to 
54 pg *h/mL for patients with renal failure (n=8) not requiring intermittent dialysis and 48 pg*h/mL 
for normal  healthy volunteers . Dialysis did not affect iloprost plasma concentrations.25  
Iloprost PK has been investigated  in patients suffering from renal insufficiency who are not on 
dialysis with serum creatinine >2  mg/d L and patients on dialysis.38 This study demonstrated that 
the PK profile for ilopros t in pat ients with renal failure, not on dialysis, was similar to that observed 
in PAOD patients and health y volunteers. Patients on dialysis have a reduced clearance of iloprost 
by a factor of 4. The iloprost dos ing regimen requires  titration , so more careful titration should be 
considered for patients on dialysis.38,39  
Iloprost PK has  also been  investigated  in patients suffering from li ver cirrhosis. The study 
demonstrated that iloprost clearance was reduced by a factor of 2 in patients suffering from hepatic 
dysfunction compared with healthy subjects. The iloprost dos ing regimen requires titration , so 
more careful titration should be co nsidered for patients with liver impairment. However, apart 
from a reduction of the starting dose (of approximately 50%) for titration, special 
recommendations are not necessary for patients with impaired liver function.40 
1.2.5 Summary of Iloprost Clinical Exper ience in Systemic Sclerosis  
Several proof -of-concept studies have been conducted evaluating the effects of IV iloprost in 
patients with SSc. These studies evaluated the effects of iloprost in SSc patients with RP and DUs.  
Two placebo -controlled studies  that support the Eicos Sciences , Inc.  development program were 
published by Fredrick M Wigley, MD and sponsored by Berlex Laboratories and the Scleroderma 
Society.41,42

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  25The first study evaluated the  effect of treatment with IV iloprost in patients with RP and ischemic 
ulcers secondary to SSc. In this double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, parallel -group 
study, 35 patients with SSc -associated RP were randomized to receive iloprost (0.5 to 
2.0 ng/kg/min) or placebo by continuous infusion for 6 hours on 5 consecutive days. Patients were 
examined every 2 weeks for a follow -up period of 10 weeks. The study evaluated patient diaries 
recording RP symptoms and attacks. Digital cutaneous lesions including digital ischemic 
ulcerations, fissures, and paronychia were counted, described , and photograp hed at entry and on 
each follow -up assessment. 41 
Of the  35 patients enrolled , 34 completed the 5 days of infusion. One patient discontinued 
treatm ent on Day 2 due to chest and thigh pain of uncertain etiology. Thirty -three patients 
completed 10 weeks of follow -up; 1 patient in the placebo group withdrew at the 8 -week follow -up 
due to a new DU . A total of 11 patients, 7 treated with iloprost and 4 re ceiving placebo, had 
cutaneous finger lesions ( DUs, fissures, or paronychia) at baseline. At the Week 10 study visit, 
6 of the 7 patients treated with iloprost had complete healing of all lesions compared to  none of 
the 4 patients taking placebo (p=0.015).  Digital tip ulcers were present in 4 patients in each 
treatment group. All of the iloprost patients had complete healing at Weeks 6, 8 , and 10 compared 
to none of the 4 patients receiving placebo (p=0.029). One of the placebo patients reported partial 
healing of DUs. Of the patients with no lesions at baseline, 3 of 11 patients receiving iloprost and 
3 of 13  patients receiving placebo developed new lesions. The total number of DUs that developed 
was less in iloprost (11 DUs) compared to placebo (29 DUs). A t least 1 adverse event was reported 
in all 18 patients receiving iloprost and by 10 of the 17  patients receiving placebo. The most 
common adverse events reported in the iloprost group were headache, nausea, vomiting , and jaw 
or thigh pain.41 
The second study evaluated the effect of IV  iloprost in treating  patients with RP secondary to SSc. 
In a follow -up, multicenter (12 sites), double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, 
parallel -group study, 131 SSc patients with RP were randomized to receive iloprost (0.5 to 
2.0 ng/kg/min) or placebo by continuous infusion for 6 hours on 5 consecutive days. The study 
follow -up period was 9 weeks and patients were re -examined at 3, 6 , and 9 weeks after completion 
of the infusion. The study evaluated patient diaries recording RP symptoms and attacks. 
Physicians ’ assessment of overall treatment effect was recorded. Digita l cutaneous lesions were 
recorded on Days 1 and 5 of infusion and at Weeks 3, 6, and 9 of the follow -up period. The protocol 
defined a healing response as a reduction in number of finger lesions from baseline of at least 50%. 
Data for cutaneous lesions wer e analyzed for the subset of patients who successfully completed 
5 days of infusion and had at least 6 weeks of follow -up.42 
A total of 131 patien ts (64 iloprost and 67 placebo) enrolled and 126 successfully completed the 
5-day infusion. Of these, 114 patients (56 iloprost and 58 placebo) completed at least 6 weeks of 
follow -up. A total of 17 patients (8 iloprost and 9 placebo) withdrew from the stu dy. The patients 
receiving iloprost had a decreased RP severity score at Weeks 3, 6, and 9. The treatment difference 
was greater at Weeks 1 to 3 (p=0.006) and Weeks 4 to 6 (p=0.05) than at Weeks 7 to 9 (p=0.09). 
A comparison of the changes over the entire study period (Weeks 1 to 9) showed a greater mean 
decrease in the iloprost group ( -34.8%) than the placebo group (-19.7%) (p=0.01). In the subset of 
patients with digital cutaneous lesions at baseline, the mean decrease in RP severity score remained 
the sa me as those in the entire group given iloprost ( -34.5%), but the effect was less in those who 
received placebo in this subset ( -9.9%) (p=0.01).42  
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  26Patients receiving iloprost had a greater decrease in frequency of RP attacks than those receiving 
placebo at every follow -up assessment. The mean decrease in attack frequency per week during 
the entire study was 39.1% in patients receiving iloprost compar ed to 22.2% in patients receiving 
placebo (p=0.005). In the subset of patients with digital cutaneous lesions, there was a mean 
decrease in attack frequency during the entire follow -up period of 36% in patients receiving 
iloprost and 14.1% in patients rece iving placebo (p=0.064).42   
A total of 73 patients (35 iloprost and 38 placebo) had digital cutaneous lesions at baseline. A 
greater number of patients receiving iloprost had at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the total 
number of lesions at all times during the 9 -week follow -up period.  The group receiving iloprost 
had a greater proportion of patients who completely healed (no remaining original lesions and no 
new lesions) at all times during the study compared t o placebo (p>0.20 at Week 9).  The most 
common adverse events reported by patients receiving iloprost were headache, flushing, nausea, 
jaw pain, diarrhea , and vomiting. The side effects were reversible and controlled by a reduction of 
the infusion  rate of i loprost.42  
In addition to the 2 studies summarized above, there is a large amount of published data in Europe 
on the successful use of intermitte nt or continuous iloprost for management of DUs secondary to 
SSc.43,44,45,46,47,48 
1.3 Rationale  
Intravenous iloprost has market authorization in Europe and Australia and is the standard of care 
treatment for RP and DUs in Europe. However, this treatment is not currently available within the 
United States. In clinical practice, there is a high unmet n eed for effective pharmacologic therapies 
for patients with symptomatic RP secondary to SSc. This Phase 2 pilot  study  will be piloting  an 
initial evaluation of iloprost, testing the study endpoints and logistics of study operations that 
include, among other things, an electronic patient -reported outcomes ( ePRO ) diary for the 
evaluation of subject response to the treatment as well as the infusion workflow for this multi day 
treatment to prepare for a Phase 3 study.  There are several significant feasibility challenges to 
studying symptomatic RP secondary to SSc. First, the population is very small,2,49 estimated at 
~70,000 adult patients with SSc in the United States (based on U nited States Census from  
04 July 2016). For patients with SSc, RP is a problem throughout the year , but the sy mptoms have 
been reported to be reduced by about 50% in the summer months.50 To ensure recruitment and 
limit the impact of seasonal variation in temperature  on the incidence of attacks , this study will be 
conducted during the winter  and spring months.

3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
effect o f iloprost on the symptomatic relief of RP attacks in subjects with symptomatic RP 
secondary to SSc. The study will be piloting an initial evaluation of iloprost, testing the study 
endpoints and logistics of study operations that include, among other things, an ePRO diary for 
the evaluation of subject response to the treatment as well  as the i nfusion workflow for this 
multi day treatment. Subjects are allowed to continue receiving stable standard of care therapies 
for the management of symptomatic RP (eg, calcium channel blockers, ACE  inhibitors, statins, 
fluoxetine, and low dose acetyl salicylic acid) or may participate without the use of background 
standard of care therapies.  
The study will enroll a maximum of  40 subjects.  Subject enroll ment may be halted by the Sponsor 
at any time for any reason.  
The study consists of an up to 30 -day screening period during which subjects will complete a daily 
ePRO diary to record information regarding all symptomatic RP attacks (eg, severity of symptoms, 
duration, and hand function). The up to 30 -day screening period consists of a 5 -day eligibility 
period and an up to 25 -day baseline ePRO diary completion period:  
• During the 5 -day eligibility period, eligible subjects will have a minimum of 10  symptomatic 
RP attacks, documented in the ePRO diary, occurring over at least 3 separate days of the 5 -day 
eligibility period.  
• During the baseline ePRO diary completion perio d, eligible subjects must  complete the daily 
ePRO diary for a minimum of 10 days (up to a maximum of 25 days) until the day of 
randomization. It may be necessary to extend the baseline ePRO diary completion period 
beyond 10 days in order to accommodate the  preferred Monday to Friday dosing schedule. The 
ePRO symptomatic RP attack data from this time period will be used for the calculation of the 
baseline frequency of symptomatic RP attacks.  
Eligible subjects will be given the option to participate in a PK s ubstudy . Subjects who participate 
in the sub study will provide plasma samples for PK analysis. The samples will be analyzed for 
iloprost concentrations using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 r atio to iloprost injection for IV use or placebo. 
Randomization will be stratified based on the use of phosphodiesterase  inhibitors at screening. 
Study drug administration will begin on Day 1, and subjects will receive study drug for 
5 consecutive days (eg, Monday through Friday) as an IV infusion over 6 hours each day via a 
peripheral line (NovaCath ™ Integrated IV Catheter System) or a peripherally inserted central 
catheter (PICC) using an infusion  pump.  
Subjects must have a systolic bl ood pressure 85 mmHg (sitting position) prior to study drug 
administration  each day of administration . On Day 1, study drug will be initiated at a starting dose 
of 0.5 ng/kg/min, and dose increases will occur every 30 minutes ( 5 minutes) in increments of  
0.5 ng/kg/min up to 2.0 ng/kg/min or the individual tolerated dose. If dose -limiting adverse events 
(eg, headache, flushing, jaw pain, myalgia, nausea, or vomiting) occur that cannot be tolerated by 
the subject, then the dose will be reduced in a step wis e manner by 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes 
(5 minutes), until a tolerated dose is determined. If symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  29adverse event occurs during administration of iloprost at the starting dose (ie, 0.5 ng/kg/min), the 
infusion will be reduced to 0.25 ng/kg/min. If the dose of 0.25 ng/kg/min is not tolerated due to 
symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting adverse event occurs , the study drug will be 
discontinued and reinitiation of the infusion can be attempted after the event has r esolved or been 
treated. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to and after 
all dose changes. If the subject experiences symptomatic hypotension or any other adverse event 
that cannot be tolerated, as determined by t he Investigator, during administration of study drug, 
the dose will be reduced or the infusion will be stopped until the symptoms resolve, at which point 
the study drug should be reinitiated at a previously tolerated dose. The maximum tolerated dose 
will b e maintained for the remaining 6 -hour daily period. At the end of the 6 -hour infusion period, 
the dose will be stopped. Subjects will be monitored for up to 1 hour after completion of study 
drug infusion (ie, vital signs will be obtained 15 minutes [ 5 minutes] and 1 hour [ 15 minutes] 
after completion of the infusion).  
On Days 2 to 5, the infusion will be started using the highest infusion rate tolerated on the previous 
day without up - or down -titration, unless the subject does not tolerate the infusion or  adverse 
events occur that cannot be tolerated by the subject and necessitate a reduction in the dose. Vital 
signs will be measured prior to study drug administration and at 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to 
and after all dose changes during the infusion. Additionally, vital signs will be monitored at 
15 minutes (5 minutes) and 1 hour ( 15 minutes) after completion of the 6 -hour infusion.  
During the treatment period ( Days 1 to 5 ), while subjects receive study drug, the ePRO diary will 
not be comp leted. No study assessments will be performed on the 2 days following the end of 
treatment (Days 6 and 7, eg, Saturday and Sunday) to allow the subject to rest and return to a 
schedule  of normal daily living activity  following the 5 days of infusions.  
Subjects will be contacted via telephone on Day 8 to ensure they resume completion of the daily  
ePRO diary ; subjects will complete the diary from Day 8 through Day 21 . On Day 2 2, subjects 
will return to the clinic for post -treatment evaluations. A follow -up visit will occur 30 days after 
the last administration of study drug (Day 35).  
Subjects who discontinue study drug early will remain in the study (unless the subject withdraws 
consent) and complete the daily ePRO diary from Day 8 to Day 21 including clinica l laboratory 
assessments on the remaining missed infusion days  as well as post -treatment study assessments.  
The total duration of the study for a subject will be up to approximately 9  weeks.  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and a Steering Committee will b e utilized in the study. See 
Section 9.2.6  for details.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  324.3 Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects should be listed as having withdrawn consent only when the subject no longer wishes to 
participate in the study and no longer authorizes the Investig ators to make efforts to continue to 
obtain their outcome data.  
Every effort should be made to encourage subjects to remain in the study and complete the ePRO 
diary for the entire duration of the study. Subjects will be educated on the continued scientifi c 
importance of their data , even if they discontinue study drug. Ideally, if subjects withdraw their 
consent, it should be done in writing.  
Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.  
In the case of subjects lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the subject must be made and 
documented in the subject’s medical records.  
4.3.1 Discontinuation of Study Drug  
A subject in this clinical study may discontinue study drug for  any of the following reasons:  
• Subject requests to discontinue study drug  
• Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to t he requirements of the protocol  
• Any serious adverse event (SAE), clinically significant adverse event, severe laboratory 
abnormality, int ercurrent illness, or other medical condition which indicates to the Investigator 
that continued participation is not in t he best interest of the subject  
• Pregnancy  
• Requirement of pr ohibited concomitant medication  
• Subject fail s to comply with protocol requi rements or study -related procedures  
Unless the subject withdraws consent, subjects who discontinue study drug early will remain in 
the study for further acquisition of endpoint measurements through Day 21  including clinical 
laboratory assessments on the re maining missed infusion days as well as post -treatment study 
assessments . The reason for subject discontinuation of study drug must be documented in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF).

5.1 Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized by Interactive Response Technology  (IRT)  in a 1:1 ratio to the 
following treatment groups:  
• Iloprost  injection for IV use   
• Placebo  injection for IV u se 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing  
Intravenous iloprost for the treatment of RP is well established in European guidelines and 
practice. The dosing in this study is based on the iloprost dosing titration algorithm that has been 
used in proof -of-concept studies in sub jects with SSc  41,42,51 and current labeling outside the 
United  States (Ilomedin).26  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled st udy. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 
the 2 treatment groups listed in Section 5.1.  
Randomization will be stratified based on the use of phosph odiesterase inhibitors at screening.  
Individual treatment assignments will be blinded to the Sponsor, Investigator, study personnel, an d 
subjects throughout the course of the study. All individuals directly involved in the conduct of the 
study, including d ata management personnel, will remain blinded to treatment assignments.   
5.4 Breaking the Blind  
It is not expected that emergency unblinding will be needed due to the short half -life of iloprost 
and the lack of a known antidote. Furthermore, adverse events due  to iloprost typically resolve 
quickly once treatment with iloprost has been stopped. However, at all times, study personnel will 
attempt to safeguard the integrity of the blinding in order to minimize bias in the conduct of the 
study.  
Breaking of the blin d should not occur except in the case of a medical emergency and should only 
occur after discussion with the Medical Monitor. In such a case, the Investigator may access this 
information by contacting the Sponsor or its designee. If the blind is broken for an individual 
subject , the blinding should be preserved for the remainder of  the subject s throughout the duration 
of the study. In such a case, study personnel may be notified of that individual subject ’s treatment 
assignment without jeopardizing study blinding for the overall study.  
If the blind is broken for a subject, the subje ct will be encouraged to continue his/her  randomized 
intervention unless it would be medically contraindicated to do so; this decision will be based on 
Investigator consultation with the Medical Monitor. All subjects should be encouraged to continue 
study visits to the end of the study whether or not they remain on his/her  randomized intervention.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  345.5 Drug Supplies  
5.5.1 Formulation and Packaging  
Iloprost injection  for IV use  and matching placebo will be supplied in vials  packaged in a blinded 
study  drug kit (10 vials per kit) . The iloprost and placebo vials will be identical, except 100 mcg 
of iloprost will be added to the active study drug vials. The drug product must be dil uted with 
sodium chloride 0.9% in a drug reservoir (IV bag) prior to use.   
Study drug will be packaged according to current Good Manufacturing P ractice  (GMP) and Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
Study drug will be labeled according to the requireme nts of local law and legislation, as well as 
current GMP and GCP guidelines. Proof labels, detailing actual label text, will be available in the 
study files.  
5.5.2 Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing  
Dilution of drug product for use in the infusion pump  is as follows : A total of 1 mL volume ( 0.5 mL 
withdrawn from 2  vials) should be  withdrawn into a sterile syringe using aseptic technique. The 
iloprost in the sterile syringe should be transferred to a drug reservoir containing 99  mL of sodium 
chloride to make a 1000  ng/mL  (1 mcg/mL)  concentration.  
The drug reservoir should always be dispensed in a pump drug reservoir with instructions for use 
as described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.5.3 Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be administered at the site  by personnel who are trained on how to prepare  the 
study drug  solution , how to prepare t he IV site, and how to administer the IV infusion via a 
peripheral line or a PICC  using an infusion  pump.  Prior to the first infusion,  the NovaCath 
Integrated IV Catheter System will be inserted into a small peripheral vein in the hand or arm using 
aseptic  technique by a trained healthcare professional. If the subject’s peripheral veins do not 
support the placement of a peripheral line, a trained healthcare professional will insert a PICC . 
(Note: In some instances where the site chooses to use a PICC, it ma y be necessary to confirm 
placement of  the PICC with an x -ray). When possible, the same NovaCath Integrated IV Catheter 
System  or PICC will be used f or the 5  days of treatment. Refer to the Infusion and/or Pharmacy 
Manual for additional information regardi ng infusion preparation and administration.  
Subjects will receive the study drug IV infusion s for 5 consecutive days (eg, Monday to Friday). 
Study drug will be administered after dilution as an IV infusion over 6 hours each day via a 
peripheral line (NovaCath Integrated IV Catheter System) or a PICC  using an infusion  pump.  
Prior to study drug adm inistration, s ubjects will be premedicated with a single dose of 
2 acetaminophen extended -release tablets, 650  mg (each).  
Subjects must have a systolic blood pressure 85 mmHg (sitting position) prior to study drug 
administration  each day of administration . 
First infusion  
On Day 1, study drug will be initiated at a starting dose of 0.5 ng/kg/min, and dose increases will 
occur every 30 minutes ( 5 minutes) in increments of 0.5 ng/kg/min up to 2.0 ng/kg/min or the

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  35individual tolerated dose. If dose -limiting a dverse events (eg, headache, flushing, jaw pain, 
myalgia, nausea, or vomiting) occur that cannot be tolerated by the subject, then the dose will be 
reduced in a step wise manner by 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes ( 5 minutes), until a tolerated 
dose is dete rmined. If symptomatic hypotension or a dose -limiting adverse event occurs during 
administration of iloprost at the starting dose (ie, 0.5 ng/kg/min), the infusion will be reduced to 
0.25 ng/kg/min. If the dose of 0.25 ng/kg/min is not tolerated due to sym ptomatic hypotension or 
a dose -limiting adverse event occurs , the study drug will be discontinued and reinitiation of the 
infusion can be attempted after the event has resolved or been treated. Blood pressure and heart 
rate will be monitored 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to and after all dose changes. If the subject 
experiences symptomatic hypotension or any other adverse event that cannot be tolerated, as 
determined by the Investigator, during administration of study drug, the dose will be reduced or 
the infusion will be stopped until the symptoms resolve, at which point the study drug should be 
reinitiated at a previously tolerated dose. The maximum tolerated dose will be  maintained for the 
remaining 6 -hour da ily period. At the end of the 6 -hour infusion p eriod, the dose will be stopped. 
Subjects will be monitored for up to 1 hour after completion of study drug infusion (ie, vital signs 
will be obtained 15 minutes [ 5 minutes] and 1 hour [ 15 minutes] after completion of the 
infusion).  
Infusions 2 to 5  
On D ays 2 to 5, the infusion will be started using the highest infusion rate tolerated on the previous

7.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
7.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy parameter is the change in the weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks 
from baseline.  
7.1.2 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
The exploratory efficacy parameters include change s from baseline to the end of the efficacy 
follow -up in the follo wing:  
• Severity of RP attacks as determined by the severity of RP attack symptoms  (pain, numbness, 
tingling, and/or discomfort)  (using a Numeric Rating Scale [NRS])   
• Raynaud’s Condition Score  
• Hand function as assessed by the CHFS  
• Duration of symptomatic RP attacks  
• NRS  for worst pain associated with symptomatic RP  
• Patient assessment of overall improvement in symptomatic RP  
7.2 Efficacy Assessments   
7.2.1 Raynaud’s Phenomenon Attacks  
A symptomatic Raynaud’s attack for this study is defined as at least 1 color change of the subject’s 
finger(s) (blue, white, or red) associated with at least 1 symptom (pain, numbness, tingling, and/or 
discomfort of the finger[s]). The attack is considered o ver when the color changes back to 
pre-attack color (normal) and the symptoms return to the subject’s pre -attack level.  
7.2.2 Electronic Patient -Reported Outcomes  Diary   
Subjects will be provided with an ePRO diary at Visit 1 and trained on its use. Subjects wil l be 
asked to complete the ePRO diary at the time points indicated in Appendix  A. Questionnaires 
allow for documentation of frequency, severity, and duration  of symptomatic  RP attacks , as well 
as assessment of hand function. Specific questionnaires include the severity of RP attack 
symptoms (using NRS), Raynaud’s Condition  Score, CHFS , and overall patient improvement.  
7.2.2.1  Severity of Raynaud ’s phenomenon  attack symptoms (using a Numeric Rating Scale)  
Raynaud’s phenomenon attacks are associated with significant discomfort (pain, numbness, 
tingling, and/or discomfort). Subjects will be asked to rate the severity of RP attack symptoms 
(pain, numbness, tingli ng, and/or discomfort) using an 11 -point NRS.  
Intensity will be assessed as follows: 0 = no pain/numbness/tingling/discomfort, 1  to 3 = mild 
pain/numbness/tingling/discomfort, 4 to 6 = moderate pain/numbness/tingling/discomfort, and 
7 to 10 = severe pain/ numbness/tingling/discomfort.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  447.2.2.2  Raynaud’s Condition  Score  
The Raynaud’s Condition Score asks subjects to rate their difficulty with Raynaud’s condition on 
a given day from “No difficulty (0)” to “Extreme difficulty (10).” Subjects will be asked to 
consider t he number of attacks they have had on that day and how long each attack lasted. Subjects 
will also be asked to consider how much pain, numbness, or other symptoms the Raynaud’s caused 
in their fingers (including painful sores) and how much the Raynaud’s al one affected the use of 
their hands that day.  
7.2.2.3  Cochin Hand Function Scale  
Raynaud’s phenomenon attacks have a significant impact on hand function.12 The CHFS is an 
18-item self -administered instrument that assesses hand function as it relates to daily activities. 
The CHFS has been validated for use in subjects with  SSc.21  
7.2.2.4  Duration of Raynaud’s phenomenon attacks  
Subjects will be asked to document the duration of each symptomatic RP attack within their ePRO 
diaries. For each attack, the subject will record the duration in minutes.  Refer to Section 7.2.1  for 
the definition of a symptomatic RP attack.   
7.2.2.5  Overall patient improvement  
At Day -1, subjects will be asked to rate their  overall  symptomatic RP in the last week. At Day 21, 
subjects will be asked to rate their overall symptomatic RP compared to the start of the study.  
7.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Eligible subjects will be given the option to participate in a PK substudy . Subjects who participate 
in the substudy  will provide plasma samples for PK analysis. The samples will be analyzed for 
iloprost concentrations using validated liquid chromatography  mass spectrometry methods. The 
actual PK sampling times will be captured on the eCRF. The actual dosing time will also be 
captured on the eCRF.  
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of iloprost:  
• Steady state  plasma concentration just before infusion is stopped  
• Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time of dosing to the last 
time point with measurable concentration  
• AUC from t ime 0 extrapolated  to infinity  
• Percentage of AUC obtained by extrapolation  
• Plasma terminal elimination half -life  
• Plasma clearance  
• Volume of distribution

8.1 Adverse Events  
Since symptomatic RP attacks (as defined in Section 7.2.1 ) are recorded as efficacy assessments, 
these will not be treated as adverse events. However, if an event results in hospitalization or 
amputation, the event will then be reported as an SAE. I f subjects have non -RP-related pain during 
a symptomatic RP attack, that event w ill be captured as an adverse event.  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfav orable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, i ncluding observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
All adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and 
documented from  the time of informed consent  until Day 35. During study drug infusions (Day 1 
to Day 5) treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) are expected  (see Section 5.5.3.1 ). 
Treatment -emergent adverse events should be captured in relation to the dose, dose rate, and/or 
need for dose reduction. Subjects should be instructed to report any adverse event that they 
experience to the Investigator , whether or not they think the event is due to study treatment. 
Beginning at screening until Day 35, Investigators should make an assessment for adverse events 
at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse eve nt eCRF.   
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investigator  and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a comp onent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) s hould be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure  itself .  
Any medical condition already present at screening  should be recorded as medical history and not 
be reported as an adverse event , unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at  
baseline change in severity , frequency,  or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it 
should be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( eg, ECG ) findings that are 
detected during the s tudy or are present at the date of screening  and significantly worsen during 
the study should be reported as adverse event s, as described below . The Investigator  will exercise 
his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or 
other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, 
stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are determined to be an 
error should not be reported as an adverse event.

Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  47Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical f indings (eg, ECG  abnormalities) should be 
reported as an adverse event if any of the following are applicable:  
• If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality  
• If action take n with study drug is required as a result of the abnormality  
• Based on  the clinical judgment of the Investigator  
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relatio nship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, 
ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or sev erity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information.  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
The Investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize e ach adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug 
using the categories of yes or no.  
Assessment of severity  
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated , causing minimal discomfort,  and generally not interfering 
with normal daily activities.  
Mod erate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality assessment  
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related ) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse eve nt rules out a causal relationship 
and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc .) is suspected.  
Yes ( possibly, probably, or definitely related ) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal 
relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be 
identified.  
The definit ion implies a reasonable  possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  48The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequ ence from study drug administration - 
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
Each r eport should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant drug - 
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be exam ined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a 
class effect.  
• Expos ure to physical and/or mental stresses - 
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and 
better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug - 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorpti on, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered.  
8.1.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The Investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence for pre defined 
adverse events of special interest (AESIs ) throughout the subject’s participation in this study.  
The Investigator will assess and record any additional information on the AESI in detail on an 
adverse event form which must be submitted within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
For this study, hypotension will be considered an AESI.  
During the course of the study, additional AESIs may be identified by the Sponsor.  
Adverse events of special interest must be recorded in the eCRF . 
8.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death . 
• A life -threatening adverse event . 
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  49o Note: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered  “life-threatening” if, in view of 
either the Investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk  of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization . 
o Note: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay will be consider ed an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency room or urgent care visit without hospital admission will 
not be recorded as a n SAE  under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure 
scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent , or ele ctive treatment of a pre -
existing condition that did not worsen from baseline . However, unexpected complications 
and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded 
as adverse event s and assessed for seriousness.  Admission to the hospital for social or 
situational reasons ( ie, no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits , respite 
care) will not be considered inpatient hospitalizations.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substanti al disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• An important medical event.  
o Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria  may be 
considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate me dical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room o r at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that

8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators  
Initial reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until 30 days following the last 
administration of study drug  must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the 
knowledge of the occurrence .  
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (E DC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified 
electronically  by the EDC system  and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC system , send an email to Medpace Safety at 
Medpace -safetynotification@medpace.com or call the Medpace SAE reporting line  (phone 
number listed below), and fax /email  the completed paper SAE form to Medpace ( contact 
information  listed in Section 8.6) within 24 hours of awareness. When the EDC system becomes 
available, the SAE information must be entered within 24 hours of the system becoming available .

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  50Follow -up reports  
The Investigator  must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) , or the subject 
dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up inf ormation, the Investigator  must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation 
(eg, subject discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Medpa ce Clinical Safety via fax or e mail. 
If it is not possible  to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial 
reporting of SAEs.  
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an adverse event or SAE.  However, i f a subject becomes 
pregnant during the study or within the safety follow -up period defined in the protocol , the 
Investigator should report the pregnancy to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the event. Medpace Clinical Safety will then provide the Investigator/site the Exposure In Utero 
(EIU) form fo r completion. The Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it 
back to Medpace Clinical Safety.  
If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while the subject is receiving study drug 
or within the safety follow -up period defined in the protocol  (30 days after last study drug 
infusion) , the Investigator should notify Medpace Clinical Safet y as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed (up to 1 year) until the outcome of the pregnancy  is known , 
whenever possible. Once the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be 
complete d and faxed/emailed to Medpace Clinical Safety . If the outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should  also follow the 
procedures for repor ting an SAE.  
8.5 Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor /designee  will report all relevant information about Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions  (SUSAR s) that are fatal or life -threatening as  soon as possible to the FDA , and 
in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by the Sponsor/designee of such a case . Relevant  
follow -up information will subsequently be communicated within an additional 8 days.  
All other SUSARs  will be reported to the FDA  as soon as possible b ut within a maximum of 
15 days of first knowledge by the Sponsor/designee .  
The Sponsor/designee  will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country -specific legislation.  
The Sponsor/desig nee will also inform  all Investigators as required per local regulation.  
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to  an investigational medicinal product.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  539 STATISTICS  
9.1 Analysis Populations  
9.1.1 Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  
The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population is defined as all randomized subjects who initiate 
infusion of study drug. The mITT Population is the primary efficacy analysis population.  
9.1.2 Per-Protocol Population  
The Per -Protocol (PP) Population is defined as all subjects in the mITT Population who complete 
at least Day  21 without any major protocol deviations. The PP Population will be used for 
sensitiv ity analyses of the primary efficacy variable.  
9.1.3 Safety Population  
The Safety Population is defined as all randomized subjects who  initiate infusion of study drug. 
The Safety Population will be used for all safety analyses.  
9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy  
All efficacy analyses are intended to provide an initial description of the clinical profile of iloprost 
and to inform the design and logistics of future studies.  
9.2.1.1  Primary efficacy analysis  
The baseline weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks is defined as the average number of 
weekly symptomatic RP attacks occurring during the 10 - to 25 -day baseline ePRO diary 
completion period. The double -blind weekly symptomatic RP attacks is defined as the average 
number of weekly symptomatic RP a ttacks during Days 8 to 21. The primary efficacy parameter 
is the change in the weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks from baseline (ie, the mean 
number of weekly symptomatic RP attacks during Days 8 to 21 compared to during the 
10- to 25-day baseline  ePRO diary completion period).  
The primary analysis will be performed based on an analysis of covariance model, including 
randomized treatment group and randomized stratification (ie, use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
at screening) as factors and baseli ne weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks as a covariate. 
The treatment comparisons will be estimated together with th e 95% confidence interval and 
p-value. The site effect will be explored as necessary. For subjects in the mITT Population with 
intermi ttent missingness during the baseline or double -blind intervals, multiple imputation will be 
used assuming data are missing at random; for those subjects with truncated follow -up, methods 
will be used assuming missingness is not at random.  
The primary anal ysis will be performed on the mITT Population. Sensitivity analyses for the 
primary endpoint will include comparable analyses performed on the PP Population.  
The primary analysis is formally based on a 3 -category decision guideline  for future clinical stud y 
evaluation of iloprost . Specifically, the decision guideline for this study is based on whether the 
difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
Eicos Sciences, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol ES -201 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  54symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is less than X, is from X  to Y,  or is at least Y, where X is 
the threshold that would be exceeded with 90% probability when the true difference between 
iloprost and placebo in the change in the weekly frequency of symptomatic RP attacks from 
baseline is 6.65, and where Y is the threshold that would be exceeded with only 2.5% probability 
when the true difference between iloprost and placebo in the change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is 0.  
Note that these categories based on the thresholds X and Y should not be interpreted as providing 
strict decision rules , but rather as guidelines that will be factored into a broader scientific and 
clinical assessment of the benefit -to-risk profile of IV ilopro st. This broader assessment will 
include consideration of safety, supportive efficacy endpoints, and relevant information external 
to this study.  
The decision guidelines for this study include the following:  
• If the difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is less than X, then iloprost is not pla usibly more 
efficacious than  placebo; its utility in this indication should be reconsidered unless the 
endpoints support further deve lopment.  
• If the difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is between X and Y, then iloprost is plausibly more 
efficacious than placebo.  
• If the difference between iloprost and placebo in the mean change in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic RP attacks from baseline is at least Y, then iloprost would be statistically 
significantly more effective than placebo, with the strength of evidence meeting the standard 
requirement of a 0. 025 one -sided (0.05 two -sided) false -positive error rate.  
The study (and other information that emerges during the conduct of this study) will provide 
important insights through consideration of the following:  
• Estimated benefit -to-risk profile of IV ilopr ost 
• Possible refinements in the dose/schedule of IV iloprost  
• Approaches to improve adherence to the IV iloprost regimen  
• Modifications to defining eligibility criteria to enhance enrichment  
• Approaches to achieving timely accrual of study participants at cen ters with the established 
ability to provide high quality implementation of the study  
• Modifications to the use of an electronic diary to collect patient reported outcome data  
9.2.1.2  Sample size determination  
The study will enroll  up to  a maximum of  40 subjects. Subject enrollment may be halted by the 
Sponsor at any time for any reason.  
If 12.0 is the standard deviation of the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of 
symptomatic Raynaud attacks, then with 20 patients per arm, X is 1.785 and Y is 7.438.

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  55The operating characteristics for this 3 -category decision guideline, when 12.0 is the standard 
deviation of the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptomatic Raynaud attacks 
and the sample size is 20 patients per arm, are as follows:  
1. Regardi ng the false -positive error rate of the screening procedure, if IV iloprost truly provides 
no improvement in the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptomatic Raynaud 
attacks, then the probability of bringing IV iloprost forw ard to a Phase 3 trial is 32%. However, 
there is only a 2.5% chance of reaching the false positive conclusion that IV iloprost provides 
a statistically significant improvement in efficacy relative to a placebo control.    
2. The false -negative error rate is low. If the true d ifference between IV iloprost and the placebo 
control groups in the change from baseline in the weekly frequency of symptomatic Raynaud 
attacks is 6.65, then there is only a 10% chance that IV iloprost would be discarded, and thus 
a 90% chance that it woul d be evaluated in a subsequent confirmatory Phase 3 study ; 
furthermore, the probability that IV iloprost will have a statistically significant improvement 
in efficacy (at one -sided p<0.025) relative to the placebo control is 21%.  
9.2.1.3  Exploratory  efficacy analy sis 
Descriptive analyses based on point estimates and confidence intervals will be used for exploratory 
endpoints.  
9.2.2 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics  
The PK Population will include all subjects in the PK substudy  who receive study drug and for 
whom at least 1 PK  parameter can be determined and who have at least 1 value abo ve the lower 
limit of quantification.  
Descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, and 
coefficient of variation [CV]) will be used to summarize PK concentrations and parameters. 
Geometric mean and geometric CV will also be used to  summarize specific parameters.  
Additional PK/pharmacodynamic analysis  may be performed as an exploratory analysis, if 
applicable.  
9.2.3 Analysis of Safety  
All safet y analyses will be performed on the Safety Population. Subjects will be analyzed by the 
treatment received.  
Safety measures will be summarized descriptively. Qualitative variables will be summarized using 
counts and percentages by treatment group at each s tudy visit. A TEAE is defined as an adverse 
event with a start date and time on or after the administration of study drug. Treatment -emergent 
adverse events will be summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ 
class (SOC) and pre ferred term. Tables will be provided for overall incidence and incidence by 
SOC and preferred term for TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, TEAEs by maximum severity, SAE s, 
and TEAEs leading to treatment  discontinuation.  
Laboratory and vital signs parameters will b e presented using descriptive statistics for observed 
values at each visit and changes from baseline, as appropriate. Abnormal physical examination 
findings will be presented in a by -subject data listing. Descriptive statistics will be provided for 
ECG dat a. Details of any abnormalities will be included in subject listings .

a. The study consists of an up to 30 -day screening period during which subjects will complete a daily ePRO diary to record information regarding all symptomatic RP attacks 
(eg, severity of symptoms, duration, and hand function). The up to 30 -day screening per iod consists of a 5 -day eligibility period and an up to 25 -day baseline ePRO diary

Version 4.0, 01 March 2019  67completion period. Subjects are allowed a 1 -time rescreening at least 2 weeks from the last screening assessment.  
b. During the 5 -day eligibility period, eligible subjects wil l have a minimum of 10 symptomatic RP attacks, documented in the ePRO diary, occurring over at least 3 separate 
days of the 5 -day eligibility period.  
c. During the baseline ePRO diary completion period, eligible subjects must  complete the daily ePRO diary for  a minimum of 10 days (up to a maximum of 25 days) until the 
day of randomization. It may be necessary to extend the baseline ePRO diary completion period beyond 10 days in order to accommodate the preferred Monday to Friday 
dosing schedule. The ePRO sympt omatic RP attack data from this time period will be used for the calculation of the baseline frequency of symptomatic RP attacks.  
d. In circumstances where a subject discontinues the study prior to Day 21, an ET visit will be performed. Contact the IRT syste m to record the subject’s withdrawal from the 
study.  
e. Subjects will be contacted via telephone on Day 8 to ensure they resume completion of the  daily  ePRO diary; subjects will complete the diary from Day 8 through Day 21.  
f. Digital ulcers will be assessed at s creening and captured as part of the medical history at this visit. New DUs will be captured as an adverse event/SAE. In all cases, 
subjects that present with DUs will be followed until the end of the study. Investigator assessment of the DU will consist o f location, status, and healing.  
g. Eligible s ubjects will have a minimum of 10 symptomatic RP attacks, documented in the ePRO diary, occurring over at least 3 separate days  of the 5 -day eligibility period . 
h. Height will be collected at screening only.  
i. Vital signs will be measured prior to study drug administration  and at 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) prior to and after all dose changes during the infusion. Additionally, vital 
signs will be monitored at 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) and 1 hour ( 15 minutes) after completion of the 6 -hour infusion. Subjects must have a systolic BP 85 mmHg (sitting 
position) prior to study drug administration  each day of administration . The arm used for IV infusion should not be used for blood pressure monitoring.  
j. Includes chemistry and hematology.  The arm used for IV infusion should not be used to draw blood samples.  
k. On Day 5 only, perform clinical laboratory assessments (chemis try and hematology) 1 hour post infusion (wi thin 45 minutes to 3 hours post infusion is allowed).  
l. Eligible subjects will be given the option to participate in a PK substudy . Subjects who participate  in the substudy  will provide plasma samples for PK analysis on Day 2  at 
the time points indicated in Section 7.3. The arm used for IV infusion should not be used to draw blood samples.  
m. Day 2 only.  
n. For women of childbearing potential only.  
o. Prior to study drug administration.  
p. Subjects will be provided with an ePRO diary at Visit 1 and trained on its use. Subjects will start  the daily ePRO diary the day after signing informed consent. Specific 
questionnaires include the severity of RP attack symptoms (using NRS), Raynaud’s Condition Score, CHFS , and overall patient improvement.  
q. Subjects will complete the daily  ePRO diary during the eligibility period and baseline ePRO diary completion period  as outlined above . Subjects will not complete the 
ePRO diary during Days 1 to 7, but will resume reporting at Day 8 and continue until Day 21.  The CHFS and overall patient improvement  will only be completed on 
Day -1 and Day  21. 
r. Contact the IRT system to randomize the subject and obtain study drug assignment.  
s. Prior to the first infusion , the NovaCath™ Integrated IV Catheter System will be inserted into a small peripheral vein in the hand o r arm using aseptic technique by a 
trained healthcare professional. If the subject’s peripheral veins do not support the placement of a peripheral line, a train ed healthcare professional will insert a PICC. 
(Note: In some instances where the site chooses t o use a PICC, it may be necessary to confirm plac ement of  the PICC with an x -ray). When possible, the same NovaCath 
Integrated IV Catheter System or PICC will be used for the 5 days of treatment.  
t. Subjects will be premedicated  with a single dose of 2 a cetaminophen extend ed-release tablets, 650 mg (each), 15 to 60 minutes prior to study drug administration.  
u. To be administered for 5 consecutive days (eg, Monday through Friday) as an IV infusion over 6 hours each day via a periphera l line or a PICC using an infusion  pump. 
Study drug will be initiated at a dose of 0.5 ng/kg/min and will be increased every 30 min utes (5 minutes) in increments of 0.5 ng/kg/min to 2.0 ng/kg/min or the 
individual tolerated dose . Refer to Section 5.5.3  for further details.  
v. All adverse events will be collected from the time of informed consent until Day 35 .

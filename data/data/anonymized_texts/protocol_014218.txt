1.1 Primary Objective   
 
The primary objectives of this prospective pilot study is to (1) determine the feasibility 
and reproducibility of 3D contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging in liver cancer patients 
undergoing Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy and (2) evaluate whether there are 
treatment induced early changes in imaging metrics derived from 3D contrast enhanced 
ultrasound. This study will provide valuable insight as to the potential of baseline and/or 
early post -treatment 3D ultrasound perfusion characteristics (measurements of blood -
flow) of primary and metastatic liver tumors to  predict tumor response to Stereotactic  
Ablative Radiotherapy. Our underlying  goal is to assess whether early perfusion changes 
at 0-7 days  after SABR initiation can be used as a non- invasive early biomarker for 
treatment response assessment.  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives   
 
Evaluate the feasibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound- to-CT fusion by assisting three-
dimensional (3D) perfusion ultrasound (US) imaging with optical and electromagnetic tracking 
of the ultrasound probe on patients with liver cancer that will undergo CT for treatment planning and/or response evaluation. 
 
2 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease 
 
Vascular damage and response have been implicated in the response to radiotherapy at ablative doses. Perfusion MR, CT, SPECT, and PET can be used to detect therapy -induced 
changes in tumor vascularity. However, radiation exposure from multiple exams (CT/PET/SPECT), restrictions on the use of contrast in patients with renal insufficiency 
(MR/CT), limited access (MR/SPECT/PET), and elevated cost render these modalities less 
practical for frequent routine imaging.  Two -dimensional (2D) contrast- enhanced 
perfusion ultrasound (US) of injected microbub bbles, is non -ionizing, accessible, and 
relatively inexpensive but fundamentally limited in quantification by the three-
dimensional (3D) heterogeneity of tumor perfusion and the 3D nature of tumor motion.  
 
These fundamental limitations of 2D US imaging have been recently overcome by the 
development of novel real -time 3D US transducers that make 3D dynamic US perfusion 
imaging in patients possible. Our goal is to assess the utility of 3D US perfusion for liver SABR planning and response evaluation.   
 
2.2 Study Agent/Device/Procedure  
 
    DEFINITY® is comprised of lipid -coated microspheres filled with octafluoropropane gas. 
DEFNITY® does not contain any human or animal materials. The microspheres contained in DEFINITY® have a mean diameter of 1.1 to 3.3 microns (in vitro measurements). The 
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019    
  Page 8 of 30 microspheres are stable and small enough to pass through the pulmonary capillaries. The 
microbubbles are eliminated via the breath.  
     For cardiac application, a fter activation of DEFINITY® and intravenous injection, the  
physical acoustic properties of activated DEFINITY® provide contrast enhancement of the endocardial borders during echocardiography. The perflutren lipid microspheres exhibit 
lower acoustic impedance than blood and enhance the intrinsic backscatter of blo od (21).  
 
In this study it is hoped that perfusion characteristics of the lesion will predict whether a 
patient will respond to therapy.  
 
For clinicaltrials.gov compliance  
This is an FDA approved drug for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricular chamber and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular 
endocardial border.  
 This investigation is proposed to be conducted under IND exemption per 21CFR§312.2(b) 
and IRB approval.  
2.3 Rationale  
Medical imaging plays a prominent role in the clinical evaluation of cancer therapies. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) to evaluate anatomic response to 
treatment were developed to standardize tumor measurements in routine clinical care and 
in clinical trials (1). With the use of RECIST, patients are classified to either respond, stabilize, or progress, depending on treatment -induced changes in tumor size measured on 
computed tomographic (CT) scans or magnetic resonance (MR) images.  However, cancers 
treated with the new generation of targeted therapies (e.g., such as anti- angiogenic agents) 
often show little change in size during the 1st months of therapy despite substantial clinical 
benefit. Radiologic criteria that additionally take into account functional changes in the 
enhancement of lesions on contrast material –enhanced CT sc ans (3,4)  or dynamic contrast-
enhanced (DCE) MR images (5) have helped to identify patients who went on to show clinical benefit as early as 9 weeks into treatment (6).  
DCE ultrasonography (US) can be used to quantify microbubble enhancement and can be 
used to assess functional change in response to antiangiogenic treatment of patients with 
metastatic RCC. The advantage of DCE US are the lack of ionizing radiation (as compared to 
CT) and the relatively low costs and availability (compared to MRI). Furthermore, US 
contrast agents are not nephrotoxic and, therefore, can be injected with renal insufficiency. 
Recent research showed feasibility of two -dimensional (2D) DCE US in patients. Lamuraglia 
et al (7) described DCE US criteria to classify the response to sorafenib  (Nexavar; Bayer, 
West Haven, Conn). Correlations between changes in DCE US parameters, during the first 2 
weeks of treatment with sorafenib, and overall sur viva l have also been reported (8 ), while 
revascularization of tumors following the cessation of treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin; Hoffmann- La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) has been characterized by using a DCE 
US–derived perfusion index, which correlates with histologic fin dings in a murine tumor 
model (9 ). Other preclinical studies of antiangiogenic treatments have demonstrated 
correlations between DCE US and DC CT measu rements (10 ) and among DCE US, DCE MR 
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019    
  Page 9 of 30 imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emissi on tomographic 
measurements (11 ). 
Dynamic contrast- enhanced ultrasonography (DCE -US) is a technique that can be used to 
detect microvessels and quantitatively assess solid tumor perfusion using raw linear data 
(15). It involves Doppler ultrasound after injection with a contrast agent, which enhances 
the vessel signal (16, 17). Doppler ultrasonography can accurately detect and characterize 
blood flow in vessels with a diameter as low as 100 μm (14). Doppler signals provide 
functional information on neovascularity by indicating the maximal velocity in tumor supply vessels (16). The addition of perfusion software and microbubble contrast agents 
has further improved the technique, enabling the visualization of vessels with a diameter as 
small as 40 μm (17) . To date, DCE -US has been used in a number of clinical trials with 
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These studies have indicated that DCE -US parameters 
may be correlated with tumor responses, for example in RCC with sorafenib (18, 19) or in 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated by imatinib (20).  
 
Dynamic US can be used to quantify dynamic changes in tumor vascularity as early as 3 days after bevacizumab administration in patients with HCC. These early changes in tumor 
perfusion may be predictive of tumor response at 2 months, progression- free survival, and 
overall survival, and they may be potential surrogate measures of the effectiveness of antiangiogenic th erapy in patients with HCC (13 ). 
 
However, a major limitation of current perfusion US studies is that all imaging is  performed 
in a limited two -dimensional (2D) field -of-view which cannot capture the heterogeneity of 
tumor perfusion throughput its volume. Recent animal studies have shown that a 2D 
sampling of tumor perfusion may be highly biased by the position of the US transducer 
placement over the tumor and that entire- tumor three -dimensional (3D) imaging 
approaches are of paramount importance to translate non- invasive perfusion US into a 
clinical applications (12).  
 Through our research  collaboration with Philips, we have acquired a new FDA approved 3D 
US transducer that allows 3D DCE -US perfusion imaging of an extended field -of-view. This 
allows for the first time to quantify tumor perfusion of the entire volumetric extent of a liver 
metastasis and will likely substantially improve reliability and accuracy of US perfusion 
imaging in the clinical arena.  
 
In this pilot  study, we will assess performance of 3D US perfusion imaging in patients with 
liver tumors  undergoing SABR to evaluate the feasibility of performing 3D perfusion CEUS 
in this patient population and understand whether early changes in perfusion parameters 
are introduced as a result of the SABR treatment.  
 
2.4 Study Design 
 
For clinicaltrials.gov and Stanford Clinical Trials Directory compliance  
 
This is a pilot , single- center study in subjects with liver tumors . The primary objectives of this 
prospective pilot study is to (1) determine the feasibility and reproducibility of 3D contrast 
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019    
  Page 10 of 30 enhanced ultrasound imaging in liver cancer patients undergoing Stereotactic Ablative 
Radiotherapy and (2) evaluate whether there are treatment induced early changes in imaging 
metrics derived from 3D contrast enhanced ultrasound. This study will provide valuable insight 
as to the potential of baseline and/or early post- treatment 3D ultrasound perfusion 
characteristics (measurements of blood -flow) of primary and metastatic liver tumors to  predict 
tumor response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy.  
 The target lesion will be located  at the simulation CT scan for treatment planning.  Prior to 
Definity® administration, gray scale and Doppler (color or power imaging) ultrasound investigations of the target lesion will be performed using commercially available ultrasound 
equipment and standard techniques (B -mode or Harmonic imaging) to study the anatomy of the 
target lesion and surrounding parenchyma.  
 
Immediately after the unenhanced ultrasound evaluation, contrast- enhanced ultrasound will be 
perf ormed, according to the procedures described to study the lesion vascularity in comparison 
to the surrounding parenchyma. Definity® will be administered  intravenously through a central 
line or  in a peripheral vein.  
 
Unenhanced ultrasound and Definity® -enhanced ultrasound images will be recorded and stored  
anonymously . 
 The primary analysis will be based on comparison of the readout (perfusion parameters of the 
lesion ) at baseline, at 0-7 days after the first fraction of radiotherapy treatment, 2- 4 months 
following the start of radiotherapy, and the clinical outcome of the patient, including findings on routine CT and PET- CT imaging.  
 This is a S ingle Group, Open Label Study designed to evaluate to evaluate as a primary outcome 
feasibility  and efficacy.

4 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
Pregnancy Test   
 If the subject is female and of c hild -bearing potential, exclude the possibility of pregnancy by:  
• testing serum βHCG  or urine pregnancy test prior to the start of Definity® administration 
(the local laboratory may be used)  
• obtaining surgical history (e.g., tubal ligation or hysterectomy)  
• obtaining medical history (pos t-menopausal with a minimum of 1 year without menses).  
See Appendix B.  
 Safety Assessments Adverse Events  We will r ecord all untoward medical events in the Adverse Event section of the CRF. Only post-
dose untoward medical occurrences will be tabulated as adverse events.   
Imaging Procedures  
 The unenhanced ultrasound and Definity® -enhanced images will be performed, in  the same 
session, using commercially available (FDA- approved) ultrasound systems with appropriate  
contrast- specific capabilities. The ultrasound examination, both unenhanced and contrast-
enhanced should be performed by qualified personnel with at least 3  years of experience in liver 
ultrasound  or Fellows with appointment in Stanford Radiology  
 Definity® will be administered intravenously into a central line or port or an upper extremity vein 
(e.g., a vein in the cubital fossa or dorsal aspect of the wrist or hand) using a catheter while 
observing aseptic technique. Immediately following the Definity® injection, 5 mL to 10 mL of saline 
will be administered to flush the intravenous line of any remaining contrast agent. Subjects will be 
monitored for any untoward medical occurrences listed in a study case report form or note for 30-
60 min after Definity ® injection is initiated .  
 
Imaging parameters:  Contrast- specific imaging will be performed with an abdominal matrix -array transducer (PM 
mode, Philips iU22 with X6 –1; Ph ilips Ultrasound, Bothell Wash) which is a l ow-mechanical -index 
(MI) nonlinear imaging (MI, 0.06) that allows visualization of the micro -bubbles nondestructively 
Time- gain controls will be aligned to the center line. Receive gain,  dynamic range, image depth, and 
transmit focus will be optimized for each patient at the baseline examination, and then identical 
settings will be used at follow -up. Disruption- replenishment data will be collected for 
approximately 30 seconds following 1 -second, 8- frame flash at an MI of 1.3.  
 
Unenhanced Ultrasound  
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019    
  Page 13 of 30 During the unenhanced ultrasound examination, the morphology and localization of the target FLL 
will be evaluated using gray scale ultrasound and color/power Doppler modes. The target lesion 
will be identified using gray scale ultrasound and its location will be identified using Coineaud’s 
system . Then, either color Doppler imaging or power Doppler imaging should be used to study the 
morphology/vascularity of the target lesion and surrounding parenchyma. Specific measurements 
with Spectral Doppler may be used depending on the presence and/or visualization of vessels.  
 
Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Examination  The following protocol will be used, according to published literature (23):  
 An infusion of 1.3 mL of Definity diluted in 50  mL of saline will be administered using an injection 
pump. Two minutes will be allowed for the infusion to reach a steady level before disruption-
replenishment. Measurements will be performed two times (to assess reproducibility of the replenishment curves analysis following microbubble destruction and replenishment of 
microbubbles into the US field -of-view).  
 
4.1 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Concomitant Medications  
Given that concomitant meds are neither indicated nor no counter -indicated as per the 
Definity Prescription Information the Concomitant Medication section of the Case Report Form (CRF) will not be filled.   
 
4.2 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Subject will be discontinued from the study if the subject:  
• withdraws consent.  
• during the course of the study manifests condition matching exclusion criteria.  
• will not be able to adhere to protocol timeline  due to scheduling or other conflict  
• has an adverse event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires the subject’s  
Discontinuation.

In clinical trials, serious cardiopulmonary events occurred in 19 (1.1%) patients. None of 
these events, which included 8 deaths and 11 other serious adverse events, was attributed 
to DEFINITY®, but to progression of underlying disease.  
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS  
DEFINITY® is not to be administered in patients with known or suspected right- to-left, bi-
directional or transient right- to-left cardiac shunts, by intra- arterial injection, or to patients 
with known hypersensitivity to perflutren. In post marketing use, rare but serious 
cardiopulmonary or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported during or sho rtly 
following perflutren- containing microsphere administration. The risk for these reactions 
may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions. It is not 
always possible to reliably establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the 
presence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease.  Thus all patients need to be assessed for 
the presence of any condition that precludes DEFINITY® administration and it is recommended that resuscitation equipment and trained personnel are readily available.  
   Devices:  
In addition, there will be an Optical and Electromagnetic tracking tools attached to the 
Ultrasound Transducer that will not be in contact with the patient. There is very little risk to the patient associated with optical tracking as there is no transfer of energy to the 
patient. With electromagnetic tracking there may be electromagnetic interference with 
implantable devices such as pacemakers, etc. Electromagnetic tracking will not be used 
(Optical tracking ony)  if the patient has an implantable medical device to eliminate risk 
from electromagnetic interference.

 7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
 
7.1 Potential Adverse Events  
 
The safety of DEFINITY® is well documented in multiple clinical trials involving over 1,700 
patients at more than 20 U.S. medical centers.   Age, gender, race and ethnicity did not affect the 
overall incidence of adverse events.  
 
The overall incidence of treatment- related adverse events was 8.4%. The most frequently 
reported treatment- related adverse experiences were in the Central and Peripheral nervous 
system (3.1%), Body as a Whole (2.4%) and Gastrointestinal system (1.8%). The most frequently reported treatment- related adverse experiences were:

  Page 16 of 30 7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.2.1  Adverse Events  
 Adverse events will be assessed for 30 -60 minutes after each injection of Definity ®. 
 
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.0.  Both Serious and Non -Serious 
Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific 
Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse 
Event (AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent, 
Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation. All Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution.   SAEs must be reported while on 
study and up to 30 days after the last dose of the study treatment is given.  
 SAEs CTCAE Grade 3 and above, and all subsequent follow -up reports will be reported to 
the Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following 
review by the DSMC, events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be 
reported to the IRB using eProtocol within 10 working days of DSMC review, or within 5 
working days for deaths or life -threatening experiences.  
 7.2.2  AE Definition  
 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or a clinical trial 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with the use of th e product.  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence that occurs outside the period of subject follow -up 
defined in the protocol is not required to be collected in the AE section of the CRF.   An existing condition, which is detected by the diagnostic procedure conducted to test the 
efficacy of an investigational contrast agent, is not considered an AE.  
 
Symptoms or medically significant laboratory or instrumental (e.g., electrocardiographic) 
abnormalities of a pre- existing condition, such as cancer or other disease, should not be 
considered an AE. However, occurrence of new symptoms, laboratory or instrumental abnormalities, as well as worsening of pre- existing ones, are considered AEs.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
• results in death,  
• is life- threatening (i.e., the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event/reaction; it does not refer to an event/reaction which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe),  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization,  
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019    
  Page 17 of 30 • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (where disability is defined 
as a permanent or substantial disruption of ability to carry out normal life 
functions, either reported or defined as per clinical judgment),  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospitalization but may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed in the 
definition above. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, and blood dyscrasias or 
convu lsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
• Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a SAE.  
• A non- serious adverse event is any adverse event that does not meet the criteria 
listed above for a  SAE.  
 
7.2.3  Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
 
Per Stanford IRB, UPs are events involving risks to participants or others and must meet 
ALL 3 criteria below:  
 1.  Unexpected: in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given (a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol- related documents, and (b) 
the characteristics of the subject population being studies; AND  
 
2.  Related to participation in the research:  or there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research; or if a device is 
involved, probably caused by, or associated with the device; AND  
 3.  Harmful:  suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater 
risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
UPs generally will warrant consideration of substantive changes in the research protocol or 
informed consent process/document, or other corrective actions, in order to protect the 
safety, welfare, or rights of subjects or others.(27)  Due to this, UPs will be reported 
promptly to Stanford IRB following the below guidelines.  
 
A UP may also be an AE or SAE and can be noted as both on CRFs and in OnCore.  
 Reporting U Ps 
UPs should be entered into OnCore and reported within 24 hours of learning of the 
event.  
 
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019    
  Page 18 of 30 7.2.4   AE Relationship to the Investigational Product:  
Every effort will be made to determine the cause of each adverse event. The correlation 
between the investigational product and the adverse event will be classified as follows:  
1. Probable  a) The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product;  
 
b) The event follows a known response pattern to the investigational product;  
  c) The event cannot be reasonably explained by any of the following features:  
  
• the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state, or  
• other therapy administered  
• or the diagnostic/interventional procedure;  
 
d) There is evidence of partial or complete disappearance of the event after 
withdrawal of the product (positive challenge).   
e) The event follows a known response pattern to the investigational product but 
the event could have been produced by any of the following features:  
 
• the subject’s clinical state, or  
• other therapy administered, or  
• the diagnostic/interventional procedure.  
 
f) The event does not meet any of the above criteria because of:  
• conflicting data and/or  
• dubious or insufficient/poor evidenc e, or  
• the event is not judged as related or not related.  
 
g) The event is either a pre- dose event or is definitely due to causes separate from  
the administration of the investigational product, i.e.  
• documented pre- existing condition  
• technical and manual procedural problems  
• concomitant medication  
• the subject’s clinical state  
• the event is judged as not related and does not fall under any of the above 
points.

For clinicaltrials.gov and Stanford Clinical Trials Directory compliance  
10.1 Primary and Secondary Outcome measures  
 
10.1.1  Relevant Subset  
 
   All patients will be considered for the secondary outcome.  
 
10.1.2  Measurement Definition  
 
Primary Objective:  
 The primary objectives of this pilot study is to (1) determine the feasibility and 
reproducibility of 3D contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging in liver patients undergoing Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy and (2) evaluate whether there 
are treatment induced early changes in imaging metrics derived from 3D contrast 
enhanced ultrasound.  
 
10.1.3  Measurement Methods  
 Contrast Agent Administration 
The US contrast agent will be perflutren lipid microspheres (Definity; Lantheus 
Medical Imaging, North Billerica, Mass). Patients will receive an infusion of 1.3 mL 
of perflutren lipid microspheres diluted in 50 mL of saline delivered up to 10  
mL/min by us ing an injection pump (Medfusion 3500; Smiths Medical, Dublin 
Ohio). Two minutes will be allowed for the infusion to reach a steady level before 
disruption- replenishment measurements were performed.  
 
 
Imaging System Parameters 
Contrast- specific imaging will be performed with an abdominal matrix- array 
transducer (PMPI mode, Philips iU22 with X6 –1; Philips Ultrasound, Bothell 
Wash). Low -mechanical -index (MI) nonlinear imaging (MI, 0.06) will allow 
visualization of the microbubbles nondestructively. Persistence and other post-
processing will be disabled to minimize temporal and spatial averaging. Time-
gain controls will be aligned to the center line. Receive gain, dynamic range, image 
depth, and transmit focus will be optimized for each patient at the baseline 
examination, and then identical settings  will be used at follow -up. Disruption -
replenishment data will be collected  for approximately 30 seconds following  each 
1-second, 8 -frame flash at an  MI of 1.3. Frame rates ranged from 7 to  12 Hz. Data 
will be stored  in a compressed  “native” format to allow linearization.  
 
10.1.4  Measurement Time Points  
The probe will be held steady throughout each acquisition. During the infusion, 
continuous 3D data will be collected and two disruption- replenishment 
acquisitions will be performed.  
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019   
   Page 22 of 30  
10.1.5  Image analysis and derived measures  
Volume  of interest (VOIs) encompassing the lesions will be defined on the 3D 
DCE -US. After linearization of the 3D DCE -US signal (to make it proportional to 
contrast concentration), time intensity curves (TIC) will be generated for the 
mean contrast concentration within the VOI. After standard TIC fit curve 
parameters will be extracted to serve as measures that describe perfusion. These 
measures  include: relative blood volume, mean flow velocity, and relative blood 
flow = relative blood volume x mean flow velocity .   
 
10.2 Secondary Outcome 
In this pilot study of 20 patients, w e will focus on the primary objective : feasibility, 
reproducibility and assessment of changes in metrics (indices)  derived from 3D contrast 
enhanced ultrasound. Our secondary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of contrast-enhanced 
ultrasound- to-CT fusion by assisting three- dimensional (3 D) perfusion ultrasound (US) imaging 
with optical and electromagnetic tracking  of the ultrasound probe on patients with liver cancer 
that will undergo CT for treatment planning and/or response evaluation. Thus the secondary 
outcome will be the relative number of ultrasound examinations in which fusion to CT was possible.  
11 REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be 
the monitoring entity for this study. The DSMC will audit study -related activities to 
determine whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP).  This may include review of the following types of documents participating in 
the study: regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events and 
protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human 
subjects.  Results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the 
appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an 
expedited fashion, as needed.  
11.2 Data Management Plan 
Case Report Forms (CRFs) are printed or electronic documents designed to record all 
protocol- related information on each trial participant. CRFs should summarize the 
clinical findings and observations necessary to ensure safety of participants on the study, and to doc ument the study outcomes.  CRFs are required by the SRC for all 
Interventional studies.  Study -specific CRFs  will document treatment outcomes for 
data analysis.  CRFs will be developed manually and will be maintained by the study 
coordinator.  
  
12 STATISTICAL C ONSIDERATIONS 
 
12.1 Statistical Design   
The primary objectives of this pilot study is to (1) determine the feasibility and 
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019   
   Page 23 of 30 reproducibility of 3D contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging in liver patients undergoing 
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy and (2) evaluate whether there are treatment induced 
early changes in imaging metrics derived from 3D contrast enhanced ultrasound. 
Specifically, we will perform explorat ory analysis for testing the following hypotheses:  
 
12.2 Outcome Measurements:  
 Primary endpoint s: 
• To characterize the reproducibility of 3D DCE -US by estimating the concordance  
correlation coefficient (30 ,31) for repeated 3D DCE -US measures (see Section 
10.1.6, Image analysis and derived measures) . 
• To determine the variance in the relative changes of repeated 3D DCE -US measures . 
• To provide summary statistics of the relative changes in 3D DCE -US measures  
before and after SABR.  
 Secondary endpoint:  
• To provide relative number of 3D DCE -US examinations in which fusion to CT is 
possible  with tracking of the ultrasound transducer.  
 
12.3 Analysis plan: 
 This is an exploratory pilot study designed with a primary objective to evaluate (1) the 
feasibility and repro ducibility of 3D DCE -US in cancer patients undergoing SABR for liver 
lesions and (2) the magnitude of the d ifferences in perfusion measures before and after 
SABR. Future studies will seek to understand if 3D DCE -US perfusion baseline values or 
changes have predictive power for clinical endpoints in  SABR treatments. The knowledge 
gained from this study will aid in calculating the appropriate sample size for such studies .  
The main focus here is on understanding the discrepancies in measures from repeated acquisitions and differences in measures befor e and after SABR.  Thus  the data will be 
analyzed as follows:   
• Estimation the concordance  correlation coefficient (30,  31) for repeated 3D DCE -US 
measures (see Section 10.1.6, Image analysis and derived measures) as a measure of 
reproducibility . Concordance correlation values between 0.9 and 0.95 will  be 
interpreted as moderate reproducibility and  values between 0.95 and 0.99 will  be 
interpreted as substantial reproducibility based on the following scale for the concordance correlation coefficient:  Poor, < 0.9; moderate, 0.9 – 0.95; substantial 
0.95 – 0.99, nearly perfect >0.99.  
• Histogram analysis and summary statistics (mean, median, variance, and maximum) 
of the relative changes (difference/average) of repeated 3D DCE -US measures. (Small 
variance and zero mean of the relative changes will be  indicative of highly 
reproducible 3D DCE -US measures).  
• Histogram analysis and summary statistics (mean, median, variance, and maximum) 
of the relative changes (difference/baseline) in 3D DCE -US measures before and after 
SABR.  Large mean differences will be indicative of treatment (SABR) effect.  
      IRB- 30071 / Protocol Version 29Aug2019   
   Page 24 of 30 • Calculation of proportion  of 3D DCE -US exami nations in which fusion to CT is  possible 
with tracking of the ultrasound transducer. Calculation of proportion of 3D DCE -US 
examination in which repeated scans is successful. These proportions are metrics of 
feasibility (target 80% -90%). Successful fusion to CT in particular is important metric 
is 3D DCE -US is to be explored as add- on imaging for treatment planning in further 
studies.

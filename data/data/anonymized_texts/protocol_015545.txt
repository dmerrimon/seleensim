NAME OF SPONSOR: Gan & Lee  Pharmaceuticals  USA  PROTOCOL  No.: GL-GLAT1 -3001  
NAME OF STUDY TREATMENT:  Gan & Lee Insulin G largine  Injection  
TITLE OF STUDY: An Open -label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase  3 Study to Compare the  
Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and S afety of Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals Insulin Glargine Injection to L antus® 
(Insulin Glargine Injection) in Adult Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes M ellitus   
STUDY  CENTERS : Approximately  100 sites are  planned in  the United States  and Europe  
STUDY  PERIOD : Subjects randomized to the Gan & Lee 
Insulin Glargine Injection group or  the Lantus® group will 
receive treatment for 26  weeks.  PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT : Phase 3 
PLANNED STUDY  DATES:  The study  started in 2017 and is expected to end i n 2019  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate equivalence of Gan & Lee I nsulin Glargine Injection and Lantus® in terms of 
immunogenicity  
Secondary Objectives:  
• Immunogenicity: To evaluate the percentage of subjects with negative anti-insulin antibodies  
(AIAs) at baseline  who develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26, the percentage of 
subjects w ith at least a  4-fold increase in titers  compared to baseline value , mean change from 
baseline in AIA titers between treatment groups, the percentage of  subjects with confirmed positive  
AIA who develop any anti-insulin neutralizing antibodies up to visit Week 26, and percentage of 
subjects who develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26 of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine 
Injection in comparison with that of Lantus®. 
• Safety: To evaluate the safety of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection in comparison with that of 
Lantus® 
• Efficacy: To evaluate the efficacy of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection in comparison with that 
of Lantus® 
Exploratory Objectives : 
• To investigate the retrospective hypoglycemic rate and the time in hypoglycemia  and 
hyperglycemia using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)  data 
• To examine the relationship between the plasma concentration s of insulin glargine , M1, and M2, 
and immunogenic re sponse   
STUDY DESIG N AND METHODOLOGY: The purpose of this equivalence study is to compare the 
immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Gan  & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection with that of  the reference 
medicinal product, Lantus®, in adult  subjects  with type 1  diabetes mellitus.  
At the screening visit, subjects will sign the informed consent form  (ICF), they will be screened  for 
eligibility,  and the following information will be collected: adverse events, medical history (including 
diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease history), prior and concomitant medications , vital signs, height, body 
weight, and body mass index ( BMI ). The following procedures will be performed: 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG),  physical examination, and blood collection for fasting blood glucose  (FBG) test, 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1 c), AIA, routine hematology and chemistry testing (complete blood count, 
metabolic chemistry panel  with serum lipids , thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] , and free thyroxine [T4]). 
A urinalysis , and for women  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. At this 
visit, the subject will be issued a glucometer , test strips, and other supplies, and the Investigator or designee 
will provide instruction and conduct training on how to use the glucometer  for prospective  capillary blood  
glucose monitoring to document hypoglycemic episodes in a prospective manner . Subjects will be allowed 
to keep the glucometer  after the study, per local ethical and legal guidelines and regulations.  Subjects will 
also receive a Hypoglycemic Event s Record  in which they will record information about any hypoglycemic 
events that occur during their participation in the study. At this visit, the subject will have a n Abbott  
FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring  Syste m sensor applied to the back of the upper  arm. The 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
 
Page 5 of 77 
 sensor , which  calibrates itself during the first 12 to 24 hours after application, will be worn for 8  days and  
will record the interstitial glucose concentration every 15 minutes. D ata from the 2nd through the 8th day of 
wear will be used for the analysis. The subject will also be issued a Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record  for the 
8-day period, in which they will record the time of their meals and insulin use. After 8  days, the subject may  
remove the sensor an d bring it  to the r andomization visit  in a provided biohazard bag; if the end of the 8-
day CGM period coincides with the date of the  randomization visit, the sensor can be removed at the visit  
by site staff . The information obtained through CGM will have no direct impact on treatment advice and is 
intended for research purposes only. Subjects will bring  both their Hypoglycemic Event s Record  and their 
Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record  to the randomization visit.  Between the screening and randomization 
visits, subjects will have their basal insulin dose optimized based on their fasting glucose results . 
Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be centrally randomized 1:1 in an open -label fashion to 
receive either Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection or Lantus® for 2 6 weeks. Randomization will be 
stratified by country . Subjects will continue using their bolus (short -acting) insulin and will substitute the 
investigational product  (IP) for their long- acting (basal) insulin. In the USA, t he Sponsor will ensure that all 
insulin s will be provided to all subjects regardless of medical insurance or reimbursement issues.  This 
applies to the non- study insulins and this should be discussed with the Study Monitor.  
At the randomization visit (Visit 2), subjects will  receiv e a supply of insulin pens with IP. The Investigator 
or designee will train the subject on all study procedures and proper dose administration.  
All subjects  will attend 9 clinic visits (the screening  visit, the randomization visit, and visits at Weeks  2, 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20, and 26) , 2 brief visits during which a CGM sensor will be applied (8 -10 days before the visits 
at Weeks 12  and 26), and they will be contacted by telephone at Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. The Week 2 6 
visit (Visit 9) will be the end -of-treatment visit. 
At all visits and phone contacts  (except for visits to apply a  CGM sensor) , the Investigator or designee will 
review glucose results  (especially focusing on hypoglycemia ), adverse events, changes in concomitant 
medications, and changes in IP and bolus  insulin use. At all study  visits, the following procedures will be 
performed: vital signs, body weight, urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing 
potential, and an FBG  test. 
Additional procedures at study visits are as f ollows: a t Weeks 8, 16, and 26, blood for HbA1 c will be 
collected;  at Weeks 12  and 26, subjects will wear their CGM sensor to the site for the staff to safe ly remove 
it; they will bring their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record for the site staff to review, and  blood will be 
collected for routine hematology and chemistry , TSH  and free T4 ; at Weeks 12 and 26, blood will be 
collected for AIA;  and at Week 2 6, a 12-lead ECG and physical examination will be performed . A subset of 
additionally consented subjects will have blood drawn at Day 1 and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26 for 
optional pharmacokinetics (PK) (insulin glargine, M1, and M2 concentrations).  
If a subject discontinues the study prematurely (early termination – ET), site personnel will make a 
reasonabl e effort to perform all study activities scheduled for Visit 9 ( end of treatment – EOT visit). 
Additionally, it is also very important for site personnel to encourage subjects to visit the site at Week 26 + 4 weeks (and Week 12 + 1 week,  if applicable) for  a blood sample  to be obtained for AIA and HbA1
c 
measurements.  
Site personnel will contact the subjects by telephone approximately 30 days after study completion to query for serious adverse event information only.  
Subjects will only be included in the optional PK portion of the study if they are able to provide a baseline PK sample.

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Enrollment is planned for 550 su bjects overall (275 subjects per treatment 
group). The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be a n equivalence test  using the 2 one -sided tests 
(TOST) approach with α=0.05.  This sample size was chosen to achieve over 80% power on the equivalence 
test under margins dependent on the observed treatment -induced AIA rate . Sample size calculations were 
performed using EAST Version 6.4.  
STUDY TREATMENT(S):   
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection for subcutaneous 
injection, 100 U/mL , in the integrated,  disposable 3.0-mL pre -filled  Gan & Lee in jector  pen 
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration: Lantus® (insu lin glargine injection) solution for 
subcutaneous injection, 100 U/mL , in the SoloStar® 3-mL pre-filled insulin pen   
Lantus® contains insulin glargine, an insulin analog, and has a prolonged duration of action. Lantus® and 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine should be administered once daily at any time but at the same time each day. 
To be consistent with current Lantus® labeling, twice -daily dosing of IP is strictly prohibited. The dose 
regimen (dose and timing) should be individually adjusted.  
DURATION OF TREATME NT: Subjects in both groups will receive study treatment for 2 6 weeks

Exploratory Endpoints : 
• Retrospective CGM hypoglycemic rate  
• Time in hypogly cemia and hyperglycemia  
• Relationship between p lasma concentration s of insulin glargine , M1, and M2 , and AIA titers  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be an equivalence test using the TOST approach with α=0.05 
via a normal t est of difference in proportions to ( -margin, +margin) where the margin is dependent on the 
observed treatment -induced AIA rate in Lantus®. The number and percentage of subjects in each treatment 
group who develop treatment -induced AIA after baseline and u p to visit Week 26 will be evaluated using a 
test for difference in proportions based on the normal approximation. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the corresponding 90% CI in the Safety Analysis Set using Wald method for risk difference without continuity correction. The estimand of interest for the primary immunogenicity analysis  
is the difference in treatment -induced immunogenicity rates regardless if all subjects tolerate or adhere to 
study treatment or receive other insulin treatments . Intercurrent events will be handled according to the 
treatment policy strategy. Treatment Policy strategy is defined as the strategy that considers “The occurrence of the intercurrent event is irrelevant: the value for the variable of interest is  used regardless of 
whether or not the intercurrent event occurs” (See ICH E9 R1 addendum).  
The key secondary analysis will be to evaluate equivalence (FDA)/noninferiority  (EMA) of Gan & Lee 
Insulin Glargine Injection relative to Lantus
® for HbA1 c by comparing the 90% confidence interval with 
(-0.4%, 0.4%) for equivalence using the TOST approach and by comparing the upper limit of the 95% CI 
with 0.4% for noninferiority from a pattern mixture model that uses multiple imputation analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and stratification factor of country  included as fixed 
effects and baseline HbA1
c included as a covariate. Separately in each treatment group, the imputation will 
use the outcomes of patients who completed the study (inclu ding subjects who discontinued treatment but 
provided a visit Week 26 HbA1c sample) to impute outcomes in patients without actual visit Week 26 
recorded results under the missing at random assumption. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure will be specified in the SAP. Analysis of HbA1
c will follow a hierarchical testing strategy: first, 
equivalence/noninferiority will be tested with a margin of 0.4%; secondly, if and only if the test using a margin of 0.4% is significant, then equivalence/noninferiority will be tested using a margin of 0.3%. Analyses of HbA1
c in the testing hierarchy will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set consisting of all 
randomized subjects according to randomized treatment with supportive analyses on the Per Protocol Analy sis Set. A tipping point analysis with varying assumptions about the differences on each treatment arm 
between outcomes in patients who withdrew from the study early and outcomes in patients who completed the study will be performed.  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Continuous variables will be

 summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.  
The secondary immunogenicity variables of the percentage of subjects with negative AIA at baseline who 
develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26 and the percentage of subjects with confirmed positive 
AIA after baseline and up to Week 26 will be compared between treatment groups using a normal test of 
difference in proporti ons. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the corresponding 90% 
CI using Wald method for risk difference without continuity correction.  The secondary immunogenicity 
variables of the percentage of subjects in each treatment group with confirmed positive AIA at baseline and at least a 4 -fold increase in titers after baseline and up to visit Week 26 and the percentage of subjects with 
confirmed positive AIA after baseline and up to visit Week 26 who develop any anti -insulin neutralizing 
antibodies after baseline and up to visit Week 26, will be compared between treatment groups using an 
exact test of difference in proportions. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the corresponding 90% CI in the Safety Analysis Set. Th e exact confidence limits are computed by inverting 
2 separate one- sided exact tests that are based on the score statistic.  The mean change from baseline in each 
treatment group in AIA titers after baseline and up to visit Week 26 will be tabulated descrip tively .  
Safety variables will be summarized descriptively in the Safety Analysis Set consisting of all randomized  
subjects according to actual treatment received. All reported adverse events will be assigned a system organ class and preferred term accordi ng to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and graded 
according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. The number and percentage of subjects with adverse events (all adverse events, hypoglycemia, serious adverse events [in cluding fatal], 
adverse events leading to termination of study treatment and/or early withdrawal from the study, IP -related 
adverse events, and injection site reactions) will be presented. Vital signs, body weight and BMI, ECG, and laboratory results will be summarized by treatment and visit.  
The secondary efficacy variables of number and percentage of subjects achieving a HbA1 c value < 7.0% a t 
visit Week 26 and the number and percentage of subjects achieving a FBG test result of ≤ 6.0 mmol/L 
(≤ 108.0 mg/dL) in each treatment group will be compared using a test of difference of proportions based 
on the normal approximation and confidence intervals . The retrospective CGM hypoglycemic rate and time 
in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be summarized for subje cts in the Safety Analysis Set. The plasma 
concentrations of insulin glargine, M1, and M2 will be plotted against AIA titers.

6.1 Disease Review
Type 1 diabetes usually results from cellular autoimmune destruction of the beta cells in the 
pancreas, severely reducing or eliminating production of endogenous insulin. Without 
insulin , glucose cannot enter cells and blood glucose concentration increases.  Hepatic 
gluconeogenesis may ensue, further elevating the blood glucose concentration. Without treatment, potentially lif e-threatening ketoacidosis may develop [ 1]. 
Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease that, if inadequately treated, can lead to significant morbidity, including macrovascular and microvascular complications, and significantly increased mortality. In conjunction with ongoing patient lifestyle education regarding self-management of the disease, subcutaneous insulin is t he mainstay of treatment for 
patients with type 1 diabetes [ 1].  
The Diabetes C ontrol and Complications Trial (DCCT) [2] demonstrated that intensive 
therapy with subcutaneous insulin leads to improved glycemic control and better outcomes. Since the publication of the DCCT, several insulin analogs have been developed that are associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes and  lowering of 
glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1
c) equivalent to human insulin [ 2]. Ratner et al [ 3] showed 
that compared with human insulin, treatment with insulin glargine was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and a lower incidence of hypoglycemia. Hasslacher et al [ 4] 
showed that subjects with type 1 diabetes and early stage chronic kidney disease who we re 
treated with insulin analog s such as insulin glargine had better kidney function and higher 
hemoglobin concentrations, compared with those who received human insulin.  
6.2 Compound Review  – Insulin Glargine  
Insulin glargine is a biosynthetic insulin analog with a longer duration of action than human 
insulin. The substitution of glycine for asparagine at A21 and the addition of 2 arginines at 
the C-terminus of the B chain result in stabilization of the molecule, leading to delayed and 
prolonged absorption after subcutaneous injection [3, 5].  
6.2.1 Nonclinical Studies 
An extensive characterization and comparison of structural and biofunctional properties of 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection and Lantus® has been conducted [ 6]. T he s tructural 
characterization  (includi ng  primary,  secondary,  tertiary a nd quaternary s tructures; size, 
hydrophobicity, charge hete
rogeneities, and cell-based biofunctionality including the binding 
to the receptors of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1), and the activation  of the insulin-
signal
ing cascade  and the stimulati
on of glucose uptake were demonstrated to be  similar 
betwe
en Gan & Lee Insul
in Glargine Injection and Lantus®. For in vitro and in vivo 
pharmacologic and toxicologic studies and clinical studies, r eference is made to  
NDA 021081 [ 5].

Page 21 of 77 6.2.2 Clinical Studies 
In 2016, Study GL- GLA-001, a phase I, exploratory, randomized, double-blind, 2- way 
crossover pilot study, demonst
rated bioequivalence of Gan & Lee Insulin G largine  Injection  
and United S tates (US) -sourced Lantus®. A lthough this exploratory study suggested 
biosimilarity,  it was not  powered to pr ovide  robust statistical conclusions. G an & Lee Ins ulin 
Gla
rgine  Injection  was well tolerated,  and treatment -em ergent adverse events were 
comparable to those with Lantus®. There were no significant signals that would indicate a 
difference in t he safety profile between the treatments. A p ivotal pha se I st udy will be  
performed 
conc urrently to assess the pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamic effects of  
Gan & L ee Insulin G largine  Injection  compared w ith U S- and Europe an-sourced Lantus®. 
6.3 Clinical Study  Rational
e 
The purpose of this study is to compare Gan & Lee  Insulin G largine  Injection 100 U/mL 
with that of the reference medicinal product, Lantus®, Sanofi-Aventis’ brand of insulin 
glargine injection 100 U/mL, and evaluate equivalence in terms of immunogenicity, safety, 
and efficacy , in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus . 
Insulin analogs are more costly than conventional insulins, and limited access to affordable 
insulin may keep some patients from accessing important treatment options, leading to unnecessary complications [ 1, 7].  
Biosimilar products may result in significant price reductions compared to the cost of the 
reference products, even if the reductions are not of the magnitude seen with many generics [ 8].  
Biosimilar drugs are not identical to the reference product. Because even small differences in 
the primary structure can result in clinically significant functional differences, there are concerns abo ut potential risks to patients [ 8]. Insulin glargine has been shown to exhibit 
proliferative and anti- apoptotic effects in vitro in colorectal cancer cells; however, clinical 
studies have produced conflicting results regarding an association between insulin glargine and cancer risk [ 9]. And although a number of observational studies in 2009 found an 
association between insulin glargine and an increased risk for breast cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes, a recent study of more than 12,000 subj ects with type 2  diabetes who were 
newly started on insulin glargine showed no increase in the risk of breast cancer after a median 5-year follow-up period among those who were insulin-naïve. A nonsignificant increase in risk was found among subjects who had switched to insulin glargine from other insulins [ 10]. 
Because biosimilar insulins have immunogenic potential, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA require an evaluation of safety and  immunogenicity between 
biosimilars and their reference products, and the EMA has indicated these studies should be of sufficient duration (at least 6 to 12  months) to detect these differences. This study is 
designed in accordance with the guidance documents provided by the EMA [11] and the 
FDA [ 12].

 The immunogenicity assessment will use the one- assay [ 13] and tiered approach [ 14]. 
Samples collected at all time points (including pre -dose) from both treatment groups will 
first be tested  using the validated electrochemiluminescence method [ 15]. The rate and 
degree of immunogenicity, and data interpretation will also include consideration of other 
clinical attributes such as (but not limited to) symptoms of hypersensitivity or injection site reactions and the PK profile.

8.1 Overa
ll Study Design and Plan 
The purpose of this equivalence study is to compare the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy 
of Gan  & Lee Insulin G largine Injection with that of the reference medicinal product, 
Lantus®, in adul ts with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  
At the screening visit, subjects will sign the informed consent form (ICF), they will be 
screened  for eligibility, and the following information will be collected: adverse events, 
medical history (including diabetes melli tus and thyroid disease history), prior and 
concomitant medications, vital signs, height, body weight, and body mass index ( BMI ). The 
following procedures will be performed: 12- lead electrocardiog ram (ECG), physical 
examination, and blood collect ion for fa sting blood glucose (FBG)  test, HbA1 c, AIA, and 
routine hematology and chemistry testing (complete blood count, metabolic chemistry panel with serum lipids , thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], and free thyroxine [T4]). A 
urinalysis , and for women  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed. At this visit, the subject will be issued a glucometer, test strips, and other 
supplies, and the Investigator or designee will provide instruction and conduct training on how to use the glucometer for prospective glucose monitoring to document hypoglycemic episodes in a prospective manner . Subjects will b e allowed to keep the glucometer after the 
study, per local ethical and legal guidelines and regulations.
 Subjects will also receive a 
Hypoglycemic Events Record  in which they will record information about any hypoglycemic 
events that occur during their participation in the study.  
During the 2 weeks between screening and randomization, subjects will have their insulin 
dosing optimized according to Table 3 i n Section 8.5.8. 
Also , at the screenin
g visit , the subject will have a FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose 
Monitoring sensor  applied to the back of the upper arm according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Monitoring System is approved by the EMA  for people 
18 years of age or older with diabetes. The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring 
System sensor , which requires 12 to 24 hours to calibrate itself after application, will be 
worn for 8 days and will record the interstitial fluid glucose every 15 minutes.  Data from the 
2nd through the 8th days of wear will be used for each analysis.  The sensor will be blinded to 
the subject an d no subjec t action will be needed. The subject will also be issued a Mealtime 
& Insulin Dose Record in which they will record the time of their meals, and insulin use. After 8  days, the subject may remove the sensor, place in the biohazard bag provided and 
bring it with them to the randomiz ation visit. If the end of the 8-day continuous glucose 
monitoring ( CGM ) period coincides with the date of the randomization visit, the sensor can 
be removed at the visit. Subjects will bring both their Hypoglycemic Events Record and their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record to the randomization visit.  
Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be centrally randomized 1:1 in an open -

 but will substitute  IP for their basal  insulin. The Sponsor will ensure that all insulin s will be 
provided to all subjects regardless of medical insurance or reimbursement issues.   
At the randomization visit (Visit 2), subjects will receive supply of insulin kit s with IP  and 
the Investigator or designee will train subjects on all study procedures and proper dose 
administration.  
Subjects in both treatment groups wi ll be assessed every 2 weeks after Visit 2 ( randomization 
visit) through Week 22 ( telephone call ); and then at Week 26; they will attend a total of 
9 clinic visits (the screening visit, the randomization visit, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
and 26), 2 brief visits during which  a CGM sensor will be applied (8 -10 days before the visits 
at Weeks 12  and 26), and they will be contacted by telephone at Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. 
The Week 26 visit (Visit 9) will be the end-of- treatment  visit.  
At all planned visits and phone contacts (except for visits to apply a CGM sensor)  the 
Investigator or designee will review glucose results (especially looking for hypoglycemia), 
adverse events,  changes in concomitant medications, and changes in IP  or bolus insulin use, 
and the following procedures will be performed: vital signs, body weight, urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential, and an FBG test .  
Additional procedures at study visits are as follows: at Weeks 8, 16 and 26, blood for HbA1
c 
will be collected; during the visits at Weeks 12  and 26, subjects will wear their  CGM sensors 
to the site for the site staff to safely remove it, and they will bring their Mealtime & Insulin 
Dose Record  for the site staff to review , and blood will be collected for routine hematology 
and chemistry testing , TSH and free T4  and TSH ; at Weeks 12 and 26, blood will be 
collected for AIA; and at Week 26, a 12- lead ECG and physical examination will be 
performed.  
A subset of additionally consented subjects will have blood drawn at Day 1 and Weeks 2, 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20, and 26 for optional PK (insulin glargine, M1, and M2 concentrations). If a subject discontinues the study prematurely, site personnel will make a reasonable effort 
to perform all study activities sch eduled for Visit 9 (end of treatment [ EOT ] visit). 
Additionally, it is very important for site personnel to encourage subjects to visit the site at Week 26 (±  4 weeks) (and Week 12 ± 1 week if applicable) for a blood sample to be 
obtained for AIA and HbA1
c measurements.  
Figure 1 and Table 1 show the study design and study- related procedures, respectively.

Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
Page 34 of 77 No IP may be dispensed to any person not enrolled in the study. The Investigator or designee 
will count and reconcile drug supplies at the site before either returning them  to Gan & Lee 
Pharmaceuticals or designee at the end of the study. 
8.5.7 Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection Pen and the Lantus® SoloStar® 
The Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection pen and the Lantus® SoloStar® are disposable, 
multiple -dose, “dial and push”-type variable dose pens intended for the subcutaneous 
administration of insulin . The injector  pen and the drug product (in a 3.0-mL pre-filled glass 
cartridge) f orm a single integral product and will be used in conjunction with needles in a 
suitable range of s izes to be determined by the Investigator’s team. The 3- mL pre -filled glass 
cartridge contains 300 units of insulin and a maximum deliverable dose of 1 to 80 units with 
a dose increment of 1 unit. The Investigator or designee will train subjects regarding proper 
use and handling of the insulin pen injectors  for the study and instruct subjects to bring used 
insulin kits to clinic visits  when all the pens in a kit have been used. At the end-of- treatment  
visit, subjects will bring all used and unused kit s to the clinic.  
8.5.8 Dose Adjustments and D ose Escalation  
The Investigator  will de velop  each subj ect’s treatm ent plan and instruct t he subject r egard ing 
dosing of all their medications, including I P. During the 2-week pe riod between the 
screening and randomization visits, subjects will have their current b asal insulin dose 
optimized based on f
asting glucose results according to Table 3. Optimizing the dose before 
the randomiza
tion visit will reduce the need for dose adjustments during the study. Subjects 
will follow the instructions provided by the Investigator regarding any dose adjustments and 
other details re garding  the clinical managem ent of glucose and insul in.

 8.5.9 Initiating Therapy  
8.5.9.1  Switch ing from Other Insulins to Insulin Glargine  
When switching from a treatment regimen with an intermediate - or long-acting insulin to a 
regimen with insulin glargine, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required and 
the conc omitant treatment for diabetes may need to be adjusted (dose and timing of 
additional regular insulins or fast-acting insulin analogs ). 
8.5.9.2  Switch ing from Twice-Daily Isophane (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn [ NPH ]) 
Insulin to Insulin Glargine  
To reduce the risk of nocturnal and early morning hypoglycemia, subjects who are changing their basal insulin regimen from a twice -daily NPH insulin to a once- daily regimen with 
insulin glargine should reduce their daily dose of basal insulin by 20% to 30% during the first weeks of treatment.  
8.5.9.3  Hypoglycemia 
The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia may change with a change of insulin regimen, depending on the action profile of the insulins used. Because Lantus
® has a more sustained 
basal insulin supply, fewer nocturnal but more frequent early morning episodes of hypoglycemia can be expected. Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable for subjects in whom hypoglycemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as subjects with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycemia), and for subjects with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if they have not been treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycemia). 
Subject adherence to the prescribed medication, diet, and exercise regimens; correct insulin 
administration; and awareness of symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. If normal or decreased HbA1
c values are noted, the Investigator should 
consider the possibility of recurrent,  unrecognized (especially nocturnal) episodes of 
hypoglycemia. 
Investigators will advise each subject about circumstances in which warning symptoms of 
hypoglycemia may be different, diminished, or absent, and that hypoglycemia (and possible loss of consciousness) may occur before the subject is aware of any symptoms.  
Some factors that may increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia and require particularly close monitoring and possible dose adjustment include: 
• Markedly improved glycemic control after starting the study treatment 
• A known tendency to gradually develop hypoglycemia 
• Older subject age 
• Switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
• Autonomic neuropathy

 • A long history of diabetes 
• Psychiatric illness  
• A change in the site of injection from one body area to another  
• Conditions that may improve insulin sensitivity such as decreased stress 
• Unusual, increased, or prolonged physical activity 
• Intercurrent illness such as vomiting or diarrhea  
• Inadequate intake of food and/or liquids 
• Missed meals 
• Alcohol consumption 
• Uncompensated endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency  
• Concomitant medications that may enhance the blood glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycemia, such as angiotensin converting- enzyme 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfonamide antibiotics 
• Concomitant medications that block the sympathetic nervous system such as beta-blockers 
8.5.10 Previous and Concomitant Therapy  
Administration of concomitant medications must be reported in the appropriate section of the eCRF, with dosage information, dates of administration, and indication for use. Investigators and site staff should use generic names for concomitant medications if possible. All fields should be completed on the eCRF. See Appendix 3 ( Section 17.3)  for a list of allowed and 
prohibited concomitant medications. 
8.5.11 Treatment Compliance  
Investiga tors and site staff will review each subject’s treatment medication use at scheduled 
clinic visits and telephone calls, and at any interim clinic visits, and study treatment 
compliance will be assessed.  
8.5.12 Assignment to Treatment  
Randomization will be performed through IXRS. The Investigator or designee will access the IXRS to randomize enrolled subjects. The IXRS system will assign a unique randomization number and study medication kit number. Randomization will be stratified by country. No subject may be ran domized more than once, and no randomization number will be assigned 
to more than 1 subject.

 8.6 Study -Related Devices 
8.6.1 Glucometer , Test Strips, and Related Supplies  
At the screening  visit, each subject will be issued with a glucometer, test strips, and other 
supplies for use during the study to document hypoglycemic episodes in a prospective 
manner . The Investigator or qualified site staff will train each subject on the correct use of 
these supplies and any related procedures, and subjects can obtain  additional supplies as 
needed at subsequent study visits. Subjects will also be issued a Hypoglycemic Events 
Record  in which they will fully record information prospectively about any hypoglycemic 
event s. They will bring this record  to each study visit except those brief visits  for application 
of a CGM sensor. Subjects will be allowed to keep the glucometer after the study per local, 
ethical and legal guidelines and regulations. 
8.6.2 FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitori ng System is a glucose-monitoring device 
indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in persons (age 18 and older) with 
diabetes.  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monito ring System aids in understanding the 
person’s  glucose profile and detecting episodes of hyperglyc emia and hypoglyc emia.   
Interpretation of the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System readings will be based o n the trends and patterns analyzed through time using the reports available. 
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring S ystem consists of a sensor with an 
applicator, and reader that is used to start the sensor on the subject and gather the glucose data at the end of the CGM period. The s ensor has a small, flexible filament  that is ins erted 
just under the skin. The sensor can be worn for up to 14 days. Multiple subjects can have 
their sensor started by the same reader. Once applied, a sensor will measure and store the glucose readings every 15 minutes. Each site will have a single reader that will  be used for 
all their subjects . Readings from the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System 
will not be made available to subjects in real time and so they will continue performing 
glucose self -testing with the glucometer according to the Investigator’s instructions. The 
FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System will be used for data collection 
purposes only and will not be used to make treatment  decisions. The s ystem does n ot requir e 
any subject action . 
At the screening visit  and between 8 and 10 days before the visits at Weeks 12 and 26, 
subjects will attend a brief visit so the Investigator or designee can apply a CGM sensor to 
the back of the upper arm  according to the instructions in the FreeStyle Libre Pro User 
Guide. Subjects will also receive a Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record in which they will record the time of meals, and insulin doses for the 8-day CGM period. 
Eight days after the screening visit, the subject may rem ove the sensor and will bring it to the 
randomization visit; if the en d of the 8-day CGM period coincides with the date of the 
randomization visit, the sensor can be removed at the visit. Subjects will bring both their

 Hypoglycemic Events Record and their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record to the 
randomization visit.  
For the visits at Weeks 12  and 26, t he subject will have worn  the sensor  for the 8- day CGM 
period before the visit, and the site staff  will remove the sensor at the visit. The Investigator 
or designee will use the reader to retrieve the data from the sensor, and the 8-day M ealtime & 
Insulin Dose Record  will be collected and reviewed. The data from the sensor does not have 
to be uploaded at the time of the visit, but the Investigator will retain each subject’s sensor 
until it is  confirm ed the data have been successfully uploaded. Each sensor will be labeled 
with the subject and visit number and will be stored in a secure location until the end of the 
study after confirmation of successful upload . 
Investigators and staff will review  the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System 
warnings and limitations and instruct subjects about the need to avoid medications and conditions that could interfere with the results .

Page 46 of 77 10. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 
10.1 Pregnancy T
esting 
Subjects who are pregnant at screening or planning to become pregnant during the study will 
be excluded from participation in the study. All women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test at screening and at each clinic visit . Unless a female subject meets at 
least 1 of the following crite ria, she will be considered to be of childbearing potential:  
•Postmenopausal, defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without analternative medical cause
•Surgically or congenitally sterile
•Diagnosed as infertile and not undergoing treatment to res tore fertility
10.2 Physical Examination 
Physical examinations will be performed by a physician or delegate who must be listed on the 1572 as a sub-investigator. This responsibility should be documented on the Site Signature & Duty Delegation Log. The examination will include the following organs or 
organ systems : general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, skin, cardiovascular 
system, respiratory system, abdominal system and nervous system (including a neurological examination; with an assessment  of the reflexes, motor and sensory nerve assessment, 
sensory checks [extremities ] and mental status assessment).  
The examining physician or delegate completing the physical exam will document an 
assessment of normal or abnormal for each body system on the Physical Exam source document. Any abnormal finding deemed to be clinically relevant by the Investigator will be reported as an adverse event.  See Section  11.1 for more details about reporting adverse 
events.  
10.3 Vital Signs  and Body Weight 
Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure will be measured on the same arm (preferentially on the left arm) after the subject has been in a supine/sitting  position for 
5 minutes. Pulse will be recorded simultaneously with blood pressure measurements.  
Body weight (kg) will be measured without shoes or jacket. Height will be recorded at 
screening to calculate BMI . 
During the study, the Investigator may repeat vital signs for safety reasons. Clinically relevant abnormal findings will be reported as adverse events. 
10.4 Electrocardiogram  
Computerized 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained, after the subject has been supine for 
5 minutes. Each lead will be recorded for at least 3 -5 beats at a speed of 25 mm/sec paper 
speed and 10 mm/mV amplitude. At a minimum, heart rate, P, PR, QRS, QT and corrected 
Protocol No. GL-G LAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
Page 47 of 77 QT intervals (msec) will be recorded from the 12 -lead ECG. A copy of all ECGs will be 
retained on site and these may be collected for central review if required (i.e., in case 
emerging ECG data necessitate expert evaluation).  
For the purposes of screening, the Investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG 
is normal or abnormal, and if abnormal, whether the abnormality will exclude the subject from participating in the stud y. 
Investigators may repeat ECGs for quality or safety reasons. Any abnormal finding deemed to be clinically relevant by the Investigator will be reported as an adverse event . Subjects 
with clinically relevant cardiovascular side effects or adverse events, or clinically relevant ECG changes must be withdrawn from the study (see Section  8.4.3).  
10.5 Clinical Laboratory Testing  
The following routine clinical laboratory tests will be performed as indicated in  Table 1 and 
Section 9. 
•Complete blood count (red blood cell [ RBC] count, white blood cell [WBC] count,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, RBC indices, and a 5 -part WBC  differential 
[percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils])  
•Chemistry metabolic panel, including glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen,
sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate , calcium, total prote in, total and conjugated 
bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatine kinase

Page 48 of 77 11. SAFETY M EASUREMENTS AND VARIABLES 
11.1 Adverse Events 
Th
e definitions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply with the current 
CFR 21 Part 312. An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing condition, regardless of  the relationship  to the investig ational med icinal product. 
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product.  
Adverse events will be recorded beginning at the screening visit. Nonserious adverse events 
will be recorded from the time informed consent is signed through the subject’s last study visit (or termination if the subject terminates early from the study for any reason). Serious 
adverse events will be collected from the time informed consent is signed through and including 30 calendar days after the last dose of treatment with IP. 
The Invest igator or designee will record all adverse event s on the eCRF, regardless of the 
Investigator’s assessment of causality, including a description of the event, severity, time of 
occurrence, duration, any action (e.g., treatment and follow-up tests), the event outcome, and the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship to the study treatment . 
11.2 Serious Adverse Events   
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that meets any of the 
following criteria: 
•results in death
•is life -threat ening (refers to events during which a subject was actually at risk of death,
and not to events that might have become life -threatening if they had occurred in a more
severe form or if the subject had not received treatment)
•requires hospitalization or causes prolongation of exi sting inpatient hospitalization
•results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
•is a congenital abnormality/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject
•is an important medical event  that does not meet any of the a bove criteria  but may require
medical intervention to prevent the outcomes listed above, or is considered important by
the Investigator; examples of important medical events include:
oBronchospasm requiring treatment in the emergency department or athome
oDevelopment of a blood dyscrasia
oDiagnosis of a substance use disorder

 11.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest is a noteworthy serious or nonserious event that a 
sponsor may want to carefully monitor because it might be a potential precursor or prodrome for a more serious condition in susceptible individuals. In this study, hypoglycemia will be monitored as an adverse event of special interest. When an adverse event of hypoglycemia is entered into the electronic data capture system, the system will prompt the user to  provide 
additional information. 
11.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to PRA 
In addition to completing all eCRFs related to serious adverse events, the Investigator or 
designee must report all serious adverse events to PRA Drug Safety within 24 hours after 
learning about the event, even if the information is incomplete.

 Investigators will su bmit follow -up reports for serious adverse events whenever additional 
pertinen t information becomes available and will provide copies of all pertinent documents 
such as hospital records, admission and discharge summaries, surgical records, laboratory 
reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable. Monitoring of Subjects with Adverse Events. 
11.5 Monitoring of Subjects with Adverse Events 
Each subject must be carefully monitored for adverse events, including clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory test results, physical examination findings, and ECG results. At each study visit or communication, the Investigator or designee will ask subjects about any new symptoms or worsening of baseline symptoms that could indicate an adverse event .  
11.5.1 Abnormal Laboratory Test Results 
Changes or abnormalities in clinical laboratory results judged to be clinically significant by the Investigator will be recorded as adverse events. If an unexplained abnormal laboratory 
test result occurs, the Investigator or designee will promptly repeat the test and monitor the subject until th e result has returned to the normal range or an adequate explanation of the 
abnormality is found. 
11.5.2 Abnormal Physical Examination Findings  or ECG Changes  
Changes or abnormalities in physical examination findings or ECGs judged to be clinically 
significant by the Investigator will be recorded as adverse events. 
11.6 Overdose of Study Medication  
Any overdose of the study medication, with or without associated adverse events, must be 
reported to PRA Drug Safety. Overdose will be reported in the e CRF. All reports of 
overdoses m ust be filed in the Study Center File. Any adverse event  associated with the 
overdose will be reported on relevant adverse event /serious adverse event  sections in the 
eCRF.   
Investigators will instruct subjects how to manage the dose of their stu dy medication and 
other medications for diabetes, and procedures to be followed if an overdose occurs. Subjects will be instructed to seek medical assistance immediately if they experience an overdose of study medication and to notify the Investigator as s oon as feasible.  
11.7 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless the Investigator suspects an IP 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. However, any

 pregnancy during the study and the outcome of the pregnancy (spontaneous miscarriage, 
elective termination, normal birth or congenital anomaly) must be reported to PRA.  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, she will discontinue IP immediately and 
report th e pregnancy to the Investigator. The su bject will attend an end-of- treatment  visit and 
should be followed by the Investigator through childbirth or termination of the pregnancy. 
The Inve stigator will submit an initial report upon learning of the pregnancy, and a follow-up 
form when the outcome of the pregnancy is known. If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, the subject may continue in the study, but the pregnancy should be reported in the same manner as described above. Any congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject will be reported as a serious adverse event. Investigators should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise.

The data management
 and statistical analysis of this study will be performed by PRA He alth 
Sciences.  
12.1 Data Management 
An e lectronic clinical database (Medidata Solutions) will be us ed and a Data Management 
Plan will be prepared by PRA Health Sciences.  
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the latest available WHO Drug 
Reference Dictio nary. Coexistent diseases and adverse events will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA).  
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be locked. Any changes to the database after that time can be made only by written agreement 
between Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals USA and PRA Health Sciences.  
12.2 Sample Size Estimation  
Enrollment is planned for 550 subjects overall (275 subjects per treatment group). The 
primary a nalysis f or imm unogenicity will be an equivalence test us ing the 2 one- sided t ests 
(TOST) a pproach with α=0.05. This sample size was chosen to achieve ove r 80% power on 
the equivalence test of proportion of subjects unde r the margins dependent on the observed 
treatment-induced AIA rate. For example, a sample size of 550 will provide approximately 
85% power on the equivalence test of proportion of subjects with treatment-induced AIA 
using an event rate of 30% and a margin of 12% (Table 4 ). The treatment-induced AIA is 
defined as newly c
onfirmed positive AIA development or important (at least a 4-fold) 
increase in AIA titers, after baseline and up to visit Week 26. For this sample size of 550, no 
drop outs are considered in the calculation. Subjects will be encouraged to come back for 
assessments even i f they ha ve discontinued t r eatment  early. 
The similarity margin, based on the actual observed event rate for the intended reference 
product, will be used for final analysis after 
database lo ck as summarized in Table 4. Linear 
interpolation will be used for values between AIA rates in the table.

12.3 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and finalized prior to any lock of the study 
database. The SAP will provide a detailed description of the statistical methods and expand on the details provided in the protocol. Additional analyses may be added. Table, listing , and 
figures shells will also be provided. 
12.4 Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Gan & Lee Insulin G largine  Injection  or 
Lantus
® treatment.  Subject randomization w ill be stratified by country.   
Registration and randomization w ill take place using a centralized IXRS. At registration, the 
IXRS will assign a unique subject identification number that will be used on all of that 
subject’s eCRFs and serious adverse event  report forms.  
The study is not blinded. However, to avoid the introduction of operational bias into final study results and to increase the interpretability and reliability of the data , certain roles of the 
Sponsor and study team will be blinded. Details will be provided in the Data Blinding and

Plan).  
12.5 Analysis Sets  
12.5.1 Safety Analysis Set  
The Safety Analysis Set is composed  of all randomized subjects who receive any IP , even a 
partial dose  (Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection or Lan tus®). Subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment they actually received. All safety and 
immunogenicity endpoints will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. 
12.5.2 Full Analysis  Set  
The Full  Analysis Set (FAS) is composed  of all randomized subjects. Subjects in the FAS 
will be grouped according to planned treatment. All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed 
using the FAS based on the subject’s randomized treatment.  
12.5.3 Per Protocol Set 
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set is compo sed of all randomized subjects who received at 
least 1  partial dose and do not have any important protocol deviations during the first 
26 weeks of the study. Subjects in the PP Analysis Set will be grouped according to actual treatment received. The PP Ana lysis Set will be used for sensitivity analyses of confirmed 
positive AIA and HbA1c and demography summary. 
12.5.4 PK Analysis Set  
The PK Analysis Set is composed of all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 partial 
dose and provide at least 1 pre- dose assessment that is sufficient to derive plasma 
concentration of insulin glargine, M1, or M2. Subjects in the PK analysis set will be grouped according to the treatment they actually received.  
12.6 Statistical Methods  
In general, categorical variables will be summari zed using counts and percentages. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations (n), mean, and standard  deviation, median, minimum 25
th and 75th percentiles, and maximum. All 
summaries will be presented by treatment groups as wel l as the total.  All statistical analyses 
will be performed using SAS®. The SAS® version number will be noted in the SAP.

Additional sensitivity analyses on the imputation, which  explore the limitation(s) of the data 
or assumption(s) of the primary analysis being evaluated in each sensitiv ity analysis and how 
the analysis addresses each, will also be discussed in the SAP . 
Protocol No. GL-G LAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
Page 56 of 77 Missing data will be imputed for the HbA1 c analysis. The robustness of the imputation will 
be explored via sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation and including a tipping point 
analysis. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure will be presented in the SAP . 
12.6.2 Demographic and Baseline Data 
Demographic information and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the FAS, 
Safety Analysis Set, and PP Set. Descriptive statistics will be provided for age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body we ight, height, and BMI.  
Medical history conditions will be coded using most current version of MedDRA at time of database lock. The number and percentage of subjects with each medical history term  will be 
summarized by  MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.  
12.6.3 Subject Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects screened, randomized and treated in the study will be presented, together with the number and percentage of subjects who withdrew from the study prematurely, with a breakdown of the corresponding reasons for withdrawal. 
A tabulation of the number and percentage of subjects randomized in each country and center will be presented.  
12.7 Primary Endpoint  
12.7.1  Incidence of  Treatment -Induced Anti - Insulin A ntibodies 
The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be an equivalence test using the TOST 
approach with α=0.05 which is algebraically equivalent to comparing the li mits of the 90% 
confidence int erval (CI) for treatment - induced AIA development via a test of  difference in  
proportions based on normal approximation (-margin, +margin) where the margin is 
dependent on the observed treatment-induced AIA rate in Lantus® and is defined in Table 4. 
The est
imand  
of interest for  the primary immunogenicity analysis is the differ ence in 
treatment-induced immunogenicity r ates regardless if a ll subjects tol erate or  adhere to s tudy 
treatment  or re
ceive  other insulin tre atments. Intercurrent events w ill be  handled a ccording  to 
the treatment pol
icy 
strategy.  Treatment Policy s tra tegy is de fined a s the s trategy  that 
consi
ders “The
 occurrence of  the intercurrent  event is irrelevant:  the value for  the variable of  
interest is used 
regardless of  whether or  not the intercurrent  event occurs” (See I CH E9 R1 
addendum [17]). 
Sensitivity ana l
yses including worst- case imputation and using a ‘Composite Strategy’ will 
be conducted.

 12.8 Key Secondary Endpoint  
12.8.1 Change from Baseline in HbA1 c at 26 Weeks 
The key secondary analysis will be to evaluate equivalence (FDA)/noninferiority(EMA) of 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection relative to Lantus® for HbA1 c by comparing the 90% 
confidence interval with (-0.4%, 0.4%) for equivalence using the TOST approach and by comparing the upper limit of the 95% CI with 0.4% for noninferiority from a pattern mixture model that uses multiple imputation analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with 
treatmen
t and stratification factor of country included as fixed effects and baseline HbA1 c 
included as a covariate. Separately in each treatment group, the imputation wil l use the 
outcomes of patients who completed the study (including subjects who discontinued treatment but provided a visit Week 26 HbA1c sample)
 to impute outcomes in patients 
without actual visit Week 26 recorded results under the missing at random assumption. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure will be specified in the SAP. Analysis of HbA1
c 
will follow a hierarchical testing strategy: first, equivalence/noninferiority  will be tested with 
a margin of 0.4%; secondly, if and only if the test using a margin of 0.4% is significant, then equivalence will be tested using a margin of 0.3%. Analyses of HbA1
c in the testing 
hierarchy will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set consisting of all randomized subjects according to randomized treatment with  supportive analyses on the Per Protocol Analysis 
Set. A tipping point analysis with varying assumptions about the differences on each treatment arm between outcomes in patients who withdrew from the study early and outcomes in patients who completed the study will be performed. The estimand of interest for the HbA1
c analysis is the difference in change from baseline for HbA1c using the 
“treatment policy strategy” . 
12.9 Other Secondary Endpoints  
12.9.1 Immunogenicity  
12.9.1.1 Subjects with Negative Anti-I nsulin Antibodies at Ba seline Who  Develop 
Confirmed Anti-I nsulin Antibodies

develop confirmed positive AIA after baseline and up to visit Week 26 will be compared 
using a normal test of difference in proportions.  
12.9.1.2 Subjects with a 4 -fold Increase in Titers 
The percentage of subjects in each treatment group with confirmed positive AIA at baseline 
who have at least a 4 -fold increase in titers after baseline and up to visit Week  26 will be 
compared using an exact test of difference in proportions.

Page 60 of 77 13. MONITORING PROCEDURES ( QUALITY ASSURANCE)  
The Sponsor has et
hical, legal, and scientific obligations to conduct this study in accordance 
with established research principles and ICH GCP guidelines. To fulfill these obligations and 
to stay  apprised  of study progress, the Sponsor's monitors or representatives will visit the 
investigative sites during study conduct, in addition to maintaining telephone and written 
communication. On-site visits, telephone calls, and regular inspection of the e CRFs will be 
conducted  to assess subject enrol lment, compliance with protocol procedures, completeness 
and accuracy of data entered on the eCRFs, verification of e CRF data against original source 
documents, and occurrence of adverse events. The Investigator must provide the monitor with full access to all source and study documents.  
13.1 Risk and Quality Tolerance Limits and Routine Monitoring  
Sponsor assigned monitors will conduct regular site visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring various aspects of the study. The Investigator must agree to Sponsor-authorized personnel having direct access to the clinical (or associated) files and clinical study supplies (dispensing and storage areas) for all study subjects considered for 
study entry for the purpose of verifying entries made in the e CRF s, and assist with their 
activities, if requested. Adequate time and space for monitoring visits should be made available by the Investigator. 
The site must complete the eCRFs in a timely manner and on an ongoing bas is to allow 
regular review by the study monitor. Perceived risks and quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be identified and documented before 
the start of the study. 
The Sponsor will review risk control measures periodically to ascertain whether the 
implem ented quality management activities remain effective and relevant. The quality 
management approach and any important deviations from the predefined QTLs (and remedial 
actions adopted) will be described in the clinical study report. 
13.2 Inspections and Auditing  Procedures 
The Sponsor or its representative may conduct audits at the investigative sites including, but 
not limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, and comparison of e CRFs with source documents. All medical  records (progress notes) must 
be available for audit. The Investigator agrees to participate with audits conducted at a convenient time in a reasonable manner.

14.1 Electronic C
ase Report Forms 
Electronic CRF s will be used to store and transmit subject  information. The file structure and  
format for the eCRF will be provided by the Sponsor or their representative and should be 
handled in accordance with the instructions provided. 
The eCRF s must be reviewed, electronically signed, and dated by the Investigator. 
Access to  eCRF s will be stric tly password- protected and limited to personnel directly 
participating in the study. Data should be entered into the eCRF completely by the examining 
personnel or the study coordinator. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after any subject  evalu ation or communication. If data is to be changed due to erroneous input or 
other reason, an electronic audit trail will track these changes. The eCRFs and computers that store them must be accessible to study monitors and other regulatory auditors. 
14.2 Data Co llection  
During each study visit or telephone contact, the Investigator or designee will maintain 
progress notes in the subject’s medical records to document all significant observations. At a minimum, these notes will contain: 
•The date of the visit and the corresponding week  or visi t number in the study schedule
•The subject’s g eneral condition and status remarks by the subject , including any
significant  medical findings. The severity, frequency, duration, and resolution of any
reported adverse event , and t he Investigator's assessment as t o whether or not the
reported event is IP -related
•Changes in concomitant medications or dosages
•A general reference to the procedures completed
•The signature or initials of all physicians and other qualified medical designe es making
an entry in the medical record (or electronic equivalent)
In addition, any contact with the subject  via telephone or other means that provides 
significant clinical information will also be documented in the medical record  as described 
above. 
14.3 Sour ce Documents Maintenance 
Source documents contain the results of original observations and activities of a clinical 
investigation. Source documents include, but are not limited to, medical records (progress notes), computer printouts, screening logs and recorded data from automated instruments.

 All source documents from this study will be maintained by the Investigator and made 
available for inspection by authorized persons. The original signed ICF  for each subject  shall 
be filed with records kept by the Investigator and a copy shall be given to the subject . 
14.4 Record Maintenance 
All data derived from the study will remain the property of Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals. 
Records must be retained in accordance with the current ICH Guidelines on GCP. All 
essential stu dy documents including records of subject s, source documents, e CRF s and IP  
inventory must be kept on file. 
US FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.62[c]) require that records and documents pertaining to 
the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including e CRF s, 
consent forms, laboratory test results, and medical inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for 2 years after marketing application approval. If no application is filed, these records must be kept 2 year s after the investigation is discontinued and the US 
FDA and the applicable national and local health authorities are notified. The Sponsor or their representative will notify the Principal Investigator of these events.  
Essential documents shoul d be retain ed until at least 2  years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or until a t least 2  years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of IPs . However, essential documents may be 
retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the Sponsor. The Sponsor is responsible for informing the Investigator when these docu ments need no longer be retained. 
The Investigator will not dispose of any records relevant to this study without written permission from the Sponsor and will provide the Sponsor the opportunity to collect such records. The Investigator shall take responsi bility for maintaining adequate and accurate hard 
copy source documents of all observations and data generated during this study. Such documentation is subject  to inspection by the Sponsor, its representatives and regulatory 
authorities.  
If an Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires , the responsibility for 
maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept responsibility. Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed by the Sponsor. 
14.5 Confidentiality  
All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subject’s state of 
health will be regarded as confidential. For disclosure of any such information, an agreement will be obtained in writing.  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity is maintained. On e CRF s and 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or the CRO, subject s must not be identified by 
name. Instead, subject s will be known only by the unique subject  number allocated to them 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
 
Page 64 of 77 
 to ensure confidentia lity on all stu dy documentation. The Investigator will keep a separate 
log of these codes. 
To comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure subject  safety, it may be 
necessary for the Sponsor and its representative, the CRO personnel, the local research 
review board, or the health authorities to review subjects’ medical records as they relate to 
this study. Only the subject’s unique number on the e CRF s will identify him/her, but their 
full names may be made known to a drug regulatory authority or other author ized 
government or health care officials, if necessary, and to personnel designated by the Sponsor. 
Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or the CRO (e.g., consent forms) will 
be maintained by the Investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary to allow monitoring by the Sponsor and the CRO, and auditing by regulatory authorities. No documents identifying subjects by name will leave the investigative site and subject  identity 
will remain confidential in all publications rela ted to the study.

Page 65 of 77 15. ADMINISTRATION PROCEDURES  
15.1 Regulatory Ap
proval 
Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals USA or their appointed agents will be responsible for ensuring 
that appropriate regulatory authority approvals are obtained, according to local country 
requirements.  
No subject  may enter the study until this approval has been obtained. A copy of the approval 
(where one is provided, according to local country requirements) will be provided to the Investigator and to the IRB(s)/IEC(s). 
15.2 Protocol Amendments  
In accordance w ith ICH E6 Guideline for GCP the Investigator should not implement any 
deviation from, or changes to the protocol without agreement by the Sponsor and 
documented approval from the IRB/IECs of a protocol amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an imm ediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the change(s) involves only 
logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor(s), change of 
telephone number(s)).  
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential 
amendment must be approved by the Sponsor. A written amendment must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IRB/IEC s assuming this responsibility. The 
Investigator must await IRB/IEC  approval of protocol amendments before implementing the 
changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to subjects. In these cases, the IRB/IEC  must be notified within 5 days of the change. 
All amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by both the appropri ate 
regulatory authorities and the IRB/IEC , except for administrative amendments, which require 
notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment will be distributed to all recipients of the original protocol, with instructions to append the amendment to the protocol. 
If, in the judgment of the local IRB/IEC , the Investigator and/or Sponsor, the protocol 
amendment alters the study design, procedures and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject , the currently approved written ICF  will require modification. The modified ICF must 
also be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor, appropriate regulatory authorities, and the IRB/IEC . In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained from subject s enrolled in 
the study before participation continues.

 15.3 Protocol Adherence and Deviations 
The Investigators and all staff involved with the study must read the protocol thoroughly and 
follow the instructions contained in it. However, exceptions will be made in emergency situations when the protection, safety, or well -being of the subject  requires immediate 
intervention based on the judgment of the Investigator or a responsible, appropriately trained, and credentialed professional(s) designated by the Investigator as a Sub-Investigator.  
In the event of a significant protocol deviation due to an emergency, accident, or error, the 
Investigator or designee must contact the Medical Monitor at the earliest possible time by telephone. This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to whether or not the subject  
should continue in the study. The Investigator, the Sponsor, and the Medical Monitor will document this decision. 
15.4 Publication Policy  
After completion of the study, the Investigator(s) may prepare a joint publication with the 
Sponsor. The Investigator(s) must undertake not to submit any part of the data from this protocol for publication without the prior consent of Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals USA. 
15.5 Clinical Study Report  
A final clinical study report will be prepared according to the ICH guideline on Structure and 
Contents of Clinical Study Reports. A final clinical study report will be prepared regardless of whether the study is completed or prematurely terminated. The Sponsor will provide each Investigator with a copy of the final report for retention.  
15.6 Contractual and Financial Details  
The Investigator (and/or, as appropriate, the hospital administrative representative) and the Sponsor will sign a clinical study agreement prior to the start of the study, outlining overall Sponsor and Investigator responsibilities in relation to the study. The contract should describe whether costs for pharmacy, laboratory and other protocol -required services are being paid 
directly or indirectly. Financial Disclosure Statements will need to be completed, as requested 
by FDA CFR 21 part 54. 
15.7 Insurance, Indemnity and Compensation 
Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals USA undertakes to maintain an appropriate clinical study 
insurance policy. 
Deviations from the study protocol - especially the prescription of a dose other than that 
scheduled in the study protocol, other modes of administration, other indications, and longer

 treatment periods - are not permitted and shall not be covered by the statutory subject  
insurance scheme.  
15.8 Discontinuation of the Study  
This study may be terminated by the Sponsor. Reasons for discontinuation of the study may 
include the following situations: 
• Unexpected, significant, or unacceptable safety risk to subjects enrolled in the study 
• Discontinuation of study drug development 
The study may also be t erminated prematurely if  both the Investigators and the Sponsor 
agree such action is in the best interests of subjects and  is justified on either medical or 
ethical grounds. Should early termination be necessary, subjects should stop taking the study 
medic ation immediately. Every documented effort should be made by the Investigator to 
ensure that the subject returns to the site as soon as possible to complete one final EOT visit. In terminating the study, Gan  & Lee  Pharmaceuticals USA, PRA,  and the Investigators will 
ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.  
The Investigator or the Sponsor depending on the local regulation will be responsible for informing IRBs/IECs of the early termination of the trial.  
15.9 Study Center File Management  
The Investigator is responsible for assuring that the Study Center File  is maintained in 
accordance with GCP standards.

 17 APPENDICES  
17.1 Appendix 1: Declaration of Helsinki 
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical  Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by the:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975  
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983  
41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 
48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000 53th WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
A. INTRODUCTION 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of et hical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  The Declaration is intended to be read as a 
whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of 
all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The  health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when  providing medical 
care.” 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimat ely must include studies involving 
human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be 
provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research  
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
 
Page 71 of 77 
 7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and  
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most i nterventions involve risks and burdens. 
9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human  subjects 
and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly  vulnerable and 
need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
B. PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, ani mal experimentation. 
The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may harm the environment. 
14. The design and performance of each research study involving hum an subjects must be 
clearly described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the 
ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest,  incentives for subjects and 
provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post -study 
access by study subjects to interventions identified  as beneficial in the study or access to 
other appropriate care or benefits.  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must  be 
independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
 
Page 72 of 77 
 consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to 
be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but  these must not be 
allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research  subjects set forth in this 
Declaration. The committee must have th e right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher 
must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information  about any 
serious adverse event s. No change to the protocol may be made without consideration and 
approval by the committee. 
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with 
the appropriate scientific training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy  
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician  or 
other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professional and never  the research 
subjects, even though they have given consent. 
17. Medical research involving a disadvantaged or vulnerable population or community is 
only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs and priorities of this  population 
or community and if there is a reasonable likelihood that this population or community stands to benefit from the results of the research.  
18. Every medical research study involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and communities involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or communities affected by the condition under investigation. 
19. Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment 
of the first subject.  
20. Physicians may not participate in a research study involving human subjects unless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians must immediately stop a study when the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results.  
21. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
22. Participation by competent individuals as subjects in medical research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no competent individual may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
23. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information and to minimize the impact of the study on their physical, mental and social integrity. 
24. In medical research involving competent human subjects, each potential subject must be 
adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of 
 
   Protocol No. GL-GLAT1-3001 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes  Amendment 3_25 April 2019 
 
Page 73 of 77 
 interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential  risks 
of the study and the discomfort it may entail, and any other relevant aspects of the study. The 
potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the  study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisa l. Special  attention should be 
given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the 
consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed. 
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must  normally 
seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where 
consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or wo uld pose a threat 
to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may  be done only after 
consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship  with the 
physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.  
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of bene fit for them unless it is  intended to promote the 
health of the population represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the research  entails only minimal risk and minimal 
burden. 
28. When a pote ntial research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to  
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition  to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s dissent  should be 
respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary cha racteristic of the  research population. In 
such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent  from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is available and if  the research cannot be delayed, 
the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics

Page 74 of 77 
 committee. Consent to remain in the  research should be obtained as soon as possible from the 
subject or a legally authorized  representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication 
of the results of research. Authors h ave a duty to make publicly available the results of their 
research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well  as positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH  
MEDICAL CARE 
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that  
the research is justified by its potentia l preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the 
physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not 
adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested  
against those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current  proven 
intervention exists; or 
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of 
placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for ex ample, 
access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in  a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient-physician relationship. 
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking ex pert advice, with informed consent from the patient 
or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating  suffering. Where 
possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

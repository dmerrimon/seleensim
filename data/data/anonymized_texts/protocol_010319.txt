 Scientific Background 
Approximately 795,000 Americans sustain a stroke each year, placing these individuals at risk 
for recurrent stroke. One goal of post -acute rehabilitation and medical management of stroke is 
to reduce the risk for recurrent strokes. Reducing the risk for re current stroke is routinely 
approached by promoting health behaviors that mitigate specific risk factors for stroke. Specific health behaviors that are important for managing these risk factors include adherence to 
medication routines, smoking cessation, a nd physical activity.  
 
Physical inactivity throughout the day can lead to cardiovascular risk factors for recurrent stroke. Prolonged time spent physically inactive, or sedentary, has been identified as a distinct risk factor for poor metabolic control, we ight management, and all -cause mortality among adults, 
after controlling for time spent engaged in exercise. Sedentary time that is accumulated in prolong bouts with few sedentary breaks is associated with risks to cardio- metabolic health. 
Modifying sedent ary behavior patterns after stroke may, therefore, modify cardio- metabolic risk 
factors for recurrent stroke. Promoting participation in daily life activities frequently requires individuals to move out of a seated or reclined position and may support the modification of sedentary behavior patterns after stroke.  
 Subtle impairments in cognitive functions are common after stroke. These impairments can lead to difficulty monitoring one’s behavior to overcome barriers (e.g. balance impairments), and achieve participation -related goals after stroke. Difficulty monitoring and adjusting behavior, 
may lead to abandonment of daily life activities that require a high level of physical function (e.g. shopping at the grocery store) rather than identifying alternative  strategies to return to 
participation in that activity (e.g. pushing the cart and planning short trips to the grocery store). When daily life activities are abandoned, they may be replaced with sedentary behavior (e.g. watching television at home while a caregiver shops for groceries).  
 Behavioral activation is an intervention approach that provides explicit structure for self -
monitoring behavior. Behavioral activation approaches have been applied among clients with depression, dementia, brain injury, and stroke. Improvements in mood and cognitive functions and reduction in disability have been associated with behavioral activation interventions. We designed an intervention based in behavioral activation to provide explicit structure for monitoring and adjusting behavior to achieve participation in daily life activities that may break up sedentary time after stroke. Our intervention, the Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement (ABLE) intervention, applies activity scheduling and monitoring and collaborati ve 
problem solving to client -selected goals. The ABLE intervention holds promise to promote 
participation in daily life activities at scheduled times throughout the day to break up long bouts of sedentary time.
 
 
Study Objectives  
The purpose of this research study is to assess the feasibility and estimate the effects of a 
behavioral intervention (the Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement intervention, ABLE) 
on sedentary behavior after stroke.  
 
Page 3 of 7 
 Research Question:  What are the effects (sedentary behavior, participation levels) of the ABLE 
interven tion in the chronic stroke population at post -intervention (week 10) and follow -up (week 
18)? 
HYPOTHESIS A: The ABLE intervention will be associated with less sedentary time 
accumulated in prolonged bouts over time (ActivPAL).  
HYPOTHESIS B: The ABLE intervention will be associated with a greater number of sedentary 
breaks over time (ActivPAL).  
HYPOTHESIS D: The ABLE intervention will be associated with greater participation over time 
(Stroke Impact Scale- Participation Subscale ). 
 
Study Design & Methods  
The study is a single -group quasi -experimental study that will estimate within -group effects of 
the ABLE intervention on sedentary behavior. All assessment at intervention procedures will be 
completed by trained research staff (research assistants, interventionists) with supervision provided by the principal investigator.  
 
Screening Procedures:  
Participants who verbalize interest in the ABLE s tudy over the telephone will be asked to answer 
questions over the phone regarding their medical history, age, mobility, daily activities 
(Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire), and location of residence. These questions will determine initial eligibility.  
 If, based on telephone screening, participants are eligible and continue to indicate interest, an in-
person session will be scheduled to review the full informed consent. This session will be completed in the participant's home. After participants have completed the informed consent process, we will complete standardized clinical assessments (PRIME -MD/MINI, Patient Health 
Questionnaire -9) to determine eligibility. Participants will complete the PRIME -MD/MINI and 
Patient Health Questionnaire -9 to screen for mood. These are valid and reliable screening 
measures (Gilbody et al., 2007; Kroenke, et al., 2002; Spitzer et al., 1999).  
 
Baseline Assessment Procedures:  
Participants who provide informed consent, complete screening procedures, and are found to be 
eligible  based on our eligibility criteria will then complete Baseline 1.  
 
BASELINE 1 ASSESSMENTS  
 
Demographic (age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, vocation, pre -stroke residential status and 
social support), medical (stroke etiology and date of onset, co -morbidities, medications), and 
rehabilitation history (type and duration) will be gathered via participant interview and medical 
record review.  
 
Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire is a participant -reported measure of 
comorbidities. Participants  are asked to report on the presence or absence of specific chronic 
diseases, if they receive treatment for the disease, and if the disease interferes with their daily life 
activities.  
 
Page 4 of 7 
 The Stroke Impact Scale- Participation Subscale  is a valid and reliable measure of self -reported 
engagement in community activities. Participants are asked to rate the degree to which they feel 
restricted in 10 types of participation on a 1 to 5 Likert -type scale. Scores are summed and 
converted to a 0 to 100 scale where 100 indicates no participation restrictions.  
 
ActivPAL(TM) monitors will be used to assess sedentary behavior and step count over 7 days. 
The ActivPAL is a small, lightweight monitor that quantifies time spent in sitting, reclined, 
standing, and stepping. The participant will be provided the "ActivPAL Guide" as a reference 
guide. We will follow a 24 -hour wear protocol in which the participants will wear the device on 
their thigh for 7 days. During the BASELINE 1 assessment session, the researcher will train the  
participant on appropriate care and use of the device. The ActivPAL will be waterproofed and 
fastened to the individual's thigh using a non- latex, gentle adhesive (Tegaderm).  Participants will 
also be asked to record their bedtime and waking time in the " ActivPAL Diary". Sedentary 
bouts, sedentary breaks, and steps per day will be assessed using the ActivPAL monitor.  
 
BASELINE 2 ASSESSMENTS  
 
BASELINE 2 assessments will be conducted after a 4 -week delay. Due to the nature of our 7-
day ActivPAL(TM) monitoring, BASELINE 1 occurs during week 1 of the study. The 4 -week 
delay is a time period that we dose -matched to the intervention period, in which there is no 
intervention and no activity monitoring occurs. This occurs during weeks 2- 5 of the study. 
BAS ELINE 2 assessments described below will occur during week 6 of the study. 
Questionnaires will be asked over the telephone, and a researcher will meet the participant at 
their home to initiate one week of ActivPAL(TM) monitoring as described below. (Estima ted 
participant time: 60 minutes)

restricted in 10 types of participation on a 1 to 5 Likert -type scale. Scores are summed and 
converted to a 0 to 100 scale where 100 indicates no participation restrictions.  
ABLE Intervention Procedures  
 
Once participants have completed baseline testing procedures, they will participate in up to 12 
intervention sessions. These sessions will be delivered by a rehabilitation professional who has 
experience in stroke rehabilitation. Each intervention session wil l last approximately 45 minutes. 
Page 5 of 7 
 The sessions will occur at the participant's home or at a participant -preferred location in the 
community.  
 
ABLE INTERVENTION: Intervention sessions may be video recorded. During the first 
intervention session, the participant will describe a typical weekday, Saturday, and Sunday 
through a semi -structured interview and the "Intervention: Daily Schedule Worksheet." During 
this process, the therapist will ask the participant to identify portions of the day in which they 
spend prolonged amounts of time in a seated position. Participants will be oriented to the 
importance of breaking up sitting time into shortened bouts throughout the day using 
participation in meaningful daily life activities. Participants will then complete the  Activity Card 
Sort to identify meaningful daily life activities that could be incorporated throughout the day and 
week to break up prolonged sedentary time. These activities will be documented in the 
participant's workbook.  
 
Subsequent intervention sessions will focus on scheduling and monitoring participation in daily 
life activities during times of the day or during activities in which prolonged bouts of sitting time 
were identified. The sessions will focus around specific time periods that were identifi ed (e.g. 
every day after lunch, the participant spends 3 hours seated in the recliner) or specific activities 
in which the participant identifies prolonged sitting time (e.g. while watching television). The 
participant will select an activity and the thera pist will collaborate with the participant to identify 
strategies for using this activity to break up prolonged seated time. The participant will use a 
worksheet to schedule the activities and develop a plan for self -monitoring. During the following 
interv ention sessions, the therapist and participant will review the planned schedule and identify 
successes and barriers to these activities. The participant and therapist will collaboratively 
generate solutions to identified barriers and a revised plan will be  established.  
 
The intervention therapist will document intervention sessions on the "Intervention: Session 
Notes" document.  
 
After completion of 12 intervention sessions, participants will complete post -intervention 
assessments and activity monitoring.  
 
Post-Intervention Assessment Procedures  
 
ActivPAL(TM) monitors will be used to assess sedentary behavior and step count over 7 days. 
Participants will be provided with the "ActivPAL Guide" as a reference guide. The ActivPAL is 
a small, lightweight monitor that quantifies time spent in sitting, reclined, standing, and stepping. 
We will follow a 24 -hour wear protocol in which the participants will wear the device on their 
thigh for 7 days. During the BASELINE 2 assessment session, the researcher will train the 
participant on appropriate care and use of the device. The ActivPAL will be waterproofed and 
fastened to the individual's thigh using a non- latex, gentle adhesive (Tegaderm).  Participants will 
also be asked to record their bedtime and waking time in the "ActivPAL Diary." Sedentary 
bouts, sedentary breaks, and steps per day will be assessed using the ActivPAL monitor.  
 
The following questionnaire will be conducted via the telephone:  
The Stroke Impact Scale- Participation Subscale  is a valid and reliable measure of self -reported

 engagement in community activities. Participants are asked to rate the degree to which they feel 
restricted in 10 types of participation on a 1 to 5 Likert -type scale. Scores are summed and 
converted to a 0 to 100 scale where 100 indi cates no participation restrictions.  
 
Follow -Up Assessment Procedures (8 weeks post -intervention)  
 
ActivPAL(TM) monitors will be used to assess sedentary behavior and step count over 7 days. 
Participants will be provided with the "ActivPAL Guide" as a reference. The ActivPAL is a 
small, lightweight monitor that quantifies time spent in sitting, reclined, standing, and stepping.

(Baseline to Week 18 ), ActivPAL  
3. Change in Participation (Baseline to Week 11 ), Stroke Impact Scale- Participation 
Subscale 
4. Change in Participation (Baseline to Week 18 ), Stroke Impact Scale- Participation 
Subscale 
 
PRELIMINARY DATA SCREENING:  
We will explore distributions of all descriptive and outcome variables to understand the variance 
and identify outliers in our data set. We will examine our data set to identify patterns of missing 
data and descriptive characteristics for whom data were mi ssing.  
 
PRIMARY AND EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES   
This study employs a delayed baseline design to allow assessment of baseline stability. We will 
examine stability on primary and secondary outcomes between baseline 1 (week 1) and baseline 
2 (week 6). We will then  compute a single mean baseline score for each participant using 
baseline 1 (week 1) and baseline 2 (week 6).  
 
We will then compute within -person change scores between baseline and post -intervention 
(week 11) and between baseline and follow -up (week 18). The group’s mean change score and 
standard deviation will be reported.

SOURCE OF SUPPORT: No support  
 
Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh are conducting  a research study  to see whether a 
new rehabilitation intervention, the Activating Behavior for Lasting Engagement (ABLE) 
intervention can help people to be more active in their daily life after stroke.  You are being 
asked to take part in this research study because you have had a stroke at least 6 months ago 
and less than 5 years  ago, and completed our init ial screening questions over the telephone. 
We will ask 25 people to participate in this research study.    
Study Screening:   
If you decide to take part in this research study, we will conduct in -
person screening, where we will ask you some questions about 
your current mood, psychiatric history, and current substance 
abuse . These tests will tell us if you are eligible for this st udy, and 
together they will take about 45 minutes.  
Study Procedures:  
If you are eligible , we will ask you to complete baseline 
assessments in two parts . Part 1  will occur right away. During Part 
1, we will ask you to complete some tests of your thinking and 
moving abilities, your arm function, and answer questions about 
your fatigue, pain, life satisfaction,  physical activity,  and daily 
activities. These tests will take  4 hours total, and may be  split into 
2 sessions. We may video record portions of this testing.   
We will also ask you to wear an ActivPAL monitor for 7 days . An 
ActivPAL is a small, flat monitor that measures the time you spend 
sitting, standing, and taking steps throughout the day. The ActivPAL 
will be waterproofed and fastened to the front of your thigh. You 
can wear the ActivPAL during all of your daily activities, including 
water activities. Before we apply the ActivPAL, we will check the 
sensation on the front of your thigh using a light touch screening 
test. During the time that yo u are wearing the ActivPAL, we will 
ask you to write down the time that you go to bed and the time 
that you wake up in the morning in a diary that we will provide.   
Part 2 will occur during week 5. During Part 2, we will ask you to 
wear an ActivPAL monitor  for 7 days , using the same procedure as in Part 1. We will also ask 
you to answer questions about your daily activities and your mood . The questions in Part 2 
will take approximately 30 minutes .  
After the tests, a rehabilitation professional  will meet wi th you  in person for 12 intervention 
sessions in your home .  Each session will last for approximately 45 minutes. During these 
sessions, the rehabilitation professional will ask you about your daily routines. Your therapist 
will work with you using the ABLE intervention. The ABLE intervention is a rehabilitation

treatment that involves scheduling meaningful activities throughout your day and problem 
solving to identify practical strategies to reduce prolonged amounts of time spent sitting. These 
sessions may be videotaped.   
We will ask you to complete some questionnaires about your perspectives on the treatment 
during the intervention sessions . These questions will take approximately 30 minu tes.  
At the end of your last intervention session, we will ask you wear the ActivPAL monitor for 7 
days and to answer questions about your daily activities and your mood .  This will take 
approximately 60 minutes.  
We will follow up with you 8 weeks later . At that time, we will ask you to wear the ActivPAL 
monitor for 7 days  and to answer questions about your activities , pain, fatigue, outlook on life,  
and your mood. We will also share some of your ActivPAL data with you and ask you to discuss 
your activitie s during times of the week or day when you spent the most time sitting, standing, 
or stepping. In total, the follow -up activities  will take approximately 90 minutes.  
If you were involved in the Adapting Daily Activity Performance Through Strategy Training 
(ADAPTS) research study through the Occupational Therapy Department at the University of 
Pittsburgh, we are asking your permission to collect your cognitive test resu lts from that study 
to use in our analyses for this study. This will prevent you from needing to repeat several of the 
tests during baseline 1.  
As part of this study, we are requesting your authorization or permission to review your 
medical records . We will obtain past, current and future demographic (age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, education, vocation, pr e-stroke residential status, social support), medical (stroke 
etiology and onset, co -morbidities, medications) and rehabilitation history (type and du ration , 
documented impairments ). We will also gather information about the size and location of your 
stroke from imaging results. This information will be used to help us learn about your stroke 
and rehabilitation. As part of this research study, some info rmation that we obtain from you 
may be placed into your medical records. If we identify previously undiagnosed conditions that 
may benefit from treatment, we will notify you and request permission to notify your primary 
care physician. In this case, testin g results may be placed into your medical record.  
Identifiable medical record information will be made available to members of the research 
team for an indefinite period of time. Your de -identified medical information, as well as 
information obtained duri ng this research study, may be shared with other researchers in the 
future. We will protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your records , as described in 
this document, but cannot guarantee the confidentiality of your research records, including 
information obtained from your medical records, once your personal information is disclosed to 
others outside UPMC or the University. This authorization is valid for an indefinite period of 
time. However, you can always withdraw your authorization to allow t he research team to 
review your medical records  by contacting the investigators listed on the first page and making 
the request in writing. If you do so, you will no longer be permitted to participate in this study. 
Any information obtained from you up to that point will continue to be used by the research

team. The possible risks and discomforts of this research study include the possibility that you 
may become frustrated, upset, tired  during the testing and the treatment  sessions. If this 
happens, you wil l be allowed to take a break or stop the testing. There is also the risk that 
information about you may be seen by someone who is not part of the research team . We will 
make every effort to ensure that your information is protected , so that only authorized  persons 
can see your informati on. T here is a possibility that you may experience a fall or injury during 
the testing and the treatment  sessions. A trained rehabilitation professional will be present 
during the testing and the treatment  sessions. If you do  experience a fall or injury, you will 
receive treatment through UPMC.  Finally, there is a possibility that you may experience skin 
irritation from adhesive used to fasten the ActivPAL monitor to your leg. If skin irritation occurs, 
you will be able to rem ove the ActivPAL monitor and we will work with you to identify 
alternative strategies for fastening the ActivPAL to your leg.   
If you believe that the research procedures have resulted in an injury to you, immediately 
contact the Principal Investigator who  is listed on the first page of this form. Emergency medical 
treatment for injuries solely and directly related to your participation in this research study will 
be provided to you by the hospitals of UPMC. Your insurance provider may be billed for the 
costs of this emergency treatment, but none of those costs will be charged directly to you. If 
your research -related injury requires medical care beyond this emergency treatment, you will 
be responsible for the costs of this follow -up care. At this time, ther e is no plan for any 
additional financial compensation.  
You may benefit by participating in the treatment  sessions with the rehabilitation professional  
but there is no guarantee that this will help you . We hope to learn whether this intervention is 
effective to help people return to an active lifestyle after a stroke.  
If we learn about any new risks that may cause you to change your mind about continuing to 
participate, we will let you know.  
Neither you, nor your insurance provider, will be charged for any of the procedures performed 
for the purpose of this research study. You will be charged, in the standard manner, for any 
procedures performed for your routine medical and rehabilitation care (i.e., doctor or medical 
visits, treatmen ts, and all other tests and procedures including laboratory tests and imaging 
that you would normally have as part of your regular medical care).  
You will be paid $25 for each completed assessment time -point (Baseline part 1, Baseline part 
2, Post -interven tion, 8 -week follow -up). We will ask some participants to complete only 
Baseline part 1, Post -intervention, and 8 -week follow -up. Thus, you may be paid $75 or $100 
for participating in this study. If you do not complete the full study, you will be paid $25  for 
each completed assessment time point.  
Any information about you obtained from this research will be kept as confidential (private) 
as possible.  Research records, including the video, will be stored in a locked file cabinet or in 
password -protected com puter databases, and you will not be identified by name in any 
publication of the research results unless you sign a separate consent form giving your

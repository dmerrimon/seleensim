Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24of 1852 INTRODUCTION -CORE
This is a modular, Phase II study of capivasert ib in patients with R/R B -cell NHL. The 
structure of the CSP also fo llows a m odular design wi th the protocol , hereafter referred to as 
the ‘Core Protocol ’, present ing study  informat ion applicable to all pat ients in this study , and 
‘Modul es’ presenting only  module -specif ic information.
2.1 Study Rationale
Non-Hodgkin lympho ma is the 7thmost commo n cancer in the US and represents 4.3% of all 
new cancer cases in the US. In 2020, it is est imated that there will be 77,420 new cases of 
NHL, wi th a median age at di agnosis of 67 years, and an est imated 19,940 deaths related to 
this disease ( Howlader et al  2020 ).
AKT is a node of mult iple signalling pathways promot ing tumorigenesis, inhibit ing apoptosis, 
impact ing the cell cycle, and promoting invasio n and migrat ion. Capivasert ib (AZD5363) is a 
poten t, select ive inhibitor of the kinase act ivity of all 3isoforms of AKT (AKT1, AKT2, and 
AKT3) that is administered orally  on an intermi ttent schedule of administration. An est imated 
900patients wi th solid tum ours have received capivasertib in AstraZeneca sponsored studies, 
as monotherapy  or in combinat ion with other anti -cancer agents (refer to the current 
capivasert ib IB) showing a manageable safet y profile and promising efficacy data. 
Capivasert ib is targeting a different node on the PI3K -AKT -TOR signal ling pathway to the 
established PI3K inhibitors that have proven efficacy in lympho ma (and current ly approved 
for R/R FL) and has shown already promising efficacy  data in soli d tum ours.
Limited preclinical models are available for studying the effect of ca pivasertib in indol ent 
lympho ma either in vitro or in vivo. In an extended cell panel, capivasert ib monotherapy  
demonstrated in vitro activit y in lympho ma lines representative of MCL  and DLBCL  at a 
concentration less than 1 µM ( Lync h et al  2016 ). In vitro, capivasertib mo notherapy  shows 
variable inhibit ion of MCL  cell line growth. It shows 100% tumour growth inhibit ion in 2 out 
of 7MCL  cell lines (Granta -519, JVM -2) at 3 µM and 50% inhibit ion in a further 3 cell lines 
at 3µM (Mino, Jeko, Z -138). In addit ion, capivasertib shows greater than 30% tumour growth 
inhibit ion in 2MCL  line m odels in vivo (data on file).
For these reasons, capivasert ib may represe nt a novel attractive therapeutic option for the 
treatm ent of patients with haematological malignancies.
2.2 Background
2.2.1 Role of AKT Inhibition in B-cell Lymphoid Malignancies
The PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway  is frequent ly deregulated in cancers and drives tumour grow th 
and cell survival. All 3 AKT isoforms are activated in t ypes o f solid tum ours (breast, prostate, 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25of 185ovari an, pancreat ic, gastric cancers) and in haematological malignancies. This act ivation is 
often associated with resistance to established cancer therapie s as well as advanced disease 
and/or poor prognosis. AKT act ivation in tumours is largely due to input fro m other si gnalling 
pathways upstream of AKT (eg, mutation of oncogenes such as Ras, Bcr -abl, mutation of 
receptor ty rosine kinases such as epit helial growth factor receptor , amplificati on of  HER2, 
loss of PTEN funct ion, and mutations o f PI3K).
Inhibit ion of PI3K, AKT or mTOR kinases have been shown to confer anti -proliferat ive effect 
and apoptosis in a variet y of lympho ma types in vitro ( Georgakis and Y ounes 2006 ; Jia et al  
2008 ; Yuan and Cant ley 2008 ; Engelman 2009 ). Several PI3K inhibitors (ie, idelalisib, 
duvelisib, copanlisib) have been already approved for the treatment of R/R FL  (ZYDELIG 
USPI ; COPIKTRA USPI; ALIQOP AUSPI ).
Phosphorylat ion of AKT represents PI3K pathway activat ion, and is commo n in lympho mas. 
Hodgkin lympho ma co mmo nly dem onstrates AKT phosphorylation in cell lines and in 63% of 
tumour bi opsies (Georgakis et al 2006 ). In D LBCL, phosphorylation o f AKT is co mmo n (52% 
to 72% of patient samples) and might be associated with inferior survival (Uddin et al  2006 ). 
Mantle cell ly mphoma demonstrates variable levels of AKT phosphorylat ion, although the 
aggressive blastoid subt ype appears to require constitutive AKT activation for survival 
(Rudelius et al 2006 ). Follicular lympho ma shows AKT signalling pathway act ivation, due to 
either AKT phosphorylat ion or PTEN downregulatio n, in the absence of PIK3CA  mutations 
(Yahiaoui  et al  2014 ).
Several studies have demo nstrated that a decrease in AKT activit y by AKT inhibitors is 
associ ated wi th a reducti on in tum our cell  proliferati on. AKT inhibitors entering clinical 
development include ipatasert ib (RG7440), afuresertib (GSK2110183), uprosertib 
(GSK2141795), which, like capivasertib, bind to the adenosine triphosphate active site and 
inhibit AKT act ivity, thus exerting cy totoxi c and ant iproliferat ive activit ies against human 
cance r cells. Allosteric inhibitors of AKT have also been studied. Perifosine, MK -2206 and 
others al ter AKT act ivity through the suppressio n of cell growth mediated by the inhibit ion of 
AKT membrane localisat ion and subsequent activation ( Brown and Banerji 2017). However, 
limited clinical data are available wit h AKT inhibitors in lympho ma.
Perifosine is a first -generat ion AKT inhibitor that funct ions via inhibi tion of AKT 
transl ocati on to the cell membrane ( Kondapaka et al 2003 ). Com bined in a phase II trial wit h 
the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, perifosine had an ORR o f 28% in relapsed Hodgkin 
lympho ma (Guidetti et al  2014 ).
A second -generati on AKT inhibitor, MK -2206 functions via allo steric AKT inhibit ionagainst 
AKT1 and AKT2 and has shown strong preclinical activit y in a variet y of lympho ma cell lines 
as single agent and in co mbinat ions wit h other agents ( Hirai et al 2010 ; Li et al  2012 ). 
MK-2206 m onotherapy  was tested in a Phase II trial in relapsed or refractory  lympho ma 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 26of 185patients (including cHL, MCL, FL and MZL). The study showed that MK -2206 can induce 
responses in cHL  and indo lent lymphoma showing a signal o f activit y with an ORR of 20% in 
cHL, 22% in indo lent lympho ma (one CR in small lymphocyt ic lympho ma lasting for 
3.5months, and one PR in FL  lasting for 5.8 months) and of 9% in MCL. Treatment was 
overall tolerated; dose- dependent rash, hyperglycaemia and haematological toxicit ies were 
most comm only observed ( Oki et al  2015 ).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 27of 185Potential Risk of Clinical 
SignificanceSummary of Data/Rationale for 
RiskMitigation Strategy
Study treatment(s) [Capivasertib]
Based on non -clinical data, 
haematological effects are an 
important potential risk of 
capivasertib monotherapy. 
No association between 
capivasertib dose and 
haemato logical effects have been 
observed in the ongoing clinical 
studies to date, involving 
887patients in advanced solid 
tumour indications (as of 
04Oct2020).Within the capivasertib non -
clinical programme, effects on the 
haematopoietic system were noted 
in rats, with a related decrease in 
white cells in males. The changes 
were primarily noted at 
100mg/kg/day dose in males. In 
the 6 month study decreased 
cellularity was noted in the thymus 
and bone marrow of males at 
100mg/kg/day and females 
150mg/kg/day. Changes were 
reversible with the exception of 
bone marrow effects. In the dog 
only the thy mus was affected and 
was fully reversible.Due to the target population of 
CAPITAL, and their potential 
predisposition to cytopenia, either 
through disease manifestat ion, or 
prior anti -cancer treatments, 
haematological parameters will be 
closely  monito red at regular 
intervals as specified in the 
schedule of assessments in the 
protocol.
Haematological toxicity -specific 
toxicity management guidelines 
will be included in the protocol to 
support the Investigator in the 
clinical management of any such 
adverse drug reactions secondary 
to capivasertib. 
Additionally, enrolled patients will 
have been screened for adequate 
bone marrow function prior to 
commencing capivasertib as per 
the exclusion criteria in the 
protocol.
The em erging clinical safet y profile fro m the early  clinical studies have not ident ified risks 
that woul d precl ude invest igation in this setting. Second, the protocol includes ongoing safet y 
monitoring in exce ss of standard of care monitoring, with the intent of protecting pat ients 
involved in the study . Furthermore, dose m odificati on strategy  for management of 
capivasert ib-related toxici ty and m onitoring is in place for those risks deemed to be most 
likely  or serious. Thus, based upon the clinical and non -clinical safet y profile, and the strength 
of the sci entific hypothesis under evaluation, the benefit/risk assessment for this study  
supports the administration of capivasertib in patients with R/R B -cell NHL.
2.3.2 Benefit Assess ment
Data from approved PI3K inhibitors support the hypothesis that inhibit ing the PI3K -AKT 
pathway  may be a valid target for the treatment of B -cell NHL  lympho mas. All 3 PI3K 
inhibitors approved for R/R FL  so far, and the others in developme nt for indo lent lymphoma 
have demo nstrated m anageable safet y and favourable efficacy profiles. Capivasertib targets 
the sam e pathway wi th a potent and over -arching mechanism (all 3 AKT forms). It has 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 28of 185demonstrated a m anageable toxicit y profile in solid tumo urs (refer to the current capivasert ib 
IB for details). Also, capivasert ib is administered through oral route with an intermittent 
schedule which may lead to improved patient compliance and ease of patient management in 
the post -COVID -19 healthcare setting. 
Capivasert ib has demonstrated clinical act ivity in several settings, particularly  those wi th 
tumours harbouring either an AKT1 mutation or PIK3CA  mutation (Banerji et al 2018 ; 
Hyman et al 2017 ). In combinat ion, proof of concept was established with first -line paclit axel 
in patients with metastatic triple negat ive breast cancer ( Schmid et al 2020 ) and patients with 
advanced AKT1 mutant solid tumours in monotherapy or combinat ion with fulvestrant (ER + 
breast cancer) ( Hyman et al 2017 ; Smyth et al  2017 ).
These potential benefit s warrant investigation wit h capivasertib as current data suggests 
capivasert ib is an attractive investigat ional drug in R/R NHL  settings and there is a clear 
unmet clinical need in this populat ion failing or not being eligible or not having available 
approved treatment options.
2.3.3 Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion
While several treatments have been approved for patients with R/R B -cell NHL, none of them 
currently o ffer a cure to these patients. Therefore, although monotherapy capiva sertib has not 
been tested so far in lympho ma pat ients, based on the pre -clinical data available, capivasertib 
in the R/R B -cell NHL  setting does allow the opportunit y to assess its act ivity as monotherapy  
while offering the patient a reasonable chance of achieving an objective response to the 
treatm ent.
Taking into account the measures taken to minimise risk to patients participat ing in this study , 
the potenti al risks ident ified in associat ion with capivasertib are just ified by the ant icipated 
benefits tha t may be afforded to patients with R/R B- cell NHL. Capivasertib has not been 
studi ed yet in the setting of NHL; therefore, this clinical trial will provide the first clinical 
safet y and efficacy  data for capivasertib in haematological malignancies.
2.3.4 Benefit /Risk Pertaining to CAPITAL Study Conduct During the 
COVID-19 Pandemic
Cancer patients have an increased risk of exposure to SARS- CoV-2 due to frequent hospital or 
clinic visits for treatment and monitoring. A retrospective cohort study  of 28COVID -19-
infected cancer patients from 3 hospi tals in W uhan, China, reported that a third of pat ients 
(28.6%; N = 8) were suspected to have acquired the infection by hospital -associated 
transmissio n (Yu et al  2020 , Zhang et al 2020). Patients with cancer may have a higher risk 
from COVID -19 than individuals without c ancer but current evidence appears insufficient to 
support a conclusive associat ion between cancer in general and COVID -19 (Kumar et al  2019 , 
Xia et al  2020 ).
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 29of 185CAPIT AL will enro l patients wi th R/R B -cell NHL. Pati ents in thi s study  will receive 
intervent ions that lead to inhibit ion of AKT (capiv asertib). They will not be receiving 
chemotherapy , radical  radiotherapy , immunotherapy  or other continuing ant ibody  treatments 
for cancer as part of the treatment strategy . Overall, the intervent ions received and procedures 
during the course of this study  are considered to have low risk for increasing susceptibilit y to 
COVID -19 infect ion.
Furtherm ore, at this stage of disease, patients would ty pically have frequent healt hcare -related 
visits, irrespect ive of the participat ion in a clinical study . Therefore, we anticipate that overall 
their parti cipat ion in this clinical study should not significant ly increase their risk of exposure 
to COVID -19 infect ion. In addition, the dosing regimen for capivasert ib involves oral dosing 
at hom e (4days on/3 days off).
Nove l treatment opti ons are needed to improve the long -term prognosis for patients with R/R 
B-cell NHL  as thi s disease stage i s associ ated wi th high risk of developing debilitat ing 
symptoms and cancer -related death. Capivasertib could be a potentially  curat ivetreatm ent 
option in a R/R patient populat ion with high unmet medical need. The scheduled safet y 
monitoring visits that are considered in excess of standard of care monitoring are intended to 
protect patients invo lved in the study . Thus, although there may be increased risk to patients 
by exposure to SARS -CoV-2 during study  visits, this is offset by  the benefit that patients may  
receive in the form of an extended period of PFS.
In accordance with EMA  and FDA  guidelines ( EMA- CTFG -EC 2020 , FDA  2020 ), a risk 
assessment will be conducted in co llaboration with invest igators for each site and pat ient prior 
to site init iation/pat ient enrolment and on an ongoing basis throughout the study  to assess 
whether addit ional measures may  be necessary  to ensure pat ient safet y and data validit y. 
Measures may include postpo nement of study start on a global, country , or si te level or 
suspension o f recrui tment of pati ents in l ocati ons wi th an increased ri sk of COVID -19-related 
disrupt ion.
If there is a need to reconsent study  patients for the implementation of new urgent chang es in 
study  conduct, addi tional guidance on al ternat ive means of obtaining reconsent to avoid 
unnecessary  study  visits is provi ded as Appendix A(as a supplement to the standard consent 
procedures in Appendix A 3of the protocol ). Any deviat ions to the protocol necessary  to 
safeguard patient safet yor data validit y as a result of COVID -19-related disruption will be 
recorded and any permanent changes requiring an amendment to the protocol will be 
communicated to Regulatory  Authorities and IRBs/ECs in line with relevant local guidance 
and procedures.

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The study  will consist of m odules, each evaluat ing the efficacy , safet y and tol erabili ty of study  
treatm ent given to patien ts wi th different ty pes of  lympho ma.
The study  will include m odule -specific interim analyses. These interim analyses will be 
assessed against a decisio n framework ( Frewer et al 2016 ). Based on the interim results, study  
enrolment could pause and the sponsor may opt to amend the protocol to adjust dosing 
schedule based on emerging data, permanent ly clo se one or more cohort s or add in a new 
cohort evaluating capivasertib in another ty pe of lympho ma or a new module evaluat ing 
capivasert ib in combinat ion with other agents i n that popul ation. These new cohorts and/or 
modules may  be further added via formal protocol amendments b ased on em erging supportive 
preclinical and clinical data and study  rationale.
4.2.1 Regulatory Amendments for Additional Modules
To support amendments of the protocol for addit ional Modul es, AstraZeneca will provide a 
summary of non -clinical and clinical data to support the proposed new combinat ion and 
dosing schedule; this will include updat ing the fo llowing:
Study  objectives
Background informat ion provi ding rati onale for the proposed patient populat ion(s) and 
the proposed treatment plan(s)
Specific study  eligibilit y criteria
A detailed description o f the proposed study  treatment plans

A summary  of safet y data from  the com pleted or ongoing cohort(s)/Modules(s) and the 
proposed toxicit y management plans for the proposed new co mbinat ion
A descript ion of any  dose m odificat ions and the data (clinical safet y informat ion, clinical 
PK data, and non -clinical data) that support the safety  of the proposed dose modificat ions 
for the com binat ion/monotherapy  regimen in questio n
A cle arly stated j ustificat ion for the proposed sample size based on the object ives for that 
specific cohort/module; and
A detailed description o f the method and performance characterist ics of any  test that will 
be used to ident ify the pat ient populat ion to be enrolled in the cohort/Module, if the 
popul ation will be selected based on a diagnost ic assay.
4.2.2 Europe and rest of the World
AstraZeneca will provide a substant ial amendment for review and approval.
4.2.3 United States of America
AstraZeneca will provide an amen dment to the FDA  30days in advance of planned enro lment 
in the cohort for any  future combinati on. AstraZeneca will begin enrolment of patients into 
that cohort in the US no sooner than 30 days fro m the date of submission and IRB approval.
4.3 Justification fo r Dose
Refer to the relevant Module in the protocol for information.
4.4 End of Study Definition
The end o f study  is defined as the last visit of the last patient in the study  or last scheduled 
procedure shown in the SoA  in the rel evant Module for the last pat ient in the study  globally .
A patient is considered to have co mpleted the study when the patient has co mpleted his/her 
last scheduled procedure shown in the SoA  in the rel evant Modul e, including fo llow-up for 
OS.
The study  may be stopped if, in the judgeme nt of AstraZeneca, study patients are placed at 
undue risk because o f clinically significant findings.
Refer to the relevant Module for further information.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 44of 1855.3 Lifestyle Considerations
The fo llowing restri ctions apply while the patient is receiving capivasertib and for the 
specified t imes before and after:
5.3.1 Meals and Dietary Restrictions
There i s a potential for delayed and reduced absorption and/or amplified effects on the glucose 
homeostasis if capivasertib is administered w ith food, in particular together with heavy meals . 
The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but until further informat ion is available a 
conservative approach has been taken to recommend that patients fast fro m 2hours before 
dosing to 1 hour after dosin g, where possible. 
In addit ion, pati ents shoul d avoi d herbal supplements (eg, St John’s wort) and ingest ion of 
large amounts of foods and beverages known to potently modulate CYP3A4 and/or UGT2B7
enzyme act ivity during study  treatm ent. For exam ple, no m ore than half a grapefruit, a small 
glass of grapefruit juice, or 2 teaspoons of Seville orange marmalade should be consumed 
daily . 
5.3.2 Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco
No interacti ons wi th caffeine, al coho l, or tobacco have been ident ified.
5.3.3 Activity
Not applicab le.
5.3.4 Pregnancy and Contraception
5.3.4.1 Females
Women of childbearing potential who are not totally  sexually abst inent (ie, refraining fro m 
heterosexual intercourse during the ent ire peri od of  risk associ ated wi th study  interventi ons) 
and intend to be sexually  active with a non -sterilised m ale partner are required to use one form 
of highly  effective contraception combined with a barrier method (male condo m, female 
condom , cervical cap, diaphragm wit h spermicide, or contraceptive sponge with spermicide) 
of contracep tion starting before entering the study  and until 4 weeks after the last dose of 
capivasert ib. Table3contains appropriate contraception options when pa rticipating in this 
study .
It is not known whether capivasert ib has the capacity  to af fect the metabo lism o f horm onal 
contraceptives, so the highly effect ivecontracepti on method selected fro m Table3must also 
be co mbined with a barrier method of contraception.
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 45of 185Table3 Acceptable Highly Effective Contraception Options
Acceptable non -hormonal birth control methods:
• Total/true abstinence: When the patient refrains from any form of sexual intercourse and this is in line 
with their usual and/or preferred lifestyle; this must continue for the total duration of the study treatment 
and for at least 4 weeks (for female pati ents) or at least 16 weeks (for male patients) after the last dose of 
study treatment. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods, or 
declaration of abstinence solely for the duration of a trial) and withdrawal are n ot acceptable methods of 
contraception.
• Vasectomised sexual partner (with patient assurance that partner received post -vasectomy confirmation 
of azoospermia) combined with a barrier method.
• Bilateral tubal occlusion combined with a barrier method. 
• Intrauterine device (provided coils are copper banded) combined with a barrier method.
Acceptable hormonal methods:
• Mini pill combined with a barrier method: Progesterone -based oral contraceptive pill using desogestrel. 
Cerazette (Merck Sharp & Dohme) is currently the only highly efficacious progesterone -based pill 
available. 
• Combined pill combined with a barrier method: Normal and low -dose combined oral pills.
• Injection combined with a barrier method: Medroxyprogesterone injection. 
• Patch combined with a barrier method: Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system.
• Implants combined with a barrier method: Etonorgestrel -releasing implants.
• Intravaginal device (eg, ethinyl estradiol -/etonogestrel -releasing intravaginal devices) combined with a 
barri er method.
• Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system combined with a barrier method.
5.3.4.2 Males
Non-sterile men who are not totally sexually abst inent (ie, refraining fro m heterosexual 
intercourse during the ent ire peri od of  risk associated with study  interventi ons) and intend to 
be sexually act ive with a female partner (of child bearing potential) must use a condom upon 
entering the study  and unt il 16 weeks after the last dose of capivasert ib. Contraception should 
be used in females ’ partners of men taking capivasertib who are of childbearing potential 
during the course of the study  and for 16 weeks a fter the final dose of capivasert ib (see 
Table3for recommended contraception options for female partners). 
Even if the female partner is pregnant, mal e patients should st ill use a condom plus spermicide 
(if available in y our country ), as i ndicated above during the clinical study .
Male patients should refrain fro m donating sperm from the start of dosing unt il 16 weeks after 
last dose of study  treatm ent.
5.3.5 Other Restrictions
Patients who are bl ood donors should not donate blood during the study  and f or 3 months 
following their l ast dose of study  treatm ent.

Screen failures are defined as pat ients who consent to participate in the clinical stud y but are 
not subsequently entered in the study . A minimal set of screen failure informat ion is required 
to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure patients to meet the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respon d to queri es from regulatory  
authori ties. Minimal informat ion includes demography , screen failure details, eligibilit y 
criteria, and any SAE.
Patients m ay be rescreened a single t ime. However, rescreening should be documented so that 
its effect on study  results, if any, can be assessed. These pat ients should have the reason for 
study  withdrawal  recorded as screen failure in the eCRF . Rescreened pat ients should be 
assigned the same patient number as for the init ial screening.
6 STUDY INTERVENTION -CORE
Study  intervent ion is defined as any invest igational intervent ion, marketed product or placebo 
intended to be administered to or medical devices utilised by  a study  patient according to the 
study  protocol .

6.1.1 Investigational Produ cts
All patients will receive treatment with the investigational product capivasertib. Refer to the 
relevant Modul e for further details.
Capivasertib Dosing Instructions 
Capivasert ib tablets should be swallowed who le, not crushed, with a glass of water . Where 
possible, all doses o f capivasert ib should be taken at approximately the same time each day , 
12 hours apart in a fasted state (water to drink only) from at least 2 hours prior to the dose to 
at least 1 hour post -dose. Addit ional fast ing restrictio ns apply on days where fast ing glucose is 
to be tested (Section 8.2.4.1 ).
If vomiting occurs, a replacement dose should not be taken, and the patient shou ld take their 
allotted dose at the next scheduled time.
Shoul d a pati ent miss a scheduled dose, the patient will be allo wed to take the dose up to a 
maximum o f 2hours after the scheduled dose time. If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled 
dose time, th e missed dose should not be taken, and the patient should take their allotted dose 
at the next scheduled time. If a patient needs to take the dose earlier for whatever reason, the 
patient can take the dose up to 2 hours earlier than the scheduled dose time . The patient should 
make every  reasonable effort to take the capivasertib tablets on time.

lympho ma therapies should be recorde d in the clinical database. Efficacy assessments should 
continue until PD, even if pat ients start another anti- lympho ma therapy .
No intervent ion is planned after the end of the study . However, provisio ns will be in place for 
patients still enrolled at the end of the study  to continue to receive study  treatm ent if, in the 
opinio n of the invest igator , they  are continuing to receive benefit fro m treatm ent.
In the event that a roll -over or safet y extensio n study  is available at the time of the final DCO 
and database cl osure, pati ents currently receiving treatment with study  treatm ent m ay be 
transi tioned to such study , and the current study  woul d reach i ts end. The roll -over or safet y 
extensio n study  woul d ensure treatm ent continuat ion with visits and assessme nts per i ts 
protocol . Any patients who would be proposed to mo ve to such study  woul d be asked to sign a 
new ICF .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 50of 185Severe nonco mpliance with the CSP in the judgement of the invest igator and/or the 
sponsor.
Patients incorrectly init iated on study  treatm ents.
Intercurrent illness that, in the judgement of the investigator, will aff ect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree or contraindicate further dosing.
Unacceptable toxicit y.
Determinat ion by the invest igator that it is no longer safe for the patient or in the patient’s 
best interest to continue therapy .
Clinical need for concomitant or ancillary therapy  that is not permitted in the study .
Initiation of  subsequent ant i-lympho ma therapy, including another invest igational agent.
Death.
General or specific changes in the patient’s condit ion that are unacceptable for f urther 
treatm ent in the j udgement of the invest igator.
Note that discontinuation fro m study  treatm ent is NOT the same thing as a withdrawal fro m 
the study . If study  treatm ent is perm anent ly discontinued, the patient will remain in the study 
to com plete th e EOT visit within 7 days o f discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent, the 
post-treatm ent follow-up (30 [±7]days after last dose) and the long -term follow-up every  
12weeks.
See the SoA  in the rel evant Modul e for data to be collected at the time of intervent ion 
discontinuat ion (EOT) and long -term follow-up, and for any  further evaluat ions that need to 
be co mpleted.
Refer to relevant Module for criteria for stopping or pausing the study  recrui tment.
7.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation
Refer to the relevant Module for details.
7.2 Participant Withdrawal from the Study
A pat ient may wi thdraw from  the study  at any  time at hi s/her own request, or may  be 
withdrawn at any  time at the di screti on of  the investi gator for safet y, behavioural, 
compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be unco mmo n.
A pat ient who considers withdrawing from the study  must be inform ed by  the invest igator 
about m odified fo llow-up opti ons (eg, tel ephone contact, a contact with a relative or 
treating physician, or informat ion from medical r ecords).
At the time of withdrawal fro m the study , if possible, an EOT visit should be conducted, 
as shown in the SoA. See SoA in the relevant Module for data to be collected at the time

that time.
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the sponsor may  
retain and cont inue to use any data collected befo re such a withdrawal o f consent.
If a patient withdraws fro m the study , it shoul d be confirmed if he/she still agrees for 
exist ing samples to be used in line with the original consent. If he/she requests withdrawal 
of consent for use of samples, destructio n of any samples taken and not tested should be 
carried out in line with what was stated in the informed consent and local regulat ion. The 
investigator must document the decisio n on use of exist ing samples in the site study  
records and inform the Global St udy Team .
Refer to the relevant Module for details.
7.3 Lost to Follow -up
A patientwill be considered lost to fo llow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by  the study  site.
The fo llowing acti ons m ust b e taken if a patient fails to return to the study site for a required 
study  visit:
Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary , a certified l etter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent 
methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record.
Shoul d the pati ent continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from  the study . 
Site personnel, will attempt to collect the vital status of the patient within legal and ethical 
boundaries for all pat ients rando mised, including those who did not get investigational 
product. Public sources may be sear ched for vi tal status informat ion. If vital status is 
determined as deceased, this will be documented and the patient will not be considered 
lost to foll ow-up. Sponsor personnel will not be invo lved in any attempts to collect vital 
status information.

Study  procedures and their timing are summarised in the SoA in the relevant Module. 
Protocol waivers or exempt ions are not allowed.
Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the patient should co ntinue or discontinue study 
treatm ent.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the SoA in the 
relevant Modul e, is essent ial and requi red for the study .
All screening evaluat ions must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potenti al 
patients m eet all  eligibili ty criteria. The invest igator will maintain a screening log to 
record details o f all pat ients screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the pati ent’s routine clinical management and obtained 
before signing o f the ICF m ay be utilised for screening or baseline purposes provided the 
procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed within the time frame 
defined in the SoA ,with the except ion of bone marrow aspirates/biopsies (up to 12 weeks 
before the first planned dose of study  treatm ent).
Any imaging assessments (eg PET/CT scan) performed prior to the ICF signature within 
5 weeks m ay be considered as baseline, provided th at:
no anti -lympho ma treatment (including radiotherapy) has been administered between 
the date of the assessment and the first planned dose (with the only except ion of 
low-dose steroi ds ie, < 10 m g predniso lone or equivalent).
there is no significant clinical worsening of the patient.
Disease -specific assessment at screening include collect ion of prior lines of ant i-cancer 
therapi es, wi th their best overall  response and rel apse date and disease prognostic scores 
(Appendix J).
All efficacy assessments should cont inue unt il progressio n, even if patients stop study  
treatm ent.
8.1 Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy assessments will be performed as indicated in the SoA  in the rel evant Modul e until 
disease progressi on or relapse, death, lost to follow- up or withdrawal of the consent.
Disease status at baseline and during the study  will be evaluated by  using:

the size of liver and spleen
Total  body  CT, whole body  FDG -PET, MRI
Brain imaging (MRI with contrast will be performed at screening only if there is a prior 
history  of CNS invo lvement or if there are neurologic signs or sy mptoms present or as 
clinically indicated during the study )
Bone m arrow bi opsy  and/or aspi rate (Secti on 8.1.1 )
Endoscopic and histopathologic assessments (eg, tumour biopsy , cytology) if applicable
8.1.1 Bone Marrow Assessments
For all patients, a baseline (before first dose of study  treatm ent) bone m arrow biopsy and/or 
aspirate i s requi red at screening to assess bone marrow involvement by  lymphom a. 
Bone m arrow bi opsies/aspirates will be read at each site ’s local laboratory  and will  be 
perform ed as clinically  indicated while on study  (ie, to confirm CR (ifbone marrow was 
involved by lympho ma at baseline, wit hin 28days after the respective radio logical 
assessment )and per standard of care. Furthermore, if bone marrow invo lvement before the 
start of the study  was unknown, a bone marrow evaluat ion must be co nducted to confirm a 
CR. 
Patients wi th a negat ive bone marrow aspirate/bio psy (ie, no lymphom a invo lvement) at 
screening, and patients with a PR, SD or PD at any disease response assessment time po int do 
not require a fo llow-up bone marrow aspirate/biopsy . Locally  obtained resul ts shoul d be 
entered into the eCRF . 
Further details on sample processing, handling and shipment are provided in the Manual.
8.1.2 Imaging Assessments
During the screening period, a PET -CT scan will be performed to assess the measurabilit y of 
disease and will serve as baseline (Day -28 to Day -1). Informat ion on extranodal invo lvement 
will also be recorded.
Subsequent radio logical assessment, ie, CT scans with contrast (unless contraindicated) 
covering neck, chest, abdo men, and pelvis and any other di sease sites will be performed every  
8weeks (± 7days) unt il Week24 (ie, Weeks 8, 16, and 24), every  12weeks (± 7days) unt il 
Week60 (ie, Weeks 36, 48 and 60) and thereafter every  12weeks (± 7days) for R/R MCL  and 
every 24 weeks (± 7days)for R/R FL/MZL.
Patients who discont inue study  intervent ion for reasons other than PD will cont inue to be 
scanned for disease response until documented PD and regardless of starting a new

PET scans covering who le body fro m base of skull to mid -thigh (or PET/CT scans) are 
mandatory  every  8weeks (± 7days) until W eek24 (ie, Weeks 8, 16, and 24) and thereafter to 
confirm CR or as clinically indicated. More frequent PET -CT scan can be performed when 
clinically indicated at the invest igator ’s discreti on.
For MZL  patients wi th FDG -avid disease at baseline, disease response to study  treatment will 
be based on both PET and CT -based criteria. For MZL  patients wi th no FDG -avid disease at 
baseline, disease response to study  treatm ent will be based on CT -based criteria only .
PET scans should be performed whenever possible at during the 3 days off o f study  treatm ent. 
If a PET/CT is not available, an independent PET and a diagnost ic-qualit y CT scan can be 
used. If PET and CT scans are don e on the same day , the PET is reco mmended to be 
perform ed pri or to the con trast-enhanced CT not to compromise the PET read -out.If the time 
between a contrast enhanced CT and a PET is lo ng enough (eg, > 6 hours), it is possible to 
perform  CT with IV contra st prior to the PET scan .
The CT portion of a PET/CT may be submitted in lieu of a dedicated CT ; however, certain 
radiographic requi rements are needed for acceptance, as described in the Site Radio logy 
Manual, provided separately  from this protocol .
MRI m ay be used for imaging assessments if a contrast CT scan is contraindicated or 
unobtainable (in cases where MRI is desirable, the MRI must be obtained at baseline and at all 
subsequent response evaluations).
No anti -cancer treatment other than study  treatm ent can be implemented between the earliest 
date of baseline scans or bone marrow assessment and the start of study treatment. Patients 
shoul d have radi ographic tum our m easurements done at the participating study  centre or an 
acceptable alternate ima ging facilit y using an identical imaging protocol and similar 
equipment. The same imaging equipment should be used for all scans whenever possible. The 
same radi ologist shoul d be assigned to read all the scans for a given pat ient throughout the 
study .
All images for the assessment of response will be collected and stored for BICR. Any 
unscheduled efficacy assessment will also be sent for BICR to an AstraZeneca -designated 
imaging CRO. De -ident ified copies of all radio logy resul ts may  be requested by  the spon sor.

The efficacy endpo ints are based on the overall response assessment ( Appendix I).
8.1.4 Other Disease -specific Assessments
8.1.4.1 Endoscopy
Endoscopy  with adeq uate ti ssue sampling for histopathologic analysis is mandatory  to confirm 
CR for any  patients with a docum ented history  of gastrointestinal invo lvement. After CR is 
confirmed histologically (biopsy  to be perform ed wi thin 28 days fro m the respect ive 
radiological assessment) , subsequent endoscopic assessments are not mandatory  for disease 
evaluat ion, unless there is suspicio n of a new or recurrent gastrointestinal invo lvement.

assessments can be reported by  a pati ent (PRO), a clinician (Clinician -reported Outcom e), an 
observer (Observer -reported Outco me), or through a performance based assessment ( FDA -
NIH BEST Resource ). A COA  may be used in clinical studies to provide eit her direct or 
indirect evide nce of treatment benefit. It is important to examine the impact of therapy  on 
symptoms, funct ion, and other health -related QoL  of the patient to ai d understanding o f the 
risk benefit profile.
Patient-reported outcome is one ty pe of COA  and is a general ter m referring to all outcom es 
and symptoms that are directly reported by  the patient. Pati ent-reported outcome s have 
beco me important in evaluating the effect iveness of study treatm ent in clinical studies and will 
aid in understanding of the benefit/risk ev aluat ion (Kluetz et al 2018). The fo llowing PRO 
instrum ents will  be administered in this study :
Health-related QoL questionnaire EORTC QLQ -C30

NCI PRO -CTCAE
Patient-reported anti -diarrhoeal  medicati on 
PGI-TT

Patient-reported outcomes will be administered according to the SoA. The PRO 
questionnaires will be completed by patients if a linguist ically -validated versio n is available in 
their language for the coun try in which they  live. The individual questionnaires are provided 
in Appendix K.
8.1.5.1 EORTC QLQ -C30
The EOR TC QLQ -C30 was developed by the EOR TC QoL  Group 1993. It consists of 
30items and measures symptoms, functioning, and global healt h status/QoL  (Aaronson et al 
1993 ) for all  cancer ty pes. Questi ons are grouped into 5 multi-item functional scales (physic al, 
role, em otional, cogni tive, and soci al), 3 multi-item symptom  scales (fat igue, pain, and 
nausea/vo miting), a 2- item global QoL  scale, 5 singl e items assessing addit ional symptom s 
commo nly reported by  cancer pati ent (dy spnoea, loss of appet ite, inso mnia , consti pation, and 
diarrhoea), and 1 item on the financial impact of the disease. The EOR TC QLQ -C30 i s a valid

8.1.5.3 PRO -CTCAE
The PRO -CTCAE system has been deve loped by  the NCI and is included to assess tolerabilit y 
from the pati ents’ perspect ive. The PRO -CTCAE will only be administered in those countries 
where a linguist ically validated versio n is available. PRO -CTCAE is an item library o f 
symptoms experienced b y patients while undergo ing treatment of their cancer . It has been 
carefully  and systemat ically developed based on the NCI CTCAE to provide patient reported 
assessment of commo n adverse effects of cancer treatments, including a library o f 124items, 
repres enting 78 symptom atic toxicit ies. The items have previously undergone extensive 
qualitat ive and quant itative evaluat ion to support their validit y and reliabilit y (Basch et al  
2014 ; Dueck et al  2015 ; Hay et al  2014 ). For each symptomat ic AE (eg, headache), there are 
up to three questions related to key  symptom  attributes, i ncluding the symptom  frequency , 
severit y, and interference wit h daily act ivates. Each quest ion uses a 7 -day recall  with a 5-point 
ordinal response scale. The items pre -selected for this study  are based on a review of the core 
symptom  set from  NCI, expected treatment related symptoms, and in consideration of 
symptoms that are already captured in the other PRO instruments with a view t o minimize 
patient burden. Pre -selected i tems that will be administered in this study  include dry  mouth, 
blurred visio n, headache, urinary  frequency , diarrhoea, decreased appetite, nausea, vomit ing, 
fatigue, dry skin, rash and itching. The free text item i n the PRO -CTCAE instrument is not 
included in the study , as the utilit y of this inform ation and the analysis method have not been 
established.
The PRO -CTCAE is intended to enhance the precision and reproducibilit y of adverse event 
reporting to provide data that com plements and extends the informat ion provi ded by 
clinician -reporting using CTCAE, and to represent the patient perspective of the experience of 
symptom atic adverse events. Signs and symptoms assessed wit h the PRO questionnaires will 
not be conside red AEs unless entered as such into the eCRF . Use of PRO -CTCAE i s limited to 
describing in aggregate the safet y and tol erabilit y of the study  drugs and does not include the 
use of PRO -CTCAE for diagnost ic, prognostic, or therapeutic purposes in human subje cts, or 
the use of PRO -CTCAE to assess the efficacy o f the study  drugs.
8.1.5.4 Patient -reported anti- diarrhoeal medication
A quest ion is included to capture patient -reported ant i-diarrhoeal  medicat ion over the past 
1week: “Did y ou take any  medicine for diarrhoea ?”. Patients will  be asked to choose the 
responses o f “Yes” or “No”. If yes, pati ents will be asked “how much did it help? ” with 
response options: not at all, a litt le, quite a bit, very much. The questions are included to aid in 
the interpretation of pati ent-reported diarrhoea.

PRO questionnaires must be completed pri or to any  other study  procedures or discussio ns 
(following informed consent), including medicat ion treatments, and before discussio n of 
PD to avoid biasing the patient’s responses to the questions.
PRO questionnaires should be co mpleted by  thepatient in a qui et and private l ocati on.
The patient should be given sufficient time to complete the PRO questionnaires at his/her 
own speed.
The research nurse or appointed site staff should explain to patients the value and 
relevance o f these data so th at they  are m otivated to com ply wit h quest ionnaire 
completion.
The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is not 
routi nely shared with study  staff. Therefore, if the participant has any  medical problems, 
he/she shoul d discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately fro m the ePRO 
assessment.
The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the patient on how to use the ePRO 
device using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor.
The research nurs e or appointed site staff must provide guidance on who m to call if there 
are problems wit h the device when the patient is complet ing the ePRO at home.
All PRO quest ionnaires are to be completed electronically. If technical or other device -
related issues pr ohibit complet ion on the device, appropriate back -up opti ons m ay be 
considered with prior approval fro m AstraZeneca. 
The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind patients that there are no right or 
wrong answers and avo id int roduci ng bias by not clarifying items.
The patient must not receive help from relat ives, friends, or study  site staff to answer the 
ePRO questionnaires. If a patient uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for 
reading and does not have them when he or she attends the study  site, the pati ent will be 
exempted fro m completing the ePROs at that study site visit.
Site staff m ust not read or com plete the ePRO questionnaires on behalf of the patient. If 
the pati ent is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind, illite rate or not fluent in the 
available language), that patient is exempted fro m completing PRO quest ionnaires but 
may st ill part icipate in the study . If the pati ent cannot com plete the PRO questionnaires 
due to reasons other than being blind, illiterate, or fluent in language, the AstraZeneca 
study  team  must be contacted to determine if they  can be exempted. Pati ents exempted in 
this regard should be flagged appropriately by  the si te staff in the source documents and 
in the designated eCRF.

Vital signs will  be measured in a sittingposition after at least5minutes rest and will include 
temperature, systolic an d diastolic bl ood pressure, and pulse. Three readings of blood pressure 
and pulse will be taken and should be reported in the pat ient notes. The first reading should be 
rejected. The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to b e 
recorded in the eCRF .
Situations in which vital sign results should be reported as AEs are described in Sect ion8.3.5 .
8.2.3 Electrocardiograms
All ECGs t o be conducted as triplicate measurements, within approximately 5 minutes of 
starting (the 3 ECGs separated by approximately 1 minute). Assessments should be performed 
as close as possible to, but within 30 minutes of the no minal t ime point.
Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be obtained at the time points specified in the SoA  in the rel evant 
Module.
Addit ional ECGs may be taken at the discret ion of the invest igator .
Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained after the patient has been resting supine for at least 
10minut es pri or to times indicated. All ECGs should be recorded with the patient in the same 
physical posit ion. A standardised ECG machine should be used, and the patient should be 
examined using the same machine throughout the study , if possible.
After paper ECG s have been recorded, the invest igator or designated physician will review 
each of the ECGs and may refer to a local cardio logist, if appropri ate. A paper copy  shoul d be 
filed in the patient ’s medical records.
If an abnormal ECG finding at screening or bas eline is considered to be clinically  significant 
by the investigator, it should be reported as a concurrent condit ion. For all ECGs, details of

8.2.4 Clinica l Safety Laboratory Assessments
See Table 4 for the list of clinical safet y laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA  in the 
relevant Modul e for the timing and frequency .
The date and time of each collection will be recorded in the appropriate eCRF .
Laboratory  values that m eet the cri teria for CTCAE Grade 3 or have changed significant ly 
from baseline and are considered to be of clinical concern will be repeated/confirmed within 
7days and fo llowed up as appropri ate.
The invest igator should make an assessment of the available results with regard t o clinically 
relevant abnorm alities. The l aboratory  resul ts should be si gned and dated and retained at 
centre as source data for laboratory  variables.
Addit ional safet y samples may  be collected if clinically indicated at the discret ion of the 
investigator .The date, time of collection and result s (values, unit s and reference ranges) will 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . All patients with Grades 3 or 4 l aboratory  values at the 
time of co mpletion or discontinuation fro m study  treatm ent m ust be fo llowed an d have further 
tests performed unt il the laboratory values have returned to Grades 1 or 2, unless these values 
are not likely  to im prove because of the underlying disease.
Situations in which laboratory  safet y resul ts should be reported as AEs are describe d in 
Secti on8.3.5 .
All laboratory  safet y analyses, including clinical chemistry , haematol ogy and urinalysis, will 
be perform ed at a l ocal laboratory at or near to the investigator site. Sample tubes and sample 
sizes may  vary depending on l aboratory  method used and routine practice at the site.
Other safet y laboratory  tests include assessment for pregnancy , viral  serol ogy (HIV 
antibodies, CMV ant ibodie s and hepat itis sero logy [hepatit is B surface ant igen, hepat itis B 
surface ant ibodies, HBc antibodies, and hepat itis C virus ant ibodies]), and SARS -CoV-2 PCR 
testing and antibodies (if clinically indicated), and serum  immunogl obulins (IgA, IgG, IgM).
For p atients with positive ant i HBcAb or anti -hepati tis CAb at screening with docum ented 
negat ive HBV DNA  or HCV RNA , HBV DNA  and/or HCV RNA  PCR testing (as applicable) 
will be assessed every  3 monthsduring study  treatment (Table6).Pregnancy tests may be 
perform ed at the si te using a licensed test (urine or serum pregnancy test). Abnormal clinically 
significant laboratory  resul ts shoul d be repeated as soon as possible (pref erably  within 24 to

Blood gl ucose and HbA1c will be assessed according to the SoA  in the rel evant Modul e. On 
blood glucose assessment days (incorporating clinical chemistry  and gl ucose) i t is requested 
that pati ents refrain fro m caloric intake for ≥ 4hours prior to the morning dose of study 
treatm ent.
8.2.4.2 Serum Creatinine
After Cy cle2 onwards, patients taking capivasert ib and met formin in co mbinat ion shoul d 
have creat inine assessments conducted as part of the routine clinical chemistry  with addi tional 
monitoring of creat inine at the discret ion of the investigator.
Patients on m etformin shoul d attend the study  site for m onitoring of serum  creat inine at least 
once per week for the first 3 weeks after init iation of metformin, then every 3 weeks 
thereafter.
8.2.5 Other Safety Assessments
8.2.5.1 ECOG Performance Status
ECOG performance status will be assessed at the times specified in the SoA  in the rel evant 
Module. ECOG performance status is scored as fo llows:
0 = Fully active, able to carry out all pre -disease activities without restrictions
1 = Restricted in physically strenuous activity but amb ulatory and able to carry out work of a light 
or sedentary nature (eg, light housework, office work)
2 = Ambulatory and capable of self -care, but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and 
about more than 50% of waking hours
3 = Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours
4 = Completely disabled, cannot carry on self -care, totally confined to bed or chair
8.2.5.2 Echocardiogram / MUGA Scan
Assessments will be performed at screening and thereafter as clinic ally indicated. 
Bi-dimensio nal ECHO is the preferred modalit y because of the global technet ium [Tc-99m] 
shortage (but MUGA  can be used al ternat ively).
The m odali ty of the cardi ac funct ion assessments must be consistent within pat ient ie, if 
ECHO is used fo r the screening assessment and a follow -up assessment if clinically  indicated, 
then ECHO should also be used for subsequent scans if required. The patients should also be 
examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible.
Situations in which E CHO or MUGA  resul ts should be reported as AEs are described in 
Secti on8.3.5 .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 65of 1858.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The PI is responsible for ens uring that all staff involved in the study  are f amiliar with the 
contents of this sect ion.
The definit ions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix B.
Adverse events will be reported by  the patient (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, 
or the pati ent's legally  authori sed representative). 
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, document ing, and recording 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE.
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
Adverse events will be collected from t ime of signature of the ICF throughout the treatment 
period and including the fo llow-up peri od and up to 30 days after discontinuation o f study  
treatm ent.
SAEs will be recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent form.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours , as 
indicated in Appendix B. The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor 
within 24 hours of it being available.
The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, and assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for complet ing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix B.
If the invest igator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relat ionship to the study  
treatm ent that occurs after the end of the clinical study  in a pat ient treated by  him or her, the 
investigator shall, wit hout undue delay , report the SAE to the sponsor .
8.3.2 Follow
-up of AEs and SAEs
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively fo llow each pat ient 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non -serious AEs will be fo llowed unt il reso lution, 
stabilization , the event i s otherwise explained, or the pat ient is lost to foll ow-up.
Any AEs that are unreso lved at the patient ’s last AE assessment in the study are fo llowed up 
by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the 
eCRF . AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any  patient wi th 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 66of 185Adverse Event Variables
'The following variables will be collected for each AE:
AE (verbat im)
The date when the AE started and stopped
CTCAE grade
Whether the AE is serious or not
Invest igator causalit y rating against the study  treatment(s) (y es or no)
Action taken with regard to Investigat ional Product(s)
Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
Date AE m et cri teria for SAE
Date invest igator became aware of SAE
Seriousness criteria
Date of hospitalisat ion
Date of discharge
Probable cause of death
Date of death
Autopsy  performed
Causalit y assessment in relat ion to st udy procedure(s)
Causalit y assessment to other medicat ion
8.3.3 Causality Collection
The invest igator should assess causal relationship between Invest igational Product and each 
AE and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there is a reasonable 
possibilit y that the event may  have been caused by the Invest igational Product? ’
For SAEs, causal relat ionship should also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  
procedur es. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study  procedure, the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y question is found in Appendix Bto the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 67of 1858.3.4 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question 
from the study  site staff : ‘Have y ou had any heal th probl ems since the previous visit/y ou were 
last asked? ’, or revealed by observat ion will  be collected and recorded in the eCRF . When 
collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The r esults from the CSP -mandated laboratory  tests, vi tal signs, physical examinat ions, ECGs, 
and ECHO/MUGA  scans will  be summarised in the CSR. 
Deteri oration as com pared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  values, vital signs, 
physical examinat ions, E CGs, and ECHO/MUGA  scans shoul d therefore only be reported as 
AEs if they  fulfil any  of the SAE cri teria, are the reason for discontinuation o f treatm ent wi th 
the invest igational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the 
investig ator (whi ch may  include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or 
non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study  treatment, eg, dose 
adjustm ent or drug interruption).
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible the reporting invest igator 
uses the clinica l, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglo bin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, whi ch is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless uneq uivocally 
related to the disease under study .
8.3.6 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevat ions in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion 
and occurrences o f AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN m ay need 
to be reported as SA Es. Pl ease refer to Appendix Efor further instructi on on cases of increases 
in liver bio chemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy ’s Law .
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 68of 1858.3.7 Disease Progression
Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a patient ’s condi tion attributable to 
the disease for which the invest igational product is being studied. It may  be an increase in the 
severit y of the disease under study  and/or increases in the sympt oms of the di sease. Events, 
which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during 
the study .
8.3.8 New Cancers
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet at least 
one of the serious cr iteria. New primary cancers are those that are not the primary  reason for 
the administration o f study  treatm ent and are ident ified after the patient ’s incl usion in this 
study . They  do not include progression or transformat ion of the original cancer . Pati ents who 
develop a new cancer should be managed according to inst itutional guidelines wi th diagnosti c 
evaluat ions as clinically indicated, and it may be necessary  for pati ents to perm anent ly 
discontinue study  treatm ent. Further guidance is provided in Append ix B 2.
8.3.9 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the Treatment Period, or within the protocol -defined fo llow-up 
period after the administration of the las t dose of study  treatm ent, m ust be reported as follows:
Death cl early  resul ting fro m PD shoul d be documented in the eCRF in the Statement of 
Death page. It should not be reported as an SAE.
Where death is not due (or not clearly  due) to PD under study , the AE causing the death 
must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours. It should also be documented in the 
Statem ent of Death page in the eCRF. The report should contain a comment regarding the 
co-involvement of PD, if appropriate, and should assign the main an d contributory  causes 
of death.
Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE and documented in 
the Statement of Death page in the eCRF, but every effort should be made to determine a 
cause of death. A post- mortem may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, 
and if performed, a copy  of the post -mortem result s should be forwarded to AstraZeneca 
Patient Safet y or its representative within the usual time frames.
Deaths occurring after the protocol -defined fo llow-up period after the administration of the 
last dose of study  treatm ent shoul d be docum ented in the Statement of Death page. If the death 
occurred as a result of an event that started after th e defined fo llow-up period and the event is 
considered to be due to a late- onset t oxicit y to study  treatm ent, then i t shoul d also be reported 
as an SAE.
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 69of 1858.3.10 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the invest igational 
product, or to the study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , investi gators or other site personnel will inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day  ie, immediately  but no later  than 
24hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the investigator to ensure that all 
the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Pat ient Safet y data entry  site within 
onecalendar  day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up will be undertaken immediately . Invest igators or other site personnel will inform  
AstraZeneca representatives of any  follow-up informat ion on a previously  reported SAE 
within one calendar day , ie, immediately  but no later  than 24 hours of when he or she 
beco mes aware of it.
Once the invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an 
autom ated em ail alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative.
If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study  site staf f reports a SAE 
to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed.
The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca 
drug. 
8.3.11 Pregnancy
A pregnancy test will be administered to women of childbearing potential at Screening, on 
Cycle 1 Day 1, at di scont inuat ion of study  treatment, and as clinically  indicated. Confirmat ion 
of absence of pregnancy is strongly reco mmended in case o f delayed menstrual  period 
(includi ng infrequent or irregular menstrual cycles).
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except where 
the pregnancy  is discovered before the study  patient has received any study  treatm ent.
8.3.11.1 Maternal Exposure
If a patient bec omes pregnant during the course of the study , capivasertib should be 
discontinued immediately .
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC 00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 70of 185Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicio n that the invest igational 
product under study  may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. 
Congenital anomaly(/ies) /birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complicat ions should not be handled as AEs. The 
outcom e of all pregnancies (spontaneous misca rriage, el ective terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy , 
norm al birth or congeni tal anomaly/birth defect ) shoul d be f ollowed up and documented even 
if the pat ient was discont inued fro m the study .
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the investi gator or other si te personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1day, ie, immediately  but no 
later  than 24 hours of when he or she becom es aware of i t.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensur e that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Pati ent Safet y data entry  site within 1 or  
5calendar  days for SAEs (see Section 8.3.10 ) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available.
The PREGREP module in the eCRF is used to report the pregnancy and the paper -based 
PREGOUT module is used to report the outcome of the pregnancy .
8.3.11.2 Paternal Exposure
Male patients should refrain fro m fathering a child or donating sperm during the study  and for 
16weeks following the last dose of capivasertib. Patients wishing to father children should be 
advised to arrange for freezing o f sperm  samples pri or to the start of study  treatm ent.
Pregnancy of the patient ’s partners is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy , norm al birth 
or congenital anomaly), occurring from  the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the l ast 
dose should, if possible, be fo llowed up and documented.
8.3.12 Medication Error
If a medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the invest igator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1day, ie, immediately  
but no later  than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is completed wi thin 1(Initial Fatal /Life -Threatening or follow up 
Fatal /Life -Threatening) or 5(other serious init ial and fo llow up) calendar  days if there is an 
SAE associated with the medicat ion error (see Sectio n 8.3.10 ) and within 30 days for all other 
medicat ion errors.

8.3.13 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest are events of scient ific and medical interest specific to the 
further understanding of capivasert ib safet y profile and require close monitoring and rapid 
communicat ion by the invest igators to AstraZeneca. An AESI can be s erious or non -serious. 
All AESIs will be recorded in the eCRF . Seri ous AESIs will be recorded and reported as per 
Secti on 8.3.10 .
A list of AESIs can be seen below:
Hyperglycaemia
Non-infectious diarrhoea
Infective p neumo nia
Rash
Stom atitis

8.4 Overdose
There i s currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose with capivasertib and 
possible symptoms of overdose are not established. Capivasert ib must only  be used in 
accordance with the relevant clinical protocol. Adverse events associated with overdose 
shoul d be treated in response to symptoms. Any dose, or frequency  of dosing, that exceeds the 
dose regim en specified in the study  protocol  should be reported as an overdose.
Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomat ically and should be 
managed appropriately .
An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study treatment occurs in the course of the study , the 
investig ator or other si te personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives 
immediately , but no later  than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.

Table 5 Populations for Analysis
Analysis set Description
Enrolled All patients who sign the ICF.
Safety All patients who receive any amount of study treatment.
Safety data will not be formally analysed but summarised using the safety analysis 
set.
Response evaluable All patients, treated with study treatment, with measurable disease at baseline.
Pharmacokinetic All patients who receive at least 1 dose of capivasertib, for whom there is at least 
1reportable PK concentration.
ICF: informed consent form; PK: pharmacokinet ic(s).
9.4 Statistical Analyses
The SAP will be finalised within 90 days after First Patient In, but it will be aimed to have it 
finalised prior to First Patient In. It will include a more technical and detailed descript ion of 
the stati stical analyses described in this sect ion. This section is a summary o f the planned 
statist ical analyses of the most important endpo ints including primary and secondary 
endpo ints.
9.4.1 General Considerations
Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives, inc luding CROs. A 
comprehensive SAP will be developed and will describe the patient populat ions to be included 
in the analyses, the analyses including any subgroup analyses or sensit ivity analyses, and the 
procedures to account for missing, unused, and spurio us data.
Unless stated otherwise, each Cohort will be analysed separately .
Continuous data will be summarised by the number of observat ions, m ean, standard deviat ion, 
median, minimum and maximum. Geo metric mean and coefficient of variation may  be 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 76of 185presented as applicable. Categorical variables will be summarised by  frequency counts and 
percentages for each category . Unless otherwise stated, percentages will be calculated from 
the popul ation total . Time to event variables will be presented using the Kaplan -Meier 
methodol ogy, including median time calculated from the Kaplan- Meier curves.
In general, the last observed measurement prior to first dose of study  treatm ent will be 
considered the baseline measurement. For assessments on the day of first dose where tim e is 
not captured, a nominal pre -dose indicator , if available, will serve as sufficient evidence that 
the assessment occurred prior to first dose. Assessments on the day of first dose, when neit her 
time nor a nominal pre -dose indicator are captured, will b e consi dered pri or to fi rst dose if 
such procedures are required by  the protocol  to be conducted before the first dose.
Depending on the extent of any impact, summaries of data relat ing to patients diagnosed with 
COVID -19, and impact of COVID -19 on study  conduct (in particular missed visit s, del ayed or 
discontinued study  treatm ent, and other protocol deviat ions) may  be generated. More detail 
will be provided in the SAP .
The efficacy endpo ints for tumour response (ORR, DoR, and TTR) will be summarised and 
analysed based upon the response evaluable analysis set. The efficacy endpo ints for OS, PFS, 
and TFST , QoL, safet y and treatm ent exposure data will be summarised based upon the safety  
analysis set. Pharmacokinet ic data will be summarised based on the PK anal ysis set. Study  
popul ation and demography data will be summarised based upon the safety  analysis set.
Refer to the relevant Module for details on analyses and data cut -off triggers.
9.4.2 Efficacy
9.4.2.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving either CR or PR as assessed by BICR 
and will be based on the response evaluable analysis set. In addition, for sensit ivity analysis 
purposes, ORR will also be defined as the proportion of pat ients achieving either CR or PR as 
assessed by  the inve stigator and will be based on the response evaluable analysis set.
Data obtained up unt il progression, or last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, 
will be included in the assessment of ORR, regardless of whether the patient withdraws from 
therapy . Pati ents who di scontinue treatm ent wi thout a response or progression, receive 
subsequent ant i-lympho ma therapy and then respond will not be included as responders in the 
ORR.
The ORR will include data of all tumour assessments , regardl ess of whethe r it was scheduled 
or not.
ORR will be presented by  the number and percentage of patients with a response (CR/PR) 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 77of 185including 95% CIs based on exact bino mial proportions. 
Best objective response will also be summarised by  n (%) f or each category , with no formal 
statist ical analysis presented.
9.4.2.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
Primary analysis on secondary  endpoints will be based on BICR reviewed data. Sensit ivity 
analyses will be performed based on invest igator assessments.
Duration of Response (DoR)
DoR will be defined as the time fro m the date of first documented response unt il the date of 
docum ented progressi on or death due to any  cause in the absence of disease progression. The 
end of response should coincide wit h date of progressio n or death fro m any cause used for the 
PFS endpo int. The time of the init ial response will be defined as the latest of the dates 
contributing towards the first visit that was CR or PR.
The analysis will include all pat ients in the response evaluable analysis set who had a 
response, regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy .
If a patient does not progress fo llowing a response, then the censoring time will be determined 
by applying the same censoring rules as applied for PFS .
Kaplan -Meier pl ots of  DoR will be presented. Median DoR, including 95% CIs, will also be 
presented, calculated fro m the Kaplan -Meier curve. In addit ion, the number of patients still 
responding at 3, 6, and 12 months after init ial response will also be presented. Swimmer plots 
that clearly show the pr ofile of each patient who responds will also be produced.
Progression -Free Survival (PFS)
The PFS is defined as the time fro m date of first dose to date of objective disease progression 
or death (by  any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of wh ether the pati ent 
withdraws fro m treatm ent or receives another anti -lympho ma therapy prior to progression. 
Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time o f 
the latest date of assessment from their last evalua ble assessment. The PFS time will always 
be derived based on scan/assessment dates and not on visit dates.
Kaplan -Meier pl ots of  PFS will be presented. Summaries of the number and percentage of 
patients experiencing a PFS event, and the ty pe of event (prog ression or death) will be 
provi ded al ong wi th the m edian PFS, i ts 95% CI, and the proportion of pat ients who were 
progression free at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months.
The treatment status at progression of patients at the time of analysis will be summarised. This 
will include the number and percentage of patients who were on treatment at the time o f 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 78of 185progression, the number and percentage of patients who discontinued study treatment prior to 
progression, the number and percentage of patients who hav e not progressed and were on 
treatm ent or discont inued treatment. This will also provide a distribution o f number of days 
prior to progression for the patients who have discontinued treatment.
Overall Survival (OS)
The OS i s defined as the time fro m date o f first dose unt il death due to any case regardless of 
whether patient withdraws fro m treatm ent or receives another ant i-lympho ma therapy . Any 
patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored on the last recorded 
date on which the pa tient was known to be alive.
Note: Survival fo llow-up phone calls will be made in the week fo llowing the date of DCO for 
the analysis, if pat ients are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the DCO date 
these patients will be censored at the d ate of DCO.
Overall survival data will be presented similarly to the presentation described for PFS.
Time to First Subsequent Therapy or Death (TFST)
Time to first subsequent anti -lympho ma therapy or death is defined as time fro m date of first 
dose until t he start date of subsequent anti -lymphoma therapy or death due to any cause and 
will include all dosed patients regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy , 
receives another ant i-lympho ma therapy or clinically progresses prior to progression 
according to the Lugano 2014 Classificat ion for NHL.
Time to first subsequent anti -lympho ma therapy or death data will be presented similarly to 
the presentation described for PFS.
Time to Objective Response (TTR)
Time to object ive response is defined as th e time from date of first dose until the date of first 
docum ented obj ective response and will include all patients in the response evaluable analysis 
set who had a response.
The TTR will be summarised (ie, number of patients [%] based upon the number of 
responders] by  scheduled assessment time point that the response was first observed. 
Addit ionally , descript ive summary statistics will also be presented. Associated Kaplan -Meier 
curves may also be presented.
9.4.3 Safety
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety  analysis set. Safet y data will be presented 
using descript ive statist ics unless otherwi se specified.

these categories.
Separate AE tables will be provided taking into consideration relationship as assessed by the 
investigator, maximum CTCAE grading, seriousness, death and events leading to 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent as well as other action taken related to treatment, events of 
special interest, other significant AEs and timing of events.
An addit ional table will present number and percentage of patients with most commo n AEs. 
Most commo n (eg, frequency o f >x%, ≥x%) will be defined in the SAP .
Key pat ient information will be presented for patients with AEs with outcome of death, SAEs, 
AEs leading to discont inuat ion of treatment and AEs leading to treatment delay .
An AE listing for the safet y analysis set will cover details for each individual AE.
During the evaluat ion of the AE data, an AstraZeneca medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discont inuat ion. 
Based on the expert ’s judgement, si gnificant AEs of parti cular clinical importance may , after 
consultation wit h the Gl obal Patient Safety  Physician, be considered OAEs and reported as 
such in the CSR. A similar review of laboratory /vital signs/ECG data will be performed for 
ident ificat ion of OAEs.
Examples of these are marked haematological and other laboratory  abnorm alities, and certain 
events that lead to intervention (other than those already  classified as serious), dose reduction 
or significant addit ional treatm ent.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 95of 18510.2 Rationale for Module 1
The overall rationale for invest igating capivasertib in B -cell NHL  is presented in Section 2.1
of the Core Protocol. Module 1 Cohorts 1A, 1B, and 1C plan to invest igate the safet y and 
efficacy of capivasertib mo notherapy  in pati ents wi th R/R B -cell NHL.
10.3 Background –Module 1
10.3.1 Cohort 1A –Therapeutic Options for R/R Follicular Lymphoma
Follicular lympho ma is the most frequent subt ype of indo lent NHL  and accounts for 
approximately  20% of  all NHLs. This histology  is further divided into 3 different grades 
(Grades 1 to 3) reflect ing the heterogeneit y in the bio logy of the di sease. Although median OS 
is >15years, FL  remains an incurable disease in most of the patients exhibit ing a rel apsing 
and remitt ing pattern. Median PFS progressively shorten over time wit h each subsequent line 
of therapy  beyond the first (eg, 18, 9.6, 8.2 and 8.1 months after second, third, fourth, and 
≥fifth lines of therapy respectively), highlight ing a clear unmet need for R/R patients ( Link et 
al 2019 ).
The m anage ment of R/R disease include ant i-CD20 based chemo -immunotherapy , autol ogous 
HSCT and chemo -free opti ons such co mbinat ion of lenalido mide and rituximab, PI3K 
inhibitors, and tazemetostat. Three PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib, duvelisib, copanlisib) have 
been a pproved for use in the US (only 1 in Europe, idelalisib) in FL  that relapsed after at least 
2prior sy stemic therapies based on single- arm, Phase II studies. In idelalisib -treated FL  
patients, ORR was 56%, while median PFS was 1 1.0months (Salles et al  2018 ). In copanlisib -
treated FL  patients, ORR was 59% and median DoR was 12.2 months (ALIQOP A USPI ). In 
duvelisib -treated FL  patients, ORR was 42% (CR 1%), and median DoR was 10 months 
(Flinn et al 2019 ). However, the associated safet y profile (in particular, life -threatening 
infect ions, pneumo nitis, transaminit is, co litis) together with their schedule of administration 
(eg, IV use for copanl isib) often hampers their extensive use in clinical pract ice. Recent ly, the 
EZH inhibitor tazemetostat has been approved based on an open -label Phase II trial. In 
patients wi th EZH2m ut disease, ORR was 69% with a median DoR of 10.9 months and a 
median PFS of 13.8 months. In patients with wild -type EZH2, the ORR was 35%, median 
DoR was 13 months and median PFS was 11.1 months (Morschhauser et al 2020 ).
10.3.2 Coho rt 1B –Therapeutic Options for R/R Marginal Zone Lymphoma
Marginal zone lympho mas represent the second most commo n subt ype of indo lent lymphoma 
accounting for 5 -15% of NHL, although individually the 3 variants –nodal  MZL, spl enic 
MZL  and extranodal  MZL  of mucosa -associ ated lymphoi d tissue lympho ma (Sehn 2016 ). For 
patients wi th MZL  relapsing disease after at least one CD20- based FDA -approved 
chemotherap y-free opti ons include the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (approved in MZL  on the basis 
of Study  1121, a phase II trial showing ORR of 46%, CR of 3% [ IMBRUVICA  USPI ]) and 
combinat ion of lenalidomide and rituximab for patients after > 1line of treatment of 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 96of 185lenalido mide ( REVLIMID Sm PC). However, in a post -hoc a nalysis in MZL  subset, despi te 
the ORR higher in lenalido mide and rituximab combinat ion vs ri tuximab mo notherapy  (64% 
vs 44%) no PFS improvement was observed in this cohort compared to other histologies 
(Leonard et al 2019).
10.3.3 Cohort 1C –Therapeutic Options for R/R Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Mantle cell lymphoma is considered an aggressive lympho ma representing 5% to 7% of NHL  
and it ’s defined by the transl ocati on (1 1;14)(q13;q32) and result ing in const itutive 
overexpressio n of cyclin D1. PI3K -dependent AKT activat ion leads to inhibit ion of glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β, which, when activated, phosphorylates cy clin D1, tri ggering i ts nuclear 
export and proteasomal degradat ion (VanArsdale et al 2015). Consti tutive act ivation of PI3K 
in MCL  alters CD1d -mediated ant igen processing and presentation, ult imately result ing in 
decreased ant i-tumour NKT cell responses. MCL  is a heterogeneous disease wit h variable 
presentations, clinical and bio logic ri sk factors, and treatment approaches. ( Maddocks 2018) 
that often respond well in the front line setting with combination chemotherapy , although the 
responses are often not durable with a median PFS after second, third, fourth, and ≥ fifth lines 
of therapy  of 14, 6.5 , 5, and 3.3 months, respectively ( Kumar et al  2019 ). Treatment options 
for R/R MCL  include the BTK inhibitors ibrutinib and acalabrut inib; bortezomib, 
lenalido mide with or without rituximab, and brexucabtagene autoleucel ( IMBRUVICA  USPI ; 
CALQUENCE USPI ; VELCADE USPI ; REVLIMID USPI ;TECAR TUS USPI ). Although the 
response rates with single -agent BTK inhibitors are relatively high, approximately  one- third 
of patients di splay  primary resistance to BTK inhibitors, and nearly all patients eventually  
progress. The outcomes of pat ients who progress following BTK inhibitors are relat ively poor 
with an ORR ranging between 25% and 42% and median OS betwee n 6 and 10 months with 
salvage therapies ( Martin et al 2016 ; Epperla et al 2009 ; Jain et al  2018 ).
Recent ly, brexucabtagene autol eucel, a CD19- directed CAR -T therapy  has been approved for 
R/R MCL  failing ≥ 2 lines of systemic therapy including a BTK inhibitor, showing an ORR of 
85% and a 12 -month PFS and OS of 61% and 83%, respectively  (Wang et al 2020).
Promising data from CAR -T therapi es and bi -specifics ant ibody  have also recent ly emerged in 
the landscape of indo lent and aggressive lymphomas. However, toxicit ies related to fatal cases 
of cytokine release syndrome / neurotoxicit y and costs shoul d be taken into account in the 
treatm ent choice for R/R patients in future. In particular, for older patients and for those with 
co-morbidities that preclude aggressive treatment and for whom dependence on hospitals for 
infusio nal therapies represents a signifi cant challenge, are likely  to benefi t greatly  from oral 
monotherapy  (Flinn et al  2019 ).

See Secti on3of the Core Protocol.
12 STUDY DESIGN –MODULE 1
Module 1 is to be used in conjunct ion with the Core Protocol for the conduct of the study . This 
Module contains informat ion required for invest igators to conduct the study  of capivasert ib 
monotherapy  in pat ients with FL, MZL, and MCL.
This Modul e includes 3 cohorts:
Cohort 1A: capivasertib mo notherapy  in patients wi th R/R FL
Cohort 1B: capivasert ib monotherapy  in pat ients wit h R/R MZL
Cohort 1C: capivasert ib monotherapy  in pat ients wit h R/R MCL
Capivasert ib will be taken at 480 mg orally BD 4 days on/3 days off until disease progression 
unless there is evidence o f unacceptable toxicit y or if the patient/investigator requests to stop 
the treatment .
Module 1 for capivasert ib monotherapy  will include:
A Screening Period of 28 days 
A Treatm ent Peri od com prised of 28- day treatm ent cy cles, during which pat ients will 
receive study  treatm ent.
A Fo llow-up Peri od which includes:
An EOT visit to be conducte d within 7 days after discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent.
A post -treatment fo llow-up visi t to be conducted 30 days (±7days) after last dose of 
study  treatm ent.
A LTFU Peri od including co llection of subsequent anti -lympho ma therapy, 
drug-related SAEs, con comitant medication and non -drug therapies related to the 
management of drug -related SAEs, and survival will be assessed every 12 weeks 
(± 7 days) and response assessments for patient who stop study treatment without 
PD.
A total of 272 patients will  be enrolled:
94patients in Cohort 1A
94patients in Cohort 1B
84patients in Cohort 1C
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 98of 185An interim analysis focusing on safet y will be conducted when approximately 30 patients 
across the three cohorts have had the opportuni ty to be treated for 8 weeks and may inform 
preliminary efficacy based on Invest igator -assessed ORR.
An interim analysis bridging Cohorts 1A  and 1B will be performed for efficacy , based on 
BICR, after a total of n = 28 patients in Cohort 1A  plus Cohort 1B have had the opportunity  to 
be treated for 4 months. 
An interim analysis for efficacy , based on BICR , will be performed after n = 24 patients in 
Cohort 1C have had the opportunit y to be treated for 4 months.
Enrolment will not pause whilst await ing the interim data analysis. Addit ional details on the 
interim analyses will be provided in the SAP.
12.1 Justific ation for Dose
Oral capivasert ib 480 mg BD given intermittent ly (4days on/3 days off) is the recommended 
Phase II dose regimen for monotherapy . This corresponds to the maximum tolerated dose.
Although in the dose -escalation Phase I study  (Banerji et al 2018 ) in pat ients with solid 
tumours, capivasertib 480 mg BD given intermittent ly (4days on/3 days off) was defined as 
the maximum tolerated dose for the intermittent schedule 4 days on/3 day s off, the select ion of 
recommended Phase 2 dose for monotherapy  trials, including CAPIT AL, considered not only  
safet y and l ong-term tolerabili ty, but al so evidence of target engagement and PK/PD 
relationships. 
Following assessment of the mult iple dosing regimens explored (either continuous or 
intermittent schedules), capivasertib 480 mg BD given intermittent ly (4 days on/3 days off)
was considered the optimal balance between tolerabilit y and efficacy . Refer to the current 
capivasert ib IB for details.
The fo llowing evidences support the cho ice of the starting dose in the CAPIT ALstudy  and 
provi de a j ustificat ion of the selected intermittent schedule .
Better l ong-term tolerabili ty com pared to other tested schedules ( Banerji et al 2018 ).
Significant bio logical  activi ty as shown by  target engagement/inhibit ion (Robertson et al 
2020 ).
Well -characteri zed and m anageable safet y profile based on wide clinical experience to 
date ( refer to the current capivasert ib IB ), with similar clinical behaviour and PK/PD 
profiles both i n Western and Asian populat ion (Tamura et al  2016 ).

See Secti on4.4of the Core Protocol for end of study  defini tion.
For the purpose of the primary  analysis for each cohort, the DCO will be after all pat ients 
treated with capivasertib in that cohort have had the opportunit y to be treated for 6 months. At 
the time o f this DCO, the data analysis will be performed, and a cohort -specific CSR may be 
written.
After the primary  DCO , efficacy and safety  data will  cont inue to be collected. 
The DCO for the final analys is for each cohort will occur approximately  18 m onths after the 
last pati ent treated wi th capivasert ib has been enrolled in the cohort or when 70% of patients 
have progressed or died (due to any  reason) in the cohort, whi chever occurs first.
Addit ional OS follow-up analyses m ay be performed separately for each cohort after the final 
analysis, unt il 70% of the patients treated with capivasertib have died due to any cause.

Criteria for stopping or pausing the study recruitment
At any time point during the trial, the study  recruitment will pause if at least one of the 
following events occur:
Fatal  event deemed rel ated to study  therapy  by the sponsor and in discussion wit h the 
SSC (probable or certain causalit y based on World Health Organisation- Uppsala 
Moni toring Centre after f ull aet iological work -up). This will also result in a 
comprehensive review of safet y.
Unexpected and life -threatening non -hematol ogic events deemed rel ated to study  therapy  
by the sponsor and in discussion wit h the SSC. Note: As hyperglycaemia, rash, diarr hoea 
and hypersensit ivity react ions are expected adverse reactions these events will be further 
addressed at the time of the safet y interim analysis described below and will not be 
considered as stopping criteria.
Sponsor decisio n that study  partici pants a re placed at undue safet y risk.

indicat ions.
At the time of interim safet y analysis (after approximately 30 pat ients in Modul e 1 have had 
the opportunit y to be treated for 8 weeks), the study recruit ment may be paused, pending 
investigat ion by the sponsor in discussio n with SSC, if at l east one of the fo llowing events 
occur:
An increase in the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 Im portant Identified Risks of hyperglycaemia, 
diarrhoea , and rash (i rrespect ive of Invest igator -determined causalit y), com pared to the 
reported incidence in so lid tumour patients. The proposed limits would correspond to:
> 34% parti cipants experiencing Grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea
> 40% parti cipants experiencing Grade ≥ 3 hy perglycaemia
> 27% parti cipants experiencing Grade ≥ 3 m aculo-papul ar rash
≥2 pati ents experiencing systemic drug hypersensitivit y react ions
>22% of participants discontinuing study  treatment due to any  grade, causally -related AE 
( ie, > 10% increas e com pared to the reported incidence is solid tumour patients).
≥ 3 pati ents (≥ 10%) developing a persistent (ie, lasting more than 21 days despite 
supportive care) Grade ≥ 3 cy topeni a (ie,neutropenia, anaemia or thrombocy topeni a) 
within the first 28 day sof capivasertib treatment, that in the opinio n of the Invest igator, 
cannot be cl early attri butable to baseline bone marrow invo lvement by lympho ma or to 
extraneous cause.
In the event that the accrual is paused, AZ will notify  Invest igators, IRB and Regu latory 
Authori ties immediately .
Study  recrui tment init ially paused will restart only  upon approval  by Regulatory  Authorities 
and IRB/IEC of a substant ial protocol  amendment, containing addit ional information on 
benefit/risk and safet y measures as applicabl e.
For pati ents who are receiving capivasertib while the decisio n to stop or pause study  accrual  is 
under considerat ion:
The Investigator should prompt ly inform  the pati ents of the possible harm.
An individual risk/benefit assessment should be conducted by the Invest igator and by the 
sponsor in order to decide whether the risks of continuing the study  treatm ent overwei ght 
the benefit, taking into account mult iple factors including the disease response to 
treatm ent, the number of cycles already received, pri or com orbidities and AEs 
experienced in the trial.

This interim analysis will be assessed against a decisio n framework ( Frewer et al 2016 ) for 
ORR based on a l ower reference value of 40% and a target value (a desired signal to be 
observed) of 55%. The interim analysis will be based on data from pat ients from the 2cohorts 
combined. 
With 28 patients treated with capivasertib mo notherapy  who have had the opportunit y to be 
treated for 4 months, it may be considered fut ile to continue development of these cohorts if

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 107of 185there is < 10% probabilit y for the ORR to be greater than 55%. This translates into observing 
11 or fewer responders out of 28 patients; an ORR of 40% whi ch has a 2 -sided exact bino mial 
80% CI of 26.7% to 53.2%; wherein the upper confidence limit is below 55%.
Addit ionally , a greater than 80% probabilit y for the ORR to be above 40% may be considered 
a good si gnal. This translates into observing 14 or more responders out of 28 patients; an ORR 
of 50%, whi ch has a 2 -sided exact binomial 60% CI of 40.4% to 59.6% wherein the lower 
confidence limit is above 40%.
Recrui tment will not be paused while the interim analysis is evaluated.
Based on the interim resul ts, study  enrolment could pause and the sponsor may opt to amend 
the protocol to adjust dosing schedule based on emerging data, permanently close the specific 
cohort or add in a new cohort evaluating capivasertib in co mbinat ion with other agents in t hat 
popul ation which would be detailed in an amendment.

there is < 10% probabilit y for the ORR to be greater than 40%. This translates into observing 
6 or fewer responders out of 24 patients; an ORR of 25% which has a 2 -sided exact bino mial 
80% CI of 13.7% to 39.8%; wherein the upper confidence limit is below 40%.
Addit ionally , a greater than 80% probabilit y for the ORR to be above 25% may be considered 
a good si gnal. This translates into observing 9 or more responders out of 24 patients; an ORR 
of 38%, whi ch has a 2 -sided exact binomial 60% CI of 27.8% to 48.2% wherein the lower 
confidence limit is above 25%.
Recrui tment will not be paused while the interim analysis is evaluated.
Based on the interim res ults, study  enrolment could pause and the sponsor may opt to amend 
the protocol to adjust the dosing schedule based on emerging data, permanent ly close the 
specific cohort or add in a new cohort evaluat ing capivasertib in co mbinat ion with other 
agents in t hat populat ion which would be detailed in an amendment.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 111of 185Potential Changes to Informed Consent During the COVID -19 Outbreak
General Principles
The ri ghts, safety , and wellbeing of the study  patients are the m ost im portant consi derat ions 
and should prevail over interests of science and societ y. All informed consent activit ies must 
follow ICH GCP; the CSP; and local laws, regulat ions, and guidance. Prospective protocol 
waivers wit h respec t to enrolment rem ain unacceptable. Patients should not be included in 
studi es wi thout wri tten inform ed consent according to national laws and regulat ions and 
proper eligibilit y assessment.
The reconsent process described in this appendix must be adopted o nly at sites/countries 
affected by  the COVID -19 outbreak where reaching the site means placing the study  patient 
under unnecessary  risk. The described process does not overrule local laws, regulations and 
guidance; where differences arise, the latter must be fo llowed.
If the need for re -consent ing study  patients arises, visit ing the investigator sites for the sole 
purpose of obtaining reconsent should be avo ided.
Any validated and secure electronic system already used in the study  for obtaining informed 
consent can be used as per usual practice and if in compliance wit h local regulat ions.
Process for Reconsent of Study Patients at Sites Affected by the COVID -19 Outbreak
Before reconsent is obtained, the approved updated patient informat ion sheet and consent 
form shoul d be provi ded to study  patients by email. If the study  patient is not abl e to receive 
emails, couri er or m ail shoul d be used.
Verbal consent vi a phone or tel econference is allo wed.
If possible, verbal consent should be supplemented with email con firmation. The invest igator 
shoul d emphasise that study  patients should only  use em ail to confi rm their ICF consent and 
that the patient should not include any  sensi tive personal  identifier (eg, date of birth, social 
securit y number) or medical informat ionincluding AEs.
Please note: Study  patients should not sign the document at home after giving verbal consent. 
The phone call or teleconference should be informative. The document will be signed and 
filed with the patient ’s source data once the study  patient is able to attend the site. Under no 
circumstances shoul d the study  patient scan and send the document back via email.
Verbal consent and print-out of the email confirmation (if available and once possible) must 
be docum ented by  the invest igator or deleg ate (if applicable) in the study  patient’s medical 
records.
Docum entati on shoul d incl ude details on when the contact took place, the reason why  the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 112of 185study  patient coul d not reach the site, any  important details of the consent ing call/concerns 
raised, and any quest ions rai sed (especially on safety  measures) by  the study  patient and that 
these were answered sat isfactorily by  the si te consent ing party .
At the earliest possible occasion, consent must be documented via standard consent process. 
This would not a pply if the study  patient is lost to f ollow -up, dies, or the study  ends before the 
COVID -19 outbreak is over . In thi s case the reason why  the study  patient di d not si gn the 
docum ent in person has to be documented in the study  patient ’s medical records.
A 4 Data Protection
Patients will  be assigned a unique ident ifier by the sponsor. Any pat ient records or 
datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the ident ifier only; pat ient names 
or any  informat ion which would make the patient ident ifiable will not be transferred.
The patient must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
sponsor in accordance wit h local data protecti on law. The l evel of disclosure and use of 
their data m ust al so be explained to the patient in the informed consent. 
The patient must be informed that his/her medical records may  be examined by  Clinical  
Qualit y Assurance auditors or other authorised personnel appo inted by  the sponsor, by  
appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory  authorities.
A 5 Committees Structure
The safet y of all clinical studies is cl osely m onitored on an on -going basis by the sponsor in 
consultation wit h Pati ent Safet y. Issues ident ified will be addressed; for instance, this could 
involve amendments to the protoc ol and l etters to investigators.
This study  will have a nSSC. The primary responsibilit y of the SSC will be to provide 
guidance on design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of this trial at the sponsor ’s request. 
Decisio ns and recommendations of the Committ ee are not binding on the Company . Full 
details on the SSC are provided in a charter separate fro m this protocol .
A Safet y Review Committee may be established in case a module evaluating capivasertib in 
combinat ion with other agents is added in the future.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114of 185A 9 Study and Site Start and Closure
The study  start date is the date on which the clinical study  will be open for recruit ment of 
patients.
The first act of recruitment is the first site open and will be the study  start date.
The sponsor designee reserves the right to cl ose the study  site or terminate the study  at any  
time for any  reason at the sole discret ion of the sponsor . Study  sites will  be closed upon study  
completion. A study  site is considered cl osed when all  requi red docum ents and study  supplies 
have b een co llected and a study -site closure visi t has been perform ed.
The invest igator may init iate study -site closure at any  time, provi ded there i s reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended terminat ion.
Reasons for the early c losure of a study  site by the sponsor or investigator may  include but are 
not limited to:
Failure of the invest igator to comply wit h the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC 
or local health authori ties, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
Inadequate recruit ment of patients by  the invest igator
Discontinuati on of  further study  treatm ent devel opment

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 116of 185Appendix BAdverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
B 1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study 
patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the m edicinal product. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is an AE occurring during any  study  Phase (ie, run- in, treatment, washout, follow -
up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing criteria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -patient hospi talisat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talisat ion
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Adverse Events for malignant tumours reported during a study  shoul d generally be assessed 
as SAEs . If no other seri ousness criteria apply , the ‘Important Medi cal Event ’ criterion shoul d 
be used. In certain situat ions, howe ver, medical judgem ent on an individual event basis should 
be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be assessed and reported as a 
non-serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history  and progressi on 
occurs duri ng th e study , but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumour, the AE m ay not fulfil the attributes for being assessed as serious, although 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumour as an AE is valid and should occur . Also, 
some ty pes of  malignant tum ours, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospitalisat ion, may be assessed as non -serious; examples in adult s include 
Stage 1 basal cell carcino ma and S tage 1A1 cervical cance r rem oved via cone biopsy .
The above instruction applies only when the malignant tumour event in quest ion is a new 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117of 185malignant tumour (ie, it is notthe tum our f or whi ch entry  into the study  is a cri terion and that 
is being treated by  the Invest igational Pro duct under study  and is not the development of new 
or progression o f exist ing metastasis to the tumour under study ). Malignant tum ours that –as 
part of normal, if rare, progression –undergo transformat ion (eg, Richter ’s transform ation of 
B-cell chronic l ymphocy tic leukaemia into diffuse large B -cell lymphom a) shoul d not be 
considered a new malignant tumour .
Life-threatening
‘Life-threatening ’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or co ntinued use of the product would result in the patient ’s 
death. ‘Life-threatening ’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpati ent trea tment in an emergency room is not in itself an serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or dis ease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study , provi ded that i t did not deteri orate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment
Medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situat ions 
where important medical events may  not be immedi ately life threatening or result in death, 
hospi talisat ion, disabilit y or incapaci ty but may  jeopardi se the patient or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These should 
usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisatio n
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 118of 185Intensity Rating Scale:
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE v5 will be utilised for all events with an 
assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the 
recommendat ion in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate and severe events into 
CTCAE grades should be used. A  copy  of the CTCAE can be downloaded fro m the Cancer 
Therapy  Evaluat ion Program website (http://ctep.cancer .gov). The applicable versio n of 
CTCAE shoul dbe described clearly .
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B 2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it sat isfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix B 2.
B 3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug.
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administrati on of  the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug?
No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetio logy such 
as the underlying diseas e, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally reco mmend or support a re-
challenge .
Laboratory  tests. A speci fic laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 119of 185Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related ’ is made iffollowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal  relati onship is meant to convey , in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgement. W ith no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relat ionship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not rel ated’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B 4 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical stu dy a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study  treatm ent that ei ther causes harm to the patient 
or has the potential to cause harm to the patient. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of t he drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or pati ent.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error . 
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the patient received the drug
Did not occur, but ci rcumstances were recognised that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name confusio n
Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the pati ent
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature 
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 120of 185Wrong patient received the medication (excluding IRT/RTSM errors)
Wrong drug administered to patient (excluding IRT/RTSM errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in cli nical studi es:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IRT/RTSM -including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
Patient acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medicat ion
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open -label studi es, even if an AstraZeneca product 
Medication e rrors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the medication 
error .

patients while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and 
records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site.
The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward 
shipment or disposal.
AstraZeneca or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the ent ire life cycle through 
internal  procedures, m onitoring of study  sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual 
requi rements of external laboratory  provi ders.
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca -assigned bi obanks or other 
sample archive facilit ies and will be tracked by  the appropri ate AstraZeneca T eam during for 
the rem ainder of the sam ple life cycle.
If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining bio logical samples are returned to the site 
according to loc al regulati ons or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner .
C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples 
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the sam ples will  be 
disposed of/destroy ed/repatri ated, and the action documented. If samples are already analysed ,
AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy  the resul ts of this research.
Following wi thdrawal  of consent for bio logical samples, further study  partici pation shoul d be 
considered in relat ion to the wi thdrawal  processes outlined in the informed consent.
The invest igator:
Ensures pat ient’s withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
highlighted immediately to AstraZeneca or delegate.
Ensures that relevant human bio logical samples from  that pati ent, if stored at the study  
site, are immediately  identified, disposed of as appropriate, and the action documented.
Ensures that the patient and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.
AstraZeneca ensures the organisatio n(s) holding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of or repatriated as appropriate,

International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IA TA) 
(https://www .iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Pages/download.aspx ) classifies infect ious 
substances into 3 categories: Category A, Category B or Exempt
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals. 
Category A Pathogens are, eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus. Infect ious substances meet ing these 
criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to 
UN2814. Infect ious substances which cause disease only in animals must be assigned to 
UN2900.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A. Category  B pathogens are, eg, Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses. They 
are assigned the fo llowing UN number and proper shipping name:
UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category  B
are to be packed in accordance with UN 3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -Substances which do not contain infect ious substances or substances which are 
unlikely  to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they 
meet the criteria for inclusio n in another class.
Clinical study samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulat ions
Clinical study  samples will routinely  be packed and transported at ambient temperature in

D 1 Use/Analysis of DNA
AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic 
variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response 
to medicat ions. This genetic research may lead to better understandi ng of  diseases, better 
diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in healt h care, and to the discovery  of new 
diagnosti cs, treatm ents, or m edicati ons. Therefore, where local regulations and IRB/IEC 
allow, a saliva sample will be co llected for DNA analysis from consent ing patients.
This optional genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the patient’s 
DNA, i e, the ent ire geno me. 
The results of genet ic analyses may be reported in a separate study summary.
The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confident iality.
D 2 Genetic Research Plan and Procedures
Selection of Genetic Resear ch Population
All patients will be asked to participate in this genetic research. Participat ion is voluntary 
and if a patient declines to participate there will be no penalt y or loss of benefit. The 
patient will not be excluded fro m any aspect of the main study .
Inclusion Criteria
For inclusio n in this genet ic research, patients must fulfil all o f the inclus ion criteria described 
in the main body  of the Clinical Study  Protocol  and in the rel evant Modul e and: Provi de 
inform ed consent for the Genomics Init iative sampling and analyses.
Exclusion Criteria
Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any o f theexclusion criteria specified in 
the main study  or any  of the f ollowing:
Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of genetic sample 
collect ion
Withdrawal of Consent for Genetic Research
Patients m ay withdraw from  this genetic research at any t ime, independent of any 
decisio n concerning participation in other aspects of the main study . Vol untary  
withdrawal  will not prej udice further treatment. Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in 
Secti on7.2of the m ain Clinical Study  Protocol .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124of 185Collection of Samples for Genetic Research
  
Although DNA is stable, early  sampl e collect ion is preferred to avoid 
introducing bias through excluding pat ients who may  withdraw due to an AE. Only one 
sample should be co llected per patient for genetics during the study.
Coding and Storage of DNA Sampl es
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are 
important to maintain pat ient confident iality. Sampl es will  be stored for a m aximum  of 
15years, from the date of last patient last visit, after which they will be dest royed. DNA 
is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until 
no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to the sample eit her before or at the time of 
DNA extraction replacing the informat ion on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will 
be ident ifiable only by the second, unique number. This number is used to identify the 
sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genet ics laborat ories, or at the 
designated organisation. No personal details ident ifying the individual will be available to 
any person (AstraZeneca emplo yee or desi gnated organi sations working with the DNA).
The link between the patient enrolment/rando misatio n code and the second number will 
be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca 
or desi gnated organisat ions. The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples 
for analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul tswith clinical data, allow regulatory  
audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , incl uding this 
genet ics research component, are outlined in Appendix A.
Informed Consent
The genetic component of this study  is opti onal, and the patient may  parti cipat e in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in this genet ic co mponent. To 
participate in the genet ic component of the study the pat ient must si gn and date both the 
consent form for the main study  and the addendum for the Geno mics Init iative com ponent 
of the study . Copi es of  both si gned and dated consent forms must be given to the patient 
and the original filed at the study  centre. The PI(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent 
is given freely and that the patient understands that they  may freely wit hdrawal fro m the 
genet ic aspect of the study at any t ime.

AstraZeneca will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to patients, any  insurance 
company, any emplo yer, thei r family members, general physician unless r equired to do so 
by law.
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being 
linked to the ident ity of the patient. In except ional circumstances, however, certain 
individuals might see both the genet ic data and the person al identifiers of a patient. For 
example, in the case of a medical emergency , an AstraZeneca Physician or an invest igator 
might know a patient’s ident ity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Regulatory  
authori ties may  requi re access to the rel evant files, though the patient’s medical 
inform ation and the genet ic files would remain physically separate.
Data Management
Any genet ic data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca 
and/or designated organisat ions to analy se the sampl es.
AstraZeneca and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic 
differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with 
other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisations or h ealth insurance 
companies. This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they  can 
be co mbined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and 
disease. The researchers can only  use thi s inform ation for heal th-related research 
purposes. Researchers may  see summary  resul ts but they  will not be able to see individual 
patient data or any  personal  identifiers. 
Some or all  of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the genet ic

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 126of 185Appendix EActions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to i dentify and appropriately 
report PHL cases and HL  cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the 
management of elevated liver biochemistries. 
During the course of the study  the invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets PHL 
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL  and HL  events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL  
criteria coul d be m et by  an elevated ALT from a central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL  from 
a local laboratory . 
The invest igator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevat ions 
in liver bio chemistry ) for possible PHL  events.
The invest igator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL  criteria to agree whether HL  criteria are m et. HL  
criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry  
other than DILI caused by  the study  treatment. 
The invest igator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL  cases and for 
reporting SAEs and AEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with 
standard safet y reporting processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law
Aspartate aminotransferase or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together  with TBL ≥ 2×ULN at any po int 
during the study  following the start of study  medicati onirrespective of an increase in ALP .
Hy’s Law
Aspartate aminotransferase or ALT ≥ 3×ULN together  with TBL ≥ 2×ULN, where no other 
reason, other than the study  treatment, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, 
eg, el evated ALP indicating cho lestasis, viral hepatit is, another drug. 
For PHL  and HL  the el evation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no spec ified timeframe within which the 
Clinical St udy Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 127of 185elevations in transaminases and TBL  must occur .
E 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL  it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3 × ULN
AST ≥ 3 × ULN
TBL ≥ 2 × ULN
Local Laboratories Being Used:
The invest igator will wit hout delay  review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative 
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section E 2for definit ion) by 
reviewing labor atory  reports from  all previ ous visits
Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  eCRF
E 4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL  criteria the investigator will:
Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that th e patient has not met PHL criteria.
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the Clinical Study  Protocol .
E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL  criteria the invest igator will:
Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting study  
intervent ion (see Section E 6).
Notify  the AstraZeneca representat ive who will then inform the central Study Team. 
Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the invest igator will report the case as an SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y assessment ‘y es/rel ated’ 
according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 128of 185For pati ents that m et PHL cri teria prior to starting study  treatm ent, the investigator is not 
requi red to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change#in the patient’s 
condi tion.
The Study  Physician contacts the investigator, to p rovide gui dance, di scuss and agree an 
approach for the study  patients’ follow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and 
the continuous review o f data.
Subsequent to this contact the invest igator will:
Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Completes fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed with the Study  Physician.
Com plete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information beco mes available. 
#A ‘significant ’ change in the patient ’s condi tion refers to a clinically  relevant change in 
any of the individual liver biochemistry  param eters (AL T, AST or TBL) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the investigator, this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.
E 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL  criteria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL  criteria other than DILI caused by  the 
study  treatm ent, to ensure timely  analysis and reporti ng to health authorities within 
15calendar days from  date PHL  criteria was m et. The AstraZeneca Glo bal Clinical Lead or 
equivalent a nd Global Safet y Physician will also be involved in this review together with 
other subject matter experts as appropriate. 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Wher e ther e is an agr eedalternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record t he alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 129of 185If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AstraZeneca standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the AL T or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the study  treatm ent:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standa rd 
processes. 
 The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
 As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay ,of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of PHL, (report term now 
‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to study  treatm ent and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SA E reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.
E 6 Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met 
Before and After Starting Study Intervention
This sect ion is applicable to participants with liver invo lvement by  the disease who m eet PHL  
criteria on study  treatm ent, having previously  met PHL  criteria at a study  visit pri or to starting 
study  interventi on.
At the first on -study  intervention occurrence of PHL  criteria being met the invest igator will 
determine if there has been a significant change in the participants ’ condi tion# com pared wi th 
the last visit where PHL  criteria were met#
If there is no significant change no action is requi red
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 130of 185If there is a significant change, notify the AstraZeneca representative, who will inform the 
central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described in Sect ion E4.2
E 7 Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potential Hy’s Law
This sect ion is applicable when a patient meets PHL  criteria on study  treatm ent and has 
already met PHL  criteria at a previous on study  treatm ent visi t.
The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, revi ew and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence. 
The invest igator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL  criteria being 
met and answer the fo llowing quest ion:
Was the al ternat ive cause for the previous occurrence of PHL  criteria being met found 
to be the di sease under study  eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe 
infect ion or liver disease or did the parti cipant m eet PHL cri teria prior to starting study  
intervent ion and at their first on- study  interventi on visi t as described in section E 6of
this Appendix?
If No: follow the process described in Sect ion E4.2for reporting PHL  as an SAE
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant c hange in the pat ient’s condi tion#compared 
with when PHL  criteria were previously  met
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant change#follow the process described in Section E4.2for reporting 
PHL as an SAE
# A ‘significant ’ change in the pat ient’s condi tion refers to a clinically relevant change in any  
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (AL T, AST or TBL) in isolation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the investigator, this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.

Concomitant Medications
Authori zed/approved COVID- 19 vaccines can be given to patients enro lled in this trial as long 
as these do not represent a prohibited conco mitant medicat ion as detailed in TableF16. 
Invest igators should fo llow the Clinical Study  Protocol , thei r local prescribing informat ion, 
and po licies when considering if vaccinat ion against COVID -19 is appropriate for their 
patients parti cipat ing in an AstraZeneca clini cal trial .
The use of any  natural /herbal  products or other “folk rem edies ” shoul d be di scouraged, but 
use of these products, as well as use of all vitamins, nutritional supplements, and all other 
concomitant medicat ions must be recorded in the eCRF .
POTENT IAL PHARMACOKINETIC INTERACTIONS
Before study treatment
Drugs that should not be combined wit h capivasertib must have been discontinued prior to the 
start of administration of study  treatm ent in accordance with guidance provided in TableF11
to TableF13.
During study treatment
It is recommended that drugs which should not be combined wit h capivasert ib are not 
co-administered in accordance with guidance provided in TableF11to TableF14; however, if 
it is considered essent ial for pati ent m anagement to co -administer these drugs with 
capivasert ib, participants should be mo nitored cl osely for possible drug interactions.
Drugs That May Influence Capivasertib Pharmacokinetics
Based on results from in vitr ostudi es, capivasert ib is primarily metabo lised by CYP3A4 and 
UGT2B7 enzymes. Therefore, inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes may increase or 
decrease exposure, respectively , to capivasertib. 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazo le increased capivasert ib Cmax 
by 70% and AUC by 95% (study D3614C00004) and co -administration with the strong 
CYP450 inducer enzalutamide was est imated to result in approximately 50% reduction in 
capivasert ib AU C and Cmax (RE AKT study; Ko linsky et al 2017 ).
Strong inhibitors and strong inducers o f CYP3A4 must not be combined with capivasertib and 
must be stopped at least 2 weeks before the first dose of capivasert ib (3 weeks for St John’ s 
Wort and 4 weeks for enzalutamide). Strong inhibitors must not be us ed for 2 day s following 
discontinuat ion of capivasertib. Moderate inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 or UGT2B7

Drugs That May be Influenced by Capivasertib
There are currently no data confirming that there are any PK interactions between capivasert ib 
and drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes. Likewise, there are no confirmed interact ions 
with renal or hepati c transporter substrates. The potential interact ions are considered on the 
basis of preclinical data and physio logy-based PK modelling. These suggest that capivasertib 
may be a m oderate to strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, but a less potent inhibitor of som e drug 
transporters and may thus increase the exposure of some drugs. Capivasertib also inhibit ed 
CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 in vitro. However, based on physio logy-based PK m odelling, the 
increase in exposure of sensit ive substrates for these isoenzymes is n ot predicted to be 
clinically relevant (<10%). 
The gui dance below ( TableF13and TableF14) are based on the predicted magnitude o f 
increase in exposure and the expected clinical significance of that increase (therapeutic 
window and/or QT liabilit y). The lists are not intended to be exhaustive, and similar 
restri ctions will apply to other agents that are known to be sensit ive to inhibit ion of CYP3A  or 
transporter proteins. Please refer to the full Prescribing Informat ion for all drugs pri or to co -
administration with study  intervent ion and consider do se reduction where clinically

G 2 Dose Modifications Due to Specific Capivasertib -related Toxicities
G2.1 Hyperglycaemia
These are general reco mmendat ions therefore due consideration should be given to baseline 
values and fast ing condit ion (and t ime since food if applicable) when interpreting glucose 
resul ts. In di abetic patients, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetio logies that coul d 
be associ ated wi th hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydrat ion, vascular events, 
glucocorti coids).
Patients shoul d be m ade aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria).
Clinical Study Protocol -6.0 AstraZeneca
Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 140of 185Dose m odificat ion gui delines for capivasertib -related hyperglycaemia are shown in 
TableG16. In addi tion, for all  grades, pati ents may receive educat ion on lifest yle changes (eg, 
a diabetic diet) and consider beginning ho me glucose monitoring (eg, fast ing SBGM once 
daily) at the discretion o f the invest igator . If glucose ho me monitoring is inst ituted, the 
capivasert ib treatment decisio n shoul d be based on the morning fast ing glucose value obtained 
prior to the dose of capivasertib.
It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib -induced 
hyperglycaemi a include advice from  a diabetol ogist where appropriate (eg, diabet ic pat ients). 
Metformin is currently the preferred oral ant idiabeti c recommended for the management of 
hyperglycaemia occurring in pat ients parti cipat ing in studi es of capivasertib (see bel ow for 
further guidance). If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the 
intermittent schedule of capivasert ib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas 
shoul d be avoi ded due to their risk o f hypoglycaemia secondary to the ir mechanism  of action).

aPatients may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home 
glucose monitoring (eg, fasting SBGM once daily) at the discretion of the investigator. If glucose home 
monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib treatme nt decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose 
value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib.

Use of Metformin
Metfo rmin is currently the preferred oral ant idiabeti c recommended for the management of 
hyperglycaemia occurring in pat ients parti cipat ing in studi es of capivasertib. Investigators 
shoul d exercise cauti on in the dosing and management of pat ients receiving the 
metformin/capivasertib co mbinat ion and m ust be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and 
metformin toxicit y, such as l actic aci dosis and hypoglycaemia, namely : lethargy , hypotensi on, 
poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachy pnoea, sweating, diarrho ea, and vo miting.
Due to the potential interact ion of metformin and capivasertib (caused by inhibit ion of renal 
transporters [eg, OCT2] invo lved in the excret ion of met formin), when taking both 
capivasert ib and metformin concurrent ly, pati ents shoul d atten d the study  site for monitoring 
of serum  creat inine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after init iation of metformin, 
then at the invest igator ’s discretion.
Metformin should only  be given on the day s when capivasert ib is also administered (the ha lf-
life o f capivasert ib is approximately 7 to 15 hours), and should be withdrawn when treatment 
with capivasert ib is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated.

G2.4 Diarrhoea
Patients shoul d be instructed to prompt ly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. 
Alternat ive aet iologies shoul d be ruled out prior to init iating the dose modificat ions. 
Invest igators are recommended to prescribe ant i-diarrhoeal  treatment at the first visit so that 
patients can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur . Loperamide is the 
preferred ant i-diarrhoea agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in pat ients 
participat ing in studies o f capivasert ib. Dose m odificat ions for capivasertib -related diarrhoea

Note: Changes below should be implemented only during study disruptions due to any of or a 
combinat ion of civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis (eg, during quarant ines and 
resul ting site closures, regional travel restrictions and considerat ions if site personnel or study  
patients beco me infected with SARS -CoV-2 or similar pan demic infect ion) during which 
patients m ay not wi sh to or m ay be unable to vi sit the study  site for study  visit s. These 
changes should only be implemented if allowable by lo cal/regi onal guidelines and following 
notification fro m the sponsor and instruction s on how to perform these procedures will be 
provi ded at the time of implementation.
Please note that during civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis, so me study  
assessments and procedures may  not be conducted due to internat ional or local pol icies or 
guidelines, hospital or clinic restrict ions and other measures implemented to ensure the 
patient’s safet y. If in doubt, pl ease contact the AstraZeneca Study  Physician.
H 1 Reconsent of Study Patients During Study Interruptions
During study  interrupt ions, it may not be possible for the patients to complete study  visits and 
assessments on site and alternat ive means for carrying out the visits and assessments may be 
necessary , eg, rem ote visi ts. Reconsent shoul d be obtained for the alternat ive means of 
carrying out visits and assessments and should be obtained prior to performing the procedures 
described in Sections H 2to H 6. Local and regional regulat ions and/or guidelines regarding 
reconsent of study  patients shoul d be checked and fo llowed. Reconsent may  be verbal  if
allowed by  local and regi onal guidelines (note, i n the case of verbal consent/reconsent the ICF 
shoul d be signed at the pati ent’s next contact with the study  site). V isiting the study  sites for 
the sole purpose of obtaining reconsent should be avo ided.
H 2 Rescreening of Patients to Reconfirm Study Eligibility
Addit ional rescreening for screen failure due to study  disrupti on can be performed in 
previously screened pat ients. The invest igator should confirm this wit h the designated Study  
Physician.
In addit ion, during study  disrupt ion there may be a delay between confirming eligibilit y of a 
patient and ei ther enrolment into the study  or commencing of dosing with study  treatm ent. If 
this delay  is outsi de the screening window specified in Sect ion5.4, the patient will need to be 
rescreened to reconfirm eligibilit y before commencing study  procedures. This will provide 
another opportunit y to re-screen a patient in addit ion to that detailed in Section 5.4. The 
procedures detailed in Sect ion5.4must be undertaken to confirm eligibilit y using the same 
rando misat ion number as for the patient.

healt h devices.
During a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public health crisis, on -site visi ts may  be replaced by  
a telemedicine visit if allowed by  local/regional guidelines. Having a telemedicine contact 
with the pati ents will  allow AEs, concomitant medicat ion, and PRO quest ionnaires to be 
reported and documented.
H 5 At-home or Remote Location Study Intervention Administration 
Instructions
If a site visit is not possible, at -home or remote location administration of study treatment may 
be perform ed by a qualified HCP , provi ded this is acceptable within local regulat ion/guidance, 
or by  the pati ent or hi s/her caregiver . The option of at -home or remote location study 
treatm ent administration ensures pat ients safet y in cases o f a pandemic where patients may be 
at increased risk by travelling to the study  site. This will  also minimise interruption of study  
treatm ent administration during other study  disruptio ns, eg, site closures due to natural

Disease response assessment will be evaluated using the Lugano 2014 Classificat ion for NHL  
(Cheson et al 2014 ).
Response assessments will be done by the invest igators and independent ly assessed by the 
BICR, as determined by Lugano 2014 Cl assificati on response criteria. The BICR will cond uct 
response evaluat ions in accordance with the BICR charter (provided separately from this 
protocol ). Primary  and secondary efficacy  endpoints will  be based on BICR review . Blinded 
independent central review assessment will not be reported back to Sites. Investigator's 
assessment overall disease response will also be collected in eCRF .
Tumour assessment will be made for target lesio ns (ie, measurable disease), non- target lesio ns 
(ie, non -measurable disease), organ enlargement (eg, spleen, liver), and new l esions on CT 
and co mbined with visual assessment of PET -CT for response assessment ( Cheson et al 2014, 
TableI20).
Visual Interpretation of PET -CT Scans
Variation in FDG uptake in a nodal or extranodal sites indicat ive for lympho ma will be 
visually assessed using the Deauville 5 -point scale.
Target lesio ns
Up to a m aximum  of 6dominant, measurable lymph nodal or extranodal lesio ns should be 
assessed as target lesio ns and documented at baseline and throughout the study.
A lesio n will  be considered measurable if:
For nodal lesio ns: LDi > 1.5cm
For extranodal lesio n: LDi > 1cm
Lesio ns visible on PET but not on CT/MRI to be assigned as non -target lesio ns.
Target nodal or extranodal lesio ns nodes should be selected according to all o f the following:
They  should be clearly  measurable in at least 2perpendicular dimensio ns
If possible, they  should be fro m disparate regions of the body
They  should include mediast inal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites 
are invo lved
The perpendicular long and short axis diameters will be measur ed and recorded in the 
transverse plane at baseline and fo llow-up.

Capivasertib -D361FC00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 151of 185For the selected target lymph nodal lesio ns, the sum o f the product of the perpendicular 
diameters will be calculated with the percentage change fro m baseline for assessment of 
response and nadir for assessment of progression.
Non-target lesions:
All other lesio ns (including nodal, extranodal, and assessable disease) not selected as target 
lesions, as well as truly non -measurable sites of disease should be fo llowed as nonmeasurable 
disease ( eg, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial 
effusio ns, ascites) and should be factored into the overall response assessment. Non -target 
lesions will be documented at baseline and throughout the study . Measurement o f these 
lesions is not requi red to be docum ented on the eCRFs. 
Spleen involvement
Spleen will be considered to be normal if size o f its vert ical length (cranial -caudal  
measurement) is ≤ 13 cm. For pati ents wi th splenomegaly at baseline, spleen vert ical length 
will be assessed at screening and all subsequent response evaluat ions.
Liver involvement
Intrahepat ic lesions shoul d be considered as target, non -target or new lesio n as applicable. For 
patients wi th baseline hepatom egaly , the l ongest diam eter of the liver will be assessed at 
screening and all subsequent response evaluations.
Bone Marrow involvement
Bone m arrow involvement by  lymphom a docum ented by  aspirate and/or bi opsy  will be 
reported on the eCRF as present or absent.

aA score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especially if at the time of 
an interim scan. However, in studies involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be 
preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid under treatment). Measured dominant 
lesions: Up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly 
measurable in 2 diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should 
include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions inclu de those in solid 
organs (eg, liver spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on 
palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered n ot measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for 
measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is an y site of 
suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural 
effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be 
confirmed and followed by imaging. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, bone 
marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response, but 
should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activatio n as a result of 
chemotherapy of myeloid growth factors).

Assessment of new lesions
Appearance of any  new lesio ns > 1.5cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy , even if all 
other l esions are decreasin g shoul d be considered progression. Increased FDG uptake in a 
previously unaffected site should only be considered progression after confirmat ion with other 
modalities (eg, CT , MRI, biopsy ).
In pati ents wi th no history  of pulm onary lympho ma, new nodules ident ified by CT are benign 
and should be considered negative for lymphoma. These lesio ns ty pically represent infect ious 
or inflammatory  lesions; therefore, if FDG posit ive, should not be considered posit ive for 
lympho ma in the absence o f confirmatory  tests, (eg, histology).
The presence or absence of new lesio ns will be recorded in the eCRF .
Overall Response Assessment
The efficacy endpo ints are based on the overall response assessment, which is co mbining the 
radiological  response from  PET/CT scans, the bone marrow findings (if applicable) and any 
additional clinical  finding, incl uding cy tologic or histopathologic findings for each disease

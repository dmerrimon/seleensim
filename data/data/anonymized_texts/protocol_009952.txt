 2. SYNOPSIS  
Name of Sponsor/  Company:  Alkermes, Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product:  Naltrexone  
Name of Active Ingredient:  Naltrexone  
Title of S tudy:  A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Naltrexone for use 
in Conjunction with Buprenorphine in Adults with Opioid Use Disorder Transitioning from 
Buprenorphine Maintenance Prior to First Dose of VIVITROL® 
Investigator(s): This is a multicenter study in the United States  
Study Period:  
Estimated date of first subject’s consent:  Q2 2016 
Estimated date of last subject’s last visit : Q4 2017  Phase of Development:  3 
Objectives:  
Primary:  To evaluate the efficacy  of oral naltrexone used in conjunction with buprenorphine in adults 
with Opioid Use Disorder transitioning from buprenorphine maintenance prior to the first dose of 
VIVITROL.  
Secondary:  To determine the safety  and tolerability of oral naltrexone used in conjunction with 
buprenorphine in adults with Opioid Use Disorder transitioning from buprenorphine maintenance prior 
to the first dose of VIVITROL. 
Methodology: This Phase 3, r andomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will 
evaluate a dosing schedule for active versu s placebo oral naltrexone coadministered with buprenorphine 
(BUP ) in BUP -dependent individuals prior to first dose of VIVITROL. Eligible subje cts will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment groups (naltrexone + BUP or placebo naltrexone 
[PBO- N] + B UP) for induction onto VIVITROL, stratified according to low (<8  mg/day) versus high 
(8 mg/day) BUP maintenance dose at the time of initiation of the BUP L ead-in P eriod . 
This study includes : 
• BUP  Lead -in Period : 5-day stabilization on 4 mg/day BUP (or less, if entry dose is lower); 
outpatient Days -5 through -3; r esidential Days -2 and -1 (option for earlier residential 
admission at the study clinician’s discretion)  
• Treatment Period: Transitional dosing with oral naltrexone or PBO -N in conjunction with 
BUP taper; residential Days  1/1a to 7 
• VIVITROL Induction and Post -VIVITROL Observation  Period : 
− A naloxone challenge and administration of VIVITROL on Day  8/8a prior to discharge 
− Post- VIVITROL outpatient monitoring (Days  9-11) 
The study design is presented in the schematic below . 
Evaluation of withdrawal symptoms will occur  throughout the  BUP Lead-in Period , the Treatment 
Period , and the VIVITROL Induction and Post-VIVITROL Observation P eriod (Day s -5 through 11). 
Clinical testing session s to monitor opioid withdrawal effects  in response to study drug will occur on 
Days  1/1a through 7. Up to 2 additional study visits may be conducted (Day s 1a and 8a), as needed, for 
subjects who do not meet criteria for proceeding with Day  1 or Day  8 procedures . In addition, subjects

*Subjects maintained on <4 mg at Day -5 will continue on their current dose until 
the Treatment Period taper calls for further decrease to establish a consistent daily dose prior to transitional dosing with naltrexone (see Section 8.2.1).
 
Number of Subjects Planned:  Approximately 92 subjects are planned to be randomized; 46 subjects 
per treatment group.  
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  To be included in this study, subjects must be between 18 and 60 years of 
age (inclusive) at screening and be willing to provide written informed consent. Subjects must have a 
history of opioid use disorder diagnosis (according to criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual, 5th edition [DSM -5]) for at least the prior 6 consecutive months. Subjects must have a history of 
prescribed  BUP  (or buprenorphine/naloxone [BUP/Nx])  maintenance for the prior 3 or more consecutive 
months and must be maintained at a dose of ≤8 mg per day for at least 30 days prior to initiating the 
lead-in period (Day  -5; to be confirmed at screening by self- report, urine toxicology and prescr iption 
confirmation).Subjects must be voluntarily seeking treatment for opioid use disorder and be motivated to 
receive antagonist therapy.  
Investigational Product, Dosage, Duration and Mode of Administration: Naltrexone will be administered as 2  oral doses, given at least 1  hour apart, on Days 1/1a to 7, as indicated below.

 Reference Therapy, Dosage, Duration and Mode of administration: Placebo naltrexone (PBO -N) 
tablets will match the naltrexone drug product and will be administered as 2 oral doses, given at least 
1 hour apart, on Days 1/1a to 7. 
Sublingual BUP  (≤4 mg) will be administered daily to all subjects during the BUP Lead -in P eriod  
(Days  -5 to -1). On Days 1/1a to Day 4 , the BUP  dose will be tapered  down to 0 mg (i e, ≤4 mg on 
Days  1/1a, 2 mg on Days  2-3 and 0 mg on Days  4-8/8a).  
Duration of Study:  The study will last approximately 9  weeks; up to 3 weeks for screening (Days -26  
to -6), approximately 2 weeks for BUP Lead -In Period and Treatment Period, 4 to 5 days for VIVITROL 
induction and post-VIVITROL monitoring, and a 4-week follow-up period.

 Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
• The proportion of subjects who receive and tolerate VIVITROL injection on D ay 8/8a as 
demonstrated by mild (COWS ≤12 or SOWS ≤10) opioid withdrawal symptoms following 
VIVITROL administration  
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
• Proportion of days with COWS peak score ≤12 during the T reatment Period prior to the 
VIVITROL injection  (Day s 1/1a-7) 
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• Proportion of post- VIVITROL days (Days 9-11) in which subjects in each group 
demonstrate mild (COWS ≤12) opioid withdrawal 
• Mean peak COWS scores during the T reatment Period and VIVITROL Induction and Post-
VIVITROL Observa tion Period ( Days 1/1a -11) 
• Area under the curve (AUC ) for COWS scores during the Treatment Period and VIVITROL 
Induction and Post- VIVITROL Observation Period (Days  1/1a-11) 
• Mean score for “desire for opioids ” VAS during the Treatment Period and VIVITROL 
Induction and Post- VIVITROL Observation Period (Days  1/1a-11)  
Exploratory Endpoints 
• Number and proportion of subjects in PGART response category at the end of the Post-
VIVITROL Observation P eriod (Day  11) 
• Change from baseline in pupil diameter following study drug administration during the Treatment P eriod (Days  1/1a -7) 
• Change in frequency of substance use from screening to Day  36 assessed via the QSUI  
• AUC for SOWS scores during the Treatment Period and VIVITROL Induction and Post -
VIVITROL Observation Period (Days  1/1a -11) 
• Change from baseline in standardized T scores for cognitive  assessments  
Efficacy Analysis: The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using logistic regression with 
treatment as a factor.  
Safety: Reported Adverse Events (AE) terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms and system organ classes. The incidence of treatment -emergent 
AEs will be summarized by treatment group and overall by system organ class, and preferred terms 
within each system organ class. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and AEs resulting in treatment 
discontinuation will also be summarized. AEs occurring during the treatment period preceding the naloxone challenge will be analyze d separately from AEs occurring on or after the naloxone challenge 
day. 
The change from baseline in other safety parameters will be summarized by treatment group. 
Concomitant medications will be categorized and presented using the World Health Organization 
(WHO) drug Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) classification system.

Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 Number and percentage of subjects initiating concomitant medications, including ancillary medications, 
during the induction period will be summarized. 
Sample Size Considerations:  The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects who receive 
and tolerate VIVITROL injection on Day 8/8a as demonstrated by mild (COWS ≤12 or SOWS ≤10) 
opioid withdrawal symptoms following VIVITROL administration. 
Assuming the proportion of subjects receiving and tolerating VIVITROL administration is 9 0% in 
Group 1 (naltrexone + BUP) and 60% in Group 2 (PBO -N + BUP), a sample size of  approximately 
46 subjects per treatment group will provide at least 90% power to detect a statistically significant 
difference between the two treatment groups  at 5% level of significance in a two -sided test .

 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Alkermes is developing oral naltrexone to be used in conjunction with buprenorphine (BUP) for 
adults with opioid use disorder prior to the first dose of VIVITROL®. Opioid use disorder is 
among the fastest growing substance abuse issues in the United States, which is primarily 
attrib utable to the rising rates of prescription drug abuse ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration 2013) . The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reported that over 
2 million people in the United States suffer from substance use disorder related to opioid pain relievers, and in the past year 289,000 people abused heroin ( National Institute on Drug Abuse 
2014; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014) . The number of 
individuals with opioid use disorder continues to rise, along with corresponding increases in morbidity and mortality  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011) . VIVITROL, an 
extended release, injectable form of naltrexone, was FDA approved in 2010 for the prevention of 
relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. The partial opioid agonist, BUP , 
has been approved since 2002 in the U.S. for office-based prescribing for the treatment of opiate dependence by preventing symptoms of opiate withdrawal. While BUP  is effective for many 
patients, there are no studies to support the optimal duration of treatment, and therefore opioid 
agonist treatment is usually considered an open-ended, long- term maintenance approach. Yet 
some individuals, for reasons of either treatment success or treatment failure with BUP , wish to 
transition to become opioid-free. After an initially favorable or unfavorable response, a proportion of BUP -maintained patients leave treatment every month. Relapse is a common 
outcome among patients who have discontinued BUP  (Ling et al, 2009; Weiss et al, 2011) . 
Transition to injection naltrexone represents a mechanism for protecting against relapse, but there is currently very little consensus on the best method for opioid detoxification from BUP  
prior to VIVITROL induction. Various opioid agonist/antagonist regimens have been proposed 
to minimize the severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms (Sigmon et al, 2012) . A common 
component of many regimens is the use of low doses of naltrexone to shorten the withdrawal 
period. However, there are no clear guidelines or standards on how to successfully manage patients during the transition period from BUP  to VIVITROL, or on the appropri ate length of 
this transition. Establishing a reproducible regimen to transition patients from BUP  maintenance 
to VIVITROL treatment represents an important clinical goal.  
Current prescribed treatments for opioid dependence, including VIVITROL, may be 
implemented in an inpatient or outpatient facility. Due to the rising costs of inpatient treatment as 
well as patient preference, an increasing number of providers are initiating treatment in an outpatient setting (Day et al, 2005) . However, outpatient tr eatment is not without its challenges; 
rates of completion tend to be low and rates of relapse to opioid use following detoxification are high ( Day et al, 2005). Kleber et al. reported that approximately 80% of patients relapse during 
outpatient detox ification without transition to medication -assisted treatment  (Kleber 2007 ), 
which can be partly attributed to patients’ strong desire for opioids as well as experiences of intolerable withdrawal symptoms including gastrointestinal stress, pain, anxiety  and insomnia. 
One recent study comparing rates of outpatient induction onto VIVITROL for opioid-dependent 
patients found that a regimen combining ascending doses of oral naltrexone with a brief

Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 decreasing BUP taper demonstrated superiority to a standard BUP -assisted detoxification ( 56.1% 
versu s 32.7%; χ 12=6.58, p=0.010). These results support the safety, efficacy and tolerability of 
low-dose naltrexone, in conjunction with brief BUP  dosing and adjunctive non-opioid 
medications, for initiating adults with opioid dependence onto VIVITROL (Sullivan et al, 2016) . 
While agonist maintenance is protective against opioid withdrawal, the question of how long 
patients should be maintained on BUP  to provide adequate protection against relapse is of 
considerable clinical relevance.  Several studies have found that for heroin or prescription opioid 
users initially transitioned to BUP , rates of relapse are high after stabilization for 4 weeks 
followed by 7- or 28- day taper  (Nielsen et al, 2013 ). Previous trials have noted high relapse rates 
following BUP  stabilization periods of up to 3 months. In a multi- site CTN trial, following 
4 weeks of BUP /naloxone maintenance with flexible dosing, only 44% of patients were opioid-
free at its completion. At 1 -month follow-up, the percentage of abstinent patients who had 
undergone either taper co ndition had fallen to 18%  (Ling et al, 2009) . Another recent study 
examined the efficacy of b rief vs. extended BUP /naloxone treatment, with differing counseling 
intensities, for patients dependent on prescription opioids. Weiss et al. (2011) found that more 
than 90% of patients relapsed after an initial 3- week taper; following re -stabilization for  
12 weeks, over 90% of patients again relapsed when tapered off BUP /naloxone, even in patients 
receiving counseling in addition to standard medical management ( Weiss et al, 2011) . However, 
there has been little research on the outcome of patients tapered off BUP  after longer periods of 
stabilization, nor on methods to reduce the risk of relapse after tapering off BUP . 
5.2. Study Rationale  
Developing a strategy to assist patients in safely tapering from BUP  by induction onto antagonist 
therapy has immediate clinical relevance, as safely transitioning patients off BUP  would enable 
more opioid- dependent patients to access treatment.  In areas of the country where BUP  providers 
have reached maximal federally permissible limits of prescribing for 100 patients, opioid -
dependent individuals seeking treatment may face wait ing lists. While some patients who wish to 
discontinue BUP  after years of stability are unable to discontinue because of attendant opioid 
withdrawal, others seeking induction cannot be accommodated and bear the risks of ongoing opioid abuse, including overdose, risk of contracting hepatitis B or C or HIV, needing to resort to crime to support the habit, and so forth. In addition, as of May 2013, 11 states have imposed 
lifetime limits on prescriptions of BUP  for the treatment of opioid dependence, rangi ng fr om 
12 months to 36 months  (Rinaldo et al, 2013) . Finally, given the stigma asso ciated with chronic 
maintenance on opioid substitution, development of an effective strategy to assist patients in safely transitioning from BUP  to injection naltrexone is important and could help attract more 
patients into treatment.  
5.3. Rationale for Selection of Dosing Regimen  
Mannelli et al. reported findings from an open- label study evaluating the use of low doses of oral 
naltrexone, in addition to BUP  and ancillary medications, to safely transition subjects from 
opioid dependence to VIVITROL treatment (Mannelli et al, 2014) . The regimen used in this 
study was based upon prior clinical experience wherein low doses of naltrexone, combined with 
a methadone taper, reduced the severity of withdrawal symptoms during inpatient detoxification 
(Mannelli et al, 2003; Mannelli et al, 2009; Mannelli et al, 2012) . Subjects (N=20) were g iven 
Page 16 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 increasing doses of naltrexone during a 7-day outpatient period, in conjunction with 3 days of 
BUP . Withdrawal discomfort, craving, drug use and adverse events  (AEs)  were assessed daily 
until the administration of VIVITROL on Day 8. Adverse events were assessed weekly over the following month. Fourteen of the 20 subjects received VIVITROL, and 13 subjects completed all subsequent safety assessments. Withdrawal discomfort, craving and  opioid or other drug use 
were significantly lower during the detoxification/induction period and after VIVITROL administration, when compared with the assessments administered at pretreatment baseline. No serious AEs  (SAEs) occurred. The 7-day outpatient regimen using low doses of naltrexone, in 
combination with BUP , in patients with opioid use disorder prior to induction to VIVITROL was 
reported to be safe and well tolerated. The current study design is based on the regimen described in Mannelli’s recent study (Mannelli et al, 2014) . 
Recruitment of a clinical population maintained at a  BUP dose of ≤8 mg/day at study entry 
supports tolerability of the transition from opioid agonist maintenance, while increasing generalizability.  Since BUP doses of <8 mg/day yield <80% μ-opioid receptor occupancy 
(Greenwald et al, 2003)  and increase risk of relapse (D'amore et al, 2012) , these doses require 
clinical management within the protocol (ie, BUP Lead -in phase). In light of difficulty tapering 
to doses below 8 mg BUP ( Ling et al, 2009) , this study  includes 2 days of res idential monitoring 
of BUP 4 mg/day to confirm tolerability via Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS )/Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( SOWS ) prior to randomization. 
Findings from a recent open -label pilot study (Dakwar and Kleber 2015 ) support the safety and 
tolerability of the proposed regimen for BUP-dependent individuals transition ing to VIVITROL 
during a 7- day inpatient stay.  In that  investigation , subjects who had tapered to 2 mg daily of 
BUP  took their final dose on the day of admission (Day 1). On Day  3, they received 6.25 mg 
naltrexone and then received ascending doses on Days 4 through 6 (12.5, 25, 50 mg). Subjects who tolerated the 50 mg dose of oral naltrexone received 380 mg VIVITROL by intramuscular injection on Day 6. Adjuvant medications included clonidine, clonazepam, zolpidem, ibuprofen 
and loperamide.  Investigators found that 100% (6/6) of subjects were able to transition to 
VIVITROL, and subjects exhibited a significant decrease in SOWS scores (p=0.043) during this 
period. The approach used by Dakwar and Kleber (Dakwar and Kleber 2015) for transitioning 
BUP -dependent adults is largely co nsistent with that outlined by Sigmon et al. (Sigmon et al, 
2012) , who summariz ed clinical practices for transitioning patients from short-acting opioid 
agonists to naltrexone: namely, the combined use of BUP , oral naltrexone and  ancillary 
medications to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms.

7.3. Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects who initiate screening but are not randomized will be considered screen failures.  A 
subject who has previously screen failed may be allowed, at Investigator discretion, to repeat the 
screening process, provided that the circumstance that led to screen failure is no longer present. 
A randomized subject who is eligible to receive the naloxone challenge wil l be considered a 
treatment completer. Subjects completing all visits during the follow -up period will be 
categorized as completing the study.  
A subject may be discontinued from the study at any time if it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue or he/she chooses to withdraw. Reasons for subject withdrawal include: 
• AE 
• Lack of efficacy  
• Withdrawal by subject 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation 
• Study terminated by sponsor 
Page 21 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 • Other  
If a subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the study for any reason, any ongoing AEs will be 
followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the investigator  or until the subject is deemed 
by the investigator to be lost to follow -up. If, in the opinion of the investigator, it is necessary to 
monitor a subject beyond the last safety follow-up visit, the follow-up period may be extended as necessary. In such instances, the sponsor and the investigator will agree to an acceptable follow-up schedule. 
In the event that a subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the investigator should make a 
reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for withdrawal, while fully re specting the subject’s 
rights. The subject should be encouraged to return to the study center for an early termination 
(ET) visit, as close as possible to the subject’s date of study withdrawal. The ET visit will match 
the procedures at Day 9 (Table 4) . If the subject fails or refuses to return to the study center, an 
attempt must be made to contact the subject in order to assess as many safety parameter s as 
possible. All data collected remotely must be documented and kept in the subject’s record.
 
The investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who fail to complete the study. The 
reason for study discontinuation will be entered  on the appropriate electronic case report form 
(eCRF). A subject will be deemed lost to follow -up after 3 attempts at contact have been made. 
The third  attempt at contact must be a certified letter accompanied by a survey inquiring the 
reason for study discontinuation. All a ttempts at contact will be documented.  
7.4. Replacement of Subjects  
Randomized subjects who withdraw prior to the completion of the study will not be replaced.

 8. STUDY DESIGN 
8.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will evaluate a 
dosing schedule for active versu s placebo oral naltrexone coadministered with BUP  in 
BUP -dependent individuals prior to first dose of VIVITROL. Eligible subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment groups (naltrexone + BUP or placebo naltrexone [PBO -N] + BUP) for induction onto VIVITROL , stratified according to low (<8  mg/day) v ersus 
high (8 mg/day) BUP maintenance dose at the time of initiation of the BUP L ead-in P eriod . 
Approximately 92 subjects are planned to be randomized; 46 subjects per group. 
The study participation for each subject will last approximately 9  weeks; up to 3 weeks for 
screening (Days  -26 to -6 ; during which time subjects will remain  under the care of their original 
BUP provider ), approximately 2 weeks for the BUP Lead -in Period and the Treatment Period 
(Days  -5 to 7), 4 to 5 days for VIVITROL induction and post- VIVITROL monitoring  and a 
4-week outpatient follow-up period. 
This study includes: 
• BUP Lead -in Period : Outpatient Days  -5 through -3; r esidential Days -2 and -1 
(option for earlier residential admission at the study clinician’s discretion)  
• Treatment Period: Transitional dosing with oral naltrexone or PBO-N in conjunction 
with BUP taper; residential Days  1* to 7 
* Subjects who do not qualify for randomization on Day 1 will receive Day  -1 BUP 
dosing and repeat Day 1 assessments and procedures on the following day, Day 1a. 
• VIVITROL Induction and Post-VIVITROL Observation Period: 
− A naloxone challenge and administration of VIVITROL on Day  8* prior to 
discharge  
* Subjects who do not qualify to receive VIVITROL  on Day 8 will receive Day  7 
study drug (naltrexone/PBO- N), and complete Day  7 assessments and 
procedures. Day  8 assessments an d procedures will be repeated  the following 
day ( Day 8a). 
− Post-VIVITROL outpatient monitoring (Days 9-11) 
The design is presented  in Figure  1. Each phase is described further below.  
Evaluation of withdrawal symptoms will occur  throughout the BUP Lead -in Period , the 
Treatment Period, and the VIVITROL Induction and Post- VIVITROL Observation P eriod  
(Days  -5 through 11). On Day s -2 through 8/8a, AM and PM vital sign s, COWS/SOWS, and 
visual analogue scale ( VAS ) will be measured  (see Section  8.4 for details regarding the timing of 
these assessments) . On the day of discharge (Day 8/8a), PM vital sign s, COWS/SOWS and VAS 
will be measured prior to discharge. In addition to the AM and PM assessments described above, 
clinical testing sessions to monitor opioid withdr awal effects in response t o study drug will occur 
Page 23 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 on Days 1 through 7. Also, subjects will receive psychoeducational counseling starting on Day -5 
and throughout the Treatment Period. 
Up to 2 additional study visits may be conducted (Days 1a and 8a), as needed, for subjects who 
do not meet criteria for proceeding with procedures on Day 1 or Day 8. 
The combined outpatient and residential design of this trial has been selected to ensure 
tolerability of lower -dose BUP prior to introduction of the treatment regimen, and to afford the 
most accurate measurement possible of opioid withdrawal during the transition from BUP 
maintenance to first dose of VIVITROL. Multiple daily observations of opioid withdrawal will 
be recorded in an environment free from access to nonstudy opioids, thus enabling a more direct 
comparison of the efficacy of a dosing schedule for active versus placebo oral naltrexone coadministered with BUP to transition BUP -dependent individuals to first dose of VIVITROL. 
Moreover, this study is the first of its size to examine the transition from opioid agonist to antagonist therapy in this subject population, necessitating careful safety monitoring. Conducting the Treatment Period in a controlled residential environment will ensure that safety and 
tolerability are carefully monitored. This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy  of 
this procedure for use in a residential or outpatient setting for patients seeking to discontinue 
BUP and transit ion to treatment with VIVITROL.  
See Section  8.4 for more information on withdrawal assessments and clinical testing sessions, 
including a timetable for testing sessions in  Figure  2. In addition, the Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression (HAM- D) and cognitive assessments will be con ducted at screening and on Days -1, 
22 and  36.

8.2. Buprenorphine Lead -in and Treatment Periods  
8.2.1. Buprenorphine Lead- in Period  
Following a screening period of up to 21 days, all subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be gin 
a 5-day lead -in period consisting of 3 da ily outpatient visits (Day s -5 to -3) , where subjects will 
report to the research clinic daily to undergo withdrawal assessments and to receive a dose of 
Page 24 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 BUP under supervised conditions, then admission  to the residential unit on Day -2 in order to 
ensure tolerability of the BUP maintenance dose in a supervised setting. Subjects may be 
admitted for residential stay earlier  if it is the clinical judgment of the investigator that residential 
care is needed for management of opioid withdrawal symptoms. In the event that a subject is 
admitted for  the residential stay early (on Days  -5, -4, or -3), AM and PM vital signs, 
COWS/SOWS, and  VAS will also be measured . Ancillary medications will not be provided 
during the outpatient visits (Days -5 to -3), unless needed for treatment or prophylaxis of a 
documented AE. In the event that a subject is admitted for the residential stay early (on Days  -5, 
-4, or -3), the ancillary medication regimen, which begins on Day - 2 (see Section  8.9.2), will 
begin as soon as the subject becomes residential.  To ensure that all subjects initially stabilize on 
a dose of ≤4 mg BUP daily, and given that such doses are lower than those which afford full μ-
opioid receptor occupancy, up to 4 mg BUP  will be administered sublingually once daily for 
5 days  to establish a consistent daily dose prior to transitional dosing with naltrexone. Subjects 
entering the BUP  Lead -in P eriod at doses of BUP >4 mg/day will have the option, at the 
discretion of the study physician, to receive an additional take-home dose of BUP 2 mg on Day -
5 only. Subjects maintained on ≤4 mg at Day -5 will continue on their current dose until the 
Treatment Period taper calls for  further decrease . Urine toxicology screens will be collected daily 
during this period. Subjects may miss a single day during the 3 -day outpatient BUP Lead -in 
Period (Days -5 to - 3). 
8.2.2. Treatment Period  
Following 5 days of stabilization on ≤4 mg BUP, on the morning of Day 1 of the Treatment 
Period , subjects will undergo an assessment of withdrawal symptoms ( the eligibility COWS 
score) . Randomization will occur prior to study drug dosing on Day 1. Eligible subjects will 
demonstrate ability to tolerate the lead -in BUP dose based upon exhibiting minimal/mild opioid 
withdrawal symptoms (as confirmed by COWS score ≤12) on Day 1. Subjects who do not 
qualify for randomization on Day 1 will receive Day  -1 BUP dosing and complete the remaining 
Day -1 assessments and procedures. These subjects will then repeat Day  1 assessments and 
procedures on the following day, Day 1a.  
The Treatment Per iod will consist of tapering doses of BUP ( on Days  1/1a-3) in conjunction 
with ascending doses of oral naltrexone or PBO- N (Days  1/1a-7) ; see Table 3.

a The second  dose of naltrexone/PBO -N will be administered at least 60  minutes after the first dose of 
naltrexone/PBO -N, following a clinical evaluation of tolerability (based upon withdrawal symp toms) . 
b On days when subjects receive both BUP and naltrexone/PBO -N, BUP will be given sublingually immediately 
following the second dose of oral naltrexone/PBO -N. If a subject does not qualify for the second dose of 
naltrexone/PBO -N, the subject  will still receive the BUP dose for that day and will be monitored in the clinic for 
60 minutes following the BUP dose.  
c Subjects maintained on <4 mg at study entry will continue on their current dose until the treatment period taper 
calls for further decrease to establish a consistent daily dose prior to transitional dosing  with naltrexone . 
d Subjects entering the BUP  Lead -in Period at doses of BUP >4 mg/day will have the option, at the discretion of the 
study physician, to receive an additional take -home dose of BUP 2  mg on Day - 5 only.  
e If a subject has a positive naloxone challenge on Day  8, he/she will not receive the VIVITROL injection , but will 
receive Day  7 study drug (naltrexone/PBO -N), and complete Day  7 assessments and procedures. He/she will be 
offered the opportunity to remain in the residential unit overnight and may repeat the naloxone challenge the following day (Day  8a) to qualify for VIVITROL administration.  
The total daily naltrexone or PBO -N allocation will be split over 2  separate doses administered at 
least 60  minutes apart. Administration of the second naltrexone or PBO-N dose will depend upon 
how well the first wa s tolerated . 
On Day s 1/1a through 7, subjects will undergo a baseline COWS and SOWS assessment prior to 
the first dose of naltrexone or PBO-N (see Figure  2). On  Day 1 /1a, the eligibility COWS score 
may serve as the predose COWS score, if conducted within 60 minutes prior to dosing. At 
30 and 60 minutes postdose, the COWS and SOWS will be re- administered. If withdrawal 
symptoms are stable (ie,  increase of ≤5 points in COWS score from predose COWS) at the 
60-minute assessment, the second dose of oral naltrexone or PBO- N will be administered. For 
these early qualifying subjects , the next COWS/SOWS assessments at 90 and 120 minutes post-
first dose will constitute their post- second dose assessments.  
Subjects who did not qualify for the second dose of naltrexone or PBO- N at 60  minutes will also 
receive the 90 - and 120- minute COWS/SOWS assessments  (see Figure  2), and if their 
withdrawal symptoms have stabilized sufficiently by 120  minutes post- first dose (ie, increase of 
Page 26 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 ≤5 points in COWS score from predose COWS), they will receive the second dose o f oral 
naltrexone or PBO- N at this time. These later qualifying subjects will undergo 2 additional 
COWS/SOWS assessments at 150 and 180 minutes post-first dose (30 and 60 minutes post-
second dose) to monitor withdrawal status following the second dose of naltrexone or PBO -N. 
Refer to Section  8.2.3 for instructions on how to proceed should withdrawal symptoms not 
stabilize by 120  minutes.

aClinical testing sessions will include the following assessments: vital signs (body 
temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), 
oxygen saturation, pupillometry, SOWS, COWS, Opioid Craving VAS. A window of +30 minutes is allowed for these assessments.
bSubjects whose COWS score is increased ≤ 5 points above the baseline COWS qualify

Buprenorphine will be administered sublingually immediately following the second oral 
naltrexone or PBO- N dose on Days 1/1 a through 3. If a subject does not qualify for the second 
dose of naltrexone or PBO -N, he/she will still receive the BUP dose for that day  (see 
Section  8.2.3). Subjects will remain under clinical observation for a minimum of 60 minutes  
after the BUP  dose to assess tolerability of withdrawal symptoms.  
8.2.3. Poorly Tolerated Doses 
If withdrawal symptoms increase substantially after the initial dos e of naltrexone or PBO -N 
(ie, COWS score increased >5  points from the predose COWS) and do not recede during 
subsequent COWS/SOWS testing (up to 120 minutes postdose), the subject will not receive the 
second dose of naltrexone or PBO-N, but may  receive the scheduled dose of BUP , as well as 
ancillary medications. Following BUP  administration, the subject will be observed for 
60 minutes in the clinical setting. In addition to the standing regimen of ancillary medications  
(see Section  8.9.2), subjects may be administered additional doses of ancillary medications, as 
needed to alleviate any marked withdrawal symptoms (ie, total COWS  score >12) not alleviat ed 
by BUP . The subject will continue all clinical testing  sessions and the dosing scheduled for the 
following day.

 8.3. Day 8/8a Naloxone Challenge and VIVITROL Injection  
8.3.1. Naloxone Challenge 
Prior to the start of the naloxone c hallenge, COWS/SOWS assessments will be administered. 
Subjects who are no longer exhibiting significant signs of withdrawal as demonstrated by COWS 
total score ≤12 on Day 8/8a will undergo a 2-part naloxone challenge as follows: 
Part 1: 
• Administer 1.5 mg * of naloxone intramuscularly in t he subject’s arm ( nondominant 
arm preferred for first injection)  
* Note: Each naloxone injection consists of 1.5 mg. Doses of naloxone sufficient to 
precipitate opioid withdrawal in the presence of short-acting opioids may not suffice 
to displace BUP from the μ-opioid receptor ( Gal 1989). 
• Administer COWS and SOWS at 10 and 20 minutes post-naloxone injection. Vital 
signs will be measured and the subject will remain under observation following the naloxone injection to monitor for safety  
− At each timepoint (10 and 20 minutes) the COWS score must be no more than 
2 points greater than the pre-naloxone baseline COWS score for subjects to 
qualify for Part  2. 
− If either the 10- or 20-minute C OWS score increases by >2 points from the 
pre-naloxone COWS, then the challenge is considered to be positive (s ee 
Section  8.3.3.1 for instructions on how to proceed following a positive naloxone 
challenge ). A positive challenge is indicative of a significant increase in 
withdrawal symptoms and physical dependence on opi oids. 
Part 2: 
• Administer second  naloxone injection (1.5 mg  [see Part  1 above regarding dose]  
naloxone in opposite arm to that used for first injection) 
• Administer COWS and SOWS at 10 and 20 minutes post-naloxone injection. Vital signs will be measured and the subject will remain under observation following the 
naloxone injection to monitor for safety  
− At each timepoint (10 and 20 minutes) the COWS score must be no more than 
2 points greater than the immediately previous Part  1 COW S score for subjects to 
qualify for VIVITROL injection 
− If either the 10- or 20-minute COWS score in  Part 2 increases by >2 points from 
the immediately previous  Part 1 COWS  score, then the challenge is considered to 
be positive. See Section  8.3.3.1 for how to proceed following a positive naloxone 
challenge.  
Eligibility for VIVITROL administration on Day  8/8a will consist of the 
following: Part  1 post-naloxone COWS scores increase by ≤2 points from pre-
naloxone scores and Part 2 post-naloxone COWS scores increase by ≤2 points from the immediately previous Part 1 score, with a total allowable increase of 
Page 28 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 ≤4 points in COWS total sco re for Part s 1 and 2 of the challenge combined. 
Subjects must have a total COWS score ≤16 following the naloxone challenge to 
qualify for VIVITROL administration.  Subjects with a positive naloxone 
challenge on Day  8 will have the opportunity to retry the challenge on the 
following day (Day 8a; s ee Section  8.3.3.1) 
8.3.2. VIVITROL Injection  
If the naloxone challenge is negative,  a single intramuscular (gluteal) injection of VIVITROL 
380 mg will be administered following the naloxone challenge on Day 8/8a . Subjects will remain 
on-site for 1 hour for safety observation following VIVITROL administration and then may be 
discharged home, following PM withdrawal assessments . They will be asked to return for 
outpatient visits on the 3 days following VIVITROL injection  (Days  9-11). 
8.3.3. Subjects Who Do Not Transition to VIVITROL 
Due to loss of opioid tolerance and a heightened risk for overdose in subjects who have trans itioned from BUP but have not received VIVITROL (due to subject withdrawal of consent 
or a positive naloxone challenge) , it is important that subjects be reinstated on BUP /Nx 
maintenance therapy and discharged to their trea tment provider to continue BUP ma intenance 
and discuss future treatment options. 
8.3.3.1. Treatment Options for Subjects with a Positive Naloxone Challenge 
8.3.3.1.1. Day 8 
Subjects with a positive naloxone challenge on Day 8 will not receive the VIVITROL injection 
that day. In such cases, these subjects wil l receive Day  7 study drug (naltrexone/PBO- N), and 
complete Day  7 assessments and procedures (per Figure  2). Pre- and postdose COWS will be 
assessed for  clinical safety purposes only. Day 8 assessments and procedures will be repeated the 
following day ( Day 8a). 
For s ubjects who do not wish to receive a naloxone challenge on Day 8a, the study staff will 
notify the subject’s BUP provider  prior to discharge, to inform him/her  of the treatment and 
medications the subject has  received during the course of the study, and of the  need for a follow-
up appointment. Such subjects will be restarted on BUP/Nx while on the residential unit at a 
dose deemed clinically sufficient . Depending upon how many days of blinded treatment 
medication they have received, the investigator may decide that, for safety reasons, the subject 
should remain in the residential unit for up to 48 hours. Upon discharge he/she will be provided 
up to 3 days of BUP maintenance. The subject may choose to discuss other future treatment options with his/her BUP provider. 
8.3.3.1.2. Day 8a 
Subjects with a positive naloxone challenge on Day 8a  will not receive the VIVITROL injection 
that day. In such cases, the study staff will follow the discharge procedures described in 
Section  8.3.3.1.1 above. 
Page 29 of 174

Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 8.3.3.2. Treatment Options for Subjects Who Discontinue  Prior to Receiving 
VIVITROL  
For subjects who discontinue from the study during the course of the residential period, the 
procedures described in Section  8.3.3.1.2 will be followed.  
8.3.4. Referrals to Post -Study VIVITROL Provider  
Subjects who have received VIVITROL  will return to their previous BUP provider to receive 
subsequent VIVITROL treatment, unless the subject has chosen to transfer to a new treatment 
provider. Study staff will work with subjects to identify local VIVITROL treatment providers, as 
necessary.  Subjects will be asked to sign consent for release of clinical record, not to include 
study data, to contact the post- study VIVITROL pr ovider for purposes of follow- up medical 
care.  
8.4. Withdrawal Assessments Throughout the Residential Period  
Every morning (AM) and every evening (PM) during the residential  period (Days -2 to 8/8a ) 
subjects will under go a basic withdrawal evaluation  consisting of COWS, SOWS, VAS , and  vital 
signs  (Figure  2). The AM assessments should be conducted first thing in the morning and 
≥60 minute s prior to the baseline assessments. On Day 8/8a, the COWS/SOWS conducted as 
part of the AM assessments can serve as the pre-naloxone challenge COWS/SOWS if they are 
administered within an hour (≤60 minutes) prior to  the initial administration of naloxone in Part 
1 of the naloxone c hallenge. The PM assessments should be conducted in the evening. In the 
event that they cannot be conducted in the evening, the earliest they can be completed is  at 
60 minutes after the 120-minute post- first NTX/PBO -N dose for early qualifiers , and at 
60 minutes after the 180-minute post- first NTX/PBO -N dose for late qualifiers. T he 60- minute 
post- VIVITROL injection  assessments on Day 8/8a can serve as the PM assessments for those 
days. 
In the event that a  subject is admitted for the residential stay early (on Days  -5, -4 or - 3), 
standard AM and PM assessments should be conducted. For subjects who remain on the residential unit for clinical stabilization on BUP , these study assessments are not required . 
On Days  1/1a to 7, subjects will undergo daily clinical testing to  measure opioid withdrawal 
effects  in response to study drug dosing. These clinical testing sessions  will include the 
following assess ments  (see Section  8.8 for more details on individual assessments): 
• Vital signs  (body temperature, respiration  rate, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure ) 
• Oxygen saturation 
• Pupillometry  
• COWS  
• SOWS  
• VAS  
A timetable for clinical testing sessions is provided in  Figure  2. On Days 1/1a to 7, clinical 
testing  sessions will begin approximately 15 minutes prior to  the first dose of naltrexone or 
Page 30 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 PBO -N and will last at least 120  minutes following the first dose (60 minutes  following the 
second  dose). Clinical testing may  potentially  last 180 minutes  for late qualifying subj ects who 
receive the second naltr exone or PBO -N dose at the 120-m inute timepoint (s ee Section  8.2.2 for 
more information regarding early and late qualification). A window of +30 minutes is allowed 
for these assessments.  
On Day  8/8a, VAS, COWS/SOWS, vital signs, and pupillometry will be collected pre -
VIVITROL injection,  and at 30 and 60 minutes post- VIVITROL injection. The final 
COWS/SOWS assessments of the naloxone challenge will also represent the pre- VIVITROL 
COWS/SOWS  scores.  Subjects will be discharged following the 60-minute post- VIVITROL 
assessments.  
8.5. Follow -up Period  
On Study Days  22 (±3  days) and 36 (±3  days) , subjects who have complet ed the Treatment 
Period and the VIVITROL Induction and Post-VIVITROL Observation P eriod (Day s 1/1a- 11) 
will return to the research center for 2  outpatient follow-up visits that will occur  2 and 4 weeks  
after the naloxone challenge/VIVITROL injection . 
8.6. Minimizing Risks 
Participants are fully informed by inve stigators of the potential side effects of the drugs and the 
risks of the procedures. In addition participants are advised about the risk of taking an opioid 
(BUP) in conjunction with benzodiazepines, other CNS depressant medicines or alcohol. 
Participants  are monitored for oxygen saturation and vital signs by trained medical staff during 
clinical testing  sessions. Emergency medical equipment is available in  the testing clinic  and the 
clinic is  located in either a hospital where a full medical emergency back- up team is constantly 
available; or a medical research facility with appropriate emergency response procedures . 
Additionally, guidelines have been developed for opioid administration such that oxygen saturation dictates whether supplemental oxygen will b e administered. Naloxone is available 
during all laboratory sessions in the event of serious respiratory depression. It is anticipated , 
however, that careful participant selection, dose selection and  participant monitoring will 
eliminate the need for such emergency care.  
Enrolling subjects who are currently under the care of waivered physicians with the ability to 
prescribe BUP  ensures that all subjects will have access to an addiction treatment provider at the 
completion of the study, or upon termination of participation in the trial. While it is anticipated 
that many subjects will transition to VIVITROL during the study, those who are not successful at 
induction will be advised  to return to BUP  maintenance under the care of their prior BUP 
treatment provider, with whom they can discuss additional treatment options. 
See Section  8.3.3.1 for instruc tions on how to proceed with subjects who are discharged without 
receiving VIVITROL . If not returned to a stable daily dose of BUP/Nx , these subjects  will be at 
greater risk for relapsing to illicit or non medical use of opioids. Relapse also carries the ri sk of 
overdose. 
Subjects who have transitioned to VIVITROL and wish to transition to a different treatment 
provider will be offered referrals to local providers who prescribe medication- assisted treatment, 
including VIVITROL and BUP .

f In addition to the study assessments conducted during the clinical testing sessions, vital signs will be measured each morning and evening throughout the 
residential period (Days  -2 to 8/8a and any additional residential days, in the case of earlier admission or later discharge). Vital signs (b lood pressure, heart rate, 
respiratory rate  and body temperature ) will be measured after the subject has been in a s eated  position for at least 5 minutes. In addition to standard vital sign 
measurements, clinical testing sessions on Days  1/1a to 7 will include oxygen saturation and pupillometry measurements  to assess wi thdrawal effects in 
response to drug dosing. Measurements will be  collected pre - and postdose as indicated in  Figure  2. Details regarding the timing of these assessments are 
provided in Section  8.4. 
g A urine drug screen will be performed at all specified timepoints . The urine drug screen should be performed in the morning. On Days 1/1a to 7, it should be 
performed  prior to the clinical testing sessions.  
h Eligibility will be confirmed prior to randomization and administration of the first dose of NTX/PBO -N. 
i Subjec ts not qualifying for randomization on Day 1 will receive the Day -1 BUP dose and will not receive NTX/PBO -N. Subjects not qualifying for 
VIVITROL on Day 8 will receive the Day 7 NTX/PBO- N dose, along with the COWS conducted for clinical safety purposes on ly. 
j Standing ancillary medication regimen begins on Day -2. In the event that a subject is admitted for the residential stay early (on Days  -5, -4, or -3), the ancillary 
medication regimen will begin as soon as the subject becomes residential.  Also , if needed for AE treatment or prophylaxis, ancillary medications may be 
initiated at the clinician’s discretion on or after Day -5 
k For subjects receiving VIVITROL on Day  8/8a, ancillary medications will be reduced as indicated in Table 6 . 
l COWS, SOWS and VAS to be recorded each morning (AM) and evening (PM) throughout the residential  period (Days -2 to 8/8a) and any additional 
residential days, in the case of earlier admission or later discharge. On Days 1/1a to 7 the COWS, SOWS and VAS  will also be administered as part of clinical 
testing sessions to measure withdrawal effects in response to study drug dosing.  Details regarding the timing of these assessments are provided in Section  8.4. 
m On Day  8/8a, additional COWS and SOWS assessments will occur wit h the naloxone challenge, separate from the clinical testing sessions (pre-naloxone and  
10 and 20 minutes following each naloxone injection; see Section  8.3.1  for details).

Details of the study procedures are described below. The overall schedule of assessments is 
provided in Table 4. 
8.8.1. Informed Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by the principal 
investigator or designated study personnel as outlined in Section  16.3. 
Prior to the administration of any study -specific procedures, authorized study personnel will 
obtain written informed consent from each potential subject. 
8.8.2. Eligibility Review  
An eligibility review will be conducted by the investigator at the visits specified in Table 4 using 
the subject inclusion criteria in Section  7.1 and  exclusion criteria in Section  7.2. 
8.8.3. Demographics and Medical History  
Subject’s demographic data and medical history will be reviewed and documented at the 
timepoint specified in Table  4. 
8.8.4. Concomitant Medication Review  
All medications (prescription and nonprescription, including vitamins and herbal supplements) 
taken by a given subject within 30 days of screening through follow-up will be recorded. 
At each study visit (see Table 4),  the investigator or designee will record the following data on 
all medications used by the su bject: name, dose, regimen, route of administration, start and stop 
dates, and the indication for use. 
8.8.5. Vital Signs  and Oxygen Saturation 
Vital signs ( ie, body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate and  blood pressure ) will be assessed 
at the timepoints  specified in  Table 4. Respiratory rate, heart rate and b lood pressure will be 
measured after the subject has been resting in a seated position for at least 5  minutes.  
Heart rate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and respiration rate will be measured and 
recorded  pre- and postdose accord ing to the timetable provided in Figure  2. In addition to vital 
signs, a rterial oxygen saturation will be measured according to the same timetable using a soft 
sensor placed over the fingertip on the nondominant hand. 
8.8.6. Pupillometry  
Pupillometry will be conducted in a consistent level of ambient light during clinical testing 
sessions at the timepoints indicated in Table 4 accordi ng to the timetable indicated in Figure  2. 
Pupil diameter  will be measured  before and after drug administration using a digital 
pupillometer. Mean p eak (ie, maximum) pupil diameter (which will be noted as “Mean” on the 
printout) will be recorded manually and then entered into the eCRF. Output will be saved with 
the appropriate source documents for each subject.

Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 8.8.7. Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at the timepoin ts specified in Table  4, a full physical 
exam at screening and symptom-driven exams at subsequent timepoints. 
8.8.8. Body Height and Weight 
Body height and weight will be measured at screening only. 
8.8.9. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG ) will be conducted at the timep oints specified in Table 4. 
8.8.10. Behavioral Therapy: Psychoeducational Counseling 
Subjects who enter the study will be asked to participate in psychoeducational counseling at the 
timepoints specified in  Table 4. Counseling will be conducted by qualified study staff that will 
review common withdrawal symptoms, and instruct subjects on correct medication usage and the 
impor tance of adherence to study and ancillary medications.  
Subjects who were participating in counseling sessions prior to study entry will be encouraged to continue their program upon discharge from the inpatient stay. Subjects will also be provided information about local resources for addiction support upon exit from the study. 
8.8.11. Structured Interviews and Questionnaires  
8.8.11.1. Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview  
The MINI will be administered at screening ( Table 4). The MINI is a short, clinician -
administered, structured diagnostic interview, with an administration time of approximately 
15 minutes. The MINI has been validated against the much longer Structured Clinical Interview 
for DSM diagnoses. A sample of the MINI can be found in Appendix A. 
8.8.11.2. Mini -Mental Status Examination 
The MMSE is an 11- item, 30 -point, clinician -administered questionnaire used to assess global 
cognitive impairment (Faust and Fogel 1989). A score ≤23 is indicative of cognitive impairment 
consistent with possible delirium or dementia. The full MMSE is administered at screening. On 
treatment days (Days 1/1a -7; Table 4), only orientation questions (MMSE items  1-2) will be 
asked. A decrease in score of 2 points total in the orientation questions is indicative of a change 
in mental status and requires a clinical assessment, as described below , prior to continuing 
protocol procedures for that day. 
The study staff may repeat the administration of the MMSE orientation questions if performance 
was deemed to be affected by fatigue or a medication effect. If a decrease of ≥2 points from 
baseline is confirmed on the MMSE, the study physician will conduct a clinical interview with 
the subject to confirm that the subject is alert, oriented, and consents to continuing the study procedures. If these conditions are not met, the subject will be observed on site and reassessed 
after 30 minutes. If orientation remains altered, the subject will be referred for medical evaluation. If the medical evaluation results in hospitalization, this would constitute an SAE.

Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 8.8.11.3. Months of the Year Backward  
The Months of the Yea r Backward (MOTYB) is a brief assessment of verbal working memory, 
which is also used to screen for delirium ( Meagher et al, 2015) . Subjects will be instructed to 
recite the months of the year forward, and then backward. Subjects will receive a score of 0 to 2. 
Scores ≤1 indicate the absence of delirium.  
This assessment may be repeated if fatigue or poor effort is deemed to have interfered with the 
subject’s performance. An increase in MOTYB score will warrant assessment by the study 
physician. As noted above ( Section  8.8.11.2), a subject found to have altered sensorium will be 
referred for medical evaluation, and if hospitalized, this event would constitute an SAE. 
Subjects will complete the MOTYB on Days 1/1a through 7, as indicated in Table 4. 
8.8.11.4. Columbia Suicide Severity and Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is a questionnaire administered by a qualified clinician  that assesses suicidal 
ideation and behavior (Posner et al, 2011). The “Baseline/Screening ” version of the scale will be 
administered at the screening visit. The “Since Last Visit” version will be administered at all 
other timepoints specified in  Table 4. Samples of the C-SSRS can be found in Appendix B . 
8.8.11.5. Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale  
The COWS is a questionnaire designed to measure 11 common opioid withdrawal signs or 
symptoms  (Wesson and Ling 2003). The summed score provides information about the level of 
physical dependence on opioids. The COWS will be administered by research staff at the 
timepoints specified in  Table 4. In addition to morning and evening assessments throughout the 
residential  period, the COWS will be administered during clinical testing sessions (see 
Section  8.4) accord ing to the timetable provided in Figure  2. A sample of the COWS can be 
found in Appendix C . When possible, the same person should complete the COWS each time. 
8.8.11.6. Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale  
The SOWS is a 16 -item self -report questionnaire designed to measure the severity of opioid 
withdrawal symptoms. The subject rat es the intensity of symptoms using a 5 -point scale; with 0 
representing “not at all” and 5 representing “ extremely. ” The SOWS will be self -administered at 
the timepoints specified in  Table 4. In addition to morning and evening assessments throughout 
the residential  period, the SOWS will be self -administered during c linical testing sessions ( see 
Section  8.4) accord ing to the timetable provided in Figure  2. A sample of the SOWS can be 
found in Appendi x D. 
8.8.11.7. Desire for Opioids Visual Analogue Scale  
The desire for opioids will be measured using a 100-mm, horizontal VAS, with 0 anchored on the left representing “no desire for opioids” and 100 anchored on the right representing 
“strongest imaginable desire for opioids.” Subjects will place a vertical line on the scale to 
indicate their desire for opioids at that particular time. The VAS will be self -administered at the 
timepoints specified in Table 4. In addition to morning and evening assessments throughout the 
residential  period, the VAS will be self -administered during c linical testing sessions ( see 
Page 39 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 Section  8.4) accord ing to the timetable provided in Figure  2. A sample can be fo und in 
Appendix E . 
8.8.11.8. Short Michigan Alcohol Screening Test  
The SMAST is a 13 -item self -report instrument designed to measure problems experienced as a 
result of drinking alcohol. The responses are coded as “yes/no.” All “Yes” responses indicate 
problems associated with drinking except for items #1, #4 and  #5; for these items, “ No” 
responses indicate problems associated with drinking. As a research tool, the SMAST has 
>90 percent sensitivity for identifying alcohol use disorder. The SMAST will be self-administered at the timepoints specified in  Table 4 . A sample of the SMAST can be found in 
Appendix F . 
8.8.11.9. Quantitative Substance Use Inventory  
The Quantitative Substance Use Inventory (QSUI) is a 29-item questionnaire designed to quantify drug use in a specified period, including classes of drugs, particular substances, as well 
as the route of administration. Subjects will complete the QSUI at the timepoints indicated in  
Table 4. A sample of the QSUI can be found in Appendix G.  
8.8.11.10.  Patient Global Assessment of Response to Therapy  
Treatment satisfaction will be assessed using the Patient Global Assessment of Response to Therapy (PGART). The PGART consists of one item: “How would you rate your response to the 
medication that you received during the study?” It is measured on a 5 -point Likert scale (0=poor, 
4=excellent). The PGART will be self -administered at the timepoints specified in  Table 4. A  
sample of the PGART can be found in Appendix H . 
8.8.11.11. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 
The 17- item HAM -D is a clinician -administered depression scale designed to be sensitive to 
treatment effects (Hamilton 1960) . The HAM -D will be administered at the timepoints specified 
in Table 4. The Structured Interview Guide for the HAM- D (SIGH -D) will be used for 
administr ation. A sample of the SIGH-D can be found in Appendix I . 
8.8.11.12. Cognitive Assessments  
The Brief Assessments of Cognition (BAC) Symbol Coding test, Controlled Oral Word 
Association (COWA) task, Wechsler Memory Scale- III Spatial Span (WMS -III SS) test, 
Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and Test of Attentional Performance (TAP) will be 
administered at the timepoints specified in Table 4 . 
8.8.11.12.1. Brief Assessments of Cogni tion Symbol Coding Test 
The BAC Symbol Coding test is used to measure cognitive processing speed ( Keefe 1999 ). 
During this task, subjects are given a list of numbers (numerals 1- 9) that are each associated with 
a unique symbol. Subjects decode a list of 110 symbols as quickly as possible in 90 seconds. The 
total number of symbols correctly decoded can range from 0 to 110. Total administration time 
(including instruction and practice items) is 3 minutes. A sample of the BAC Symbol Coding test administrator instructions and respondent form can be found in Appendix J .

 8.8.11.12.2. Controlled Oral Word Association Task 
The COWA is a verbal fluency task (Benton et al, 1983) . Subjects are asked by a rater to 
spontaneously produce words belonging to a common category or beginning with the same 
designated letter. Total administration time is 5 minutes. A sample of the COWA task 
administrator instructions can be found in Appendix K . 
8.8.11.12.3. Wechsler Memory Sca le-III Spatial Span Test  
The WMS -III SS test is a measure of working memory (Wechsler 1997) . Subjects are presented 
with a board containing blue blocks that are randomly arranged. The clinician begins by tapping out a pattern of blocks, beginning with a sequence of 2 blocks and increasing the length of the pattern with subject proficiency (up to a sequence of 9 blocks). During the first part of the test, 
the subject is tasked with tapping the same pattern as the clinician. During the second part of the 
test, the subject is tasked with tapping out the reverse pattern of that demonstrated by the clinician. The total score ranges from 0 to 32. Total administration time is 8 minutes. A sample 
of the WMS-III SS administrator instructions can be found in Appendix L . 
8.8.11.12.4. Continuous Performance Test  
The CPT is a computer -based task that measures attention and  vigilance (Cornblatt et al, 1988) . 
Subjects are asked to attend to digits flashing on the computer screen and to click the mouse 
when the same string of digits flashes consecutively. There are 3 trials of this subtest; the first 
containing 2-digit sequences, the second containing 3-digit sequences and the third containing 4-digit sequences. Scoring for this subtest is based on “hits” versus “false alarms” and 
“randoms,” and the total score is represented by a d -prime quotient ranging from -1.00 to 4.24. 
Total administration time is 10 minutes. Screenshots of the CPT instructions can be found in Appendix M.  
8.8.11.12.5. Test of Attentional Performance 
The TAP is a computer -based divided attention task that involves the simultaneous processing of 
visual and auditory stimuli (Zimmermann and Fimm 2002) . For the visual component, a region 
of the screen displays a varying number of crosses simultaneously. When 4 of the crosses form a 
square, the subject is required to press the designated key as quickly as possible. For the auditory 
component, the subject hears a sequence of high and low tones. When the same tone occurs twice in a row, the subject is required to press the designated key as quickly as possible. The 
subject is required to pay attention to both the crosses and the tones at the same time. Total 
administration time is 2.5 to 6 minutes. A screenshot of the T AP instructions can be found in 
Appendix N. 
8.8.12. Laboratory Assessments 
8.8.12.1. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all women at screening  and Day 1/1a. A urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at Day 1/1a, as well as all subsequent timepoints specified in 
Table 4. Results must be negative for initial study eligibility and continued participation.

 8.8.14. Drug Dispensation and Reco nciliation  
Section  9 provides information related to drug dispensing procedures. Study drug (naltrexone, 
PBO -N, BUP , naloxone and VIVITROL) will be administered  by clinical study staff at the 
timepoints specified in Table 4. The clinical study site is responsible for study drug storage, 
handling and accountability as outlined in Section  10. 
8.8.15. Adverse Event Monitoring  
AEs will be monitored continuously from the time a subject signs the informed consent 
document until the completion of the final study visit (see Table 4). AEs and SAEs are defined in 
Section  12.1 and 12.2, respectively. Section  12.4 provides guidance on the monitoring and 
recording  requirements for AEs. Section  12.5 provides guidance on the reporting requirements 
for SAEs.  
8.9. Study Requirements and Restrictions  
8.9.1. Prohibited Medications and Substances  
The medications and substances listed below are prohibited for the specified time periods: 
• Methadone is prohibited at least 30 days prior to Day -5 and for the duration of the 
study 
• All opioid agonists (except BUP  when administered during applicable study days), 
including opioid-containing cough medications, are prohibited for the duration of the study 
• Naltrexone is prohibited for at least 90 days prior to Day -5 and for the duration of the study (except when administered during applicable study visits) 
• On days when cognitive assessments are conducted  (see Table 4) , caffeine and 
nicotine (oral, inhaled or smoked) are prohibited within 30 minutes prior to the start 
of the assessments . A transdermal nicotine patch may remain in place. Throughout 
the residential period, nicotine replacement therapy is permissible in accordance with prevailing clinical policy of the residential unit. 
8.9.2. Ancillary Medications  
Subjects  will receive ancillary medications on a standing schedule to treat symptoms of 
withdrawal, such as autonomic arousal, sleep disturbance, muscle tension and anxiety. Beginning 
on Day -2, medications listed in Table 6 will be provided to subjects as a standing regimen 
during the residential  phase of the study (see Table  4). In the event that a subject is admitted for 
the residential stay early (on Days -5, -4, or - 3), the ancillary medication regimen will begin as 
soon as the subject becomes residential.  If needed for AE treatment or prophylaxis, ancillar y 
medications may be initiated at the clinician’s discretion on or after Day  -5. Because mild 
symptoms of withdrawal may be present for several days after the VIVITROL injection, subjects will continue using ancillary medications on a modified schedule (se e Table 4) thro ugh Day  11 
(or, for 3  days after VIVITROL injection).

encouraged to drink liberally. 
8.9.3. Concomitant Medications  
Prescribed psychoactive medications, including anxiolytics and antidepressants, will be allowed 
for the duration of the study provided the dose is stable at the time of the screening visit. 
8.9.4. Contraception and Pregnancy  
All male and female subjects must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the 
duration of the study unless they are surgically sterile or postmenopausal (see below). The 
following are considered acceptable methods of contraception: 
• Double-barrier protection (such as a condom with spermicide or a diaphragm with spermicide)  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills or patches, a vaginal ring or a contraceptive implant) ; oral contraceptives should be initiated  at least 30  days prior to 
Screening  
Subjects who are abstinent are eligible, provided they agree to use an acceptable contraceptive 
method should they become sexually active. 
Subjects who are surgically sterile are exempt from the requirement to use contraception. Women who have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are considered surgically sterile. Men who have undergone a vasectomy 
are considered surgically sterile. Partner vasectomy is not considered an approved acceptable 
method of cont raception for a female subject.  
Women who are postmenopausal are also exempt from the requirement to use contraception. For 
the purpose of this study, postmenopausal is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation 
for at least 12 months prior to screening in women who are 45 years of age or older.

 If a subject becomes pregnant while participating in t he study, she will be discontinued from 
study drug immediately. The early termination and safety follow -up visits will be scheduled  and 
the pregnancy will be reported to Alkermes. Additional follow-up may be required. Pregnancies 
in female partners of male subjects should also be reported and will be followed in the same 
manner.  
A Pregnancy Report Form must be submitted to Alkermes ( per Section  12.5) immediately, 
within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, irrespective of whether an AE has occurred. The 
pregnancy will be follow ed until completion or termination. If the outcome of the pregnancy 
meets the criteria for classification as an SAE, it should be reported following the SAE procedure 
(see Section  12.5) . 
8.10. Residential  Period  
Subjects will be confined to a residential unit for 9 to 11 days (Days -2 to 8/8a); the residential period 
may be longer for subjects who are admitted to the residential unit earlier during the BUP Lead-in 
Period, or for subjects who fail the naloxone challenge on Day 8/8a and remain on the residential unit per Investigator  judgment.

 9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Investigational Product, Dosage, Duration and Mode of 
Administration  
Naltrexone will be supplied at the doses specified in Table 3 and provided as tablets  for oral 
administration. Naltrexone will be administered as 2  doses, given at least 1  hour apart, on Days 1 
to 7. 
9.2. Reference Therapy, Dosage, Duration and Mode of Administration  
Placebo naltrexone (PBO -N) tablets will match the naltrexone drug product and will be 
administered as 2 doses, given at least 1 hour apart, on Days 1/1a  to 7. 
Sublingual BUP  (up to 4 mg) will be administered daily to all subjects during the BUP L ead-in 
Period  (Days -5 to -1). On Days 1/1a to 7, BUP  dose will be tapered (see Table 3).  
9.3. Treatment Adherence  
Clinical study staff will administer study drug on an inpatient basis and record compliance for 
each subject in the relevant source document(s). 
9.4. Randomization/Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: naltrexone + BUP or 
PBO -N + BUP , stratified according to low (<8  mg/day) vs. high (8 mg/day) BUP maintenance 
dose at the time of initiation of the BUP L ead-in P eriod . The naltrexone or PBO- N assignment 
will be blinded while the BUP  dose will be open- label . A randomization schedule will be 
prepared by an independent biostatistician and uploaded into an Interactive Web Response 
System (IWRS). The pharmacist or designee will contact the IWRS, which will assign the 
subject to a treatment group according to the next available randomization record. The unblinded 
site pharmacist or designee will dispense naltrexone or placebo for administration to subjects. 
9.5. Blinding  
This is a double blind study. All Alkermes staff, clinical staff  and subjects will be blinded to 
treatment assignment until database lock. At each study site, study medications will be prepared 
by an unblinded research pharmacist who has no contact with participants in the trial. The 
investigator is responsible for all trial- related medical decisions. If the investigator  deems it 
necessary to break the study blind in the interest of a subject’s medical safety, he or she must 
make every effort to contact the sponsor medical monitor before the blind is broken. If t he site is 
unable to contact the medical monitor prior to breaking the blind, the medical monitor must be contacted within 24 hours following disclosure of study drug assignment. 
Breaking the blind for a single subject will not affect the b lind for the remaining subjects.

 10. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Study Drug  
Naltrexone for oral administration will be provided as white caplet-shaped IR tablets in the 
following dosage s: 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 7.5 and  15 mg. Daily naltrexone doses are described in 
Table 3 with total daily doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg.  
Placebo to match naltrexone drug product (PBO-N) will be provided as white caplet- shaped IR 
tablets.  
Commercially available BUP  will be  supplied at the doses specified in Table 3 as a rapidly 
disintegrating tablet for sublingual administration.  Buprenorphine will be administered in up to 
4 mg daily d ose during the lead -in (Days  -5 to -1). The dose will then taper down to zero mg 
during the transitional dosing period leading up to the naloxone challenge (Days 1-7).  
Commercially manufactured 1 mg/ mL naloxone will be supplied by Alkermes as 2 mL single -
dose prefilled syringes with 21 G × 1½ needles. 
VIVITROL 380  mg will be supplied by Alkermes in single -use kits, each containing a 380 mg 
vial of VIVITROL microspheres and the diluent for suspension. 
10.2. Packaging and  Storage 
Naltrexone tablets and placebo to match naltrexone tablets (PBO -N) will be supplied in 30-count 
bottles. The primary packaging consists of 60- cc high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) bottle s heat  
sealed with a 1.1 g desiccant and polypropylene cap. The material should be stored at not more 
than 25°C. 
All commercially available products are to be stored according to the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. 
Buprenorphine , a Schedule III narcotic, must be stored in accordance with US restrictions r elated 
to controlled substances. 
10.3. Accountability  
The clinical site is required to maintain current drug dispensation and accountability logs 
throughout the study as well as through IWRS. All unused supplies will be checked against the 
drug movement records during the study and/or at the end of the study. 
Buprenorphine, a Schedule III narcotic, should be accounted for in accordance with the 
requirements of the Controlled Substances Act. 
10.4. Handling and Disposal  
Following completion and verification of accountability logs, all unused and used products must 
be destroyed according to applicable local and federal regulations. Alternatively, the sponsor 
may arrange for destruction with a third -party vendor operating in accordance with GCP and/or 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), as applicable. Buprenorphine, as a Schedule III narcotic, 
should be handled and disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the Controlled 
Substances Act.

 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed via the following:  
• AEs 
• Vital signs  and arterial oxygen saturation ( measured during clinical testing sessions ) 
• Laboratory test results  
• ECG parameters  (uncorrected QT, QT interval corrected for heart rate using the 
Fridericia formula [QTcF] , QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Bazett 
formula [QTcB] , HR, RR, and  QRS intervals)  
• C-SSRS score s 
12.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the investigationa l treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that 
does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. 
If the severity of a subject’s withdrawal symptoms necessitates administering a nonstudy 
medication, or doses of an ancillary medication that exceed the standing regimen, the condition 
being treated should be noted as an AE . 
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the informed consent form (ICF) are considered to 
be pre-existing conditions and are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre- existing 
conditions that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. 
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by the investigator. Clinically signif icant values will be considered AEs and recorded 
as such on the eCRFs. Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a subject will be withdrawn from the study if a 
pregnancy occurs. As described in Section  8.9.4, the pregnancy, including a partner’s pregnancy, 
must be reported to Alkermes, and additional follow-up may be required. 
12.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any  dose and regardless of causality that meets one or more of 
the following criteria : 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Page 50 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( eg, a substantial disruption of 
a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening  or require 
hospitalization may be considered to be SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above. 
Admission to a hospital or an inpatient unit for a non- medical reason (ie, social stay admission) 
during the study in the absence of untoward medical occurrence will not be considered as an 
SAE, but will be captured as an AE. 
Hospitalization due to worsening of behavioral health -related issues should be reported as an 
SAE.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source 
document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by the investigator (or designated 
sub-investigator) according to his/her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in Table 7 should 
be used to guide this assessment. Please note that not all criteria must be present to be indicative 
of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “ test drugs ” for the purposes of 
the definitions listed in the table.

Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 12.4. Monitoring and Recording of Adverse Events  
AE data collection will begin after a subject signs the ICF  and will continue until completion of 
the final safety follow -up visit (Visit 10) or 28 days after the final dose of study drug. Any AE or 
SAE having an onset after the safety follow -up visit will not be collected or reported unless the 
investigator  feels that the event may be related to the study drug.  
Subjects will be instructed by the investigator  or designee to report the occurrence of any AE. 
All volunteered, elicited  and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. 
The investigator will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the study drug (see 
Section  12.3), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken  and subject outcome. 
The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (severity): 
• Mild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities  
• Severe:  Is incapacitating; results in inability to work or perform usual activities  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the investigator or  until the 
subject is deemed by the investigator  to be lost to follow-up. 
For clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the Investigator ’s 
Brochure will be used as the reference document to designate event expectedness.  
Withdrawal from the study as a result of an AE and any therapeutic measures that are taken shall 
be at the discretion of the investigator . If a subject withdraws from the s tudy for any reason , any 
ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the investigator or  until the 
subject is deemed by the investigator  to be lost to follow-up. 
12.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Pregnancy  
All SAEs and pregnancies must be reported to Alkermes via  
immediately, within 24 hours  of discovery, by emailing: 
 or by faxing the report to the following:  
FAX Number:   
The written report for SAEs should be submitted on the SAE form provided for this purpose. The 
SAE report must include the Investigator ’s opinion as to whether the event is study drug- related. 
If this relationship is determined to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug, 
evidence to support this assessment must also be provided. 
The written report for pregnancies in female subjects and in female partners of male subjects 
should be submitted on the Pregnancy Report Form provided for this purpose.

 13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Sample Siz e Considerations  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects who receive and tolerate 
VIVITROL injection  on Day 8/8a as demonstrated by mild (COWS ≤12 or SOWS ≤10) opioid 
withdrawal symptoms following VIVITROL administration . 
Assuming the proportion of subjects receiving and tolerating VIVITROL administration is 9 0% 
in Group 1 and 60% in Group 2, a sample size of  approximately 46 subjects per treatment group 
will provide at least 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference between the two 
treatment groups  at 5% level of significance in a 2-sided test . 
13.2. General Statistical Methodology  
In general, summary statistics ( ie, n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
for continuous variables, and number [%] of subjects in each category for categorical variables) 
will be provided by treatment group for all variables. 
Baseline values are defined as  any nonmissing assessments prior to receiving the first dose of 
naltrexone or PBO- N. 
Source data for the summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as by-subject data 
listings.  
13.2.1. Study Populations 
13.2.1.1. Safety Population

Page 54 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 The analyses will be carried out  using logistic regression with tr eatment as a factor . 
13.4.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
• Proportion of days with COWS peak score ≤12 during the T reatment Period prior to 
the VIVITROL injection  (Days 1/1a- 7) 
The analys is will be carried out using a negative binomial model with treatment as a factor . 
13.4.3. Other Secondary Endpoints  
• Proportion of post- VIVITROL days (Days  9-11) in which subjects in each group 
demonstrate mild (COWS ≤12) opioid withdrawal 
The analyses  will be carried out using a negative binomial model with treatmen t as a factor.  
• Mean peak COWS scores during the Treatment Period and VIVITROL Induction and 
Post-VIVITROL Observation Period (Days  1/1a-11)

VIVITROL Induction and Post-VIVITROL Observation Period (Days  1/1a-11) 
• Mean score for “desire for opioids” VAS during the Treatment Period and 
VIVITROL Induction and Post-VIVITROL Observation Period (Days  1/1a-11) 
These endpoints will be analyzed  using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) , with  treatment as a 
factor . 
13.4.4. Exploratory Endpoints 
• Number and proportion of subjects in PGART response category at the end of the 
post-VIVITROL observation period (Day 11) 
The analyses  will be carried out using a logistic regression model with treatment as a factor . 
• Change from baseline in pupil diameter following study drug administration during 
the Treatment Period (Days  1/1a- 7) 
• Change in frequency of substance use from screening to Day 36 assessed via the QSUI  
• AUC for SOWS scores during the Treatment Period and VIVITROL Induction and Post-VIVITROL Observation Period ( Days  1/1a-11) 
• Change from baseline in the standardized T scores for cognitive assessments  
The analyses  will be carried out using an analysis of cov ariance (ANCOVA)  with treatment as a 
factor . 
13.5. Safety and Tolerability Analyses 
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. 
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated based on AEs, vital sign and oxygen saturation 
measurements , laboratory test results, ECG findings and C- SSRS scores . 
Page 55 of 174
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK6428-A302 v 4.0 (Amendment 3.0) CONFIDENTIAL  
 Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  
The incidence of treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized by treatment group and overall by 
system or gan class, and preferred terms within each system organ class. SAEs and AEs resulting 
in treatment discontinuation will also be summarized. AEs occurring during the treatment period preceding the naloxone challenge will be analyzed separately from AEs occu rring on or after the 
naloxone challenge day. 
Change from baseline in  laboratory tests, vital signs  and oxygen saturation, and ECG 
assessments ( uncorrected QT, QTcF, QTcB, HR, RR and QRS intervals) will be summarized by 
treatment group and overall at each visit.  Number (percentage) of subjects with potentially 
clinically significant (PCS) values at any postbaseline visit will be also summarized by treatment 
group. 
For each ideation/behavior type in C-SSRS, as well as the overall ideation/behavior category, the 
number and percentage of subjects with ‘Yes’ responses at any post baseline visit (including unscheduled visit) will be summarized by treatment group. 
Number and percent of subjects initiating concomitant medications, including ancillary 
medications, during the induction period will be summarized. 
Concomitant medications will be categorized and presented using the World Health Organization 
(WHO) drug Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) classification system.

16.1. Ethics Review  
The clinical site’s IRB must meet all relevant regulatory requirements. The study protocol and 
ICF will be reviewed by the IRB prior to enrolling subjects into the study; written approval from 
the committee must be received by Alkermes before drug will be released to the  investigator . 
The protocol must be re-approved by the IRB upon receipt of amendments and annually, as local 
regulatory requirements require. 
The investigator is responsible for submitting all protocol changes and SAE reports to the IRB 
according to local procedures. At a minimum, all SAEs requiring an investigational new drug 
safety report must be immediately reported.  
All relevant correspondence from the IRB will be forwarded by the respective study site to the 
sponsor in a timely fashion. 
16.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Guideline E6, and all applicable local regulatory requirements. GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality 
standard used for designing, conducting, recording  and reporting studies involving the 
participation of human subjects. Alkermes is committed to complying with this standard to 
provide assurance that the rights, safety  and well-being of study subjects will be protected, 
consistent with th e principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
16.3. Written Informed Consent  
The investigator (or authorized designee) at each cent er will ensure that the subject  is given full 
and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, potential and possible risks and benefits of the study. Each prospective subject will receive an IRB-approved ICF that 
summarizes the pertinent study information and will be given ample time to read the form and 
ask questions about the study. All information is to be provided in a language understandable to the subject and must not include any language that waives the subject’s legal rights. Prospective 
subjects must also be informed of their right to withdraw consent without prejudice at any time 
during the study. If the subject chooses to participate, he/she must sign the ICF before any study-specific procedures are conducted.  
All subjects will be informed of their rights to privacy and will be made aware that the study data will be submitted to Alkerme s, the IRB, the CRO, if applicable , and  to regulatory authorities for 
review and evaluation for the duration of the study and until the project has been approved for 
marketing, or is withdrawn from investigation. They will also be informed that the study monitor 
may inspect their medical records to verify the accuracy and completeness of the study records and results. 
Significant changes to the protocol or product safety information may require a revision of the 
ICF, which must be reviewed and approved by t he IRB, and then signed by all applicable study 
participants.

An overview of study data handling and recordkeeping procedures and restrictions is provided in 
the subsequent sections; please refer to the CSA for further details. 
17.1. Data Capture  
As stated in Section  15.1, this study will use eCRFs for capturing data. All entries, corrections  
and alterations will be made by the investigator or other authorized study personnel. A ll data 
entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness  by independent monitors . The electronic 
data capture system maintains a full audit trail.  
All electronic source data collected outside the eCRF, such as results from computer - or pap er-
based cognitive assessments  and the central laboratory, will be transferred directly to Alkermes 
for incorporation into the final data sets. A paper copy of all laboratory reports will remain with 
the source docum ents at the study site. All out-of-range laboratory values will be deemed as 
clinically significant or not clinically significant by the investigator . Clinically significant values 
will be considered AEs and recorded as such on the eCRFs. 
AEs will be coded using MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be categorized using the 
WHO- ATC classification system.  
17.2. Inspection of Records  
Alkermes or its representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The investigator agrees to allow 
the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subject charts and source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
17.3. Retention of Records 
Retention and storage of all essential clinical study documents shall be governed by the terms 
and conditions of the site’s CSA and in accordance with ICH guidelines/local regulatory requirements as follows: 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by the terms of 
the CSA. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

   3 GENERAL	
  INSTRUCTIONS	
  
	
  
	
  
The	
  M.I.N.I.	
  was	
  designed	
  as	
  a	
  brief	
  structured	
  interview	
  for	
  the	
  major	
  Axis	
  I	
  psychiatric	
  disorders	
  in	
  DSM -­‐5	
  and	
  ICD -­‐10.	
  	
  Validation	
  
and	
   reliability	
   studies	
   have	
   been	
   done	
   comparing	
   the	
   M.I.N.I.	
   to	
   the	
   SCID -­‐P	
   for	
   DSM -­‐III-­‐R	
   and	
   the	
   CIDI	
   (a	
   structured	
   interview	
  
developed	
  by	
  the	
  World	
  Health	
  Organization).	
  	
  The	
  results	
  of	
  these	
  studies	
  show	
  that	
  the	
  M.I.N.I.	
  has	
   similar	
  reliability	
  and	
  validity	
  
properties,	
  but	
  can	
  be	
  administered	
  in	
  a	
  much	
  shorter	
  period	
  of	
  time	
  (mean	
  18.7	
  ±	
  11.6	
  minutes,	
  median	
  15	
  minutes)	
  than	
  the	
  
above	
  referenced	
  instruments.	
  	
   Clinicians	
  can	
  use	
  it,	
  after	
  a	
  brief	
  training	
  session.	
  	
   Lay	
  interviewers	
  require	
  more	
  extensive	
  training. 	
  
	
  
INTERVIEW: 	
  
	
   In	
  order	
  to	
  keep	
  the	
  interview	
  as	
  brief	
  as	
  possible,	
  inform	
  the	
  patient	
  that	
  you	
  will	
  conduct	
  a	
  clinical	
  interview	
  that	
  is	
  mo re	
  
structured	
  than	
  usual,	
  with	
  very	
  precise	
  questions	
  about	
  psychological	
  proble ms	
  which	
  require	
  a	
  yes	
  or	
  no	
  answer. 	
  
	
  GENERAL	
  FORMAT: 	
  
	
   The	
  M.I.N.I.	
  is	
  divided	
  into	
   modules 	
  identified	
  by	
  letters,	
  each	
  corresponding	
  to	
  a	
  diagnostic	
  category. 	
  
	
   •At	
  the	
  beginning	
  of	
  each	
  diagnostic	
  module	
  (except	
  for	
  psychotic	
  disorders	
  module),	
  screening	
  question(s)	
  corresponding	
  to	
  the	
  main	
  criteria	
  of	
  the	
  disorder	
  are	
  presented	
  in	
  a	
   gray	
  box.	
  
	
   •At	
  the	
  end	
  of	
  each	
  module,	
  diagnostic	
  box(es)	
  permit	
  the	
  clinician	
   to	
  indicate	
  whether	
  diagnostic	
  criteria	
  are	
  met.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  Lifetime Past __ 
Years 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Beha vior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is  any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt.  There does not h
ave to be any injury or harm , just the potential  for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broke
n so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumping from window of a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to
 harm yourself? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or Did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better,  
get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for that, act ual attempt would 
have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted 
attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once 
they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. 
Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

destructive behavior.
 Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, except that the individual stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by 
something else.

Acts or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a verbalization or thought, such as 
assembling a specific me
thod (e.g. buying pills, purchasing a gun) or preparing for one’s death by suicide (e.g. giving things away, writing a 
suicide note).

3.  Moderately severe physical damage; medical  hospitalization and likely intensive care required (e.g. comatose with reflexes 
intact; third-degree burns less than 20% of body; extensive blood loss but can recover; major fractures). 
4.  Severe physical damage; medical  hospitalization with intensive care required (e.g. comatose without reflexes; third-degree 
burns over 20% of body; extensive blood loss with unstable vital signs; major damage to a vital area).

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR 
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types) Since Last 
Visit  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Beha vior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or 
harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is considered an a
ttempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to
 harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get 
sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

□   □ 
Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for that, act ual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so. 
Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you 
actually did anything?

Preparatory Acts or Behavior: 
Acts or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a verbalization or thought, such as assembling a 
specific method (e.g. 
buying pills, purchasing a gun) or preparing for one’s death by suicide (e.g. giving things away, writing a suicide note).  
Have you taken any steps towards making a suicide attempt or preparing to kill yourself (such as collecting pills, getting a gun, 
giving valuables away or
 writing a suicide note)?

Actual Lethality/Medical Damage:   
0.  No physical damage or very minor physical damage (e.g. surface scratches). 
1.  Minor physical da
mage (e.g. lethargic speech; first-degree burns; mild bleeding; sprains). 
2.  Moderate physical damage; medical attention needed (e.g. conscious but sleepy, somewhat responsive; second-degree burns; bleeding of major vessel). 
3.  Moderately severe physical damage; medical  hospitalization and likely intensive care required (e.g. comatose with reflexes intact; third-degree burns less 
than 20% of body; extensive blood loss but can recover; major fractures). 
4.  Severe physical damage; medical  hospitalization with intensive care required (e.g. comatose without reflexes; third-degree burns over 20% of body; 
extensive blood loss with unstable vital signs; major damage to a vital area). 
5.  Death

______ 
Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0 
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medical damage, had potential for very serious 
lethality: put gun i
n mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with oncoming train but pulled away 
before run over). 
 
0 = Behavior not likely to result in injury 
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death

SHORT MICHIGAN ALCOHOL SCREENING TEST  
(SMAST)  
Administration & Interpretation  
Instructions  
From: A Self -Administered Short Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (SMAST)  
M.L. Seltzer, A. Vinokur, and L.J. Van Rooijen. Studies on Alcohol 36:117 -126, 1975  
 
The Short Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (SMAST) is a 13 -item questionnaire that 
requires a 7th grade  reading level, and only a few minutes to complete. It was develop ed 
from the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Evaluation data indicate that it is an 
effective diagnostic ins trument, and does not have a tendency for false positives, as does 
the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. It is strongly recommended that the DA ST-10 
be used along with the SMAST unless there  is a clear indication that the client uses 
alcohol but does not  use any other drug at all.  
 
The SMAST is self -administered. All questions are to be answered with “YES ” or “NO” 
answers only. A "No" answer to question s 1,4, and 5, and each "Yes" response to the 
other questions earn one point.   
 
Interpretations : A score of 1 or 2 indicates that there is no alcohol problem and  no 
further action is needed at this time. A score of 3 indicates a borderline alcohol problem 
and furth er investigation is necessary.

INTERVIEWER  
The first question for each item should be asked exactly as written.  Often this question will elicit enough 
information about the severity and frequency of a symptom for you to rate the item with confidence.  Follow -up 
questions are provided, however, for use when further exploration or additional clarification of symptoms is necessary.  The specified questions should be asked until you have enough information to rate the item confidently.  In some cases, you may also have to add your own follow -up questions to obtain necessary 
information.  
  
Time period .  The interview questions indicate that the ratings should be based on the patient's condition in 
the past week.  
 
 
Referent of "usual" or "normal" condition .  Several of the interview questions in the HAM -D refer to the 
patient's usual or normal functioning.  In some cases, such as when the patient has Dysthymia or Seasonal 
Affective Disorder, the referent should be to the last time they felt OK (i.e., not depressed or high) for at least a few weeks.  
  
This instrument provides an interview guide for both the Hamilton Depression Scale (Hamilton, Max:  A rating scale for depression.  J 
Neurol Neurosurg Psychiat  23:56-61, 1960).  The anchor point descriptions for both scales, with very minor modifications, have been taken 
from the ECDEU Assessment Manual (Guy, William, ECDEU Assessment Manual for Psychopharmacology , Revised 1976, DHEW 
Publication No. (ADM) 76-338).  Additional designators were added in parentheses to the depression scale anchor points by Kobak, Lipsitz 
and Williams to further standardize ratings.  A reliability study of the SIGH-D (interview guide for the HAM-D alone) was published in the Archives of General Psychiatry
 (1988;45:742-747).

Alkermes ALK6428-A302 Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)  
 
(Allow 60 seconds per trial) 
 
 
INSTRUCTIONS:   Say to the patient:  
 
I will say a letter of the alphabet.  Then I want you to give me as many 
words that begin with the letter as quickly as you can.  For instance, if I say 
'B', you might give me 'bad', 'battle', 'bed'... I do not want you to use words 
that are proper names or things that would start with a capital letter, such 
as 'Boston', 'Bob', or 'Buick'.  Also, do not use the same word again with a 
different ending such as 'eat' and 'eating'.  Any questions?  (pause)   Begin 
when I say the letter.  The first letter is 'F'.   You have one minute.  Go 
ahead. 
 
Begin timing immediately.  Allow one minute.  If patients discontinue before the end of 
the minute, encourage them to try to think of more words.  If there is a silence of 15 
seconds, repeat the basic instructions:  
 
 Remember, you are to tell me as many words as you can that begin with 
the letter ‘F’.    
 
For scoring purposes, write down the actual words in the order in which they are 
produced.  A score sheet for recording individual patient responses has been included 
on the following page.  If shorthand is used, be sure to make each word legible for 
review.   Write all words, even if they are repetitions or incorrect.  If repetitions occur 
that may be accepted if an alternate meaning was intended by the patient, (“four” and 
“for”, “son” and “sun”), then ask what was meant by this word at the END  of the 1-
minute period. 
 
The first (letter-F) trial is followed by the following instruction: 
 
Now tell me as many words beginning with the letter ‘A’ as you can.  You 
have one minute. Ready, go.

Alkermes ALK6428-A302  Last, the patient is instructed: 
 
Now tell me as many words beginning with the letter ‘S’ as you can. You 
have one minute.  Ready, go. 
 
 
SCORING:   
 
Repetitions of words are not corrected but are not included in scoring.  The total 
number of correct words generated for each letter, F, A, and S, (excluding intrusions, 
repeated roots or repetitions of the same word) are counted and entered on the 
response sheet.  For example, if a patient generated 18 F-words, 12 A-words, and 20 
S-words, the totals would be entered on the response sheet. 
 
Scoring Rules 
 
Acceptable words begin with the given letter (F, A, or S).  Slang words and foreign 
words that are part of standard English (e.g. “amigo”) are acceptable.  
 
UNACCEPTABLE WORDS  include the following:   
 Words that are proper names, as indicated in the instructions.  Generally, 
these proper names are capitalized.  The following proper names would all 
be unacceptable:  France, Fred, February, Friday, and Fritos. 
 
 Words that sound like they belong but the actual spelling dictates that the 
word choice was incorrect.  For example , “phone” is not acceptable as an 
“F” word.  
    
 Words that are repetitions.   For example, if the patient says, “feel” as the 
first word, then repeats it later; the patient will receive credit only for the first 
time the word is given.  Homonyms, however, are acceptable if the patient 
indicates that the word has a different meaning from the first time it was 
given.  For example, a patient may say “ant” and then later say “aunt”.  You 
may need to ask the patient what word was intended.  Credit for both words 
would be given. 
  
 Words that have the same root and basically refer to the same thing.  This 
is sometimes difficult to judge.  Words that are clearly variations of the root 
word are not given credit.  For example, if  “fast, faster, fastest” were given, 
credit would go only to “fast.” If “flexible, flexibility” were given, credit would 
Page 152 of 174
 
3 
Alkermes ALK6428-A302 go only to “flexible.” In addition, the repetition of a word as a compound 
word is unacceptable.  For example, if  “air, air mattress” were given, credit 
would go only to “air”.   
 
 However, words that have the same root, yet refer to clearly different things, 
should be given credit.  For example, if “fool, foolhardy” or “fireman, fireplug” were 
given, credit would go to both words.  (These are also one word responses, not two 
words with the same first word.)  The best rule of thumb for determining whether a 
word is a repetition or not is to refer to the phrase in the instructions that asks the 
patients not to “use the same word again with a different ending.”  
 
 Numbers pose a problem because some patients attempt to give a series of 
numbers.  In keeping with the rules above, “five, fifty, and fifteen” would all receive 
credit, yet “fifty -one, fifty-two” or “five, five thousand” would receive only one point.

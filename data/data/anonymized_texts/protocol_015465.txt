 1 BACKGROUND  
 
CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has long recommended annual influenza 
vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications.  In June 2018, ACIP voted 
to reaffirm this core recommendation for the 2018- 2019 influen za season.  Specifically, ACIP stated that: 
For the 2018-19 season, immunization providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-
appropriate, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). LAIV4 is an option for those for whom it is otherwise appropriate
1.  Influenza vaccination is particularly important for persons at high risk for 
medical complications attributed to severe influenza.1  It is anticipated that the recommendations will be 
similar for the 2019- 20 season. ACIP designates persons with asthma t o be at higher risk for severe 
influenza.1  
 Asthma, a chronic, inflammatory disease of the pulmonary airways, can be life- threatening if not 
adequately managed.
2 According to the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), in 2016, 8.4 
million children <18 years (9.3%) had (current) asthma, with increased prevalence of asthma among older, compared with younger children [0- 4 years ( 3.8%); 5 -11 years ( 9.6%); 12 -17 years (10.5%)].
3 
Children in economically disadvantaged families were also more likely to have asthma ( 10.7%) than 
children in families that were not disadvantaged (6.7 %).3 Furthermore, children with asthma are more 
likely to require hospitalization for influenza, and to experience asthma exacerbations after influenza 
illness.4,5 Despite this, NHIS data for the 2012-2013 influenza season revealed that influenza vaccination 
among children with asthma 2 -17 years averaged almost 5 5%, up from 32% in 2004-2005, yet, this 
proportion still falls short of the Healthy People 2020 influenza vaccination goal of 80% for children with 
asthma (aged 6 months- 17 years).6-8    
 Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)  is administered intranasally , and replication of the vaccine 
virus occurs primarily in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells . This replication can lead to sym ptoms of nasal 
congestion.
9,10   Since 2013, all LAIV formulations used in the United States ha ve been quadrivalent 
LAIV (LAIV4) ( FluMist® Quadrivalent ).  The Warnings and Precautions section of the FDA package 
insert for LAIV 4 states that , “persons of any age with asthma may be at increased risk of wheezing 
following the a dministration (of LAIV)” .10  Similarly, ACIP considers a sthma in persons aged ≥5 years a 
precaution for LAIV use.1  Because of the potential  for increased risk of wheezing after LAIV,  the use of 
LAIV in persons with asthma has been an area of vaccine safety research for many years; the  safety  issue 
remain s unresolved . Broadening the LAIV recommendation to include persons with asthma could have 
several advantages: 1. Ease of program implementation, especially in busy clinic or school-based vaccination settings; 2. Ease of implementation and greater options for influenza pandemic preparedness; and 3. Grea ter options for children with needle phobia. A clinical study to assess the safety of LAIV4 in 
children with asthma could expand the evidence base and inform clinical decision-making and public 
health policy.  Below we present a summary of the safety data of LAIV in children and recent changes in 
ACIP recommendations for use of LAIV.  
 
Review of Safety Evidence for LAIV in Children .  In 2014, after completing a review of available 
evidence, ACIP concluded that for healthy children aged 2- 8 years, risks for harms assessed (including 
fever, wheezing, and serious adverse events) appeared to be similar for LAIV and IIV.11 However, for 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0 
03July 2019  
  7 
 children with chronic medical conditions placing them at higher risk for influenza complications, 
including asthma, data on the relative safety of LAIV and IIV were limited.11 Most studies suggested that 
LAIV was not associated with an increased risk of wheezing events after vaccination in children who are 
at least 2 years of age and that did not  have a prior history of asthma and wheezing.12 However, data 
regarding LAIV safety in persons with a history of asthma or wheeze were less clear.12-14 One study of 
LAIV safety specified in the methods that children with severe asthma were included; no safety concerns 
were identified, but the small study (N=48) conducted in one season limited the ability to draw 
conclusions.13 There is even less information about the safety of LAIV4 in persons with asthma when 
compared with trivalent LAIV ; LAIV4 has been the only live influenza vaccine product available in the 
United States  since the 2013-14 influenza season.  
 
In an effort to further assess the safety of LAIV in participant s with asthma, several clinical trials have been 
conducted over the past decade. These will be briefly summarized to provide a context for the prop osed study. 
Redding et al. assessed the safety and tolerability of LAIV in children > 9 years of age with moderate to severe 
asthma.13 They enrolled 48 subjects (24 participant s and 24 controls) into a randomized, double blind, placebo-
controlled study; spirometry was  performed twice before vaccination to establish a baseline forced expiratory 
volume (FEV1) and once 2 to 5 days thereafter. The primary outcome was the percent change in percent -
predicted FEV1 before and after vaccination; a reduction of ≥15%  was the prespecified endpoint . Peak flows, 
clinical asthma symptom scores and n ighttime awakening scores were also measured daily from 7 days pre- to 
28 days post -vaccination. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure (percentage  change in 
percent predicted FEV1) between the treatment and placebo groups (P = 0.78). Secondary outcomes did not 
differ between the two groups either; these included the number of participant s with a decrease in FEV1, 
reductions in peak flows, use of beta- adrenergic rescue medications, asthma exacerbations and clinical asthma 
symptom scores befo re and after vaccination. The same proportion of participant s in each group experienced 
post-vaccination symptoms within 10 days (92% and 91%, respectively; P = 1.0). No serious adverse events 
occurred. These data were reassuring for the safety of LAIV in asthmatic children but were of small sample 
size.13  
 
To further evaluate the safety of LAIV in children and adolescents, a larger randomized, double blind, 
placebo- controll ed safety trial in healthy children age 12 months to 17 years was conducted by Bergen et 
al., in a large health maintenance organization.15 Children were randomized 2:1 to receive either LAIV or 
placebo. Children <9 years of age received a second dose of LAIV or placebo 28 to 42 days after the first 
dose. Enrolled children were followed for 42 days after each vaccination for all medically att ended 
events. A total of 9689 evaluable children were enrolled in the study. Of the 4 pre- specified diagnostic 
categories (acute respiratory tract events, systemic bacterial infection, acute gastrointestinal tract events, 
and rare events potentially associ ated with wild -type influenza), none was associated with vaccine receipt. 
However, a significantly increased relative risk (4.06; 90% confidence interval, 1.29 to 17.86) of reactive 
airway disease was observed in children 18 to 35 months of age.15  
 
Given these concerns regarding the triggering of asthma by LAIV, Piedra et al . conducted an even larger 
open- label, non -randomized, community-based trial of LAIV in children 18 months to 18 years of age 
over a four -year period.16 In the four years of the study 18,780 doses of LAIV were administered to 
11,096 children. Medical records of all children were surveyed for serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
health care utilization was evaluated for medically attended acute respiratory illness and asthma. No 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0 
03July 2019  
  8 
 increased risk of asthma events for 0 to 14 days after vaccination was observed in children of any age 
group. In vaccine year 1, children who were 18 months to 4 years of age did have a significantly higher risk for asthma events 15 to 42 days after vaccination (RR 2.85; 95% CI: 1.01-8.03), but this was not seen 
in year 2. The authors concluded, “…although the possibility for a true increased risk for asthma was 
observed in one of the four years of the study in children who were 18 months to 4 years of age at 15 to 42 days after vaccination, it is more likely that the association is a chance effect because of the 190 comparisons made without adjustment for multiple comparisons.” They also concluded that LAIV was 
safe and not associated with an increase in asthma events in children who are younger than 5 years.
16  
 
Utilizing the same population as Piedra, Gaglani et al. administered a single LAIV dose to healthy 
children aged 1.5- 18 years with history of intermittent wheezing.17 As in the earlier study, they assessed 
the rates of medically attended acu te respiratory illnesses, including acute asthma exacerbation, during 0-
14 and 0-42 days post- LAIV and also assessed the risk of new -onset asthma in LAIV recipients. During 
each of the 4 study years, a total of 454, 656, 656, and 430 children with intermittent wheezing who 
received LAIV, respectively, had no increased risk for medically attended acute respiratory illnesses, 
including asthma exacerbation. First-dose LAIV recipients, including those aged 1.5-4 years, and those 
receiving 2- 4 consecutive annual  doses had no increased risk. Children with parental report of intermittent 
wheezing and those with administrative database codes for asthma during the two prior years had no 
increased risk of wheezing. In addition, during the 4 years of the study, 2,952, 3,092, 2,953, and 2,478 
children without history of wheezing, respectively, had no increased risk of new- onset asthma. The 
authors concluded that “LAIV administration in children aged 1.5- 18 years with a history of intermittent 
wheezing was safe, and was not associated with increased risk for medically -attended acute respiratory 
illnesses, including acute asthma exacerbation during any of the study years.”17  
 
Ashkenazi et al. compared the safety of LAIV and trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV)  in young 
children with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections.18 Children 6 to 71 months of age were 
randomized to receive 2 doses of LAIV (n = 1101) or TIV (n = 1086), 35 +/ - 7 days apart before the start of the 
2002- 2003 influenza season. They were followed for vaccine effectiveness and safety. Overall, 52.7% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 21.6% -72.2%) fewer cases of influenza caused by virus strains antigenically similar 
to vaccine were observed in LAIV than TIV recipients. Greater relative efficacy for LAIV was observed for the antigenically similar A (H1N1 ) (100.0% ; 95% CI = 42.3% -100.0%) and B (68.0%; 95% CI = 37.3% -84.8%) 
strains but not for the antigenically similar A (H3N2 ) strains ( -97.1%; 95% CI = - 540.2% to 31.5%). Relative to 
TIV, LAIV reduced the number of respiratory tract infection healthcare provider visi ts by 8.9% (90% CI = 
1.5% -15.8%) and missed days of school, kindergarten, or day care by 16.2% (90% CI = 10.4% -21.6%). Rhinitis 
and rhinorrhea, otitis media, and decreased appetite were the only events that were reported more frequently in LAIV recipients (monitored for 11 consecutive days after vaccination). There was no difference between groups 
in the incidence of wheezing after vaccination (during the 42 days after vaccination). LAIV was well tolerated 
in these children and demonstrated superior relative efficacy compared with TIV in preventing influenza illness.
18  
 Given the concern about the safety of LAIV administration in patients with asthma, a large open -label study was 
conducted among 2,229 asthmatic child ren aged 6 to 17 years by Fleming et al . during the 2002-2003 
influenza season.
4 Children receiving high-dose systemic corticosteroids were excluded from the study, 
but the study did not quantify the level of severity of the underlying asthma among study participants. 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0 
03July 2019  
  9 
 Nearly 70% of children were on inhaled corticosteroids.  No significant differences were reported between 
the LAIV and TIV vaccine recipients in the incidence of asthm a exacerbations (during 42 days after 
vaccination), mean peak expiratory flow rates, asthma symptom scores, or nighttime awakening scores. 
Rhinorrhea and nasal congestion were common ly reported symptoms among recipients of LAIV during the 15 
days after stu dy vaccination ; injection site reactions were the most commonly reported symptoms among 
recipients of TIV. Overall, there was no evidence of a significant increase in adverse pulmonary outcomes 
for LAIV compared with TIV. LAIV had a significantly greater r elative efficacy of 35% compared with 
TIV in this high-risk population.4 This well designed and conducted clinical trial serves as a model for the 
conduct of the proposed trial.   
More recently, t he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vaccine Safety Datalink published a 
study assessing the safety of LAIV in persons with asthma.
19  They assessed medically -attended 
respiratory events during the 14 days after LAIV (trivalent LAIV and monovalent 2009 H1N1 pandemic 
LAIV) compared with the 29 to 42 days after vaccination among persons 2 through 49 years over three 
influenza seasons (2008 -2009; 2009-2010; 2010-2011).  Most patients had intermittent or mild persistent 
asthma. Medically -attended upper or lower respiratory events (outp atient or inpatient) were not 
significantly increased after LAIV. This was true for younger children 2- 8 years as well as older children 
9-17 years.   
Summary of r ecent history of ACIP guidance for use of LAIV .  Based on influenza surveillance systems 
and published pre- and post- licensure clinical study data, ACIP recommendations for live attenuated 
influenza vaccine (LAIV) use in healthy children aged ≥2 years have changed over recent years. During 
2007-2008 thro ugh the 2013-2014 influenza seasons, ACIP recommended that either live attenuated 
influenza vaccine (LAIV) or IIV could be used for these children.9 In 2014, after completing an evidence 
review, ACIP concluded that data supported the superior efficacy for LAIV versus IIV in children aged 2-8 years; in response ACIP recommended a preference for LAIV over IIV in this age group during the 
2014- 15 influen za season.
11 However, following thi s preferred recommendation, new data emerged 
suggesting that LAIV did not have superior efficacy over IIV.20 Therefore for the 2015-16 influenza 
season, ACIP removed the preference and recommended that either LAIV or IIV could be used in  healthy 
children aged ≥2 years.20  Due to concerns regarding lack of effectiveness of quadrivalent LAIV 
(FluMist ® Quadrivalent; LAIV4; MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) during the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 
influenza seasons,  ACIP voted in June 2016 to recommend against use of LAIV4 in persons of any age 
during the 2016- 2017 influenza season ,21  and continued the recommendation against use of LAIV4 
during the 2017- 2018 influenza season .1   The manufacturer (MedImmune/AstraZeneca) identified that a 
more immunogenic strain of post- pandemic A(H1N1) was  needed to improve the immune response to 
LAIV4. The manufacturer changed the vaccine formulation and carried out clinical studies of viral 
shedding and antibody response to the new LAIV4 formulation in young children.  Results of these studies were presen ted at the February 2018 ACIP meeting.
22  Based on results of these studies and 
additional investigations, the ACIP voted on F ebruary 21, 2018, to recommend inclusion of the updated 
quadrivalent formulation of LAIV (FluMist®; LAIV4) among vaccines eligible for use during the 2018-2019 influenza season.
22,23  On June 8, 2018, CDC published the updated recommendation for use of the 
Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4) during the 2018- 2019 influenza season : “For 
the 2018–19 U.S. influenza season, providers may choose to administer any licensed, age- appropriate 
influenza vaccine (IIV, recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV], or LAIV4). LAIV4 is an option for those for 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0

  10 
 whom it is otherwise appropriate. No preference is expressed for any influenza vaccine product.”23  It is 
anticipated that the recommendations will be similar for the 2019 -20 season. 
 
In September 2015, CDC’s Immunization Safety Office- Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment 
(CISA) Project awarded 3 medical research centers a contract to conduct a clinical study to assess the 
safety of LAIV versus IIV in children 5-11 years diagnosed with persistent asthma.  This study intended 
to enroll participants during the 2016-2017 influenza season; however, these plans were postponed 
temporarily during the 2016-2017 and 2017- 2018 influenza s easons due to the ACIP recommendation 
against use of LAIV.  ACIP’s vote in February 2018 to recommend use of LAIV4 and express ed no 
preference for use of LAIV or IIV in children  during the 2018- 19 influenza season .  This vote ma de it 
feasible for this CISA vaccine safety study to proceed, and it is anticipated that the recommendation s will 
be similar for the 2019-20 season.

 2  STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1  Study Objectives  
2.1.1  Primary Objective  
 
1. To compare proportions of participants with asthma exacerbation s during the 42 days (until day 
43) after quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV4 ) versus quadrivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine (IIV4 ) in children with asthma aged 5-17 years.  
 
The hypothesis for this primary objective is that the proportion of asthma exacerbations after LAIV4 is 
non-inferior to the proportion of asthma exacerbations after IIV4 (proportion of asthma exacerbations is 
NOT higher in the LAIV4 group vs. the IIV4  group).  
2.1.2 Secondary Objectives  
1. To compare proportions of participant s with asthma exacerbation s during the 14 days after 
LAIV4 versus IIV 4  
2. To compare the proportions of participant s with asthma symptoms and unscheduled albuterol use 
during the 14 days after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4 
3. To compare the proportion of participants that experience a clinically significant decrease in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) from baseline during the 14 days after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4 
2.1.3   Exploratory Objectives 
1. To compare proportions of participant s with asthma exacerbations during the 14 days and 42 days 
after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4 , by asthma severity group 
2. To compare the proportions of par ticipants with asthma symptoms and unscheduled albuterol use 
during the 14 days after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4, by asthma severity group 
3. To compare the proportion of participant s who experience a clinically significant decrease in 
PEFR from baseline during the 14 days after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4, by asthma severity group 
4. To describe and compare changes in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) from baseline (pre-
vaccination) PEFR after vaccination over time during the 14 days after LAIV4 versus IIV4, by

2.2  Study Outcome Measures   
2.2.1 Primary Outcome Measure  
1. Comparison of the proportion of participants experiencing an asthma exacerbation during the 42 
days after LAIV4 vs. IIV4 (until day 43).  
 
According to the 2007 Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma , asthma exacerbations, “ are acute or subacute episodes of progressively worsening shortness 
of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness ( or some combination of these symptoms ). 
Exacerbations are characterized by decreases in expiratory airflow that ca n be documented and 
quantified by simple  measures of lung function [spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF)]”.
24   For  
this study, asthma exacerbation will be defined as :  any acute episode of progressively worsening 
shortness of breath  (dyspnea), cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and/or respiratory dis tress d uring 
the 42 days (until day 43) after influenza vaccination for which the patient seeks unscheduled medical 
attention (e.g., healthcare provider office  or Emergency  Department visit or hospitalization)  or 
receives a new prescription for systemic corticosteroids.   
2.2.2  Secondary Outcome M easures  
1. Comparison of the proportion of participants experiencing an asthma exacerbation during the 14 days 
after LAIV4 vs. IIV4. 
For the purposes of this outcome me asure, t he above definition of asthma exacerbation (section 
2.2.1) is modified to include the time period of 14 days after receipt of influenza vaccine (LAIV4 
or IIV4)  
 
2. Comparison of the proportion of participants with asthma symptoms and unscheduled albuterol use 
during the 14 days after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4 (each is assessed separately).

 4   STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES  
 
4.1  Recruitment  
 
This is a prospective randomized, open label clinical trial in approximately 300 children aged 5-17 years , 
inclusive, with a physician diagnosis of persistent asthma.  The study will be conducted at three sites: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Lead site), Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center 
(contributing site), and Duke University Medical Center (contributing site) during the 2018-2019 and 
2019-2020 influenza season s. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a single intranasal 
dose of LAIV4 or an intramuscular injection of IIV4, stratifyin g by asthma severity (mild vs. moderate-
to-severe)  and by age group (5-11 years vs. 12- 17 years of age).  Vanderbilt will enroll approximately  100 
participants , Cinc innati will enroll approximately 110 participant s, and Duke will enroll  approximately  90 
participants.  All sites will begin enrolling when study vaccines become available.   Recruitment will 
occur at various clinics at the three study sites.   At all sites, study participants will be compensated for  the 
initial clinic visit at enrollment , and  for each study visit follow-up (excluding reminder -only 
communications), as outlined in Section 4.3.  A social security number will be requested for the parent, 
legal guardian, or  child who receives monetary compensation for participating in  this study.   A child may 
participate in this study even if their parent or legal guardian chooses not to provide a social security 
number; however, the study  will not be able to provide compensation to the parent, legal guardian, or 
child  if a social security number is not provided.  
 
4.2  Enrollment  and Randomization 
 
Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either a single intranasal dose of licensed quadrivalent LAIV4 or an intramuscular injection of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), stratifying by 
asthma severity (mild vs. moderate- to-severe) and age (5-11 vs. 12- 17 years of age) . Asthma severity 
level will be assessed at Visit 1 (see Table 2, section 4. 4).  Randomization will be done separately for 
each site. Each site may have more than one clinic to recruit participants, and proportions of participants 
with mild or moderate -to-severe asthma can vary by clinics. Randomization will be accomplished using 
the REDCap System, hosted at Vanderbilt, or a back -up method if REDCap is temporarily unavailable . 
REDCap is a web-based system  that is easily accessible to the other collaborating sites. This study will be 
open label and study staff and participant s will not be blinded to treatment arm assignments .

 4.4  Assignment of Asthma Severity  
 
After the informed consent  process , asthma severity will be assessed for each child according to the 
classification schema described  on Table 2, section 4.4.1.    
4.4.1  Characterizing Asthma Severity  
Prior to randomization, it will be necessary to characterize asthma severity in each patient (see Table 2). 
For this study, we will only recruit participants with persistent asthma and will recruit within the full clinical sp ectrum of asthma severity described in Table 2 (mild, moderate, and severe).  For this study, we 
have created distinct  categories of asthma severity levels, using existing literature and clinical judgement. 
Study staff should use these definitions at time of enrollment to identify if the children have mild -, 
moderate -, or severe -persistent asthma.   For the purposes of our study, the categories of asthma severity 
reflect the intensity of medical treatment needed to: 1) obtain op timal control of asthma, and 2) minimize 
impairment and risk resulting from asthma. 
 This categorization was adapted from the National Asthma 
Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 that was issued in September 2011 and the associated Quick Reference Guide https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/media/docs/asthma_qrg_0_0.pdf

 4.5  Baseline demographic and health data  
 
All patients enrolled in the study will have baseline demographic and clinical data obtained from their 
parents/legal guardian at the time of enrollment and clarified with available medical records if necessary . 
These data will  include age, gender, height, weight, BMI , allerg y history, conditions for which the child 
takes prescribed or over-the-counter medications or supplements, and the list of medications or 
supplements.  If these data are not available from the clinic record , they will be obtained from the 
parent (s) or legal guardia n(s).  
 
4.6  Individual Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) Evaluations 
 Participants will be trained on the “at home” performance of PEFR using a digital hand held device 
purchased by study funds  and that participant s will get to keep after completing the study . The device is 
easily learned, and it can provide an objective measure of control of asthma symptoms. Typically, a participant ’s PEFR is measured while standing by the  highest of 3 efforts. These measurements should be 
completed in the evening, before taking daily controller medication, to minimize variations that may be 
influenced by diurnal changes. Additionally, the PEFR maneuver should be attempted after completion of the two surveys that assess asthma control (c- ACT/ACT  and PROSE) to avoid b ias in the recording of 
daily symptoms. All efforts will be made to minimize variation in technique; training in proper digital peak flow meter use will be accomplished at study enrollment and reviewed  at each study call .  
 
For this study, all sites will p rovide participants with a digital peak flow meter. This device has an 
automatic memory for peak flow measurements and each entry is marked  with a time stamp; thus, 
participants will be instructed to  record their daily PEFR data measurements on their memor y aid  until 
day 15.

4.7  Vaccine Delivery  
 
Only U.S.-licensed vaccines will be used in this study. These vaccines will be used according to the 
approved FDA package insert . The vaccines will be obtained from the study site pharmacies and will be 
administered by a licensed provider (RN, NP, PA, MD) from the study team. Both of the vaccines will be quadri valent . The  summaries from the package inserts of the two proposed vaccines are shown below.  
The influenza vaccines formulated for use during the 2018-2019 or 2019-2020 influenza season shall be used in this study for the respective season . Vaccines will be administered in a manner that is consistent 
with ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization .

 the United States there is only one licensed formulation of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4; 
FluMist® Quadrivalent ; AstraZeneca ), and this will be used in all sites for the study.   
4.7.2  Fluzone® Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (suspension for intramuscular injection)  
Fluzone® Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4; Sanofi  Pasteur) is a vaccine indicated for active 
immunization for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza A subtype viruses and type B 
viruses contained in the vaccine .28  Fluzone® Quadrivalent is approved for use in persons 6 months of age 
and older for intramuscular administration by a healthcare provider.  There is no precaution or contraindication against using Fluzone
® Quadrivalent in persons with asthma.   In the event of lack of 
availability of Fluzone® Quadrivalent, another U.S.- licensed age-appropriate quadrivalent IIV product 
may be used according to the FDA package insert.29  
4.7.3  Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Single and 2- Dose Considerations for Participants aged 5 -8 years 
Evidence from several studies indicates that children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine (administered a min imum of 4 weeks apart) during their first season of vaccination for 
optimal protection.
1   For children aged 5-8 years, the ACIP recommends  2 doses of seasonal influenza 
vaccine, administered at least 4 weeks apart, if they have not previously received 2 or more total doses of trivalent or quadrivalen t influenza vaccine before July 1 of the current influenza season . For purposes of 
this study, July 1, 2018 would be used as the cutoff date for the 2018-2019 influenza season , and July 1, 
2019 would be used as the cutoff date for the 201 9-2020 influenza season . The two doses need not to 
have been received during the same season or consecutive seasons. See Fig 2, (Influenza vaccine dosing 
algorithm for children aged 6 months through 8 years- Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, 
United States, 2018. ). 
20  If a child needs two doses, it is acceptable for one dose to be LAIV4 and the 
other dose to be IIV3 or IIV4.  
 
Among participants 5 through 8 years otherwise eligible for enrollment into this study, Vanderbilt, 
Cincin nati, and Duke will assess during the pre- enrollment process and at the time of enrollment whether 
one or two doses of seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for each of these potential study 
participant s. For study participant s in the 5- to-8year age ca tegory who are recommended to receive two 
doses of seasonal influenza vaccine during 2018-2019 or 2019-2020 influenza season s, the following 
guidance will be used:   
• For those receiving dose #1 of influenza vaccine at Visit #1 during the study, t he parent (s) or legal 
guardian (s) will be educated to seek the second dose from their usual healthcare provider; 
administration of the second dose will not be a study procedure . Study staff may facilitate, but will 
not be responsible for , making the appointment for the child to receive the second dose of the 
seasonal influenza vaccine at the healthcare provider office.  The parent (s) or legal guardian(s)  must 
also be informed that the child wou ld be eligible to receive Dose #2 beginning 4 weeks after Dose #1, 
but that the study will request that Dose #2 be administered after Day #43 to allow for the study to 
assess asthma symptoms during a complete 6 -week timeframe after the vacc ination. If during the 
study a parent (s) or legal guardian(s)  changes their mind, and the child receives the second dose 
before day #43, the parent or legal guardian will be instructed to inform the study staff .  In addition, if 
there is widespread circulation of influenza virus in the local community  at the time of enrollment (as 
assessed by the study site investigator (s), in consultation with local public health experts ), this request 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0 
03July 2019  
  26 
 to postpone D ose #2 will be removed.  In  74% of influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2015–16, 
peak influenza activity did  not occur until January or later, and in 59% of seasons, the peak was in 
February or later.1  
• For children aged 5-8 years who have already received dose #1 during the 2018-2019 or 2019-2020 
influenza season s before enrollment in this study, and who are recommended to receive Dose #2, 
study staff will ensure that at least 4 weeks have elapsed since Dose #1 before administering Dose #2 during this study.  Study staff will document if Dose #1 or Dose #2 was administered during this study (at Visit #1)

recommendation is anticipated to be similar (using the July 1, 2019 cutoff) for the 2019-
2020 season]   
 
The seasonal influenza vaccine (quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccin e or quadrivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine) will be administered at baseline (Day 1 of study) according to the study randomization 
scheme.   
  4.8  Monitoring Vaccine Safety in the First 15 Days 
 On the vaccination day and for the next 14 days post-vaccination (until day 15), all participant s will be 
monitored daily by their parent(s) or legal guardian(s)  and the information will be recorded using memory 
aids provided at the enrollment visit. Daily  reactogenicity, including measurement of nighttime 
awakening, and unscheduled albuterol use and t wo validated questionnaires
 will be completed ( c-
ACT/ACT  and PROSE) .  PROSE will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and on Day 15 . FIGURE 2. Influenza vaccine dosing algorithm for children aged 6 months through 8 years —

In addition to the two questionnaires  above, several predefined events that could occur after vaccine 
administration will also be recorded for 14 days after vaccination (through day 15). These will include 
fever (oral temperature ≥100.4°F) , asthma symptoms , and other respiratory and systemic symptoms . 
Medication receipt, new prescriptions for asthma medications,  and any previously unscheduled healthcare 
utilization (medical office visits, ED visits, hospitalizations) will also be documented on the reaction 
form. To ensure compliance with the reaction assessment, parents will be called , emailed through 
REDCap , or receive text messages on Days 4, 8 and 15 by the study staff.  
 On the day of vaccination and during the first 14 days (until day 15) after vaccination, if the participant  
reports an increase in their symptoms and an increase in the need for medications for their asthma, the family will be instructed to contact the study staff, so medical records can later be collected , if needed. If 
at any point a st udy participant is experiencing symptoms of any asthma exacerbation, the participant or 
their parent will be instructed to contact their primary care provider (PCP ) and inform study staff of this 
encounter.   
 
4.9  Extended follow -up for days 16 -43 
 After the initial 15 -day follow up after vaccination, there will be an extended surveillance period for 
safety assessment from day 1 6 after vaccination for a total of 42 days (Day 43). This will be 
accomplished by a telephone call , text messaging,  or email  through the REDCap system to the parents of 
the participants, depending on their preference and their availability, at day 29 and at day 44 to determine the status of asthma control. On Day 29, participants will be queried about concomitant medications , 
unsolicited symptoms, serious adverse events, and medical services utilization. On day 44, participants 
will be queried about concomitant medications , unsolicited symptoms, serious adverse events, and 
medical services utilization , as defined above. The c- ACT/ACT  score will also be completed at day 44. 
 During the extended follow up period, parents/legal guardian  will be instructed to contact the study staff 
if the participant has an
 unscheduled medical visit for management of asthma symptoms  or a new asthma 
medication prescribed. 
 
4.10  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded on the memory aid  and will include the need for new prescription 
or nonprescription medications for the control of asthma, an unscheduled healthcare provider visit or consultation within 42 days (until day 43) after vaccination, any other clinically significant event occurring at any point during the study period. Serious AEs (SAEs) will also be monitored through 42 
days (until day 43) after vaccination and will include events that result in death, were life threatening, 
result in participant  hospitalization or prolongation  of existing hospitalization, result in persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity. Additionally, important medical events that may not have resulted in 
death, were not life threatening, or did not require hospitalization might be considered SAEs when, according to appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the patient or participant  and require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Medical records will be requested 
and reviewed to evaluate SAE and assess relatedness of SAEs to receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4

 5  RISKS  
 
5.1  Vaccines  
 
All participants will receive the CDC Vaccine Information Statements (VIS ) 
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current- vis.html ) before vaccination. With any medicine, 
including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions. These are usually mild and go away on thei r own, but 
serious reactions are also possible. Any medication or vaccine can cause a severe allergic reaction, 
including anaphylaxis. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million 
doses, and would happen within a few minut es to a few hours after the vaccination. As with any 
medicine, there is a very small chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death. 
5.1.1  Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV)  
ACIP routinely recommends IIV for children with asthma9,11,20 and risks after IIV would  be expected to 
be no higher than those encountered through usual care. Most people who get a flu shot do not have any problems with it. Minor problems following a flu shot may include:  soreness, redness, or swelling where 
the shot was given, hoarseness, sore, red or itchy eyes, cough, fever, aches, headache, itching, fatigue. If 
these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1 or 2 days.  More serious problems 
following a flu shot can include the following: There may be a small increased risk of Gu illain -Barré 
Syndrome (GBS) after inactivated flu vaccine. This risk has been estimated at 1 or 2 additional cases per million people vaccinated, primarily in adults.  This is much lower than the risk of severe complications from flu, which can be prevented by flu vaccine. Problems could happen after any injected vaccine: People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after vaccination can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by a fall. Some people get 
severe pain in the shoulder and have difficulty moving the arm where a shot was given. 
5.1.2  Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) 
ACIP considers use of LAIV as a precaution for children aged ≥5 years with asthma.
1 In addition to the 
usual risks as described in the VIS  (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current-vis.html ), children with 
asthma might experience higher rates of asthma exacerbations after LAIV than with IIV.9,11,20 Most 
people who get LAIV do not have any problems with it. Reactions to LAIV may resemble a very mild 
case of flu. Some of the most common symptoms  that have been reported following LAIV in children and 
adolescents 2 -17 years of age are runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, fever, headache, 
muscle aches, wheezing, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea .10  
 There is also the potent ial risk of loss of confidentiality about the  information obtained as part of this 
study (see section 9) .

 6  REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Parent (s) or legal guardian(s) who at any time express any concern about symptoms or serious unsolicited 
events will be encouraged to follow up with their child’s health care provider. 
Serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be reported to CDC and all participating IRBs according to 
institu tional requirements.  
If indicated, adverse events will be reported to CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS). The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires healthcare providers to report:  
• Any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the 
vaccine; or 
• Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination 
(https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf ) 
[link accessed 5/2/2019 ) that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination. 
In addition, CDC encourages reporting of any clinically significant adverse event that occurs in a patient following a vaccination, even if there is uncertainty regarding if a vaccine caused the event.  
 
As noted in section 4.10, a SAE is an AE meeting one or more of the following criteria 
• Life-threatening illne ss  
• Death  
• Hospitalization - An event requiring inpatient hospitalization 
• Prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  
 
Additionally, important medical events that may not have resulted in death, were not life threatening, or 
did not require hospitalization might be considered SAEs when, according to appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the patient or participant  and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above.  These will be reported to the IRBs. SAEs will be assessed for 
relatedness to vaccine: related  or not related.  
 
Participants who report severe solicited AEs or SAEs or express any concern about symptoms, and/or 
unsolicited events will be encouraged to follow up with their pediatrician or primary care provider. Severe 
solicited or unsolicited adverse events are those that prevent daily activity and/or require a doctor’s office 
visit or a missed day of school or daycare.

7  STUDY WITHDRAWAL  AND  DISCONTINUATION  
 
Participant s may voluntarily withdraw their consent for study participation at any time and for any reason, 
without penalty. 
 
A participant may withdraw or be withdrawn from this study for any of the following reasons: 
• Medical disease or condition, or any new clinical findings for which continued participation, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub -investigator, would compromise 
the safety of the participant, or would interfere with the participant's successful completion of this 
study, or would interfere with the evaluation of responses. 
• As deemed necessary by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub- investigator for 
noncompliance or other reasons. 
• Participant  withdrawal of consent.  
• Participant  lost to follow -up. 
• Termination of this study. 
• New information becomes available that makes further participation unsafe.  
 
Participant s may withd raw their consent for study participation at any time and for any reason, without 
penalty.  
 
7.1  Handling of Withdrawals 
 
Participant s who withdraw from the study before randomization will be replaced. Participants who 
withdraw from the study after randomization will not be replaced. Every attempt should be made to 
collect all data specified by the protocol relative to study vaccine received  up to the time of withdrawal. 
Data collected before withdrawal will still be  used for analysis.  
  
7.2  Termination of Study  
 This study may be terminated for safety concerns of the PI, CDC, or participating IRBs.

8  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1  Sample Size Calculations  
 
This study aims to enroll approximately 300 participants (at least 100 from Vanderbilt, at least 110 from 
Cincinnati, and at least 90 from Duke). We assume that the proportion of asthma exacerbations in 42 days (until day 43) after vaccination is 12% after LAIV4 and IIV4.
4 We also assume that ~10% of the children 
may drop out, yielding a total sample of at least 270 (135 LAIV4 and 135 IIV4).    We expect the proportion of asthma exacerbation in LAIV4 (experimental group) will be at least as high as IIV group (control group).  The power estimate is shown below, given delta of 10% and one-sided 
alpha is set at 5% level.

IIV4 group (pc) Proportion of asthma 
exacerbation in LAIV4 
experimental group (pe) Estimated power to reject 
H0: pe – pc>=10% 
12% 12% 81.1%  
 
The null hypothesis will be rejected (and delta margin non-inferiority claimed) when the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the PE- PC is less than 10%.  IBM SPSS SamplePower 
software version 3.0.1 was used for the power calculation which was not adjusted for stratifying by site.  
8.2  Analysis plan 
  
Descriptive analyses will be summarized for continuous variables with mean, standard deviation, median, 
and interquartile range. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages. Explanatory figures will be generated to evaluate the data distribution.  Comparisons of demographic characteristics between LAIV4 and IIV4 groups will be conducted using Pearson Chi- square and 
Wilcoxon tests appropriately.   We will prepare three datasets for analyses populations for main analysis of the p rimary and secondary 
objectives.  These are defined below. 
 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:  
 
The ITT Population includes any participant that was enrolled, randomized into the study, and received a 
study vaccine at Visit 1.   
 
Per Protocol Population fo r 43 Days:  
 
The Per Protocol Population for 43 days is a subset of the ITT Population.  This is defined as all 
participant s who were randomized, vaccinated, completed study procedures through day 43, had no 
protocol violations that are likely to affect the objectives , and did not receive a second dose of influenza 
vaccine before day  43.   
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0 
03July 2019  
  32 
  
Per Protocol Population for 15 Days    
 
The Per Protocol Population for 15 days is a subset of the ITT Population.  This is defined as all participant s who were randomized, vaccinated, completed study procedures through day 15, and have no 
protocol violations that are likely to affect the objective s.  
 The Per Protocol population for 43 days is the primary analysis population for the Primary Objective. Statistical analyses for the Primary Objective will be performed for the ITT population and the Per Protocol for 43 days, or the ITT Population only if no participants are excluded from the Per Protocol 
Population.  The Per Protocol population for 15 days is the primary analysis population for the Secondary 
Objectives. Statistical analyses for the Secondary Objectives will be performed for the ITT p opulation 
and Per Protocol population for 15 days, or the ITT Population only if no participants are excluded from the Per Protocol Population.  The list of major protocol violations for analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 In the ITT and Per Protocol populations, participant s will be analyzed according to randomization 
assignment, rather than treatment group.  If applicable, sensitivity analyses on primary and secondary objectives will be done on datasets defined by treatment group.  For example, if a participant was 
assigned to LAIV4 and inadvertently received IIV4 that participant  would be reassigned to the IIV4 
treatment group in the sensitivity analyses.  
 
Adjustments for enrollment site and/or other covariates for study ob jectives will be described in the 
comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The analysis methods for the exploratory objectives, as 
well as sensitivity analyses, will be also be detailed in the SAP.  
 
All analyses will be performed using R 3.5.0 (r-project.org), SAS version 9.4, or STATA version 15, or 
updated software from these programs.  
8.2.1  Primary Objective  
1. To compare proportions of asthma exacerbations during the 42 days (until day 43) after LAIV4 
versus IIV4 in children with asthma aged 5 -17 years.  
 
The hypothesis for this primary objective is that the proportion of asthma exacerbations after LAIV4 is 
non-inferior to the proportion of asthma exacerbations after IIV4 (proportion of asthma exacerbations is NOT higher in the LAIV4 group vs. the IIV4 group). 
8.2.2  Primary Outcome Measure 
1. Proportions of asthma exacerbations in recipients of LAIV4 and IIV4 during the 42 days post -
vaccination (until day 43).  
 
The asthma exacerbation proportion within 42 days (until day 43) post-vaccination will be calculated for children receiving LAIV4 or IIV4 influenza vaccine.  For this calculation a child with an asthma 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0 
03July 2019  
  33 
 exacerbation (as defined earlier in the protocol) on one or more days during day 1-43 would be 
considered to have had an asthma exacerbation (dichotomous yes or no).  We propose a one- sided test for 
non-inferiority of asthma exacerbation in children receiving LAIV4 vs. children receiving IIV4.  More 
precisely , we hope to reject the null hypothesis H0 indicating a higher proportion of children with asthma 
exacerbation (above an acceptable margin DELTA=10%) in the experimental (LAIV4) group as 
compared to the control (IIV4) group. Namely, PE is the true probability of event (asthma exacerbation) in the experimental group, PC is the true probability of event in the control group, and DELTA indicates 
maximum clinically acceptable absolute increase in the probability of event in the experimental group 
over probability of event in the control group. We hope to reject: H0:  PE >=  PC + DELTA in favor of 
alternative hypothesis H1: PE < PC + DELTA.  The null hypothesis H0 will be rejected (and DELTA margin non-inferiority claimed) when the upper limit of the 95% one- sided  confidence interval for the 
PE-PC is less than DELTA. More explicitly, if pe is the estimated event proportion in the experimental 
group; pc  is the estimated event proportion in the control group; ne  is the number of children in the 
experimental group; and nc  if the number of children in the control group, then H0 is rejected if

8.2.3  Secondary Objectives and Secondary Outcome Measures (SOM)  
1. The first secondary objective (SO 1) is to compare the proportion of participants with asthma 
exacerbations during the 14 days (until day 15) after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4.  
 
Outcome measure:   Comparison of the proportion of participant s experiencing an 
asthma exacerbation during the 14 days after LAIV4 vs. IIV4. 
 
The analysis is similar to primary objective 1 using a one-sided non- inferiority test with 
the alpha level set at 0.05 and non-inferiority margin of 10% though asthma exacerbation proportions during the 14 days post- vaccination is the outcome.  
 
2. The second secondary object ive (SO 2) is to compare the proportion of participants with asthma 
symptoms and unscheduled albuterol use during the 14 days after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4.   
 
Outcome measures:    
 
SOM 2a: Proportions of participants with asthma symptoms of cough after LAIV4 vs. 
IIV4 during the 14 days post-vaccination.  SOM 2b: Proportions of participants with asthma symptoms of wheezing after LAIV4 vs. 
IIV4 during the 14 days post-vaccination. 
 SOM 2c: Proportions of participants with asthma symptoms of tightness in chest after 
LAIV4 vs. IIV4 during the 14 days post-vaccination. 
 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0

 SOM 2d: Proportions of participants with asthma symptoms of nighttime awakening after 
LAIV4 vs. IIV4 during the 14 days post-vaccination.  
SOM 2e: Proportions of participants with unscheduled albuterol use to treat asthma 
symptoms after LAIV4 vs. IIV4 during the 14 days post-vaccination.
 
Proportions of participant s with each asthma symptom (yes or no) along with 
unscheduled albuterol use to treat asthma symptoms (yes or no) will be compared 
between two treatment groups using Chi- square tests.  Proportions and difference of 
proportions between two treatment groups will be reported along with their 95% CIs.  No 
adjustments will be made to the alpha level (two -sided alpha=0.05) for this secondary 
objective. 
 
3. The third secondary objective (SO 3) is to compare the proportion of participants who experience a 
clinically significant decrease in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) from baseline during the 14 days 
after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4.  
 
Outcome  measure:   Proportions of participants that experience a clinically significant 
decrease in peak flow measurement from baseline (≥ 20% in PEFR from baseline) after 
LAIV4 vs. IIV4 during the 14 days post- vaccination  
 
Proportions of participant s with a clinically significant ( ≥ 20%) decrease in PEFR from 
baseline (yes or no) will be compared between two treatment groups using a Chi- square test.  
Proportions and difference of proportions by two treatment groups will be reported along with their 95% CIs.   No a djustments will be made to the alpha level (two -sided alpha=0.05) 
for this secondary objective.

 9  PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES   
 
Participant  confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the site principal investigators, other study personnel, 
the sponsor, and their agents.  Participants will have code numbers and will not be identified by name.   
 
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence.  No information concerning this study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third 
party without prior written approval of the sponsor. 
All information provided by the sponsor and all data and information generated by the participating as 
part of this study (other than a participant ’s medical records) will be kept confidential by the site principal 
investigators and other study personnel to the extent permitted by law. This informati on and data will not 
be used by the site principal investigator or other study personnel for any purpose other than conducting this study.  These restrictions do not apply to: (1) information which becomes publicly available through no fault of the site principal investigator or other study personnel; (2) information which is necessary to disclose in confidence to an IRB solely for the evaluation of this study; (3) information which is 
necessary to disclose in order to provide appropriate medical care to a study participant ; or (4) study 
results which may be published.  
A Certificate of Confidentiality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) covers this 
study.  Under this Certificate, the researchers may not disclose or use information or documents that may identify participants in any legal, administrative, legislative, or other action, unless the participant has 
consented for this use or the information is required to be reported by federal, s tate or local law such as

 10  DATA HANDLING AND RECORDS RETENTION  
 
Study records and reports, including, but not limited to, electronic case report forms (eCRFs), source 
documents, informed consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, shall be  
retained locally by each site in accordance with institutional record keeping requirements.  Across all sites, records will be retained for a minimum of 3 years after the study is closed, as is required under 45 
CFR 46.115(b).  
10.1  Data collection and data management  
 
The amount of data that will be collected for the proposed project will be substantial and will require a 
sophisticated, practical and flexible system that can accommodate different modes of data collection and several separate linked surveys. The novel Vanderbilt- designed resource developed specifically for online 
collection of research information, the REDCap platform, will be used to design study forms, including the memory aid forms, and short customized questionnaires to collect information from study 
participants. This system will be used by Vanderbilt, Cincinnati and Duke for data management.  All 
electronic linkages will fulfill regulations for protection of human participants and requirements to minimize the risk  of breach of confidentiality. After initial set-up, the workload required for electronic 
data collection will be substantially reduced (description of REDCap resources below).
30 The Vanderbilt, 
Cincinnati and Duke investigators have previously used the REDCap system for collection and analysis 
of large quantities of data. Participants ’ parent (s) or legal guardian(s) will fill out their paper memory aid  
and will  be contacted via phone calls , email s, and/ or a text messages according to the visit schedule in 
section 4.3.  The data will  be entered by study personnel onto REDCap. All study- related documents 
containing protected health information, e.g. enrollment logs, case report forms, will be maintained in 
secure research offices at Vanderbilt, Cincinnati and Duke, respectively, which are accessible to research 
staff only.  
10.1.1  Vanderbilt Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  
Investigators within the NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Research Unit at Vanderbilt have 
developed REDCap , to collect and manage data for diverse clinical and translational research studies.30 
REDCap was designed around the concept of giving research teams an easy method to specify project needs and rapidly develop secure, web-based applications for collection, management and sharing of research data. REDCap accomplishes these key functions through use of a single study metadata table referenced by presentation-level operational modules. Based on this abstracted programming model, 
databases are developed in an efficient manner with little resource investment beyond the creation of a 
single data dictionary. The concept of metadata-driven application development is well established, and the critical f actor for successful data collection lies in creating a simple workflow methodology allowing 
research teams to autonomously develop study- related metadata in an efficient manner.  REDCap  
includes secure institutional data hosting and full audit- trails in c ompliance with HIPAA security 
requirements. The REDCap Consortium is comprised of 647 active institutions , including CCHMC  and 
Duke Health Technology Solutions. The REDCap currently supports 68,000 projects with over 89,000 users spanning numerous research  focus areas across the consortium.  The current project will use this 
software application for the design of electronic forms to collect information from study participants, to

 link the baseline data, in an automated database family, to perform data cleaning and data quality 
assuranc e efficiently, and to design analytical dataset s for the analysis of the project data.  
 
Periodic data enrollment audits will be conducted through the recruitment period to help monitor study 
progress.  
10.1.2  Data cleaning an d data quality assurance  
To maximize data cleaning and data quality assurance, built- in filters and checks for consistency of the 
data including range and limit checks  and branching logic and pull-down menus to limit choices for 
categorical variables to a pre- specified list will be performed automatically to minimize data entry error. 
The data will be randomly sampled and checked against source records on a regular basis. The data and 
related analytical datasets will also be stored in the Dep artment of Biostatistics with secured password -
protected computers at Vanderbilt University. Data cleaning check and error reports will be generated on 
a regular basis for all sites.   
10.1.3  Role of the CDC Investigators in the Project  
This study is funded by a CDC contract with Vanderbilt University, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital 
Medical Center and Duke University as Task Orders in the CISA Project Contract. Vanderbilt University 
(C. Buddy Creech and Andrew Sokolow) will oversee the overall study and direct activities at Vanderbilt 
University.  Duke University (Emmanuel (Chip) Walter and Amy Stallings) will contribute participants 
and direct activities at Duke, and Mary Staat and Carolyn Kercsmar will contribute participants and direct activities at Cincinnati. CDC personnel will collaborate with the three study sites to develop the protocol, 
conduct the study, ensure the study is aligned with CDC public health priorities, and analyze the data and 
disseminate the results. CDC may receive access to cod ed data.

 11  ETHICS AND  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
11.1  Ethical Standard  
The site principal investigators will ensure that this trial is conducted in full conformity with principles of 
the Belmont Report:  Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research 
of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (April 18, 1979) and codified in 45 CFR 46 and ICH E6; 62 Federal Regulations 25691 (1997), 
if applicable.  The site principal investigator’s Institution will hold a current Federal Wide Assurance 
(FWA) issued by the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) for federally funded research. 
11.2  Institutional Review Board 
Prior to enrollment of participant s into this trial, the approved protocol and informed consent- parental 
permission documents will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IRB .  
11.3  Informed Consent Process  
11.3.1  Parental Permission  
The site principal investigator or designee will choose participant s in accordance with the eligibility 
criteria detailed in Section 3.  Before any study procedures are performed, the investigators must obtain 
and document the permission of the child’s parent (s) or legal guardian(s) , in accordance with the 
requirements of  45 CFR 46 and the local IRB. 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual agreeing to participate in a trial and 
continuing throughout the individual’s trial participation.  Before any study procedures are performed, 
participants ’ parent(s)  or legal  guardian(s) will receive a comprehensive explanation of the proposed 
study procedures and study intervention, study products (influenza vaccines), including the nature and 
risks of the trial, alternate therapies, any known AEs, and the other elements that are part of obtaining 
proper informed consent.  Participant s’ parent(s)  or legal  guardian(s) will also receive a detailed 
explanation of the proposed use and disclosure of their protected health information.  Participants’ 
parent(s)  or legal  guardian(s) will be allowed sufficient time to consider participation in the study, after 
having the nature and risks of the study explained to them, and have the opportunity to discuss the trial 
with their family, friends or legally authorized representative or think about it prior to agreeing to participate.  
Parental permission  forms describe in detail the study intervention, study products, study procedures, 
risks and possible benefits that are given to participant s. Parental permission  forms will be IRB -approved 
and the participant ’s parent (s) or legal guardian (s) will be asked to read and review the appropriate 
document.  Upon reviewing the appropriate document, the site principal investigator (or designee) will explain the research study to participant s and their parent(s)  or legal  guardian(s) and answer any questions 
that may arise.  If the participant’s parent (s) or legal guardian(s)  agrees, he, she , or they  will be asked to 
sign the parental permission document.  W ritten documentation of parental permission  is required prior to 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0

 starting any study procedures or interventions being done specifically for the trial, including 
administering study product  (seasonal influenza vaccine) . The parent (s) or legal guardian(s)  will be given 
a copy of all parental permission  forms that they sign. 
By signing the parental permission form, parent (s) or legal guardian(s) give permission on behalf of their 
children to participate in all aspects of the study.  
The rights and welfare of participant s will be protected by emphasizing to participant s that the quality of 
their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in or withdraw from this 
trial. 
11.3.2  Assent Process  
This study includes children aged 5 through 17 years . Assent will be obtained following local IRB 
policies and standard practice for obtaining and documenting assent.  During the  consent/ assent process, 
study staff will discuss the study with both the parent and child. For children who require assent based on 
local IRB policies, study staff  will actively solicit the assent (affirmative agreement) of the child .  A 
child’s failure to object will not will not be sufficient to demonstrate assent.

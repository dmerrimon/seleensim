Total Sample Size  Approximately 2 6 completers  
Sites  3 sites  
Study Design  This study is a Phase 2 randomized, crossover study comparing 
ORMD -0801 given QD versus TID in subjects with T1D. Subjects 
with T1D will have a screening visit  (Visit 1)  during which they will 
be required to review and sign the informed consen t form. Medical 
history and demographics will be collected. Vital signs will be 
measured, physical exam will be performed, and blood and urine 
samples will be collected for hematology/chemistry/urinalysis.  
Eligible subjects will be scheduled to return to t he clinic in 1 week 
(Visit 2). Subjects fulfilling all inclusion/exclusion criteria will have 
a CGM placed, provided with a diary, dispensed Placebo capsules 
and asked  to return to the clinic in 10 Days  (Visit 3, Day 1 ) for 
randomization. At Visit 3, data from CGM will be downloaded and 
diaries will be collected. Blood samples will be collected in f asting  
for chemistry and HbA1c. Subjects  will be randomized to receive 
either ORMD -0801 24 mg given once daily at bedtime, or ORMD -
0801 8 mg given three times a day, 45 -90 minutes before meals. 
Subjects  will be instructed to continue their normal diet, and to 
adjust their basal and bolus insulin in the normal fashion. Subjects  
will be instructed to return to the clinic 10 days  before Visit 5 (Visit 
4, Day 18). At Visit 4, compliance will be assessed, IMP and diary 
dispensed and the CGM will be placed. Subjects  will be instructed to 
return to the clinic in 10 days  for Visit 5 (Day 28) . At Visit 5  a 
fasting  blood sample for chemi stry panel and HbA1C will be drawn  
and after the diary has been collected and the CGM monitor 
removed,  they will be crossed over to the alternate treatment 
regimen. IMP will be dispensed, and the subject  will be asked  to 
return 10 days before Visit 7  for Visit 6 (Day 46). At Visit 6, 
compliance will be checked, IMP and diary  will be dispensed and

 the CGM will be placed. Subjects  will be instructed to return in 10 
days for Visit 7 (Day 56) . At Visit 7 the CGM will be removed, 
compliance checked, the di ary will be collected , and a blood sample 
will be drawn for a chemistry panel and HbA1C . A physical 
examination will be performed, and the subject  will exit the study.  
Subjects  will be provided with diaries at Visits 2, 4 and 6, and will 
be asked to captur e the amount of basal and bolus exogenous insulin

 Statistical Methods  Subjects will be analyzed under 3 treatment regimens: Standard of Care 
(Baseline), Once a Day Dosing (QD) and Three Times a Day Dosing 
(TID).  
Information collected in the daily diaries or via the Continuous Glucose 
Monitor (CGM) on the final 10 days of tr eatment will be analyzed 
using a Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance with subject as a 
random effect with each of the 10 days being a single measure. When 
analyzing the exogenous insulin variables, CGM parameters (mean 24 
hour glucose value and 24 hou r time within 70 -180 mg/dL range) and 
patient reported carbohydrate intake will be included as covariates. 
When analyzing CGM parameters, exogenous insulin (basal and bolus 
insulin amounts) and patient reported carbohydrate intake will be 
included as covar iates. Treatment least squares means and change from 
baseline estimates will be derived using this linear model.  
Information collected at the day 28 visits will be analyzed using an 
Analysis of Covariance model with subject as a random effect. 
Treatment le ast squares means and change from baseline estimates will 
be derived using this linear model.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
Diabetes mellitus is a  chronic metabolic  disorder that has reached epidemic proportions in the  
United States, affecting almost 8%  of the U.S. popul ation in 2007 (Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, 200 8). Diabetes mellitus is d efined by hyperglycemia (increased concentration 
of glucose in the  blood)  caused by defective insulin s ecretion (Type 1, T1D ), resistance to 
insulin action (Type 2, T2DM ), or a combination of  both. Diabetes mellitus l eads to an 
increased risk of  microvascular damage (retinop athy, nephropathy and neuropathy), reduced 
life expectancy, increased risk of  macrovascular compli cations (ischemic heart disease, stroke, 
and peripheral vascular disease), and diminish ed quality of life. This illn ess requires 
continuing  medical care, subject s elf-management, and education to p revent acute 
complications and reduce the risk of  long-term compli cations (American Diabetes Association, 
2009 ). 
The treatment goal for subjects with this dis ease is long-term glycemic control (over both fasting 
and non -fasting  blood glucose levels), which has been demonst rated in both T1D and T2DM  
subjects to reduce the morbiditi es associated with un controlled glycemic l evels (Diabetes Cont rol 
and Compli cations Trial Research Group, 1993; Cleary et al., 2006; UK Prospective Diabetes 
Study Group, 19 98a & 1998 b). Typical options for glycemic control in subjects with T1D 
include two or more injections of  insulin d aily, with dos es adjust ed on the  basis of  self-
monito ring of blood  glucose levels. Insulin replacement is accompli shed by giving a basal insulin 
and pre-prandial insulin. The basal insulin is either long acting (glargine or detemir) or 
intermediate-acting (NPH). The pre-prandial insulin is either rapid-acting (lispro, aspart, or 
glulisin e) or short-acting (regular). 
 
Glycemic control is m easured by subject s elf-monito ring of blood  glucose (SMBG), subject s elf-
monito ring of interstitial glucose, and periodic  blood t ests for measurement of h emoglobin A1C 
(HbA1c or A1C ). HbA1c levels reflect average glycemia over several months and th erefore 
provide  a surrogate for glycemic control (U.S. Food and Drug Administ ration, 2008 ). A 
consensus st atement written by the American Diabetes Association and the  European Association 
for the Study of Diabetes targets an HbA1c level of <7% as an obj ective for nonp regnant adults, 
who do not h ave complicating factors, for the prevention of micro- and m acrovascular disease 
(Nathan et al., 2009 ). 
 
Subcutaneously administ ered insulin is hi ghly effective at lowering glycemia and helping 
subjects achieve target HbA1c levels. Insulin h as no ov erall dose  limit with respect to s afety 
(except for hypoglycemia) and provides an improved lipid p rofile. However, subcutaneously 
administ ered insulin requires daily injections and blood glucose monito ring, and is associated 
with weight gain and an increased risk of  hypoglycemia. Insulin is available as formulations 
with di ffere nt ph armacokinetic (PK) and ph armacodynamic (PD) profiles (e.g, rapid, regular,

Confidential                                                                                                                                               Page 18 of 62 
 intermediate, or long acting, or mixtures of these). These different formulations are used to tailor 
appropriate insulin regimens on a  per subject b asis (Nathan et al., 2006). 
ORMD-0801 is b ased on Oramed’s platform technology for the oral delivery of polypeptides, 
which includes a proprietary formulation of  excipients to facilitate oral uptake by hindering 
proteolysis in the  small intestine  and facilitating translocation of p eptides across the  gut epithelial 
lining, and into the  systemic circulation. The formulation for ORMD-0801 in cludes soybean 
trypsin inhibitor  (SBTI) to hind er proteolysis, and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
(EDT A) to facilitate translocation. The fish o il provides om ega-3 fatty acids. The enteric-coated 
capsules are designed to disint egrate in a pH- dependent manner in the  small intestine. The initial 
indication for ORMD-0801 is to reduce fasting blood glucose in adult subj ects with Type 2 
diabetes mellitus with the obj ective of controlling the overall average glycemic level. 
 
The potential advantage of oral insulin in the treatment of elevated fasting blood glucose as 
compared to sub cutaneously-administ ered ins ulin li es in the more physiological mechanism of 
delivery. Orally-administ ered insulin, on ce transported across the  gut wall, is ferried to the  
hepatic portal vein, mimi cking the natural route of endogenous pancreatic insulin and delivering 
the insulin di rectly to the  intended site  of action. In contrast, sub cutaneously-administ ered insulin 
reaches the liver through the  systemic circulation th ereby requiring higher systemic levels of 
insulin in o rder to achieve the same effect. Thus, oral insulin administ ration (in combination with 
subcutaneously administered insulin) is expected to provide more physiological and improved 
control of blood glucose in Type 1 diabetes patients. This will reduce their  risk of  hypoglycemia 
and may prevent weight gain . The PK/PD profile of ORMD-0801 is well-suited to the control of 
fasting blood  glucose due to the  delayed onset.  
 
Oramed has completed five Phase 1 safety studies of various formulations of ORMD -0801 in 
healthy human volunteers. Four Phase 2 studies have been completed, two in patients with 
T2DM , and two in patients with T1D. These Phase 2 studies investigated differe nt formulations, 
the effect of meals at different times following ORMD -0801 administration, and the effect of 
ORMD -0801 on glucose as measured by continuou s glucose monitoring (CGM) over a ten -day 
treatment period with three doses per day prior to meals. N otably, one Phase 2 study assessed the 
safety and effectiveness on fasting blood glucose of repeat bed time administration of ORMD -
0801 in patients with T2DM  over a period of 6 weeks. A Phase 1/2 dose -response study was also 
conducted. These studies demons trated that the drug product is well -tolerated and can effectively 
reduce plasma glucose and C -peptide levels. There were no significant safety observations and 
no serious adverse reactions were reported for the completed studies, although there were two 
self-reported events of hypoglycemia in the six -week, Phase 2 study.  
Oramed intends to continue the clinical development of ORMD -0801.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study is designed to  compare ORMD -0801 given QD versus TID in subject s with T1D . The 
study will consist of seven visits (including Screening Visit) .   
 
During Screening, subjects will be required to sign the informed consent form.  Medical and 
medication history and demographic information will be collected. Eligibility  for participation  
will be evaluated. Vital signs ( height, weight, seated SBP/ DBP , and heart rate ) will be measured, 
physical examination will be performed, and a blood and urine sample will be collected for 
hematology/chemistry/urinalysis.  
Eligible subjects will be scheduled to return to the clinic in 1 week (Visit 2). Subjects fulfilling 
all inclusion/exclusion criteria will have a CGM placed, provided with a diary, dispensed 
placebo capsules and asked to return to the clinic in 10 days  (Visit 3, Day 1) for randomization. 
At Visit 3, data from CGM will be downloaded and diaries will be collected. Blood samples

 will be collected in fasting for chemistry and HbA1C. Subjects will be randomized to receive 
either ORMD -0801 24 mg given once daily at bedtime, or ORMD -0801 8 mg given three times 
a day, 45 -90 minutes before meals. Subjects will be instructed to continue their normal diet, 
and to adjust their basal and bolus insulin in the normal fashion.  Subjects will be instructed to 
return to the clinic in 10 days before Visit 5  (Visit 4, Day 18). At Visit 4, compliance will be 
assessed, IMP and diary dispensed and the CGM will be placed. Subjects will be instructed to 
return to the clinic in 10 days  for Visit 5 (Day 28). At Visit 5 a blood sample for chemistry 
panel and HbA1C will be drawn , the diary collected , the CGM removed  and the patient will be 
crossed over to the alternate treatment regimen. IMP will be dispensed, and the subject will be 
asked to  return in 10 days before Visit 7  for Visit 6 (Day 46). At Visit 6, compliance will be 
checked, IMP and a diary will be dispensed and the CGM will be placed. Subjects will be 
instructed to return in 10 days  for Visit 7 (Day 56). At Visit 7 the CGM will be removed, the 
diary will be collected, compliance checked, blood sample will be drawn for a chemistry panel 
and HbA1C. A physical examination will be performed, and the subject will exit the study.  
Subjects will be provided with diaries at Visits 2, 4 and 6 , and will be asked to capture the 
amount of basal and bolus exogenous insulin administered each day and calculate their 
carbohydrate count for all meals and snacks over the 10-day CGM monitoring period  of each 
treatment period . 
3.2 Screening ( -21 Days  prior t o Randomization ) 
At the Screening Visit , potential subjects will be given a detailed oral presentation describing the 
nature, purpose, risks, and requirements of the study and will receive detailed written 
information.  Subjects will be given ample time to  consider participation and ask questions 
which will be adequately addressed by site personnel.  
Once the subject is satisfied that he/she is willing to participate in the study, he/she will be asked 
to sign the stu dy ICF  (refer to Section 11.2.4  for further detail s regard ing the ICF).  The 
investigational site personnel obtaining written consent from the subject will also sign the 
consent form.  
Once signed, the Investigator will ret ain the original ICF for the subject’s study records and 
provide the subject with a signed copy.  The investigator will verify that informed consent has 
been obtained from each subject prior to enrollment into the study and prior to the subject 
undergoing any study -related procedures.  
Screening activities after obtaining informed consent will be conducted and consist of the 
following:  
• Completion of medical history  (including start date for T1DM) ,  
• Collection of demographic data (sex, age, race/ethnicity);

3.2.1 Screen Failure  
A screen failure is defined as a subject who has signed the ICF, does not meet all the entry 
criteria outlined in Section 4 of this protocol (note that this includes assessments through 
Visit  1), and was not randomized to receive study treatment . The Investigator is res ponsible for 
keeping a record of all subjects screened for entry into the study and subsequently excluded.  The 
reason(s) for exclusion will be recorded in the source documents and on the Screening log. 
Screen failure subjects will have only their consent,  demographic and reason for screen failure 
(including, where applicable, the unmet inclusion or exclusion criteria) data entered into the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system, unless an adverse event was responsible for the subject’s 
screen failure, in whi ch case all data collected for that subject during the screening process will 
be entered into the EDC system.

 Within the provisions of informed consent and good clinical judgment with respect to safety, 
every attempt will be  made to have subjects complete the study.  The following are reasons to 
terminate a subject’s participation in the study:  
1. Subject experiences an AE that in the judgement of the Investigator poses a significant 
risk to the subject for continued participat ion in the study . 
a. If a subject experiences hyperglycemia, defined in Section 7.3.2 , blood glucose 
will be checked 1 -2 hours later. If the glucose remains elevated, the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study.  
2. Subject uses a prohibited med ication (listed in Section 5.7) that in the judgment of the 
Investigator poses a significant risk to the subject for continued participation in the study 
or that will interfere with the interpretation of the results of the study . 
3. Subject becomes pregnant.  
4. Significant protocol viola tion or noncompliance on the part of the subject or the 
Investigator.   
5. Intercurrent illness that requires treatment that is not consistent with the protocol 
requirements, or intercurrent illness or the associated treatment that in the judgment of 
the Inves tigator poses a significant risk to the subject for continued participation in the 
study.   
6. Subject wishes to withdraw for any reason.  
7. Sponsor elects to end the study, or the Investigational Site elects to end the study at their 
site.  
8. Any other reason  that in the judgment of the Investigator  poses unacceptable risk to the 
subject . 
Reasons for study drug discontinuation may include the following:  
1. Adverse event  
2. Episodes of hypoglycemia as defined in Section 7.3.1 . 
3. Subject  meets one of the exclusion criteria during the study  
4. Any clinically significant change in the subject ’s medical condition  
 
Subjects  who withdraw from the stud y prior to treatment may be replaced. Subjects  who are 
withdrawn and have received at least one treatment will not be replaced. Subjects  who 
discontinue study drug treatment will not be replaced.  
Except in cases of emergency, the Investigator should consul t with the Sponsor and the  Medical 
Monitor  before removing the subject from the study.  In some circumstances it may be necessary 
to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs that may have an unclear relationship to 
study  treatment .  The Investiga tor should obtain approval from the Sponsor and Medical Monitor  
before restarting study treatment s that were temporarily discontinued for an AE.

 In the event that a subject discontinues the study prior to completion, the date the subject is 
withdrawn and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the source documents and CRF.  
Although a subject will not be obliged to give his/her reason fo r withdrawing prematurely, the 
Investigator will make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the 
subject’s rights.   
All subjects who are randomized and treated (i.e., received any amount of study treatment ) will 
be included in the safety analyses.  Thus, every effort will be made to contact any subject who 
fails to attend any appointments/contacts, in order to ensure that he/she is in satisfactory health.  
If a subject withdraws from the study as a result o f meeting discontinuation criteria after the start 
of study treatment  administration, reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return 
for the  early withdrawal  evaluations (Section 3.9).  Any subject withdrawn due to a suspected 
study treatment  -related AE should be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event.  
Subjects may choose to withdraw authorization to use and disclose th eir PHI as defined by the 
HIPAA.  Such withdrawal of authorization must be made to the Investigator in writing.  Any PHI 
collected by the Investigator prior to the date of such withdrawal will continue to be used and 
disclosed.  
Randomized subjects who are discontinued from this study for any reason will not be replaced.   
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study, and the Investigator/Investigational Site has the 
right to close the site, at any time, although this should occur only after consultatio n between 
involved parties.   The Investigator will notify the IRB in writing of a premature termination of a 
study or closure of Investigational Site and will send a copy of the notification to the Sponsor.   
Events that may trigger premature termination of a study or closure of an Investigational Site 
include, but are not limited to , a new toxicity finding , a request to discontinue the trial from a 
regulatory authority, non-compliance with the protocol , GCP violations, slow recruitment /low 
enrollment , or chang e in development plans for the study treatment . 
If either of the criteria listed below is met, enrollment of new subjects and dosing of ongoing 
subjects will be temporarily stopped.  T he Investigator , Sponsor,  and the Medical Monitor  will 
discuss whether a lower dose or any additional treatment guidelines should be implemented, or if 
the trial should be permanently stopped.  Any proposed changes to the protocol to address such 
findings will be submitted for review and approval by the IRB an d FDA prior to re -starting the 
trial. 
1. A death within 30 days after study treatment  administration where there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the event;  
2. Two Grade 4 AEs where there is a reasonable possibility that the study treatment  cause d 
the events.

 5.7 Concomitant Medications  and Supplements  
All medications and supplements  (other th an study treatment ) taken by the subject from Visit 
3/Day 1 through Visit 7 will be considered “concomitant ” medications and supplements.  
Medications and supplements taken prior to Visit 3/Day 1  that are no longer being taken at the 
time of Visit 3/Day 1 will be considered “prior” medications and supplements.  
All prior medications and supplements taken within 30 days prior to the first dose of study 
treatment  and concomitant medications  and suppl ements  will be recorded in the subject’s source 
documentation and in the eCRF.  
The use of concomitant medications and supplements should be kept at a minimum, if possible.  
Any medications  and supplements  needed for the welfare of a subject and that in the  judgment of 
the Investigator will not pose a significant risk to the subject for continued participation in the 
study or that will not interfere with the interpretation of the results of this study may be given to 
the subject.  If a subject requires the u se of any of the prohibited medications  and supplements  
listed below, the Investigator will contact the Sponsor  and the  Medical Monitor  to discuss the 
subject’s continued participation in the study.  In the event of an emergency, subjects will be 
treated a t the discretion of the Investigator according to acceptable community standards of 
medical care.   
The following are prohibited medications:  
1. Any I nvestigational Drug other than ORMD -0801  within 30 d ays prior to Visit 3/Day 1 
through Visit 7; 
2. Any anti -diabetic drugs (except for those allowable by the inclusion criteria)  including 
GLP -1 analogue, α -glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and pramlintide  within 6 weeks prior 
to Screening ; 
3. Thyroid preparations or thyroxine (except in subjects  on stable r eplacement therapy);  
4. Systemic long -acting corticosteroids or other systemic corticosteroids or inhaled 
corticosteroids (if daily dosage is > 1,000 μg equivalent beclomethasone) . Intra -articular 
and/or topical corticosteroids are not considered systemic.  
5. Medications known to modify glucose metabolism or to decrease the ability to recover 
from hypoglycemia such as oral, par enteral, and inhaled steroids,  and 
immunosuppressive or immunomod ulating agents.   
If the subject initiates prohibited drug therapy, or if the Investigator determines that use of a 
prohibited therapy is in the best interest of the subject ’s health and well -being, the Investigator 
and sponsor will jointly decide to continue or discontinue the subject.  
5.8 Dietary  Restrictions  
Subjects will be advi sed not to make any drastic changes in their regular diet throughout the 
study. Excessive caffeine use (i.e., more than five cups of caffeinated beverages per day) should

 6.4 Review and Documentation of Medication s and Supplements  
All medications or supplements  subjects are taking or have taken within 30  days prior to Visit 
3/Day 1 through Visit 7 will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and the medical history 
CRF.  
All medications and supplements (other than study treatment ) taken by the subject after  Visit 
3/Day 1 through Visit 7 assessment s will be considered “concomitant” medications and 
supplements.  Medications and supplements taken prior to Visit 3/Day 1  that are no longer being 
taken at Visit 3/Day 1  will be considered “prior” medications and supp lements.  
Medications and supplements should be recorded according to the generic name when possible.   
The use of c oncomitant medications and supplements should be limited to those that are 
medically necessary.  Any medication  or supplement  used should have an indication recorded , 
and for concomitant medications and supplements, this indication must be represented as either 
for the treatment of an AE , for t he management of a pre -existing condition, or for prophylaxis.  
Dosage increases for any concomitant medication  or supplement  should be noted and the reason 
for the dosage increase recorded as an  AE (assumes worsening condition).  The side effects of 
conco mitant medications will be recorded as AEs.  
Any subject whose condition becomes disqualifying  during the course of the study may be 
treated for that condition .  If the condition  is suspected during Screening , the subject should not 
be enrolled.  Treatment  of the condition should be instituted according to the 
Investigator’s/attending physician's judgment.  
Medications that have no treatment intent but rather are part of supportive routine care such as 
local anesthetics, intravenous solutions to maintain fl uid balance and keep access open, 
medications used for prophylaxis, and narcotics for postsurgical pain must also be recorded in 
the subject’s medical record and CRF . 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY REPORTING  
7.1 Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed on an ongoing basis by review of reported AEs, physical 
examinations, vital si gns (including weig ht, seated SBP/DBP, and heart rate ), and clinical safety 
labs (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis).  
7.2 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a) as follows:  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not considered drug related.  
Oramed Ltd.   Protocol No. ORA -D-017

 An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable an d unintended sign 
(e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
a drug, and does not imply any judgment about causality.  An AE can arise with any use of the 
drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
AEs with be collected starting with Visit 2/Day  -10. However, AEs occurring between Visit 2/ 
Day -10 and Visit 3/Day  1 will be regarded as “pretreatment” if they occur before IP administration 
at Visit 3/Day  1. TEAEs are defined as any AE that starts or increases in severity after the first 
randomized dose of study IP on Visit 3/Day 1.   
7.3 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32( a) as follows : 
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• Life-threatening AE;  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Persistent o r significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in t he view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
7.3.1 Adverse Events of Hypoglycemia  
The CTCAE (version 4.0) definition for mild, moderate, and severe hypoglycemia based on blood 
glucose will be used, as shown below:  
Mild: from 55 to <70 mg/dL (3.0 to < 3.8 mmol/L)  
Moderate: from 40 to < 55 mg/dL (2.2 to < 3.0 mmol/L)

 Severe: from 30 to < 40 mg/dL (1.7 to < 2.2 mmol/L)  
Life Threatening: < 30 mg/dL (< 1.7 mmol/L)  
Subjects  with hypoglycemia will be provided with 2 -4 glucose tablets as necessary until 
symptoms subside or blood glucose increases to greater than 70 mg/dL. If a patient has greater 
than 2 episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia at any particular study visit,  they will be 
terminated from the study.  
 
7.3.2 Adverse Events of Hyperglycemia  
Hyperglycemia will be defined as a blood glucos e reading > 300 mg/dL. Subjects who have a 
blood glucose reading > 300 mg/dL will have the reading repeated 1 -2 hours later. If a subject’s 
glucose remains above 300 mg/dL, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and treated 
according to the following  criteria:  
1. Subjects who are asymptomatic with a glucose reading >300 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL will 
be provided with dietary counseli ng and either adjustment of their current medication or 
addition of an alternative hypoglycemic agent.  
2. Subjects who are symptoma tic with a glucose reading >300 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL will 
be provided with dietary counseling, subcutaneous insulin on a sliding scale, and 
adjustment of their current medication or addition of an alternative hypoglycemic agent.  
3. Subjects with a glucose rea ding ≥500 mg/dL will be provided with dietary counseling, 
subcutaneous insulin on a sliding scale, and adjustment of their current medication or 
addition of an alternative hypoglycemic agent.  
7.4 Eliciting and Reporting of Adverse Events  
AE monitoring will start immediately following the first dose study treatment and will continue 
through Visit  7.  Any  subject with a possible study treatment -related AE at Visit 6/Day 2 will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization of the event.  Further, any SAE, whether or not related 
to study treatment , that occurs within 14 days following the last dose of study treatment  will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization of the e vent.  This may require additional clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests.  The follow -up results will be recorded in the subject's source 
documentation and in the eCRF.  
Subjects will be instructed to report all AEs experienced during the study, and sub jects will be 
assessed for the occurrence of AEs throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, 
subjects will be asked general, non -leading questions such as "How are you feeling?"   
All AEs, including pretreatment and TEAEs, reported by t he subject, observed or otherwise 
identified by the Investigator, or other Investigational Site personnel will be documented.

 Medical conditions existing at Screening should be recorded as medical history.  New or 
worsening pre -existing medical condition s or diseases are considered AEs if they arise or worsen 
after the Screening visit, and should be recorded as AEs.  
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
require surgery.  The condition for which the s urgery is required is an AE if it occurs or is 
detected following the first dose of study treatment through Visit  7.  Conditions leading to 
planned surgical procedures are not AEs if the condition(s) was (were) known before study 
treatment .  In the latter case, the condition should be reported as medical history.  
7.4.1 Routine Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether or not associated with the study treatment, that are observed by the 
Investigator, other Investigational Site personnel, or those reported by th e subject will be 
recorded  in the subject’s source documentation and on the AE page of the eCRF.   Copies of the 
SAE CRF pages or an SAE listing generated based on the eCRF pages will be submitted to the 
Sponsor at regularly scheduled intervals to allow the  Sponsor to meet expedited regulatory 
reporting requirements under 21 CFR 312.32 (see Section 7.4.2  for further detail) and regular 
regulatory reporting requirements under 21 CFR 312.33 .  
For each AE, the following information will be entered in the eCRF:  
• Medical diagnosis of the event in s tandard medical terminology (if a medical diagnosis 
cannot be determined, a description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event);  
• Date of onset of any new AE or worsening of a previously observed AE;  
• Date of resolution of the ev ent (or confirmatio n ongoing ); 
• Whether the event is serious  (per definition in Section 7.3), and if so, the reason it is 
considered serious;  
• Severity of AE (per defin ition in Section 7.6); 
• Assessment of the at tributability of the AE to the s tudy treatment  (per definition in 
Section 7.5);  
• Whether the event is expect ed (per definition in Section 7.7); 
• Action taken in treating the AE (including concomitant medications or therapies 
administered) and/or change in t he study treatment  administration or dose (including 
whether the study treatment  was temporarily interrupted or d iscontinued);  
• Outcome of AE (per definition in Section 7.8).

study treatment , must be reported by the Investigator or other Investigational Site personnel to 
the Medical Monitor by telephone or fax within 24 hours of learning of the event .  The contact 
information for the Medical Monitor is provide d below.  
Medical Monitor:   
Carmen Margaritescu, MD  
Safety Office, Integrium, LLC  
Office: 714 -210-6665  
Cellular: 714 -328-7083

SAE Forms will be provided by the Sponsor or Sponsor desi gnated CRO.  If all information is 
not known at the time of initial reporting, an initial report should still be made.  In the event there 
is a question as to whether the experience is serious, the information should be forwarded to the 
Medical Monitor for  review.  The Investigator is responsible for following up on completion of 
the SAE Form.  The Investigator will submit substantiating data in hard copy form, such as 
diagnostic test reports and progress notes, to the Medical Monitor.  In the case of fatal ity, 
autopsy reports will be furnished to the Medical Monitor as soon as available.  If the Medical 
Monitor is informed of a SAE via a telephone call, preliminary information will be obtained, and 
the study site will be instructed to fax an SAE Form.  
The i nitial SAE Form and any subsequent follow -up SAE Forms submitted to provide more 
accurate, corrected, or new information must be signed by the Investigator.  The Investigator and 
Investigational Site Personnel must make every reasonable effort to obtain, f rom other 
institutions if necessary, all supporting medical case records as needed to comply with expedited 
Investigational New Drug application (IND) safety reporting requirements.   
If the SAE involves expedited IND safety reporting (as determined by the  Sponsor or designee), 
all supporting medical records must be submitted to the Sponsor or designee within 4 calendar 
days for death or life -threatening events, and 10 calendar days for all other events.  In cases 
where medical records and supporting docume ntation are unobtainable, the Investigator must 
generate a narrative of the event utilizing, when necessary, interviews with the subject, their 
family members and care givers as appropriate.  
The Investigator must also promptly inform the governing IRB of the SAE in accordance with 
the governing IRB’s requirements.  Any SAE that is determined by the Sponsor to be reportable 
to the FDA as an IND Safety Report (as defined in 21 CFR 312.32) will be reported to FDA by 
Oramed Ltd.   Protocol No. ORA -D-017

 the Sponsor or designee within the specifie d time frame.  All IND Safety Reports will also be 
promptly provided to the Investigator for submission to his/her IRB.  Similarly, any SAE that is 
determined by the Sponsor to require expedited reporting to other regulatory authorities will be 
reported to  the appropriate authorities by the Sponsor or designee within the specified time 
frames, and will be provided to the Investigator for submission to his/her IRB.  
The Investigator, Medical Monitor, and Sponsor will review each SAE report and evaluate the 
relationship of the adverse experience to study treatment  and to underlying disease.  Based on 
this assessment, a decision will be made concerning the need for further action.  The primary 
consideration governing further action is whether new findings affect  the safety of subjects 
participating in the clinical trial.  If the discovery of a new adverse experience related to the 
study treatment  raises concern over the safety of continued administration o f study treatment , the 
Sponsor will take immediate steps t o notify the regulatory authorities.  
Further action that may be required includes the following:  
1. Alteration of existing research by modification of the protocol;  
2. Discontinuation or suspension of the study;  
3. Alteration of the informed consent process by modi fication of the existing consent form 
and informing current study participants of new findings;  
4. Modification of previously identified expected adverse experiences to include adverse 
experiences newly identified as study treatment -related.  
 
If the partner of a subject participating in the study becomes pregnant during the study or within 
30 days of discontinuing study medication, the Investigator should report the pregnancy to 
Integrium within 24 hours of being notified. Safety personnel will then f orward the Exposure In 
Utero form to the Investigator for completion.  
The partner should be followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the  
Sponsor. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the 
pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an 
SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, still birth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
7.5 Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
For all AEs, the Principal Investigator will provide an assessment of causal relationship to the 
study  treatment  (active or placebo).  The causality assessment must be recorded in the subject’s 
source documents and on the AE CRF.  Causal relationship will be classified acco rding to the 
following criteria:  
1. Unrelated : The event is clearly  due to causes  other  than the active  study  drug.

 2. Unlikely : The event is doubtfully  related  to active  study  drug.   The event  was most likely  
related  to other  factors  such as the subject ’s clinical  state,  concomitant  drugs  or other 
therapeutic  interventions.  
3. Possible : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence  from  the time of active study  
drug administration,  but could  have been produced  by other  factors  such as the subject ’s 
clinical  state,  therapeutic interventions  or concomitant  drugs.  
4. Probable : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence from  the time of active 
study  drug administration,  and follows  a known response pattern  to the  drug.  The toxicity  
cannot  be reasonably  explained  by other  factors  such as the subject ’s clinical  state,  
therapeutic interventions  or concomitant  drugs.  
5. Definite : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence  from  the time of active study  
drug administration,  follows  a known  response pattern  to the  drug,  cannot  be reasonably  
explained  by other  factors  such as the subject ’s condition,  concomitant  drugs  or 
therapeutic interventions,  AND either occurs  immediately  following  active  study  drug 
administration,  improves on stopping  the study  drug,  or reappears  on re-exposure.  
 
7.5.1 Potential Adverse Events Associated with ORMD -0801  
Hypoglycemia and associated symptoms (e.g., weakness, dizziness, shakiness, increased 
sweating, palpitations, or confusion), have been associated with insulin administration, including 
ORMD -0801. Animal reproductive studies  have not been conducted with ORM D-0801. It is not 
known whether ORMD -0801 can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It is 
also not known whether this product is excreted in human milk. Pregnant or breastfeeding 
women are excluded from th is study.  
Long -term animal studies have not been completed to assess whether ORMD -0801 impairs 
fertility.  
7.6 Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The severity of each AE will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03.  The 
severity of AEs that are not specifically listed in the CTCAE will be categorized according to the 
general guidelines provided in the CTCAE, and as summarized in the table below.  
General Guidelines for Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
Grade 1 :  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 :  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) [preparing meals, shopping for  
groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.].

 Grade 3 :  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL (bathing, dr essing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden).  
Grade 4 :  Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 : Death related to AE.  
 
Note the distinction between the severity  and the seriousness of an AE. A severe AE is not 
necessarily a SAE.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with 
subject 's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for 
SAEs, listed a bove in Section 7.3. 
7.7 Expectedness of Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a) as follows:  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsew here in the current 
application, as amended.  
7.8 Assessment of Adverse Event Outcome  
Outcome of AEs will be defined according to ICH Topic E2B, ICH Guideline.  
• Recovered/Resolved:   The subject has recovered fully from the AE without any 
remaining effects or imp airment.  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae :  The subject has recovered, but with an after effect 
possibly due to disease or treatment.  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved:   The condition is still present.  
• Fatal:  Fatal should only be used when death is possibly rela ted to the AE.  
• Unknown :  The primary outcome is not known at the time of the final assessment.  If an 
outcome for an AE is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up will proceed 
until an outcome is known or followed up to the Final Study Visit.  Any subject wit h a 
possible study treatment -related AE at the Final Study Visit will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the event.  Further, any SAE, whether or not related to Study 
treatment  (active or placebo), that occurs within 30  days following the las t dose of Study 
treatment  will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event.

 7.9 Clinical Findings  
Any significant clinical findings will be f ollowed until the condition returns to pre -study status, 
stabilizes, or can be explained as not being study treatment  related.  If the clinical finding is 
reported as an AE (per the criteria outlined in Section  7.2), the follow -up procedures for AEs 
defined above will apply.

 8 STATISTICAL METHODS   
This section describes the statistical methods to be used for the analysis and reporting of data 
collected under Protocol No. ORA -D-017. Additional details will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan.  
8.1 Sample Size  
An estimated total of 24 subjects are planned to be randomized to participate in the two dosing 
conditions in a randomized order.  The study objectives (primary, secondary and exploratory) 
have not been previously explored, so there are no estimates of means or standard deviations to 
perform power calculations.  
Safety will be a secondary endpoint for this trial and will be assessed p rimarily based on AEs.  
Secondary safety assessments will include physical examination, 12 -lead ECG, vital signs 
(including weight, seated SBP/DBP, and heart rate ), and clinical safety labs (hematology, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis).  
8.2 Statistical Conside rations  
Subjects will be analyzed under 3 treatment regimens: Standard of Care (Baseline), Once a Day 
Dosing (QD) and Three Times a Day Dosing (TID).  
Information collected in the daily diaries or via the Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) on the 
final 1 0 days of treatment will be analyzed using a Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance 
with subject as a random effect  with each of the 1 0 days being a single measure . When analyzing 
the exogenous insulin variables, CGM parameters  (mean 24 hour glucose value an d 24 hour time 
within 70 -180 mg/dL range)  and patient reported carbohydrate intake  will be included as 
covariates. When analyzing CGM parameters, exogenous insulin (basal and bolus insulin 
amounts) and patient reported carbohydrate intake will be included as covariates. Treatment least 
squares means and c hange from baseline estimates will be derived using th is linear model.  
Information collected at the day 28 visits will be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance 
model with subject as a random effect. Trea tment least squares means and change from baseline 
estimates will be derived using this linear model.  
8.3 Basal, Bolus and Total Exogenous Insulin  
The amount of basal, bolus and total exogenous insulin will be analyzed using the Repeated 
Measures Analysis of Covariance model indicated in Section 8.2. Least squares means, standard 
error and 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each treatment regimen and changes 
between treatmen t regimens.  
Total daily non -oral insulin requirements in units per kilogram (kg) body weight will also be 
analyzed in a fashion similar to basal, bolus and total exogenous insulin.

 8.4 Continuous Glucose Monitor  Evaluation  
For the purpose of analysis:  
• 24-hour will be considered to be from 6AM to 6AM,  
• Daytime will be considered to be from 6AM to 10PM,  
• Nighttime will be considered to be from 10PM to 6AM , and  
The area under the curve (AUC) will be derived for each of the time periods (24 -hour, daytime  
and night time)  for each of the 1 0 days for each treatment regimen . The average glucose 
measurement will be derived by dividing the AUC by the number of observed hours.  
In addition to the mean values, the following CGM parameters will be derived:  
• Time in range 70 -180 mg/dL  
• Time <70 mg/dL  
• Time >180 mg/dL  
• Time >250 mg/dL  
• Glucose coefficient of variation  
• Low blood glucose index (LBGI)  
• Glucose below 70 mg/dL Area Over the Curve (AOC 70) 
All of the CGM parameters will be analyzed for each of the time periods (24 -hour, daytime and 
nighttime) using the Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance Model indicated in Section 8. 2. 
8.5 Other Endpoints of Interest  
HbA1c, average patient reported carbohyd rate intake and body weight will be summarized using 
an Analysis of Covariance Model as indicated in Section 8.2.  
8.6 Safety  Evaluation  
8.6.1 Safety Population  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one  dose of study treatment  will be included in the 
safety analysis population.    
8.6.2 Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA.  The severity of AEs will be graded 
according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03.  AEs with be collected starting with Visit 2/Day  -10. 
However, AEs occurring between Visit 2/Day -10 and Visit 3/Day  1 will be regarded as 
“pretreatment” if they occur before IP administration at Visit 3/Day  1. TEAEs are defined as any 
AE that starts or increases in severity after the first randomized dose o f study IP on Visit 3/Day 1.  
The incidence of TEAEs  will be tabulated by MedDRA preferred term, system organ class, 
treatment group , severity, and assigned relationship t o study treatment .  The incidence for each 
TEAE  will be provided as the total number o f subjects that experienced the TEAE , as well as the 
percentage of the population that this represents.  If a TEAE  is reported more than once for a 
given subject, the greatest severity and the worst -case attribution will be presented in the 
summary tables.

 TEAEs  will be listed for individual subjects, along with information regarding onset  and end 
dates, onset time where available , severity, seriousness, relationship t o study treatment , action 
taken, and outcome.  A similar listing will be prepared for the pretreatment AEs.   
Pretreatment AEs and TEAEs that lead to withdrawal from the study will be separately listed and 
summarized.  Similarly, separate tabulation s and listing s will be prepared for pretreatment and 
treatment -emergent SAEs .  
Descriptive statis tics will be generated as appropriate (i.e., frequency for categorical data).  
Inferential statistical analysis comparing the AE data between active and placebo is not planned.  
8.6.3 Laboratory Evaluations  
Individual clinical safety lab (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis)  values will be listed 
by treatment and summarized using descriptive statistics  as appropriate (i.e., mean, median, 
range, and standard deviation for continuous data and frequency for categorical data) .  Individual 
change from bas eline  (Screening ) in laboratory values will be calculated and summarized 
descriptively. A clinically significant change from baseline  (Screening ) will be recorded as a n 
AE if deemed appropriate by the Investigator . 
8.6.4 Vital Signs  
Individ ual vital sign measure ments ( height, weight, seated SBP/DBP,  and heart rate ) will be 
listed by measurement time and summarized using descriptive statistics  as appropriate (i.e., 
mean, median, range, and standard deviation) .  Individual change from baseline  (Screening ) in 
vital sign measurements will be calculated and summarized descriptively.  A clinically 
significant change from baseline  (Screening ) will be recorded as a TE AE if deemed appropriate 
by the Investigator . 
8.6.5 12-lead ECG  
Individual 12 -lead ECG assessments at screening will be listed .  
8.6.6 Physical Examination  
Individual physical examination findings will be listed for each visit in which a physical 
examination occurred .  A clinically significant change from baseline  (Screening ) will be 
recorded as a n AE if deemed appropriate by the Investigator.  
8.6.7 Prior and Concomitant Medications  and Supplements  
Medications and supplements will be coded using the most current version of  the WHO  Drug 
Reference List, which employs the A natomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system .   
All medications and supplements (other than study treatment ) taken by the subject from Visit 
2/Day 1  through the Visit 7 will be considered “concomitant ” medications  and supplements .  
Medications and supplements taken prior to the first dose of ORMD -0801  that are no longer 
being taken at the time of the first dose  of ORMD -0801 will be considered “prior ” medications  
and supplements .   
Concomitant medications and supplements will be listed for individual subjects.  A similar 
listing will be prepared for prior medications and supplements  taken within 30 days prior to the

 9 DATA MANAGEMENT  
9.1 Data Collection  
All data required by the study protocol will be collected in a validated database according to the 
contract research organization’s (CRO’s) SOPs.  
9.2 Electronic Data Capture  
Data from the source documents  will be entered into the electronic EDC  system by authorized 
Investigational Site personnel.  Data Management staff, using both electronic and manual 
checks, will systematically check the data.  Errors or omissions will result in queries (which c an 
be issued by the Study Monitor or Data Management staff), which will be presented to the 
Investigational Site within the EDC system.  The Investigational Site will resolve the queries 
within the EDC system.  The Study Monitor and Data Management staff w ill review the 
responses as part of the query resolution process.  The EDC system will track the queries with 
the corresponding responses.  
Medications and supplements entered into the database will be coded in the EDC system using 
the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical classification system.  AEs and Medical History will be coded in the EDC 
system using MedDRA terminology.  
Clinical laboratory samples  will be processed by Consolidated Medic al Bio -Analysis, Inc. at 
10700  Walker Street, Cypress, CA 90630.  All lab  results will be sent electronically to Integrium. 
The clinical laboratory results will be imported into the database.  
9.3 Quality Assurance and Database Lock  
A 100% critical variable review of all key safety and secondary en dpoint data in the database 
will be  performed.  Following this review, a data quality control audit or a random sample equal 
to the square root plus 1 of the total population  will be performed.  
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be locked.  
Any changes to the database after that time can only be made by joint written agreement between 
the Sponsor, the Investigator, Integrium, and the study biostatistician.

 10 AMENDMENTS/MODIFICATIONS OF THIS PROTOCOL  
The Investigator will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and 
evaluations described in this protocol.  As the study progresses it may become necessary to 
change or modify parts of the protocol.  The Sponsor or designee is r esponsible for submitting 
protocol amendments to the appropriate government regulatory authorities.  The Investigator is 
responsible for submitting protocol amendments to the appropriate IRB.  Approval by the IRB 
must be obtained before changes are impleme nted.    
When an emergency occurs that requires a departure from the protocol for an individual, a 
departure will be only for that subject.  The Investigator or other physician in attendance in such 
an emergency will, if circumstances and time permit, conta ct the Medical Monitor immediately 
by telephone.  Such contacts will be made as soon as possible to permit a decision as to whether 
or not the subject (for whom the departure from protocol was affected) is to continue in the 
study.  The eCRF and source doc uments will completely describe the departure from the 
protocol and state the reasons for such departure.  In addition, the IRB will be notified in writing 
of such departure from protocol.

The study will be conducted as described in the approved protocol, with amendments and in 
accordance with the obligations of clinical Investigators set forth in the Form FDA 1572 and in 
21 CFR 50, 54, 56 and 31 2. 
11.2.3  Institutional Review Board  
The Investigator is responsible for the submission of t he protocol , ICF, and other written 
materials (such as advertisements and diaries), along with  relevant supporting data  (e.g., IB),  to 
the appropriate IRB for review and approval before the study can be initiated.  The Investigator 
is also responsible for submitting a mendments to the protocol  and ICF  to the IRB for review and 
approval prior to implementation of the change.  The Investigator is responsible for providing the  
Sponsor with a letter documenting the IRB approval prior to initiation of the study  or 
implementation of the changes, respectively .  
The Investigator will not have authority to implement any deviation or change to the protocol 
without prior review and doc umented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB of an 
amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  Any 
significant deviation from the approved protocol will be documented in the source documents 
and eCRF .  
Any deviation or change to the protocol required to eliminate an immediate hazard prior to 
obtaining IRB approval/favorable opinion, will be submitted as soon as possible to:  
• IRB for review and approval/favorable opinion.

 • The Sponsor  via appropriate designees.  
• Regulatory Authorities, if required by local regulations.  
Documentation of IRB approval signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB will be provided 
to the Sponsor  via appropriate designees.  
If an Amendment substantially alter s the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
subject: (1) the ICF will be revised and submitted to the IRB for review and approval/favorable 
opinion; (2) the revised ICF will be used to obtain consent from subjects currently enrolled in the 
study if they are affected by the Amendment; and (3) the new ICF will be used to obtain consent 
from any new subjects prior to enrollment.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB of all reportable AEs.  IND Safety Reports 
provided by the Sponso r to the Investigator will be promptly forwarded to the IRB by the 
Investigator.  Updates to the IB provided by the Sponsor to the Investigator will be submitted to 
the IRB by the Investigator.  
The Investigator is also responsible for informing the IRB of the progress of the study and for 
obtaining annual IRB renewal.  The Investigator must inform the IRB when the study is 
completed or terminated.  After completion or termination of the study, the Investigator will 
submit the final clinical study report to the IRB.  The structure and content of the report will 
meet that described in Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports E3 (ICH Harmonized 
Tripartite Guideline, dated November 30, 1995).   
11.2.4  Subject Informed Consent  
The Investigator must comply with inf ormed consent regulations (21  CFR Part 50) and relevant 
state regulations (i.e., California Bill of Rights for California patients).   
The ICF will clearly describe the nature, scope, and potential risks and benefits of the study, in a 
language that the su bject understands.  The ICF will conform to all the requirements for 
informed consent according to ICH GCP and US FDA guidelines (21 CFR 50) and will include 
any additional elements required by the Investigator’s institution or local regulatory authorities .  
The ICF will adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.   
Prior to the beginning of the study, the Investigator will obtain the IRB’s written 
approval/favorable opinion of the written ICF.  The IRB approved I CF will be given to each 
prospective participant.  The subjects will be given adequate time to discuss the study with the 
Investigator or site staff and to decide whether or not to participate.  Each subject who agrees to 
participate in the trial and who s igns the ICF will be given a copy of the signed, dated, and 
witnessed document.  The original signed ICF will be retained by the Investigator in the study 
files.  
The ICF and any other information provided to subjects will be revised whenever important new 
information becomes available that is relevant to the subject's consent, and the Investigator will

The Investigator has the responsibility of maintaining a comprehensive and centralized filing 
system containing all study -related document ation.  These files must be available for inspection 
by the Sponsor or designee , the IRB , and regulatory authorities (i.e., FDA or international 
regulatory authorities) at any time and should consist of the Essential Documents as defined in 
ICH E6, which i nclude, but are not limited to, the following elements:  
• Subject files, containing the co mpleted CRFs , supporting source documentation from the 
medical record , including labo ratory data , and the signed ICF;  
• Regulatory files, containing the protocol with all amendments and Sponsor and 
Investigator signature pages, copies of all other regulatory documentation, and all 
correspondence between the site and the IRB and Sponsor ; and  
• Drug accountability files, inclu ding a complete account of the receipt and disposition of 
the Study treatment  (active and placebo) . 
The Investigator will retain all study r ecords for at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region (i.e., United States , Europe, or Japan) , and until there are 
no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region.  If no application is filed 
or if the application is not approved for such indication, the Investigator will retain all study 
records for at least  2 years after the investigation is discontinued  and regulatory authorities have 
been notified.  The Sponsor  will provide written notification when it is appropriate for the 
Investigator to discard the study -specific documents referenced above.  
The Investig ator will notify the Sponsor prior to destroying any study records.  Should the 
Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, 
the Sponsor will be notified in writing in advance.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the Investigational Site for any 
or all of the documents, special arrangements will be made between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor for storage.  If source documents are required for continued care of the subject, 
appropriate copies for storage off site will be made.  
11.7 Clinical Study Report  
After completion or termination of the study, a clinical study report will be prepared.  The 
structure and content of the report will meet that  described in Structure and Content of  Clinical

 12 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
12.1 Study Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by the Sponsor or designee to evaluate the progress of the study, to 
verify the accuracy and completeness of the eCRFs, to assure that all protocol requirements, 
applicable laws and/or regulations, and Investigator’s obligation s are being fulfilled, and to 
resolve any inconsistencies in the study records.  
The Investigator will allow the Study Monitor to periodically review, at mutually convenient 
times during the study and after the study has been completed, all eCRFs and offic e, hospital, 
and laboratory records supporting the participation of each subject in the study.   
The Study Monitor will compare the eCRF data against source documentation in order to verify 
its accuracy and completeness.  The Investigator and Investigation al Site staff will collaborate 
with the Study Monitor to resolve any identified data discrepancies in a timely manner.   
The Study Monitor will record any protocol deviations identified, including, but not limited to, 
subjects that were enrolled even thoug h they did not meet all eligibility criteria, subjects who 
took concomitant medications specifically prohibited by the protocol, subjects who received the 
wrong study treatment  or incorrect dose, and subjects who failed to comply with the protocol -
defined dietary restrictions.  The Investigator and Investigational Site  staff will collaborate with 
the Study M onitor to identify the reason for each protocol deviation.   
The Study M onitor will compare the Investigational Site study treatment  accountability reco rd 
against the s tudy treatment  inventory (unused and used) at the site.  The Investigator and 
Investigational Site  staff will collaborate with the Study M onitor to resolve any identified 
discrepancies in a timely manner.  
Each issue identified during study monitoring visits will be documented and reported to both the 
Sponsor and the Investigator.  
12.2 On-Site Audits  
The FDA , or other regulatory authorities,  may request access to all study records for inspection 
and copying.  The Principal Investigator and Investigational Site staff will cooperate with the 
inspectors and allow access to all source documents supporting the eCRFs and other study -
related documen ts.  The Investigator will immediately notify the Sponsor when contacted by any 
regulatory authority for the purpose of conducting an inspection.   
The Sponsor or designee may also request to visit the Investigator’s site to conduct an audit of 
the study .  Prior to initiating this audit, the Investigator will be contacted by the Sponsor to 
arrange a convenient time for this visit.  The Principal Investigator and Investigational Site staff 
will cooperate with the auditors and  allow access  to all source docum ents supporting the eCRFs 
and other study -related documents .

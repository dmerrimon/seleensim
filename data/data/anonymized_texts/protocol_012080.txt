2 INTRODUCTION  
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) provides a description of the statistical methods and 
procedures to be implemented for the analyses of data from Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, 
LLC Protocol CCP -020-101. Any deviations from this analysis plan will be sub stantiated by 
sound statistical rationale and will be documented in the final clinical study report.  
 
3 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 
3.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to descriptively characterize the single -dose and steady 
state pharmacokinetics (PK) of diacerein (if quantifiable) and its active metabolite, rhein, after 
topical application of CCP -020 (diacerein 1% ointment) under maximum use conditions in 
adolescent and adult patients with EB, and in infants/children with  EB. 
 
3.2 Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single -dose and 
steady -state topical application of CCP -020 (diacerein 1% ointment) in patients with EB.  
 
4 STUDY  OVERVIEW  
 
4.1 Study  Design  
The study is designed as an open label, single period study in approximately 16 -20 patients 
with EB ranging in age from infants/children (ages 6 months – 11 years, inclusive) and 
adolescents/adults (ages 12 and up) with at least 8 -10 subjects between the a ged 6 months to 
11 years, inclusive (infants/children). The study will be conducted in two cohorts as follows:  
1. 8-10 adolescent and adult patients with EB (aged 12 and  older)  
a. EBS subjects: lesions encompassing ≥ 2% BSA for study entry. Diacerein 
application  area to be ≥ 5% BSA and include lesioned and non -lesioned skin (if 
lesions account for less than 5% BSA); however, topical administration must be ≤ 
30% BSA.  
b. DEB/JEB subjects: lesions encompassing ≥ 2% BSA for study entry. Diacerein 
application area to be ≥ 5% BSA and include lesioned and non -lesioned skin (if 
lesions account for less than 5% BSA); however, topical administration must be ≤ 
30% BSA.

CCP -020-101 Statistical Analysis Plan  Page 7 of 20  
 
2. 8-10 infants/children with EB (aged 6 months to 11 years,  inclusive)  
a. EBS subjects: lesions encompassing ≥ 2% BSA for study entry. Diacerein 
application area to be ≥ 5% BSA and include lesioned and non -lesioned skin (if 
lesions account for less than 5% BSA); however, topical administration must  be ≤ 
30% BSA.  
b. DEB/JEB subjects: lesions encompassing ≥ 2% BSA for study entry. Diacerein 
application area to be ≥ 5% BSA and include lesioned and non -lesioned skin (if 
lesions account for less than 5% BSA); however, topical administration must be ≤ 
30% BSA.  
NOTE: 1% BSA is defined as the area of the subject’s hand held flat, including the thumb 
and fingers held  togeth er. 
NOTE: No more than 4 -5 DEB/JEB patients (50% of the cohort) may be enrolled into the 
cohort. DEB/JEB patients will not be eligible for the open -label extension study.  
For adolescent/adult patients with EB (Cohort 1):  
Eligible, consented (assented and/o r consent via guardian) adolescent and adult patients aged 
12 and up with EB lesions encompassing ≥ 2% BSA will be enrolled in the study. On Day  1, 
the total surface area of all available areas for application will be quantified and recorded.  The 
area(s) surrounding the lesion/lesions, will be marked (with a marker) encompassing no less 
than a total of 5% BSA (across all lesions, total) and separate paper body charts will be 
completed documenting the application area. The area(s) encompassing no less than 5% BSA 
will be defined as the application area(s) and will remain fixed over the course of the 10 Day C 
period. On Day 1, the topical dose of CCP -020 will be applied by study staff followed by blood 
sampling for plasma analysis of diacerein and rhein throu gh 8 hours post -application. PK 
samples will be collected at pre -dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post -dose on Days 1 and 10. 
Trough PK samples will be collected on any two available days from Day 3 through Day 9. 
Patients will be discharged from the study site on Day 1 and will continue  applications to the 
entire application area for 9 days at home at the same time each day. For the trough sample 
visits between Days 3 and 9, CCP -020 will be applied after the blood draw. The application 
area should be  left uncovered for at least one -hour post -application, after which it is acceptable 
to apply non -absorbent bandages consistent with standard of care. On Day 10, patients will 
return to the study site for a pre -dose blood sample and application of CCP -020 to the 
application area followed by blood sampling for plasma analysis of diacerein and  rhein.  
For infant/child patients with EB (Cohort 2):  
Eligible, assented (consented via guardian) infant/child patients aged 6 months to 11 years, 
inclusive with EB lesi ons encompassing ≥ 2% BSA will be enrolled in the study. On Day 1,  
Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
CCP -020-101 Statistical Analysis Plan  Page 8 of 20  
 
the total surface area of all available areas for application will be quantified and recorded. The 
area(s) surrounding the lesion/lesions, will be marked (with a marker) enco mpassing no less 
than a total of 5% BSA (across all lesions, total) and separate paper body charts will be 
completed documenting the application area. The area(s) encompassing no less than 5% BSA 
will be defined as the application area(s) and will remain f ixed over the course of the 10 Day 
treatment period. On Day 1, the topical dose of CCP -020 will be applied by study staff followed 
by blood sampling for plasma analysis of diacerein and rhein through 8 hours post - application. 
PK samples will be collected at pre -dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post -dose on Days 1 and 10. 
Trough samples for Days 3 -9 will not be required for this cohort. Patients will be discharged 
from the study site on Day 1 and will continue applications to the entire application area for 9 
days at home at the same time each day. The application area should be left uncovered for at 
least one -hour post -application, after which it is acceptable to apply non -absorbent bandages 
consistent with standard of care. On Day 10, patients will return to the study site for a predose 
blood sample and application of CCP -020 to the application area followed by blood sampling 
for plasma analysis of diacerein and rhein. For sites participating in the United States (US), 
children under the age of 4 are prohibite d from participating due to regulatory  restrictions.  
For both cohorts, on Days 1 and 10, void -volume catheters will be placed to obviate multiple 
needle sticks in blood sampling.  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations.  
The clinic/study site will attempt to contact subjects using their standard procedures 
approximately 14 days after the last study drug application to determine i f any adverse events 
(AEs) have occurred since the last dose of study drug. Subjects who terminate the study early 
will be contacted if the Principal Investigator (PI) deems necessary.  
EB (excluding DEB/JEB) patients that complete this study or receive at least one dose of study 
drug will be eligible for consideration to enroll an open -label extension study conducted under 
a separate  protocol.

• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  or 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth  defect.  
 
6.11.3  Adverse Events of Special  Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific t o the program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by

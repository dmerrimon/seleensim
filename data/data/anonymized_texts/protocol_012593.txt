CLINICAL STUDY  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Name:  ATLAS Study  
Protocol Number:  CP2015 -2 
Protocol Title:  AtriClip ® Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion Concomitant to Structural Heart 
Procedures (ATLAS)  
Name of Finished 
Product(s):  AtriClip® Gillinov -Cosgrove ® LAA Exclusion Systems [AtriClip FLEX (ACH2), 
AtriClip Long (LAA), or AtriClip Standard (ACH1)]  
Development Phase:  Exempt, post market  
Study Design:  This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (2:1), unblinded pilot study.  
Indication of Device:  All medical devices used during this study are cleared for commercial distribution and 
are to be used in accordance with approved product labeling.  
 
The AtriClip LAA Exclusion System is indicated for the occlusion of  the left atrial 
appendage, under direct visualization, in conjunction  with other open cardiac surgical 
procedures.  Direct visualization, in this context, requires that the surgeon is able to 
see the heart directly, without assistance from a camera, endoscope, etc., or an y other 
viewing technology. This includes procedures performed by sternotomy (full or 
partial) as well as  thoracotomy (single or multiple).  
Objective(s):  The objective(s) of this trial are to:  
1. Compare impact of POAF among two randomized treatment arms; 
patients with POAF and surgical LAA closure (using AtriClip Gillinov -
Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems) versus patients with POAF and no 
surgical LAA closure . 
2. Evaluate Healthcare  resource utilization [ i.e. Hospital length of stay 
(LOS), emergency room and/or h ospital re -admissions, and costs 
associated with specific adverse events  that may be related to atrial 
fibrillation ]. 
3. Evaluate long -term outcomes of LAA closure with AtriClip in patients at 
risk of developing POAF.  
Number of Subjects 
(Planned):  Up to 2000 subjects will be randomized into this study.  
Sites:  Up to 40 sites  
Patient Population:  Patients without a document ed history of AF but who present with a CHA2DS2 - VASc 
of > 2 and HASBLED of > 2 and will undergo a valve or CABG (structural heart) 
procedure w ith direct visual access to the LAA will be eligible to participate based 
upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this protocol.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
The traditional standard of care for patients with POAF is oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy as 
prophylaxis of thromboembolic events.   Recent clinical literature from Gallego et al (Gallego, Relation of 
the HAS -BLED bleeding risk score to major bleeding, ca rdiovascular events, and mortatlity in 
anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation., 2012)  suggests that the risk of major bleeding exceeds the 
risk of thromboembolic events in AF patients at a HAS -BLED score of > 3.  Gallego et al. also reported 
that patients with low CHADS score (e.g., 0 – 1) have lower major bleeding risk than those patients with 
CHADS >=2. Although Gallego et al. focused on HAS -BLED > 3, the study recrui ted 800 (83%) and 740 
(77%) patients with HASB LED>=2 and CHADS>=2, respectively. In fact, 472 (49%) of the patients 
recruited in the study had a HASBLED score of 2. Other peer -reviewed research from Tung et al (Tung, 
2015)   identifies that the highest risk for major bleedi ng occurs within the first 30 days of initiating OACs.  
Therefore, this study focuses entirely on a subset of patients that are vulnerable to both initiation of OACs 
as well overalls risks of OAC therapy.   
Literature and current practice reinforce the fac t that this subset of high risk AF patients are not routinely 
being started on OACs.  In a recent meta -analysis from Lip et al (Lip, Underuse of Oral Anticoagulation in 
AF, A systematic review, 2010) , looking at high risk  patients (defined as those with a CHADS > 2) only 
39% of AF patients in the U.S. were on OAC therapy.  
This study intends to monitor a subset of patients with specific risk factors where both the risk of 
thromboembolic events and major bleeding intersect r esulting in significant clinical equipoise both in 
literature and in current “real life” clinical practice.  
Use of the AtriClip device  may eliminate the nidus for AF -related thrombi originating in the Left Atrial 
Appendage.   While not the focus of this st udy it is believed that this may contribute favorably to the primary 
composite endpoint of major bleeding, stroke and  TIA.  T his research may begin to better inform clinical 
practice for those treating these high risk patients  and continue to ascertain the risk of major bleeding vis-

à-vis the risk of thromboembolic events in AF pat ients at a HAS -BLED score >=2. 
 
Need for Treatment in ATLAS  
Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) and related stroke/TIAs impact mortality, morbidity and QOL for 
patients under going structural heart disease procedures.    Oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is typically 
indicated for stroke prophylaxis in patients with POAF.   Risk factors identified by HAS -BLED scoring of 
>2 present an increased risk for bleeding creating clinical equipoise between the risk/benefit of stroke/TIA 
risk and clinically significant bleeding.  Initiation of anticoagulation therapy for POAF patients is reported 
to increase hospital length of stay b y 2-5 days.  Exclusion of the Left Atrial Appendage in patients with 
Atrial Fibrillation is believed to reduce the potential for thrombus formation within the Left Atrial 
Appendage which is the site of a majority (90%) of all thrombi identified in patients  examined with an AF 
related stroke  (Blackshear, 1996) .   
 
The 2006 ACC/AHA Guidelines recommended removal of the Left Atrial Appendage to reduce the 
potential for stroke during cardiac (structural heart) procedures for any patien t with risk factors for stroke 
or postoperative atrial fibrillation when it can be done without  adding risk to the primary operation.  Due 
to a lack of randomized controlled trials showing a reduction in stroke in patients with their LAA removed, 
prophylac tic LAA exclusion is not routinely performed.    
 
Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation (POAF) incidence is reported to be between 30 -50% depending upon 
patient demographics, procedural variables and intensity of rhythm monitoring.  Historically, POAF was 
considered to be self -terminating and confined to the postoperative hospital stay.  A recent paper from 
Joung et al (Joung, 2014) , published  in the American Heart Journal suggests that new -onset POAF is 
associated with a five times higher risk of future long term AF than matched patients as well as a three 
times higher mortality.  
 
In addition, POAF has been shown to have a strong association with perioperative stroke/TIA, increased 
length of hospital stay, decreased QOL and increased  mortality.    A 2014 Annals paper from LaPar  et al. 
(LaPar, 2014)  evaluated  ~50,000 patients undergoing structural heart procedures.   For patients with POAF, 
stroke incidence was 2.6% vs. 1.1% vs. in non -POAF patients at 30-day follow -up, increased ICU time of 
48 hours longer, increased hospital LOS of 3 days,  and a 25% higher 30-day readmission rate.  The total 
incremental hospital costs associated with POAF was determined to be ~$9000.   Yusuf et al (Yus uf, 2014) , 
reviewed data on over 100,000 cardiac surgery patients in Ontario, Canada over 10 years to examine the 
rate and predictors of early and late stroke.   New -onset POAF was one of the strongest predictors of early 
stroke with an Odd Ratio of 1 .5.  Age, history of TIA/stroke, PAD, CHF, and valve surgery were also 
predictors.  The data also showed that increasing CHADS2 scores predicted increased risk of stroke or 
death among patients with AF vs. those without AF .  
 
An October 2013 JTCVS paper by  Chua  et al. (Chua, 2013)  validated  the CHADS2 scoring system as 
highly predictive for risk of POAF in CABG patients without a history of preoperative AF.  Specifically, 
patients with CHADS2 scores of >2 had a 36% risk of POAF (ra nge of 27 -100%).   
 
A more refined scoring system, the CHA2DS2 -VASc score, has been validated to define the risk of stroke 
in AF patients in numerous papers.  A CHA2DS2 -VASc of >2 estimates an annual risk of stroke of between 
4.5-18.2% in patients with AF.

Risks Associated with Initiating Anticoagulation Therapy  
Typical hospital protocol for stroke prophylaxis in patients with POAF is the initiation of anticoagulation 
therapy (AC) within 24 hours of diagnosis.   A 2009 Annals paper from (Kasirajan, 2009)  et al. identified 
isolated POAF as adding 2.2 days to hospital length of stay presumably associated with normalization of 
anticoagulation therapy within therapeutic range.   The HASBLED scoring system has been va lidated in 
multiple studies to identify the risk of clinically significant bleeding.    HASBLED scores of >2 have an 
associated risk of bleeding of between 4.1 -19.6% annually.     
A recent Circulation paper from Roldan  (Rolden, 2013)  et.al defined a strong correlation between bleeding 
and adverse cardiovascular events using the HASBLED scoring system.  They concluded that crude 
bleeding rates exceeded thrombotic events at HAS -BLED scores of >3.    
Azoulay  (Azou lay, 2014)  et al. reported that the initiation of Warfarin was associated with a 1.71 relative 
risk of AF -related stroke within the first 30 days suggesting a significant   transient hypercoagulable state 
at the start of treatment.   In a report from R uiz-Nodar  at al.  (Ruiz -Nodar, 2012) , they reported a major 
bleeding rate of 11.8% at one year in patients with a HAS -BLED score of > 3 in their series of patients 
undergoing coronary artery stenting procedures.    
Clinical equipoise exists regarding the initiation of anticoagulation therapy in patients with a significant 
risk of AF -related stroke as well as significant risk of bleeding related to OAC therapy.  
Evidence suggests that the risk of major bleeding exceeds the risk  of thromboembolic events in AF patients 
with a HAS -BLED > 3 (Gallego, Relation of the HAS -BLED bleeding risk score to major bleeding, 
cardiovascular events, and mortatlity in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation., 2012) .  Other peer -
reviewed research identifies that the highest risk for major bleeding and ischemic stroke occurs within the 
first 30 days of initiating OACs (Tung, 2015)  (Gomes, 2013) .  This study focuses on patients that are 
vulnerable to both risks identified by two well established scoring strata (CHADS and HASBLED) as well 
as significantly increased risks for patients initiating OAC therapy for a complication that will largely self -
terminate wit hin 30 days of onset.   
 
Hypothesis Testing of LAA Closure in POAF   
Dr. Cox (Cox, 1993)  describes  a large series of patients where a Maze procedure was performed including 
LAA surgical exclusion.   At 90 day follow up only 2/306 (.6%) patients experienced a stroke/TIA although 
37% had POAF in spite of a majority not receiving postoperative anticoagula tion therapy.    
In a 2013 paper from Kim et al.  (Kim, 2013) ; describes  a series of 631 matched patients with/without LAA 
exclusion concomitant to cardiac (structural heart) procedures.  Using propensity analysis, 260 subjects 
with postoperative AF were analyzed evaluating  incidence of stroke/TIA.   In the LAA exclusion group 
there were zero (0%) stroke/TIAs in spite of a majority of these patients not receiving anticoagulation 
therapy.  Conversely there were 6% stroke/TIAs in the no LA A exclusion group (p = 0.003).  A second 
article (Viles -Gonzalez, 2012)  et al.; showed a ~77% reduction in expected stroke rate in AF patients with 
a >2 CHADS2 score undergoing a percutaneous LAA closure device and contraindications to Warfarin.    
 
These papers provide preliminary evidence that LAA exclusion may potentially reduce stroke/TIA 
complications associated with POAF and that its application to patients  with a significant risk of bleeding 
on OACs may have a secondary benefit in reducing bleeding complications.  
 
  
Study Number: CP2015 -2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 48 
Record : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
Published data suggests a risk of POAF in valve and CABG patients of between 32 -66% (Creswell, 1993) .  
The ris k of a perioperative CVA event in  the POAF patient population of up to 6% (Lee, 2014)  and a 2-
year rate of stroke or death of 21.2 % for those with a CHADS2 score of greater than 3 (Whitlock, 2014) .    
The decision to forgo placing an AtriClip in  the treatment arm will  be at the surgeon’s perioperative 
discretion due to overall risk of the procedure  or risk associated with accessing the LAA and  documented 
with a rationale on the Case Report Form (for exampl e, excessive adhesions  in the vicinity of the LAA.).  
 
The Role of ATLAS in Critically Ill Patients  
Anticoagulation therapy is considered the standard of care for stroke prophylaxis in patients with Atrial 
Fibrillation but in patients with risk factors for bleeding the risk/benefit of medical management is 
elucidated.   This study will evaluate a medical management arm vs. mechanical exclusion of the left 
appendage via an implantable device.  It is believed that the left appendage is the source for a predominant 
number of stroke causing emboli in AF patients .  It is postulated that patients receiving antic oagulation will 
incur a longer length of stay due to the initiation and normalization and maintenance of therapeutic lev els 
associated with therapy.  This will also be evaluated in the study.   
 
2.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVE S 
 
The objective(s) of this trial are to:  
1. Compare impact of POAF among two randomized treatment arms; patients with POAF and 
surgical LAA closure (using AtriClip Gillinov -Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems) versus 
patients with POAF and no surgical LAA closure . 
2. Evaluate Healthcare resource utilization  [i.e. Hospital length of stay (LOS), emergency room 
and/or hospital re -admissions, and costs associated with specific adverse events  that may be 
related to atrial fibrillation ]. 
3. Evaluate long -term outcomes of LAA closure with AtriClip in patients at risk of developing 
POAF.

Overall Study and Design – Description  
All patients who undergo a valve or CABG (structural heart) procedure with direct visual access to the 
LAA will be eligible to participate based upon consent and evaluation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
defined in this protocol.    
 
The target p atient population includes patients at risk of POAF based on the CHA2DS2 -VASc and 
HASBLED scoring.  
 
Patient must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria (including intra -operative exclusion criteria ) before 
enrollment or randomization.     
 
During the planned structural heart procedure, the intra -operative exclusion criteria will be assessed.  If any 
intra-operative exclusion criteri a are met, the subject will be a screen  fail and will not be enrolled  or 
randomized.     
 
To execute randomizati on, at the time of enrollment, s ubjects will be assigned a sequential identi fication 
number at each site and a corresponding sealed envelope which will be opened in the operating room to 
reveal the treatment group.  Subjects will be randomized 2:1 (2 with AtriC lip® to 1 with  no AtriC lip®).  
Randomization sequences will be generated by  the AtriCure Statistician and will b e stratified by s ite.  The 
subject population will be randomized using a blocking scheme for each surgeon to ensure equal and 
balanced treatment group allocations and to avo id bias with respect to known or unknown subject  variables 
that could affect the outcome of this study.  
 
Post-index procedure, all subjects will be monitored per the hospital standard of care processes for POAF.   
 
Four (4) treatment arms result : 
 Surgery with AtriC lip (POAF diagnosed  / Institution SoC anticoagulation therapy ) 
 Surgery with AtriC lip (No POAF ) 
 Surger y with no AtriC lip (POAF diagnosed  / Institution SoC anticoagulation therapy ) 
 Surgery with no AtriC lip (No POAF)  
 
Subjects will be assessed for AEs related to the placement of the AtriClip and will be instructed to notify 
the PI of any AEs that occur d uring the study .  All s ubjects  that develop POAF during the hospital stay  will 
be followed for approximately 1 year (365 days) post index procedure.  In addition, all the subjects  in the 
AtriClip group that do not develop POAF will also be followed for 365 -days post index procedure.  
4.2 Selection of Study Population  
4.2.1 Recruitment  
All patients who meet the inclusion criteria  will be tracked on a Screening Log .  Patients  will be provided 
the IRB approved IC F and will have the opportunity to read, understand, and have their questions answered 
prior to signing the IC F.  If the patient agrees to participate in the study and signs  consent, the ICF will be 
completed.  The subject must sign and date the IC F prior to any study -specific procedures being performed.  
The person reviewing the IC F with the subject will also sign and date the IC F.  The subject will be given a 
copy of the signed IC F to keep.

1. Presence of thr ombus in the left  atrium or LAA.  
2. LAA tissue is deemed friable or has significant adhesions (as evaluated by the surgeon) near or on 
the LAA making AtriC lip placement overly risky.  
3. Left atrial appendage is outside the range of manufacturer ’s recommendations  - width < 29mm or 
> 50mm . 
4. Direct visualization access is not available for AtriC lip placement.  
5. Any medical condition or finding for which the Investigator used medical discretion to determine 
the subject should be excluded.   Any medical condition or finding for which the  Investigator used 
medical discretion to determine the subject should be excluded.  
4.2.6 Removal of Subjects from Study  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Code of Federal Regulations, a subject has the right 
to withdraw from the study  at any time for any reason without prejudice to his/her future medical care by 
the physician or the institution.  Should a subject (or subject’s legally authorized guardian/representative) 
decide to withdraw; all efforts will be made to collect and report  the final visit observations as thoroughly 
and timely as possible.  Subjects who withdraw from the study  will not be replaced.  
The primary reason for early termination and the date of termination will be recorded in the electronic case 
report form.  Reaso ns may include:  
Investigator Decision  
If the subject experiences an adverse event and the Principal Investigator or Medical Monitor 
believes it is in their best interest to discontinue participation in the study , they will be withdrawn 
from the study . 
Lost  to Follow -up 
When contact with the subject ha s been lost without completing the  final visit assessment, and 
every attempt to contact has failed, the subject will be considered lost to follow -up.  Final 
documentation regarding all attempts to contact the subject requesting their return for the fi nal 
visit should be documented.  
Withdra wal of Consent  
The subject withdraws consent for participation in the study .  Any method of contact with the 
subject in which they state they no longer want to participate in the study  specific activities

constitutes withdrawal of consent.  When possible t he reason for withdrawal will be documented.  
Site Termination or Study  Termination  
A site or study  may be terminated.  When this occurs all subjects at the site will be withdrawn and 
documented as early termination.  Reasons for site or study  termination m ay include, but are  not 
limited to the following:  
 Administrative Concerns (e.g., inadequate subject enrollment, Investigator/institution non -
compliance, change of business strategy, etc.);  
 Safety Issues, including those due to non -compliance, which substan tially affect the risk to 
benefit ratio of the study  subjects at a site or for the study  as a whole;  
 Regulatory Body Mandate(s)  
 
Other (which may include):  
 Protocol deviation, noncompliance or violation  
 Sponsor recommendation  
 Device/ index procedure failure  
 Death  
4.2.7 Follow -up for Early Terminated Subjects  
In the even t that a subject is eligible , enrolled, and randomized into the study but must early terminate either 
prior to the index procedure ( AtriC lip placement ) or even after the index procedure; the subject  will be 
follow ed for 30 days for safety purposes.   
5.0 PROCEDURE  
5.1 General Description  
Individual centers and investigators will be  selected based upon their expertise in the targeted structural 
heart disease procedures (non -mechanical Mitral Valve Repair/Replacement, Aortic Valve 
Repair/Replacement, and Corona ry Artery By -Pass procedures) as well as proficiency in AtriClip 
placement.  
The term index procedure refers only to the placement /non-placement of the AtriC lip (dependent on 
randomization) . All proce dures leading up to and after the placement of the AtriC lip are considered part 
of the structural heart procedure and are to be cond ucted under the discretion of the surgeon in accordance 
to the hospital’s standard of care.  
Transesophageal Echocardiography  (TEE) with Doppler  
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with Doppler must be performed prior to any epicardial surgical 
intervent ion. The purpose of the TEE with Doppler is to assess for presence of thrombus .  If a thrombus is 
present in the left atrium o r LAA, the subject will not be enrolled or randomized into the study  and no 
AtriC lip will be placed .   
 
The AtriClip LAA Exclusion  System must be used only by properly trained and qualified medical personnel 
in accordance with the Instructions for Use (IFU).  Failure to properly follow instructions may result in 
improper functioning of the device.  
  
Study Number: CP2015 -2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 48 
Record : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
 
If the subject continues to meet  all study eligibility criteria  (including intra -operative exclusion criteria) , 
they will be enrolled and randomized.  If the subject is randomized to the group to receive the AtriClip 
LAA Exclusion System placement, the following steps are performed:  
 
Note: A recommended surgical technique is presented below. It is recognized that individual patient 
anatomic variation, surgical conditions, or surgeon preference may necessitate modifications to the 
outlined procedures.   Regardless, surgeons must adhere t o the AtriClip LAA Exclusion System  sizing 
criteria, device selection, and device use instructions as outlined in the IFU.  
5.2 Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Exclusion  (Index Procedure)  
5.2.1 No AtriC lip arm  
If the subject is randomized to the no AtriC lip arm, the left atrial appendage should be left intact  with no 
management.  
5.2.2 AtriClip arm  
If the subject is randomized to the AtriC lip arm, t he left atrial appendage should be managed using the 
AtriClip LAA Exclusion System.  The left atrial appendage is t ypically accessible and exclusion of the Left 
Appendage by the AtriClip is believed to introduce little time or risk to the primary operation.   In the event 
that, the surg eon deems that the AtriClip device is not able to be utilized for left atrial a ppend age after 
randomization, because of anatomical limitations  or that it is not feasible or safe to address the LAA, t he 
appendage may be left intact.  I n the even t that a subject is randomized but must early terminate before or 
after the index procedure; the  subject will be followed for 30 days for safety purposes .   
General Placement of the AtriClip : 
Refer to the IFU for proper AtriClip size selection  as well as AtriC lip positioning and d eployment 
instructions.  Using a Kitner or forceps, the open AtriClip ® device is passed over the tip of the left atrial 
appendage.  The tip of the appendage is gently teased into the AtriClip.  The device is then lowered into the 
base of the appendage.  Awareness of the proximity of the circumflex artery  and its relationship  to the 
targeted location at the base of the left atrial appendage  is critical . The AtriClip is applied on the left atrial 
appendage ensuring the alignment and complete closure of the LAA .   
 
 
   
 
   
Post Index  Procedure  - Subject Assessment  
To assess the subject status with regard to potential bleeding, assessments of hemoglobin and hematocrit 
shall be performed po st index  procedure per the hospital’s standard of care.

5.3 Post-Surgical  Follow -up Anticoagulation Therapy  
Subjects who are diagnosed with POAF during their postoperative course  should be treated per the 
institution’s standard of care and may in clude  anticoagulation therapy .  
The decision to administer anticoagulation therapy in the post -operative/follow -up setting is at the 
discretion of the Investigator/Institution taking into consideration, the subject’s ability to safely initiate and 
sustain anticoagulation therapy.    
The anticoagulants that may be used in medical management may include:  
 Acenocoumarol  
 Acetylsalicylic acid  
 Apixaban  
 Dabigatran  
 Edoxaban  
 Heparin  
 Nadroparin  
 Rivaroxiban  
 Warfarin  
 Other (to be specified)  
These are the anticoagulants that may be utilized in medical management.  The decision of which 
anticoagulant to use (if any) is left to the discretion of the Investigator.  
6.0 IDENTITY OF STUDY DEVICES  
The devices utilized for the study include:  
AtriClip Gill inov-Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems which are indicated for the occlusion of the left atrial 
appendage, under direct visualization, in conjunction with other open cardiac surgical procedures.  Direct 
visualization, in this context, requires that the surgeo n is able to see the heart directly, without assistance 
from a camera, endoscope, etc., or any other viewing technology. This includes procedures performed by 
sternotomy (full or partial) as well as thoracotomy (single or multiple).  
 
All medical devices used during this study are cleared for commercial distribution and are to be used in 
accordance with approved product labeling.  
 
Device Description  
When closed, the AtriClip applies uniform pressure over the length of the AtriClip to ensure consistent, 
reproducible, and secure exclusion of the LAA.   The AtriClip is available in the following lengths to 
accommodate different sizes of LAA: 35 mm, 40 mm, 45 mm, and 50 mm.  
The AtriClip was cleared under K093679.  The frame assembly of the implantable AtriClip c onsists of two 
Nitinol (nickel titanium) springs connecting two opposing titanium tubes (core), which are covered with a 
Polyurethane elastomer.  This assembly is covered with a knit braided polyester fabric, composed entirely 
of Polyethylene terephthalate  (PET).  The Nitinol springs are biased toward the closed position allowing 
the device to close in the absence of opposing forces (Figure 1).  When closed, the AtriClip applies uniform 
pressure over the length of the AtriClip to ensure consistent, reproduc ible, a nd secure exclusion of the LAA.

8.1.1 Source Documents  
Source documents are documents on which information regarding subjects are first recorded. PI subject 
files or hospital records generally are the basis of source document information . This may include but is 
not limited to, original s ubject files, hospital/clinic records, original recordings/tracing, and digital  images 
from automated instruments, X -ray films, and laboratory results.  
 
Source documents must be retained by the PI as part of the subject’s permanent medical record. The 
information in the source documents is used to complete the eCRFs. All information captured on the eCRFs 
should be completely and accurately supported in source documentation.  Study Monitors will verify data 
reported on eCRFs with site source documents.  Any additional information relevant to the study  should be 
included in the source documents. In particular, any deviations from the study  protocol or procedures should 
be recorded in the source documents. The PI will retain originals of all source documents, subject consent 
forms, and study  data.

8.1.2 Data Collection  
An EDC system will be utilized by study  site personnel to transfer study  data from source records (medical 
records and/or source document worksheets) onto common eCRFs. This system is a web -based, secure 
electronic software application This system is designed , developed, and maintained in a manner that is 
compliant with national an d international GCP data protection/data privacy and electronic record/electronic 
signature (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11) regulatory requirements.  The platform software has been validated in 
accordance with 21 CFR Part 11, European Commission’s Directive on Data  Protection and US Safe Harbor 
Certification.   Prior to being released for data entry, validation of the study level components (i.e. data entry 
screens, associated edit checks and work flow) will be conducted in accordance with approved user 
acceptance te sting procedures. Access to this system will be controlled so that only authorized users will 
have the ability to enter into the system.  The system is considered a closed system according to 21 CFR 
Part 11 Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures.  
The EDC system will be used to facilitate the collection of all study  data at the site. Designated site 
personnel will be responsible for entering subject data into the EDC system. All external and Sponsor 
internal users will be trained on the EDC applicat ion at a level dependent on their planned function.  
An EDC digital User Manual will be available under the help menu within the EDC we bsite to assist in the 
collection and entry of source data into the electronic casebook.  
Investigative study sites will b e asked to enter subject data into the eCRFs no later than 2 weeks from the 
time the subject was seen for their scheduled study visit.  
Detailed description of the eCRF components are included in the eCRF  Completion Instructions. These 
will be provided to t he Investigators prior to initiating subject enrollment.  The respective eCRFs must be 
fully completed for each sub ject and signed electronically.  
Data collected during the clinical investigation for each subject will be maintained as accurately and 
completely as possible with entries into an electronic data capture system provided by AtriCure.  The 
personal data recorded on all documents, including copy documents, and within the system will be regarded 
as confidential.  The Investigator will be responsible for the timing, completeness and accuracy of the 
details entered within the electronic data capture system.  All data entered in the database must  have source 
documents in the subject’s medical records.  
Data will be entered into the electronic data capture system by members of the Investigational team who 
have received training in the use of the system.  The system will generate data queries at the point of data 
entry based on validation checks defined by AtriCure. Such validation checks will primarily be focused on 
validation of key variables including selected subject demographics, appropriate value ranges and date 
checks. Resolution of the queries  will be the responsibility of the Clinical Investigator and investigation 
team members.  Following completion of all data queries on each eCRF, the Clinical Investigator will be 
responsible for reviewing and confirming agreement to the data within the sys tem. 
The Investigator must record the subject’s participation in this clinical investigation in the subject’s hospital 
notes.  In addition, the Investigator must keep a separate list of all subjects entered into this clinical 
investigation showing each sub ject’s name, date of birth and assigned subject number (fo r identification 
purposes).  A s ubject Identification Log  will be provided in the Investigator’s File for this purpose.

8.1.3 Data Correction  
Corrections to eCRFs will be prompted via automated electron ic edit checks and queries manually created 
by reviewers.  The corrections and the individual making the correction(s) to the eCRF will be within EDC.  
8.1.4 Investigator Regulatory Binder  
Each Investigator must maintain an accurate, complete, and current copy of  the Investigator Regulatory 
Binder.  Upon receipt of copies of changes or revision updates to the Binder from the Sponsor, the 
Investigator will add the updated document to the Regulatory Binder .  If an Investigator holds multiple 
copies of the Regulatory  Binder, then all copies must be updated with the current revisions.  
8.1.5 Study Correspondence  
Each Investigator and all personnel from the investigational site will maintain records of all correspondence, 
electronic, written, and verbal, relating to any aspect  of the clinical investigation.  The records are 
maintained in the Investigator  Regulatory  Binder consisting of, but not limited to correspondence with other 
participating clinical investigators, the reviewing IRB, and the Sponsor.  The CRA will examine th e 
contents of the correspondence.  
8.1.6 Data Privacy  
Subjects will be made aware that their personal data will be collected and processed in accordance with 
data protection legislation including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA). Subjects will be asked to sign an Authorization for Release of Personal Health Information (PHI) 
for the purpose of this investigation. This authorization may be combined with the IC F depending on local 
IRB preference.  Results from the Clinical Inve stigat ion may be published. However, s ubject confidentiality 
will be maintained at all times and it will not be p ossible to identify individual s ubjects from any data 
presented.  
8.1.7 Record Retention, Inspection, and Custody  
The PI must maintain all documentation related to the study  until notified by the Sponsor. The PI will allow 
representatives of the Sponsor, IRB, the FDA, or other government regulatory agencies to inspect all study  
records, eCRFs, and corresponding portio ns of the subject’s office and/or hospital medical records at 
regular intervals during the study . These inspections are to verify adherence to the protocol, integrity of the 
data being captured on the eCRFs, and compliance with applicable regulations.  
Subject medical records will be kept confidential.  Study  reports will not identify subjects by name.  These 
reports may be submitted to the FDA and/or regulatory authorities.  
If custody of the records is transferred, notice of such a transfer should be given  to the Sponsor no later 
than ten (10) working days after the transfer occurs.  
The Investigator should retain copies of all documents pertaining to this clinical investigation (including 
source documentation, the informed consent document and any other documents to identify the subjects) 
for at least 2 years after this clinical inves tigation is completed.  In addition, if the Clinical Investigator 
moves/retires, etc., he/she should provide AtriCure Inc. the name and address of the person who will look

Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
after and be responsible for the subjects’ clinical investigation related records.  
8.1.8 Medical Dictionary Coding  
Medical dictionary coding will be performed using a coding thesaurus algorithm.  The MedDRA will be 
used upon data entry and query resolution for AEs, SAEs, via automated and manual coding processes.  
8.1.9 Data Quality Assurance  
Quality control and quality assurance processes implemented during this study  to ensure subject safety 
rights, and welfare are protected and to foster data integrity are characterized below.  
8.1.10  Investigator Training  - Protocol Specific Training  
Protocol t raining will  be scheduled once IRB approval is obtained and the Clinical Study Agreement is 
executed.   AtriCure, Inc.  will train the study site on the protocol and that training will be documented.  It is 
ultimately the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure all  clinical site personnel participating in this study 
are trained.  
The index procedure may only be performed by qualified investigators, familiar with the study procedures 
and techniques.   
8.1.11  Monitoring  
This study  will be monitored by the sponsor to ensure:  
 The rights , safety and well -being of the subjects are protected;  
 The reported study  data is accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; and  
 The conduct of the study  is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment(s), applicabl e GCPs, and with applicable local/regional regulatory 
requirements.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
In ord er to perform the monitoring r ole effectively, the CRA  must verify eCRF entries with source 
documents.  The CRA  must be given access to primary subject data which supports the information 
recorded on the eCRF, i.e. hospital notes, appointment books, original laboratory records, etc.  Access to 

  
Study Number: CP2015 -2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 48 
Record : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
these documents must also be given shou ld the regulatory authority in the instance of  an external inspection .  
Since a subject has the right to refuse access to these  documents on the grounds of confidentiality, consent 
to access is included in the informed consent doc ument, which the subject signs.  
The Principal  Investigator will receive reasonable notification prior to each monitoring visit during the 
course of this clinical investigation.  At each visit, the Principal  Investigator will be expected to co -operate 
with the CRA  for the review and verification of eCRFs and any additional records that may have been 
previously arranged between the Principal  Investigator and  the CRA . 
8.2 Changes to Protocol, Protocol Deviations and Protocol Amendments  
8.2.1 Changes to Protocol  
The I nvestigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to the protocol without agreement 
by the sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB of an 
amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study  subjects, or when the 
change(s) involves only logisti cal or administrative aspects of the study  (e.g., change in CRA (s), change of 
telephone number(s)). In the event of an emergency situation, th e Investigator must notify the CRA or 
AtriCure immediately.  A full written report of the situation must be forwar ded to the IRB who approved 
the original protocol and AtriCure within 10 working days of the event.  
8.2.2 Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator agrees to conduct the study in accordance with this protocol;  however, protocol deviations 
may occur during the course of the study .  Protocol deviations are events occurring during the conduct of 
the study  which are not in compliance with the protocol and for which an amendment has not been granted. 
Protocol deviations can be committed by the Sponsor, the PI, or study  subject. A deviation can be identified 
from a number of sources. Potential sources include, but are not limited to: a member of the PI’s staff, the 
CRA  during monitoring visits, or a member of the data management or statistical groups when entering or 
analyzi ng data.  The PI or PI’s representative are encouraged to contact the CRA  or AtriCure  as soon as 
possible upon observing a protocol deviation.  Regardless of the source, it is crucial to document the 
deviation and record all corrective actions. Protocol de viations will be reported in the final report.  
The process for capturing deviations will be detailed in the monitoring plan.  The process will require that 
documentation describe the deviation, appropriate actions taken, and will be included in the study  file for 
the respective PI and subject.  The study  site representative will be advised to record the deviation and 
relevant discussion with the Sponsor about the deviation in subject source documents.  
Protocol deviations affecting the scientific soundness o f the study  or the rights, safety, or welfare of the 
subjects, will be reported by the PI, as required by the IRB.  
Protocol deviations will be summarized and grouped into relevant categories for analysis and may include, 
but not be limited to, subjects who : 
 Entered the study  although they did not satisfy the eligibility criteria; or  
 Developed withdrawal criteria during the study , but not removed.

8.2.3 Protocol Amendments  
If it becomes necessary to amend the protocol,  then the nature of the amendment will be agreed between 
the Sponsor and the Principal Investigator(s) and this will be recorded with a justification for the 
amendment. The appropriate IRBs will be informed of amendments prior to implementation of the chan ge. 
9.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 Clinical Study Objective  
The objectives of this study are to:  
1. Compare impact of POAF among two randomized treatment arms; patients with POAF and 
surgical LAA closure (using AtriClip Gillinov -Cosgrove LAA Exclusion Systems) versus 
patients with POAF and no surgical LAA closure . 
2. Evaluate Healthcare resource utilization [i.e. Hospital length of stay (LOS), emergency room 
and/or hospital re -admissions, and costs associated with specific adverse events  that may be 
related to atrial fibrillation ]. 
3. Evaluate long -term outcomes of LAA closure with AtriClip in patients at risk of developing 
POAF.  
These patients will be enrolled prior to a scheduled existing cardiac procedure and randomized prior to the  
study  index procedure  (AtriC lip placement) . Perioperative event rates and postoperative outcomes 
including reoperation for bleeding, hospital length of stay, neurologic consults for stroke/TIAs, ED visits, 
and hospital readmissions through interval follow ups  will be determined.    
9.2 Study Endpoints  
The following endpoints will be collected for this hypothesis generating pilot study:  
1. Perioperative complications associated with AtriClip placement.  [Defined as: stroke, major 
bleeding  that requir es re-operation and/or transfusion of > 2 U packed red blood cells (PRBC) 
within any 24-hour period during the first 2  days’  post-index procedure,  myocardial infarction 
(MI), or death .] 
2. Intraoperative successful exclusion of LAA . [Defined as no (0 mm) flow be tween LAA and 
LA and < 5 mm LAA remnant by intraoperative TEE with Doppler. ] 
3. Composite event rates between the group of subjects diagnosed with POAF (AtriClip vs no 
AtriClip) through 365 days’  post index procedure and between the group of subjects not 
diagnosed with POAF (AtriClip vs no AtriClip) through 30 days’  post index procedure.  Events 
to be evaluated include: Thromboembolic & Hemorrhagic Events such as cerebrovascular 
accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), peripheral ischemia, hemorrhagic stroke, 
neurologic bleed, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, or other major bleeding event.   
4. Composite event (listed above) rates through 365 -days post index procedure for all AtriClip 
patients, regardless of whether the patient develops  POAF . 
5. Healthcare resou rce utilization variance between groups as related to the composite events 
above.  [Specifically hospital length -of-stay (LOS), reoperation for bleeding, neurologic 
consults for stroke or TIA, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital readmissions.]

Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
9.3 Healthcare resource utilization  
Healthcare resource utilization will be compared between groups.   Major resource use collected at various 
study visits/follow -up calls will include hospital resources (OR time, LOS , etc.), cardiac related medication 
use, readmissions, including 30 days readmit, neurological  consults, additional procedures during follow -
up related to index procedures, and rehabilitation associated with post index procedure strokes.   Costs from 
standa rd sources (DRGs, CPT  code s, RedBook, published studies for SAE and Rehab, etc.) may be assigned 
to assess economic impact and summed over the 365-day treatment period to obtain total treatment costs.    
9.4 Sample Size and Power  
This is a prospective, multicen ter, randomized (2:1), unblinded study conducted in up to 2000 patients at 
risk of POAF based on the CHA2DS2 -VASc and HASBLED scoring  at up to 20 USA sites.  All patients 
who undergo a valve or CABG (structural heart) procedure with direct visual access to the LAA will be 
eligible to participate based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this protocol.   
 
 
    
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
    
 
    
  
A total of up to 2 000 patients (approx. 1333  in AtriClip group, approx. 667 in SOC group) at risk of POAF 
will be enrolled in this study. It is  assume d that 40% of the patients will be diagnosed with POAF. A two 
treatment group one -sided Z -test with continuity correction and an  = 0.05 will hav e 80% power to detect 
the difference between a medical management (SOC) safety rate of PS = 12.5% and a mechanical exclusion 

  
Study Number: CP2015 -2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 48 
Record : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
(AtriC lip) safety rate of PC = 6.25% at 30 -days post -op when the sample size (for completers) for patients 
diagnosed with POAF is 485 in the AtriClip group and 243 in the SOC group (a total sample size of 728). 
Adjusting for loss to follow -up, 533 patients in the AtriClip group and 267 in the SOC group (a total sample 
size of 800) are expected to be diagnosed  with POAF.  
9.5 Randomization  
Upon enrollment, subjects will be assigned a sequential identification number at each site and a 
corresponding sealed envelope which will be opened prior to the index procedure t o reveal the treatment 
group. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 (2 with AtriClip  to 1 anticoagulation therapy and without AtriClip).  
Randomization sequences will be generated by AtriCure Statistician using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, North Carolina)  and will be stratified by site.   
9.6 Analysis Populations  
Intent -To-Treat  (ITT) Population:  The effectiveness, safety, health economic and Qualify of life analyses 
will be base d on the ITT p opulation. The ITT Population is defined as all subjects randomized to either the 
AtriClip LAA Closure or anticoagulation therapy and witho ut AtriClip  LAA  Closure group and  on whom 
the surgical  index procedure is attempted (even if the index procedure is aborted).  
POAF Diagnosis (POAF) Population:  This population will include all ITT subjects diagnosed with POAF. 
This will be the primary analysis population for effectiveness and health economic endpoints.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population:  A PP population may be defined for effectiveness, health economi c and 
Quality of Life analyses. This population is defined by POAF  population but without any major protocol 
violations, that is, those that could potentially bias the results.  
9.7 Analysis of Study Endpoints  
Study endpoints will be summarized by treatment gr oup and overall as appropriate.  Continuous variables 
will be summarized by presenting the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum by procedure group (AtriClip LAA Closure or anticoagulation therapy and without AtriClip  LAA  
Closure ). Tabulation of categorical variables by group will include counts and percentages. 95% confidence 
intervals will be provided as appropriate.  
Since this is an exploratory study, additional analyses, additional analysis populations, covariates and 
summary tables and/or graphs will be generated as needed.  
In all analyses described below, the null hypothesis will be a two -sided test of no treatment group difference. 
All statistical tests will use a two -sided significance level of =0.05.  
9.7.1 Effectivenes s and Health Economic Analysis  
A Pearson’s Chi -Squared test will be used to compare the incidence of successful LAA exclusion between 
the two procedure groups. Alternatively, a Fisher’s Exact test will be used if justified by small cell counts 
(less than 5 ) and Clopper -Pearson (Exact) 95% CI will also be reported.  
In addition, LAA exclusion might also be analyzed using multiple logistic regression model with the 
proportion of the event of successful LAA exclusion as the dependent variable and the following  
independent variables: sites (or clusters of sites), surgical approach (sternotomy, right mini -thoracotomy or 
other), age, gender, CHA2DS2 - VASc score, HASBLED score and relevant interaction terms.  
  
Study Number: CP2015 -2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 48 
Record : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
Healthcare resource use will be assessed by examining eit her total resource use, treatment costs or formal 
cost effectiveness/cost utility analysis.   Resource use such as hospital length of stay, OR time, and total 
treatment costs will be compared between the treatment groups using a two -way analysis of variance  
(ANOVA) model with procedure group (AtriClip LAA Closure or anticoagulation therapy and without 
AtriClip LAA Closure) and site as fixed effects in the model.   
These endpoints will also be compared using the two -sided t -test. A Shapiro -Wilk test of normality will be 
performed and if the normality assumption is not met, an approximate non -parametric model (e.g. Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test) may be performed.  
A Pearson’ s Chi -Squared test will be used to compare difference in 30 day readmits, number of neurological 
consults, additional procedures, and patient medication use between the two procedure groups.    
Formal economic models utilizing treatment effectiveness (Quali ty adjusted life years, costs to reduce 
stroke, etc.) may be built with collected data and other secondary sources accounting for specific country 
perspective and discounted appropriately.    
9.7.2 Safety Analysis  
A Pearson’s Chi -Squared test will be used to compare the incidence of complications associates with LAA 
exclusion between the two procedure groups. Alternatively, a Fisher’s Exact test will be used if justified by 
small cell counts (less than 5) and Cloppe r-Pearson (Exact) 95% CI will also be reported. Thromboembolic 
and hemorrhagic events will be similarly analyzed.  
In add ition, complications associated with LAA exclusion and thromboembolic/hemorrhagic might also be 
analyzed using multiple logistic regres sion model similar to the effectiveness endpoint (successful LAA 
exclusion) described above.  
9.8 Detailed Analysis Plan  
Prior to looking at the data and database closure, if needed, a detailed statistical analysis  
plan will be prepared and finalized to compl etely specify the statistical procedures to be applied to the data 
by the statistician who will conduct the analysis. The plan will amplify on the methods discussed in this 
protocol, will address any protocol changes that would affect the analysis, and wil l provide a rationale for 
any changes to the analysis.  
10.0 Safety Monitoring  
Subject safety will be monitored throughout the course of this study by monitoring for Adverse Events and 
Product Complaints related to the AtriClip  device .  The AtriClip device used during th e index procedure 
for the clinical study ha s been cleared for marketing by the FDA and is being used within the current 
labeling and indications for use.  Any event that occurs that may have caused or contributed to a death or 
serious injury or th at indicates the AtriClip device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or 
contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur will be reporte d in compliance with 
21 CRF Part 803.  
In addition to general surgical risks, addition al risks specifically associated with the AtriClip implant are 
as follows:  
 Incomplete exclusion of left atrial appendage (LAA)  
 Additional surgery if the device is not placed in the correct position.  
 Allergic reaction to the implant materials  
  
Study Number: CP2015 -2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 48 
Record : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
 Device misplac ement or embolization  
 Device breakage  
 Inability to move or retrieve device  
There may also be other risks that are unforeseen at this time.  
10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
Adverse Event (AE): any undesirable clinical occurrence or change from  a patient’s baseline (pre -index 
procedure) condi tion, whether it is device related or not.  
 Adverse Event Identification: a condition that is one of the following:  
a. A unique symptom or event that is a change from the subject’s baseline status  
b. A series of s ymptoms or events that can be categorized as a single entity based on definitions 
found herein  
c. A specific diagnosis responsible for a clinical change  
d. A worsening or exacerbation of a pre -existing condition  
10.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
10.2.1  Definition of a S erious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): any adverse event is considered serious if it results in death, is life 
threatening, requires hospitalization (initial or prolonged), results in disability or permanent damage, causes 
congenital anomaly/birth defe ct, requires intervention to prevent impairment or damage, or other serious 
(important medical events) which may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  
Note : “Death” should not be repor ted as an adverse event.  The cause of death should be reported as an 
adverse event.  The only exception is “Sudden De ath” when the cause is unknown.  
10.2.2  Subject Death  
Subject death during the investigation must be reported by the Investigator (or designee) by completing the 
Study Exit  eCRF in the database  along with the cause of death .  The electronic Adverse Event Form is 
necessary if the event was related to the AtriC lip device or placement of the device.   In addition, subject 
death must be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB requirements.   
10.2.3  Adverse Event Classification  
The investigator is required to provide:  
 Time interval of the event – The time interval of the  occurrence  of the adverse event should be 
assessed in relationship to timing of the index procedure (AtriClip  placement)  
 Date of event onset and outcome of the event, or date of death  
 Severity of the event – (Mild, Moderate, Severe)  
 Action taken for medical management of the event  
 Relationship of the event – it is the PIs responsibility to assess the relationship of an AE and provide 
primary cause.  Events will be categorized by relationship to the AtriClip  device, the applier,  ancillary 
device, and t he index procedure or other .   
  
Study Number: CP2015 -2 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 48 
Record : Clinical Study Protocol    
Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
 Adverse events will be assessed to determine if the event  meets the definition of a serious  adverse 
event .   
10.2.4  Reporting  Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs (both serious and no n-serious and regardless of 
relationship) in the source documents .  The Investigator at each site participating site is responsib le for 
reporting AEs and SAEs to AtriCure only when they are related to the LAA exclusion index procedure or 
device .  AEs related to the LAA exclusion procedure or device will be reported on the eCRF.  The CRFs 
allow the investigator to indicate whether or not the adverse events are related to the AtriClip device or 
AtriClip placement (index procedure).  
 Use a separate Adverse  Event Form to document each event  
 The Adverse Event Form must be electronically signed by the Investigator  
Note: It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform their IRB of SAEs as required by their 
IRB procedures and in conformance with FDA requi rements.  
All Serious Adverse Events that are related to the LAA exclus ion index procedure or device m ust be 
reported by the Investigator by submitting the AE eCRF to AtriCure within 10 days of becoming aware of 
the AE  and recorded on the Serious Adverse Ev ent Source Document Collection Form   An event determined 
by the Investigator to be life threatening or to have led to death should be reported within 24 hours.  
The Investigator shall send a written report including a narrative description of the SAE to Atr iCure within 
three (3) working days of the initial report.  The Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs until the 
events are resolved, or the subject has exited the study or  the AE is otherwise explained.  
11.0 PRODUCT COMPLAINTS  
11.1 Medical Device Reporting and Product Complaints  
All reported device observations, malfunctions or failures for AtriClip LAA products will be reported on 
the Device Complaint Form  within 10 days of observation of the Product Complaint via email to 
.  In the event of a suspected observation or device problem, the device shall be 
returned to the sponsor for analysis.  In addition, the Investigational Device Observation  eCRF should be  
completed with in 10 days of a suspected observation or device problem.   
Whenever an event involving an AtriCure device is subject to reporting under that Medical Device 
Reporting (MDR) regulation, AtriCure shall submit to the FDA the appropriate reports required by MDR 
within the time frames as identified in 21 CFR Part 803.  Criteria for reporting malfunctions and potentially 
serious injuries is based on interpretations of medical intervention, potential for serious injury, and impact 
of a malfunction to  a device’s essential functionality.  AtriCure will follow - reference documents

Health  Questionnaire / English  version  for the USA  SCRIPT  FOR  TELEPHONE  INTERVIEW  
 
 
GENERAL INTRODUCTION  
It is suggested  that the telephone  interviewer follows the script  of the EQ -5D. Although  allowance  should  
be made  for the interviewer’s  particular style  of speaking,  the wording of  the questionnaire  instructions 
should  be followed  as closely  as possible. In the case of the EQ -5D descriptive system  on pages 2 and 3, the  
exact wording must  be followed.  
 
It is recommended  that the interviewer  has a copy  of the EQ -5D in front of  him or  her as it  is administered 
over the telephone.  This enables  the respondent’s  answers  to be entered  directly  on the EQ -5D by the  
interviewer  on behalf  of the respondent  (i.e. the appropriate  boxes  on pages  2 and 3 are marked  and the scale  
on page 4 is marked  at the point  indicating  the respondent’s  ‘health today’).  If the respondent  asks for 
clarification,  the interviewer  can help by  re-reading  the question verbatim.  The interviewer should  not try 
to offer his  or her  own explanation but  suggest  that the  respondent  uses his or  her own  interpretation.  
 
If the respondent  has difficulty  regarding  which  box to mark,  the interviewer  should  repeat  the 
question  verbatim  and ask the respondent  to answer  in a way that most  closely  resembles  his or her 
thoughts  about  his or her health  today.  
 
INTRODUCTION TO  EQ-5D 
(Note  to interviewer:  please read the following)  
We are  trying  to find  out what you think  about your health.  I will first ask you some  simple  questions about 
your health TODAY. I will then ask  you to rate your health on  a measuring  scale.  I will explain  what  to do 
as I go along  but please interrupt  me if you do not understand  something  or if things are  not clear  to you. 
Please  also remember  that there  are no right  or wrong  answers.  We are interested  here only in your personal  
view.

EQ-5D DESCRIPTIVE  SYSTEM:  INTRODUCTION  
First  I am going  to read  out some  questions.  Each  question  has a choice  of five 
answers.  Please  tell me which  answer  best describes  your  health  TODAY.  Do not 
choose  more  than  one answer  in each  group  of questions.  
(Note  to interviewer:  it may be necessary  to remind  the respondent  regularly  that the 
timeframe  is TODAY. It may also be necessary to repeat  the questions verbatim)

ANXIETY  / DEPRESSION  
Finally,  I'd like to ask you about  anxiety  or depression.  Would  you say that: 
1. You are not anxious  or depressed?  
2. You are slightly  anxious  or depressed?  
3. You are moderately  anxious  or depressed?  
4. You are severely  anxious  or depressed?  
5. You are extremely  anxious  or depressed?  
(Note  to interviewer:  mark  the appropriate box  on the EQ-5D questionnaire)  
 
EQ VAS:  INTRODUCTION  
(Note  for administrator: If  possible, it  might  be useful to  send a visual  aid (i.e. the EQ  VAS) before the  
telephone  call so that the respondent  can have this in front of him or her when completing  the task)  
Now,  I would  like to ask you to say how good  or bad your  health  is TODAY.  
I'd like you to try to picture  in your  mind  a scale  that looks  a bit like a thermometer.  Can you do 
that?  The best health  you can imagine  is marked  100 (one hundred) at  the top of the scale  and the 
worst  health  you can imagine  is marked  0 (zero)  at the bottom.  
 
EQ VAS:  TASK  
I would  now like you to tell me the point  on this scale  where  you would  put your  health  today.  
(Note  to interviewer:  mark  the point  on the  scale  at the  point  indicating  the respondent’s ‘health  today’)  
Thank you for taking the time  to answer  these  questions.

APPENDIX 2 - Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
Risk Category:  Minimal . 
Summary :  The AtriClip device is commonly used for the exclusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA). 
The risks to subjects undergoing surgery to place the AtriClip device are listed below.  
 
1.0 POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:  
Risks associated with having the AtriClip placed (does not address the risks and discomforts associated 
with cardiac surgery).  
 
Possible risks and discomforts that may be associated with the use of the AtriClip during procedure are 
identified below.  
 Incomplete exclusion of left atrial appendage (LAA)  
 Additional surgery i f the device is not placed in the correct position.  
 Allergic reaction to the implant materials  
 Device misplacement or embolization  
 Device breakage  
 Inability to move or retrieve device  
 Injury, perforation or tear of the LAA which may lead to blood loss  
 
POTENTIAL RISKS  
Complications may occur at any time during the procedure, post procedure or follow -up period that could 
specifically occur with the AtriC lip® or the placement of the AtriC lip® include the following:  
 Myocardial infarction  
 Blood loss requirin g transfusion  
 Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)  
 Circumflex artery impingement  
 Death  
 Stroke  
 Pericarditis  
 Peripheral ischemia  
 Transient ischemic attack (TIA)  
 
2.0 POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
Benefits may include but are not limited to, the following:  
 Prevention of thromboem bolic events (blood clots).  
 Prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic (non -CNS) embolism.

Version date:  15Feb2017/ Rev: H  
 
 Elimination of oral blood thinners resulting in a reduction of bleeding complications associated 
with long -term anticoagulation.  
 Eliminating the need for life -long compliance to oral anticoagulant therapy and the frequent blood 
tests (depending on oral anticoagulant agent), and lifestyle changes associated with blood thinning 
medications.  
 Advancing the medical and scientific knowledge that may benefit future patients  with similar 
conditions may be gained through this clinical study.  
 There may also be other benefits that are unforeseen at this time.  
 
3.0 ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES/TREATMENTS  
There are some alternative ways for closing your left atrial appendage that does not i nvolve using the 
AtriClip:  
 Sewing or closing appendage with sutures or ligatures  
 Stapling the appendage closed with a medical stapling device  
 
MINIMIZATION OF RISKS  
Measures which will be taken to minimize risks related to the study include:  
 The investigators in this study will be selected based on their experience in treating  patients with 
atrial fibrillation and performing surgical  procedures  
 Investigators will be chosen that are qualified to complete study index procedures and are 
experienced in the placement of the AtriCure AtriClip device.  
 Well defined clinical study protocol, including specific inclusion/ exclusion criteria to  enroll 
appropriate subjects in the trial.  
 Close patient monitoring during the surgica l procedure and follow -up period.  
 
Alternative to Participation:   Patients may decline and would be treated with the same standard of care.   
CONCLUSION :  This clinical study is justified because the study sponsor and clinical  investigators 
believe the pot ential benefits outweigh the potential risks.

Page 5of 49STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) details the statistical methodology to be used in analyzing 
trial data and outlines the statistical programming specifications, tables, figures, and listings for 
clinical trial RSV-MVA-002. It describes the variables and populations, anticipated data 
transformations and manipulations, and other details of the analyses not provided in the Clinical 
Trial Protocol (CTP). 
The analyses defined in the SAP will be followed completely. It may be necessary to define 
some additional explorative analyses, and/or additional analysis populations. If any unforeseen 
additional analysis is included in the clinical study report (CSR) it will be clearly flagged as an 
additional unplanned explorative analysis. 
The analyses described are based on the final clinical trial protocol RSV-MVA-002 Edition 2.0 
dated 27 Jan 2017. 
GENERAL DEFINITIONS 
Vaccinations 
For this trial a vaccination means an intramuscular administration of active MVA-BN-RSV 
vaccine or Tris-buffered saline (TBS). 
Placebo 
Tris-buffered saline (TBS) 
Dose 1 
Represents the nominal titer of 1 x 108 Infectious Unit (Inf.U) per 0.5 mL. 
Dose 2 
Represents the nominal titer of 5 x 108 Inf.U per 0.5 mL. 
Treatment Group 
Subjects are recruited into one of five treatment groups receiving different investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) doses and schedules.  
Age groups: Subjects will be stratified by age into two groups: ≥ 55 to < 70, and ≥ 70 years of 
age. A minimum of 20 subjects per treatment group in the age stratum ≥ 70 years is required. 
Subgroups 
The subgroup consists of 20 subjects per treatment group (a total of 100 subjects) who will have 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collection as well as an additional serum and nasal 
swab sample collection time point one week post each vaccination. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific version Date: 31 -May-17
Page 6of 49Trial Day 
The trial day is based on the day of the first vaccination. The day of first vaccination is defined 
as Day 0 and the day after first vaccination is Day 1, and so on. Similarly, the day before first 
vaccination is defined as Day -1, and so on. No reference is made to the time of the vaccination 
in the calculation of the trial day, i.e. at midnight a new trial day begins regardless of the time of 
first vaccination. Note that it is possible for Visit 1 (V1) to be performed, for example, on trial 
Day -1. 
Baseline 
Baseline refers to the last measurement before first vaccination of trial vaccine. This is either at 
Visit 1 or at Screening (SCR) Visit (or latest re-screening) as applicable. For example, if there 
are missing vital sign data at Visit 1, the SCR or latest re-screening data will be used to impute 
the missing vital sign data as the baseline measurement. Partial rescreen is possible for certain 
isolated entry criteria. In such case the last measurement before first vaccination of trial drug will 
be used as the baseline value. This means that a subject’s baseline date may differ across screen 
and rescreen records. This data will be summarized as Baseline data without a direct 
specification of which visit was used. However, in all other visits no imputation will be used and 
the actual visit used will be specified in tables or listings. 
Staggering visit (VS) 
A visit only required by subjects allocated into the sentinel and safety cohort. The staggering 
process will be performed at one clinical site only. 
Vaccination Period 
A vaccination period is defined as the period starting at a given vaccination and ending 28 days 
after this vaccination or until the subject receives another vaccination or discontinues the trial 
with the following hierarchy:  
If subject receives both vaccinations, the second vaccination represents the end of 
vaccination period 1. 
The end of vaccination period 2 is 28 days after receiving the second vaccination, unless 
subject discontinues earlier. In this case, the discontinuation date represents the end of 
vaccination period 2. 
If subject discontinues before second vaccination, the discontinuation date represents the 
end of vaccination period 1. 
As the intention is that all subjects will receive two vaccinations, two vaccination periods will be 
recorded per subject. The overall vaccination period starts from the beginning of period 1 and 
ends at the end of period 2. 
Screening Phase 
The Screening Phase is defined from the Screening Visit up to, but not including Visit 1. This 
includes any Re-screening Visits that are conducted. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific version Date: 31 -May-17
Page 7of 49Active Trial Phase 
The active trial phase is defined as the trial phase starting with and including Visit 1 and ending 
with and including EAP (End of active trial phase) (V3 + 28-35 days). 
End of Active Trial Phase (EAP) 
EAP is defined as the last visit of the active trial phase.
Follow-Up Trial Phase 
The Follow-Up trial phase is defined as the phase starting after EAP visit and includes the 
Follow-up visits (FU1 and FU2). 
Eligible Subjects 
A subject is eligible if the screening question “Is subject eligible and willing to continue?” is 
answered with “Yes” and there are no subsequent substantial protocol deviations that affect the 
eligibility of the subject at Visit 1 prior to randomization. 
Subjects Receiving Both Vaccinations 
A subject is considered as having received both doses of trial vaccination per the randomized 
group assignment if a date of drug administration is given for the vaccination at Visit 1 and for 
the vaccination at Visit 3, and no major vaccine preparation or administration deviation is 
recorded. 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) 
An Adverse Event (AE) with onset either on the day of a vaccination, but after the vaccination or 
within the 28 days following a vaccination. Note that serious AEs are also considered treatment-
emergent after 28 days (see below). 
Serious Adverse Events 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) from first vaccination to last follow-up visit are considered 
as treatment-emergent regardless of the day of onset. 
AEs related to respiratory tract infections 
New AEs related to respiratory tract infections will be assessed and documented at all trial visits, 
including the FU Visits and are considered as treatment-emergent regardless of the day of onset. 
Adverse Drug Reaction 
An AE with either a ‘possible’, ‘probable’, ‘definite’ ‘unknown’ or ‘missing’ relationship to the 
vaccine (which means: “causally related”). 
Nominal Titer 
The MVA-BN-RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine is formulated at a nominal titer of 
5 x 108 Inf.U per dose (0.5 mL). The actual titer will be determined in stability testing.

Geometric Mean Titer and Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units 
The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) and Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units (GMSFU) are 
calculated by taking the antilogarithm of the mean of the log 10 transformed titers, and Spot 
Forming Units, respectively.  
(Sero)Negative and (Sero)Positive Results 
For each immunogenicity assay a negative result is defined as a titer below the DL, while a 
positive result is a titer equal to or above the DL. 
Response 
For each immunogenicity assay, a response to the vaccine (applicable only for post baseline 
visits) is defined as either the appearance of a positive result for subjects with a negative result at 
baseline (Visit 1), or an increase by a factor of at least 2 compared to the Visit 1 for subjects with 
a positive result at Visit 1. Response status is applicable only for V1b, V2, V3, V3b, V4, EAP 
Visit, and FU1 and FU2 Visits and is not calculated for subjects with missing Visit 1 titer. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific version Date: 31 -May-17
Page 9of 49The response rate at each post baseline visit is the percentage of subjects who have a positive 
response status out of the number of subjects with a non-missing response status (positive or 
negative) at that visit. 
Responder 
A subject is an ELISPOT Responder to the vaccine in a particular test agent (F pool, G(A) pool, 
G(B) pool, N pool, M2 pool, RSV Virus) if the subject has a response for at least two post 
baseline visits (V1b to V 4) within the same test agent. The responder evaluation applies only to 
subjects with at least two post baseline results available. 
The responder rate for each test agent F pool, G(A) pool, G(B) pool, N pool, M2 pool, RSV 
Virus) is the percentage of subjects who are responders to the relevant test agent out of the 
number of subjects with a non-missing responder status (positive or negative). 
Individual peak titer 
The individual peak titer is the maximum of titers recorded on V1b, V2, V3, V3b, V4, EAP 
Visit.
Fold Increase 
The fold increase is defined as a subject’s post-Baseline titer at Visit X, divided by the baseline titer.

1.1 Trial Description 
This trial is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase II trial in ≥ 55 
year old adults to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant MVA-BN-RSV 
vaccine. A total of 400 subjects will be recruited into five treatment groups in this trial (see Table 
2).

5 80 ≥55 0.5 Placebo Placebo IM
Total 400 
In general, subjects are stratified by age into two groups: ≥ 55 to < 70 and ≥ 70 years. However, 
during the staggering phase performed by the staggering site (sentinel cohort and safety cohort) 
only the younger age group is recruited. In order to have the best power to detect differences 
between the strata the aim is to achieve equally distributed recruitment across the age strata but 
at least 20 subjects per treatment group are required in the age stratum ≥ 70 years. 
The PBMC subgroup consists of 20 subjects per group recruited after the staggering phase. A 
total of three sites recruit all PBMC subjects.  
Recruitment into the trial is performed in a staggered manner. The staggering process is 
performed at one clinical trial site. The trial starts with a sentinel cohort with a total of 2 subjects, 
1 subject recruited into Group 2 and one subject into Group 4 (i.e. 1:1 subjects receiving Dose 1 
and Dose 2). Following a positive safety assessment for the subjects in the sentinel cohort, 
recruitment in the safety cohort starts. The safety cohort includes a total of 10 subjects, 5 subjects 
each into Groups 2 and 4 (i.e. 5:5 subjects receiving Dose 1 and Dose 2). Following a positive 
safety assessment for the subjects in the safety cohort, recruitment in all groups for the remaining 
subjects is opened. The open recruitment phase includes all treatment groups. The open 
recruitment phase randomization is stratified by age and site.

1.5 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is planned for this trial. 
1.6 Safety Monitoring Team 
The SMT is a board that oversees the safety of subjects participating in the trial during the 
staggering phase only. The members of the SMT are the national coordinating investigator, 
principal investigator (of the staggering site) and the medical monitors (BN and CRO) of the 
clinical trial. The primary responsibility of the SMT is to review and evaluate the accumulated 
trial data for safety after each staggering step and to make the decision to proceed to the next 
staggering step.  
1.7 Safety Monitoring Committee 
The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) is an independent board that oversees the safety of 
subjects participating in the trial. The primary responsibilities of the SMC are to periodically 
review and evaluate the accumulated trial data for participant safety, trial conduct and progress, 
and make recommendations to BN and the Coordinating Investigator and Principal Investigators 
(PI) concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial. A separate charter 
describes in detail relevant operational procedures, communication pathways  and roles and 
responsibilities of the SMC. 
If an event occurs which fulfills the trial halting rules, the SMC will review the event in a timely 
manner and will give a recommendation to BN and the Coordinating Investigator and PIs to halt, 
resume or terminate the trial participation of the affected subject and/or the trial as a whole.

Page 19of 496 The memory aid should be completed daily for an 8-day period (Day 0 to Day 7), starting with the day of vaccination. If symptoms are ongoing after 
Day 7, temperature/symptom measurements should continue each day until resolved and the last day of the symptom and maximum intensity will be 
recorded on the memory aid. 
7 The entries on the memory aid card need to be reviewed together with the subject. 
8 Only in the presence of symptoms indicating a respiratory infection at any timepoint after first vaccination, defined by any case of rhinorrhea, nasal 
congestion, pharyngitis, cough, wheezing (or increase in baseline wheezing), sputum production (or increase / change in nature of baseline sputum 
production) or new (or worsening of) shortness of breath. Subjects need to be instructed to return to the site within 3 days after start of symptoms.  
9 Subgroup only.  
10 Refer to Protocol Section 8.2.9 for Cardiac Assessment 
11 Nasal swabs will be taken from both nostrils.  
12 During the staggering phase, data from the memory aid need to be transferred to the Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) immediately for SMT (Safety 
Monitoring Team) review and the memory aid card will be returned to the subject to complete entries for the remaining days.  
13 Visit VS (Staggering Visit) is only required for the subjects in the staggering phase, i.e. sentinel cohort and safety cohort; the target week is named as 0S.

Page 20of 493. Statistical Methods 
3.1. Planned Sample Size  
A group sample size of 70 per group (recruiting 80 per group to account for a 12% dropout rate), 
and an assumed SD of 0.46 for the log 10 PRNT titers (A strain) will give 80% power to detect a 
relative change in titers from the Group 1 of a 66% increase.  
Assumptions used to determine the sample size of the trial are below. 
Testing of the primary objective will be performed by assuming that the log 10 of the titers 
are normally distributed.  
No adjustment for multiple comparison is considered. 
Testing will be conducted in a descriptive manner and no adjustment for multiple testing 
will be performed. 
The upper 95% confidence limit of the standard deviation (SD) of the log 10 titers from the 
Phase I trial RSV-MVA-001 at Visit 6 (2 weeks post second vaccination) was calculated as 0.46 (the SD was very similar in all groups). The SD is assumed to be similar to that 
observed in the RSV Phase I trial (RSV-MVA-001). 
3.2. Analysis Populations 
3.2.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
This is the subset of subjects who will have received at least one vaccination and for whom any 
post-baseline data are available. The primary analysis of safety and efficacy will be performed 
on this analysis set. 
In the case where a subject might receive the wrong randomized treatment, safety summaries for 
this subject will be based on actual treatment received. However, for a subject randomized to 
Group 2 or Group 4, and who received only one vaccination instead of two, safety summaries for 
this subject will be based on their randomized treatment group. 
3.2.2 Per-Protocol Set (PPS) 
This is the subset of subjects in the FAS who have received all vaccinations, completed all visits 
of the active trial phase (Visit 1 to EAP) and adhered to all protocol conditions. Subjects with 
major protocol violations will not be included in this dataset. However, subjects with only minor 
(not relevant) protocol deviations are included into this dataset.  
The decision whether a protocol deviation is major or not for the classification of subjects into 
the various datasets will be made on a case-by-case basis at the data review meeting (DRM) prior 
to database lock. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 21of 49Potential major protocol violations are (but are not restricted to): 
1. Premature discontinuation of the trial during the active trial phase (the question “did the 
subject prematurely discontinue the trial?” is answered with “yes” even where no other 
reason exists to exclude the subject from further participation in accordance with the 
protocol). 
2. Subject did not meet all of the inclusion criteria. 
3. Subject met one or more of the exclusion criteria. 
4. Withdrawal from the second vaccination. 5. Major vaccine preparation and administration deviation from specification as given in the 
protocol including cases where the subject fulfils at least one of the criteria specified in 
the protocol for withdrawal from vaccination. 
6. Major deviations of the visit window as determined during the DRM(s). 
7. Prohibited Prior or Concomitant Medication use. 
8. Missing immunogenicity data at any critical visits (the decision on what is a critical visit 
will be made at the DRM). 
9. Respiratory Viral Panel result positive for RSV A or RSV B. 
The main analysis of humoral and mucosal immunogenicity endpoints will be performed on the 
FAS. The same statistical procedures will also be applied to the PPS. If there is no substantial 
difference in FAS and PPS then only the FAS will be presented in the main part of the CSR. 
3.2.3 Immunogenicity Analysis Set (IAS) 
This is the subset of subjects in the FAS which was assigned to the PBMC subgroup. The main 
analysis of the cellular immunogenicity endpoints will be performed on the IAS. Additional 
subgroups may need to be defined during the DRM before database lock and would be described 
in the CSR. 
3.3. Data Definitions, Data Conventions and Handling of Missing Data 
3.3.1 Missing Immunogenicity Data 
Analysis of immunogenicity variables will be done on a valid case basis, i.e. for missing 
observations no imputation technique such as “Last observation carried forward” will be applied, 
since this could introduce an optimistic bias into the analysis. 
For assay results that are below the detection limit, refer to Table 1 : Detection Limits (DL) in the 
general definition section.

Page 22of 493.3.2 Missing Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Data 
In the case of incomplete AE and/or medication start and end dates, the following rules will be 
used to assign AEs to the correct vaccination period, and medications as prior/concomitant: 
For analysis purposes of any Prior and Concomitant Medication or any AE, imputation of partial 
start and end dates will be performed based on the following rules: 
† It is assumed that a missing month implies a missing day as well, and that a missing year implies a missing month and day. 
Partial/Missing Start Date 
If day is missing, then impute the 1st of the month as in the table above, but if the month 
is the same as the month of the first vaccination date then assign the imputed start date as the first vaccination date. 
If month and day are missing, then impute as above to January 1 unless the year is the 
same as the first vaccination date then assign imputed start date as the first vaccination 
date. 
If the date is completely missing, then impute the first vaccination date unless the end date indicates that the AE/medication could have started/been taken prior to this in which 
case the date is imputed to 1st January of the same year as the start date. 
Partial/Missing End Date 
If day is missing, then impute the last day of the month as in the table above unless the 
month is the same as the month of the first vaccination date then impute the end date as 
the last vaccination date. 
If month and day are missing, then impute as above to December 31 unless the year is the same as the first vaccination date then assign imputed end date as the last vaccination 
date. 
If the date is completely missing, check if AE/medication is ongoing before imputing a 
date and when the AE/medication started in relation to vaccination date. If the ongoing 
flag is missing, then assume that the AE/medication is still ongoing/medication is still 
being taken. In this case, do not impute the date. If the AE/medication stopped and the 
start date is prior to the first vaccination date, then impute the first vaccination date. If the 
AE/medication started on or after first vaccination date, then impute an end date which is 
one day after the last vaccination date. 
These imputation methods will be used for the table summaries. However, all listings will display the original dates as captured in the eCRF. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 23of 493.3.3 Assignment of AEs to Vaccination Period  
Each AE will be assigned to a vaccination period using date/time of vaccination and date/time of 
onset of the AE: 
All AEs starting at or after the first vaccination but before vaccination 2 (Visit 3) will be assigned to vaccination period 1.  
All AEs starting on or after the second vaccination but before or at EAP will be assigned 
to vaccination period 2. If the subject missed the second vaccination for any reason, the 
AEs will be assigned to the overall vaccination period. 
Any AEs starting after EAP up to the FU2 Visit belong to the FU period. 
If onset time is missing and start date of AE coincides with the date of a vaccination, the AE will be assigned to the vaccination period corresponding to the vaccination on this date. 
Each AE starting on or after first vaccination not matching the definition of a solicited AE is 
defined as an unsolicited AE. If a solicited AE begins outside of the 8-day period following the 
last vaccination it will be considered an unsolicited AE regardless of the preferred term (PT). If 
start time of the AE is missing and start date coincides with date of the vaccination, it will be 
regarded as a treatment-emergent AE. If the start date is (partially) missing the AE will be 
regarded as a treatment-emergent AE following the worst-case principle. 
Worst-case principle: 
To avoid a potential misclassification of an AE to a vaccination period or to the overall 
vaccination period, if an imputed start date corresponds to the first of the month or to the first of 
the year, and matches the month and year of the first or second vaccination date, then the AE will 
be assigned to the vaccination period with matching month and year. If the AE cannot be 
assigned to a vaccination period because of a (partially) missing start date then it will be only 
assigned to the overall vaccination period. 
3.3.4 General Considerations for AEs  
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 19.1 will be used for coding of 
AEs. 
Duration of an AE will be calculated as follows: 
For Unsolicited AEs: expressed in [days] 
End date – start date of AE + 1 day. Note that duration can be calculated even if time of 
day is missing for either start or end dates, or if time is missing for both. 
In case of partially missing start date (month and/or day missing) or partially missing end 
date (month and/or day missing), duration will not be calculated. 
In case of an ongoing AE, the duration will not be calculated. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 24of 49For Solicited AEs: expressed in [days] 
End date of AE – start date of AE + 1, where end date is the last day the symptom is 
defined as an AE and start date is the first day symptom is defined as an AE (no matter if 
the AE occurred at every day between first day and last day). In case of an ongoing AE, 
the duration will not be calculated. 
Relative day of onset between vaccination and start of AE will be calculated as follows: 
For Unsolicited AEs: expressed in [days] 
Start date of AE – corresponding vaccination date. 
In case of (partially) missing start date no calculation will be done. 
For Solicited AEs: expressed in [days] 
The relative day is calculated as the day of first symptom intensity recording > 0. 
Start date of AE – corresponding vaccination date, where start date is the first day a 
symptom is defined as an AE; vaccination day corresponds to Day 0.

Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 30of 49For all ELISA and PRNT titers descriptive statistics will be based on number of observations (n), 
Geometric Means, confidence intervals (CI), minimum (Min), median, maximum (Max). Other 
continuous measurements will be summarized using descriptive statistics (i.e., number of 
observations (n), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), Min, median, Max and categorical 
data will be summarized by means of frequency tables (i.e., count and percentages), if not stated 
otherwise. Unless otherwise stated, the Min and Max will be reported with the same number of 
decimal places as the individual values are recorded. CIs, Means, Medians, and SD will be 
reported to one additional decimal place. 
Descriptive statistics for the SFU values will be based on both the GMSFU and the median (with 
associated CI) and Min and Max. 
A non-parametric percentile based CI ( Hahn  G and Meeker W (1991) Statistical Intervals: A 
Guide for Practitioners, New York: John , 1991) will be placed around the median for each 
group, using the SAS UNIVARIATE Procedure, i.e.: 
PROC UNIVARIATE DATA=<dataset_name> CIPCTLDF; VAR SFU; BY GROUP; RUN; 
Repeated assessments/measurements and unscheduled assessments/measurements will be 
included in the Individual Subject Data Listing. All tables and listings will be sorted by 
scheduled visit with unscheduled visits listed in-between scheduled visits (and by subject, if 
appropriate). 
All tables will be presented by treatment groups. Solicited AEs will be presented by treatment 
and age group (≥55 to <70 and ≥70 years). For immunogenicity analysis, only PRNT strain A 
and ELISA IgA will be presented by treatment and age group (≥55 to <70 and ≥70 years). The 
remaining ELISA immunogenicity analyses will be presented by treatment group only. 
Summary by subject refers to summary of the overall period, e.g., the overall vaccination period,

Page 32of 493.5.4 Demographic and Other Baseline Data 
Demographics 
Descriptive statistics for the demographics will be produced for the FAS, PPS, and IAS. 
Continuous variables include: age at screening (years), height at screening (cm), weight at 
screening (kg) and BMI at screening (kg/m2). If there is a full rescreening then the information 
from the rescreening visit will be used. 
Age is presented as captured in the SDTM Subject Characteristics (SC) domain. Age is auto-
calculated from the eCRF where age is calculated as the difference between informed consent 
date and date of birth converted to years using the Joda-Time Java API and ISO8601 calendar 
system.   
Frequencies and percentages of subjects will be tabulated for the categorical variables gender, 
race and ethnicity in the same table by treatment group and overall. Percentages will be based on 
the total number of subjects in each table pertaining to the FAS, PPS, or IAS. 
The demographic listing will be presented for the FAS. 
Medical History 
A summary of medical history by SOC and PT per MedDRA 19.1 will be produced by treatment 
group for the FAS.  
A medical history listing will be presented for the FAS. 
Vaccine Assessment at Screening 
A listing of vaccine history and planned vaccination at screening will be presented for all 
subjects. 
3.5.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All prior medication will be listed by Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) class Level 2, 
Level 3, PT and Generic name per the September 2016 version of World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary (WHO-DD) for the FAS population. The listing “Prior medication” includes the 
medication data where end date is before date of first administration of trial vaccine. 
All Concomitant Medication will be summarized by ATC class Level 2 and Level 3 for all 
subjects in the FAS. A concomitant medication listing will also be presented for the FAS. The 
table and listing “Concomitant Medication” includes ongoing medication or medication with 
missing end date or with end date after date of first administration of trial vaccine, as well as 
medication starting after first administration. 
All listings will display the original dates as captured in the eCRF. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 33of 493.5.6 Compliance 
Compliance will be summarized for the FAS population with respect to: 
Number of subjects who received at least one vaccination 
Number and percentage of subjects who received vaccination 1 
Number and percentage of subjects with memory aid returned at vaccination 1 
Number and percentage of subjects who received vaccination 2 
Number and percentage of subjects with memory aid returned at vaccination 2 
Number and percentage of subjects who received both vaccinations 
Separate listings for vaccine administration and memory aid will also be presented. 
3.5.7 Immunogenicity Analysis ELISA, PRNT and ELISPOT 
All serum and nasal swab immunogenicity results will be listed for the FAS. Tables will be 
prepared for the FAS and the PPS. Immunogenicity results from PBMC samples will be 
summarized for the IAS population. 
Primary immunogenicity endpoint: PRNT (A strain) titers 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint is Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after one or two 
MVA-BN-RSV vaccinations or placebo measured by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test 
(PRNT; against strain A) 2 weeks post last vaccination. 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint will also be summarized descriptively using the 
geometric mean of fold increase, positivity rates (including associated 95% CI’s), and response 
rates (including associated 95% CI’s) for each treatment group, and by age group at each 
sampling point. 
In addition, the following descriptive comparison of the ratios of the GMTs and GMFI’s between 
treatment groups by visit will be calculated along with the corresponding 95% CI by assuming 
that the log10 PRNT (A strain) titers and log10 PRNT (A strain) Fold Increases are normally 
distributed: 
1. Group 2 / Group 1 – Two vaccinations compared to one vaccination using Dose 1 
2. Group 4 / Group 3 – Two vaccinations compared to one vaccination using Dose 2 
3. Group 3 / Group 1 – Dose 2 compared to Dose 1 using one vaccination 
4. Group 4 / Group 2 – Dose 2 compared to Dose 1 using two vaccinations  
5. Group 2 / Group 5 – Two vaccinations using Dose 1 compared to Placebo 
6. Group 4 / Group 5 – Two vaccinations using Dose 2 compared to Placebo 
As a secondary descriptive analysis for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, an ANOVA 
model (with dose and age group as independent variables) of the log 10 titers for the three doses 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 34of 49using Group 2, Group 4, and Group 5 will be performed. For Group 5 (2 vaccinations of 
Placebo), a dose value of 1 will be used to facilitate the log transformation of the dose. The dose 
response relationship will be explored in this analysis using linear and quadratic orthogonal 
contrasts. If the linear contrast (i.e. slope) of the regression fit is significant at the standard 
significance level of 0.05 then a dose response relationship will have been demonstrated. If the 
quadratic contrast is significantly different from zero then this will indicate that the dose 
response is not linear within the dose range used in this trial. Assuming the quadratic effect is 
negative over the higher dose ranges, then this will be seen as confirmation of a plateau effect in 
terms of responses for higher dose. This dose response ANOVA will be performed a second time 
without age group in the model.  
As an exploratory analysis, an ANOVA will be conducted on the log 10 titers using dose (2 
levels), the number of vaccinations (2 levels), and age group (2 levels) as main effects, and dose-
by-number of vaccinations as an interaction term. The main effect of dose (2 levels) will not 
include the placebo treatment group. To further explore whether baseline titers have an effect on 
dose, a similar ANOVA will be performed where the dependent variable of log 10 titers will be 
replaced with log 10 Fold Increase. 
All ANOVAs will be performed on the FAS only. 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
All other immunogenicity results (PRNT strain B, ELISPOT, ELISA IgG/IgA) will be 
considered as secondary descriptive analyses and will be analyzed similarly to the primary 
endpoint analysis (by age group results will be included for ELISA IgA only). Note that for 
secondary immunogenicity endpoints, ANOVAs will be performed only for PRNT strain B, IgA 
ELISA and IgG ELISA Total. The dose-response ANOVAs will be performed without age group 
in the model. 
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs)
For all ELISA and PRNT results the GMTs will be calculated by taking the antilogarithm of the 
mean of the log 10 titer transformations.  
Descriptive statistics will be derived by visit including number of observations, Min, median, 
Max, GMT, with 95% CI (derived by the antilogarithm of 95% CI of the log 10 titer 
transformations based on the percentiles of the t-distribution). 
Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units (ELISPOT) 
SFU/1 x 106 PBMC will be reported as whole numbers. Min and Max will be reported as whole 
numbers. Medians, GMSFUs, and CI will be reported to one decimal place.  
A non-parametric percentile based CI ( Hahn  G and Meeker W (1991) Statistical Intervals: A 
Guide for Practitioners, New York: John , 1991) will be placed around the median for each 
treatment group, using the SAS

Page 35of 49UNIVARIATE Procedure, i.e.: 
PROC UNIVARIATE DATA=<dataset_name> CIPCTLDF; 
VAR <SFU Variable>; 
BY <Treatment Group variable>; 
RUN; 
The calculation of the 95% CI for the Geometric Means will be based upon the assumption that 
the logarithm of the SFU has a normal distribution. 
Seropositivity rates 
RSV-specific ELISA and PRNT seropositivity rates will be presented by treatment group for 
each visit along with the Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs. 
Positivity rates (ELISPOT) 
Positivity rates will be presented by treatment group for each visit along with the Clopper-
Pearson 95% CIs. 
Response rates 
Response rates for RSV-specific ELISA and PRNT titers will be presented by treatment group 
for each post baseline visit along with the Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs. Response status is only 
applicable for subjects with a V1 (baseline) titer available. 
The same type of analysis of response rates will be conducted for the ELISPOT results and for 
IFN-γ and IL-4 results. 
Responder rates (ELISPOT) 
The responder rates (based on the total number of subjects with responder status available) will 
also be presented by group with exact Clopper-Pearson 95% CI. 
3.5.8 Adverse Events  
A summary table by vaccination period and Overall will be presented as an overview of local 
and general solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs. This summary table will present the number and 
percentage of subjects who had at least one event in each period as well as the corresponding 
total number of events for: 
At least one AE documented 
Any TEAE 
Non-serious TEAEs 
SAEs 
Related TEAEs 
TEAEs Graded ≥ 2 
TEAEs Graded ≥ 3 
Related TEAEs Graded ≥ 3 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 36of 49Related SAEs 
AEs leading to withdrawal from the trial 
AEs leading to withdrawal from second vaccination 
Deaths 
The Overall summary is the sum of Period 1 and Period 2 counts. 
A similar per subject table will be presented where each subject is counted once per their entire 
study participation. 
For the ATP and FU Phase, all AEs will be listed by subject, including SOC and PT for the FAS. 
Any AE with onset later than 28 days since the previous vaccination will not be included in 
summary tables but will be included in the listing and will be flagged accordingly as non-
treatment-emergent. 
According to the clinical trial protocol no new AEs should be reported during the FU Phase, 
except SAEs and AEs related to respiratory tract infections, but if any are reported then they will 
be listed but considered non-treatment-emergent and no statistical testing or summaries will be 
presented for them. 
Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs (solicited and unsolicited) with onset from first vaccination up to and including EAP 
will be summarized by SOC and PT by vaccination period. Related SAEs will be presented in 
similar fashion. SAEs which occurred during the FU Phase will be listed. 
Related Grade 3 Adverse Events 
All Grade 3 or higher related AEs will be summarized by vaccination period by PT for solicited 
AEs, and by SOC and PT for unsolicited AEs. Individual subject listings for Grade 3 or higher 
AEs will be presented. 
Solicited Local Adverse Events 
Solicited local AEs will be summarized by PT after each vaccination, and broken down by 
maximum intensity. The incidence (i.e., the number of subjects developing a specified solicited 
local AE on the day of vaccination or over the seven days after each vaccination divided by the 
number of subjects per respective vaccination period) will be calculated. The incidence will also 
be calculated for any solicited local AE for each vaccination period, the overall vaccination 
period, by treatment and by age group. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher AEs will also be 
calculated as well as the incidence of Grade 3 or higher AEs. 
The duration (in days) of the solicited local AEs will be summarized and presented in a listing. A 
similar table and listing will be presented for relative day of onset for solicited local AEs. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 37of 49All tables created for solicited local adverse events per vaccination period will be repeated but on 
a per subject basis, where subjects are counted once per each adverse event experienced. 
Solicited General Adverse Events 
Solicited general AEs will be summarized in the same manner as solicited local AEs. In addition, 
a summary table will be produced for general AEs by vaccination period with reasonable 
possibility of relationship to trial vaccine, where relationship is defined as either possible, 
probable, definite, or missing.  Also, the number of general AE events by intensity and 
relationship to trial medication will be presented by vaccination period. Each by vaccination 
period table will be repeated but on a per subject basis where subjects are counted only once per 
adverse event experienced. 
Pre-treatment Adverse Events 
AEs recorded after signing of the informed consent form but before the first administration of 
trial vaccine are considered pre-treatment AEs. These pre-treatment AEs will be presented in a 
subject listing. 
Unsolicited AEs 
Treatment-emergent unsolicited AEs in the active trial phase will be summarized by System 
Organ Class (SOC) and PT, and by vaccination period, and for overall. A similar table will be 
produced per subject. 
Separate tables for related treatment-emergent unsolicited AEs, graded ≥3 treatment-emergent 
unsolicited AEs, and related graded ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs will be presented by vaccination 
period and overall.   
The total number events and percentages of all treatment-emergent unsolicited AEs will be 
presented by intensity, relationship, and for related AE intensity. 
Non-treatment-emergent AEs will be flagged and included in the listing only, but will not be 
included in the summary tables. 
3.5.9 Clinical Laboratory Exams (Hematology, Chemistry) 
All measured hematology and chemistry values (and changes from baseline for continuous 
parameters) will be listed and summarized at each sampling visit using descriptive statistics 
(mean, SD, median, Min and Max). 
Summary tables will be produced for the number of high and low laboratory values at Screening 
Visit, Visit 2 and Visit 4 by hematology and chemistry parameter. Note that Hepatitis B and C 
testing, HIV testing, and Troponin I testing are only summarized at the Screening Visit. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 38of 49In addition, all clinical laboratory values outside the normal range will be listed by subject, 
gender, age and flagging of abnormal values (LN=Below normal range, HN=Above normal 
range) with their clinical significance. 
Shift tables will be used to evaluate categorical changes from Screening Visit to Visit 2 and 
Screening Visit to Visit 4 with respect to normal ranges (below LLN, Normal, above ULN) in 
hematology and biochemistry parameters. 
3.5.10 Vital Signs 
Measured vital sign values and changes from Baseline will be summarized at each applicable 
time point using descriptive statistics. All measured values will be listed.

Page 39of 493.5.11 ECGs 
ECG Central Assessment results of normal, normal variant, and abnormal will be summarized at 
Screening Visit, Visit 2, Visit 4, FU1, and FU2 Visits, as applicable. In addition, a similar table 
for abnormal ECGs as determined by the investigator as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant will be presented. 
All ECGs will be listed. 
3.5.12 Pregnancy Test 
Results of pregnancy tests will be presented in an individual subject listing. 
3.5.13 Physical Examination 
Subjects with abnormal physical examinations will be listed. 
3.6. Alterations in SAP from the Clinical Trial Protocol  
The following analysis items are deviations from the trial protocol: 
Section 7.1.1, RSV-specific ELISA, of the protocol states that “The GMT is calculated per 
visit as well as based on individual peak titers by taking the antilogarithm of the mean of the 
log 10 titer transformations. The Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) is calculated as (GMT at Visit 
X / GMT at Visit 1).” Per Bavarian Nordic instruction, this statistic will be deleted from the analysis, and replaced by the Fold Increase. 
Section 9.2, Sample Size Calculation, of the protocol states that “A secondary descriptive 
quadratic orthogonal regression of the log
10 titers for the three doses using Group 2, Group 4 
and Group 5 will also be performed.” and “In addition, an explorative two way ANOVA will 
be conducted on the log 10 titers using dose (2 levels) and number of vaccinations (2 levels) 
fitting both main effects and the interaction term.” In both regression analyses, age group will 
be added to the model per direction from Bavarian Nordic.  
RSV-specific memory B cells analyses are not covered in this SAP, but will be addressed in 
detail in an SAP amendment after further assay development.

 General Definitions  
Booster Vaccinated /Treated  Subjects  
A subject is considered vaccinated or treated once they have received any dose of the booster  
vaccination.  
Booster Study Day  
For this sub -study, t he day of the booster vaccination is defined as Day 0, the following as  Day 1, 
and so on. Equally, the day before the booster vaccination in the screening period is defined as 
Day -1, and so on. A new study day begins always at midnight regardless of the time of the 
booster  vaccination.  
Booster Baseline  
If not otherwise specified, “ booster baseline”  refers to the last measurement prior to  the booster 
vaccination , which is performed on booster visit ( BV) 1 (approximately 12 month s from the first 
vaccination in the main study) .  In case of missing vital event data at the first treatment visit, the 
booster screening  vital event  data may be used to impute baseline values . These  data will be 
summarized as baseline data without specif ying the visit from which the data were derived . 
However, in cases where no pre -treatment values exist for a baseline parameter, the subject will 
be considered as having no baseline, and post-baseline changes will not be able to be calculated  
and will be excluded from analyses . 
Main Baseline  
The main study baseline (described as “main baseline” in this document) refers to the last 
measurement before first vaccination with trial vaccine in the main study. This is either at Visit 1 
or at Screening Visit (or latest re -screening) as applicable.  
Booster Screening Phase  
Time period  from the booster screening  visit (BV0) until the booster vaccination visit  (BV1) .  
This could include any unschedule d visit s during the screening period up to the booster 
vaccination . 
Booster Active Trial Phase  (BATP)  
Time period covering from BV1 until the visit approximately 4 weeks later (Booster End of 
Active Phase ( BEAP )); whether this occurs at the final study visit or at an early termination visit ). 
This could include any unscheduled visits up until final visit of the booster active trial phase .  
This is also the vaccination period  of the booster sub -study .

Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 8 of 43 
 Booster Follow -Up Trial Phase   
Time period between th e BEAP and the final study v isit.  Note that for subjects who do not return 
for booster sub -study follow -up visits ( BFU), there may be no BFU phase data available.  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  (TEAE)  
A TEAE is an adverse event with an onset either on or after the day of the booster vaccination , or 
within the 28 days following the booster  vaccination.   Note that serious AEs are also considered 
treatment -emergent after 28 days (see below).  
Serious Adverse Events  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) from BV1 to the last follow -up visit are considered as 
treatment -emergent , regardless of the day of onset.  
Related AE or Adverse Drug Reaction  (ADR)  
Treatment -related AEs are defined as TEAE s determined  by the investigator  to be possibl y, 
probabl y, or definite ly caused by MVA -BN-RSV . TEAEs with an unknown or missing caus ality 
also constitute treatment -related AEs .  In case of missing causality assessments, a TEAE will be 
considered as related for the summaries.  
Nominal Titer  
The MVA -BN-RSV (Respiratory Syncytia l Virus) vaccine is formulated at a nominal titer of 
5 x 108 Inf.U per dose (0.5 mL). The actual titer will be determined in stability testing.  
Geometric Mean Titer and Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units  
The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) and Geometric Mean Spo t Forming Units (GMSFU) are 
calculated by taking the antilogarithm of the mean of the log 10 transformed titers, and Spot 
Forming Units, respectively.  
Detection Limit (DL)  
The limit from where a positive signal can be measured in immunogenicity assays.   Refer to 
Appendix 6.1 for DLs of the planned tests.  
(Sero)Negative and (Sero)Positive Results  
For each immunogenicity assay , a negative result is defined as a titer below the DL, while a 
positive result is a titer equal to or above the DL.

Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 9 of 43 
 Response  
For each immunogenicity assay, a response to the vaccine (applicable only for post baseline 
visits) is defined as either the appearance of a positive result for subjects wit h a negative result at 
baseline , or an increase by a factor of at least 2 compared to baseline  for subjects w ith a positive 
result at baseline . Response status is applicable only for  post baseline visits  and is not calculated 
for subjects with missing baseline  titer.  Main study response is defined based on the main 
baseline.  Booster sub-study response is defined based on the booster baseline.   Post baseline 
visits include Visit (V) 1b, V2, V3, V3b, V4, end o f active phase (EAP) visit, follow -up visit 
(FU) 1, and FU2 from the main study; BV1b, BV2, BEAP visit, BFU1 , BFU2  and BFU 3 from 
the booster sub -study.  
The response rate at each post baseline visit is the percentage of subjects who have a positive 
response  status out of the number of subjects with a non -missing response status at that visit.  
Responder  
A subject is an ELISPOT responder to the vaccine in a particular test agent (F pool, G(A) pool, 
G(B) pool, N pool, M2 pool, RSV Virus) if the subject has a re sponse for at least two post 
baseline visits ( V1b, V2, V3, V3b, V4 from the main study; BV1b, BV2  from the booster sub -
study ) within the same test agent. The responder evaluation applies only to subjects with at least 
two post  baseline results available.  
The responder rate for each test agent F pool, G(A) pool, G(B) pool, N pool, M2 pool, RSV 
Virus) is the percentage of subjects who are responders to the relevant test agent out of the 
number of subjects with a non -missing responder status.  
Individual peak t iter 
The individual peak titer is the maximum of titers recorded on V1, V2, V3, V4, and EAP visit 
from the main study, BV2 and BEAP visit from the booster sub -study .  Since V1b, V3b, and 
BV1b samples are only collected for the PBMC subgroup, they will  be excluded from the peak 
titer selection.  
Fold Increase  
The fold increase is defined as a subject’s post  Baseline titer at Visit X, divided by the baseline titer.   
Main study fold increase is defined based on the main baseline.  Booster sub -study f old in crease 
can be  defined based on the booster baseline or the main baseline .

 1 Introduction  
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) details the statistical methodology to be used in analyzing 
study data and outlines the key statistical programming specification s for the booster sub -study of 
clinical trial RSV -MVA -002.  It describes the variables and populations, anticipated data 
transformations and manipulations, and other details of the analyses not provided in the study 
protocol.  The SAP is written based on r ecommendations from ICH E3: Structure and Content of 
Clinical Study Reports , and ICH E9: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials .  Table, figure and 
listing shells are described in a separate document.  
The analyses described here are based on the final clinical trial protocol  RSV -MVA -002 Edition 
4.0 dated  April  26, 201 8.  Details for the analyses of the main study data are described in the final 
SAP dated May 31, 2017 and the SAP Addendum dated October 11, 2017.  This plan covers 
analysis details of data collected for the booster sub -study.  It will be followed completely for the 
analysis  of data derived from the sub -study .  If any unforeseen additional analyses are included in 
the clinical study report (CSR) they will be clearly described as additional, unplanned analyses.   
2 Trial Overview

Approximately one year after their first vaccination in th e main study, 86 subjects in two  selected 
treatment groups of the main study (Group 1 and Group 3) are planned to  be recruited to 
participate in the booster sub-study . They will receive a single booster vaccination  using the same 
MVA -BN-RSV dose they received during the main study.  Subjects will be followed up for 12 
months after their booster vaccination.   Out of these 86 subjects, approximately 26 will be 
recruited from the PBMC subgroup (approximately 13 subjects for each of the two selected dose

 groups ).  The selection of the treatment groups to be included in the booster sub -study is based on 
the results of the main study.  
2.2 Design Techniques to Avoid Bias  
Eligible subjects who have consented to participate in the booster sub -study will be enrolled until 
a total of 86 is reached .  PBMC sites will begin recruitment 1 -2 weeks prior to the remaining  sites 
to ensure 1 3 PBMC subjects  per treatment group .  Once 46 subjects are enrolled into one 
treatment group, enrolment for that group will stop to assure an approximately equal number of 
enrolled subjects in both treatment groups.  
2.2.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects in this booster sub -study will not be randomized.  They will get the same dose received 
during the main study.  
2.2.2 Blinding  
Subjects in the booster sub -study will not be blinded because they will get the same dose received 
in the main study , which has already been unblinded . 
2.3 Objectives  
2.3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the main study is  to assess the optimal dose and schedule of the 
MVA -BN-RSV vaccine in adult and elderly subjects in terms of immunogenicity.  
The objective of the booster sub -study is to demonstrate that the immune response of subjects 
previously vaccinated with MVA -BN-RSV vaccine can be boosted one year later with a single 
MVA -BN-RSV vaccination.  
2.3.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the main study are: 
• To assess safety and re actogenicity of the MVA -BN-RSV vaccine in adult/elderly subjects  
• To assess the RSV -specific humoral immune responses (in all subjects) and cellular immune 
responses (in a subgroup population of each group) against the MVA -BN-RSV vaccine in 
adult/elderly su bjects.  
• To explore a potential correlation of the RSV -specific immune response to RSV related 
respiratory disease symptoms.

Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 12 of 43 
 The secondary objectives of the booster sub -study are:  
• To assess the RSV -specific immune responses elicited by  the MVA -BN-RSV vaccin e (in 
subjects of the selected treatment groups) one year after the last vaccination in the main trial 
in adult/elderly subjects.  
• To assess the RSV -specific humoral immune responses (in subjects of the selected treatment 
groups) and cellular immune respons es (in the respective subgroup population of the selected 
treatment groups) of the MVA -BN-RSV vaccine following a one year booster vaccination in 
adult/elderly subjects.  
• To identify further potential differences in durability and/or boostability  of immune responses 
in the two chosen MVA -BN-RSV dose regimens.  
• To assess safety and reactogenicity of the MVA -BN-RSV vaccine following the booster 
vaccination in adult/elderly subjects  
2.4 Study Population  
In the main study, subjects were stratified by age i nto two groups: ≥ 55 to < 70 , and ≥ 70 years.  
At least 20 subjects per treatment group were  required in the age stratum ≥ 70 years.  
The booster sub -study will enroll  approximately 43 subjects from each of the two selected dose 
groups regardless of age sub groups.  
2.5 Inclusion Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects who completed all vaccinations of the main trial according to protocol in the selected 
dose groups and signed the booster sub -study informed consent are eligible to participate in the 
booster sub -study .  A list  of exclusion criteria  for the booster sub -study is provided in the study 
protocol.  Subjects are required to meet none of the exclusion criteria to enter the sub-study.  
2.6 Endpoints  
Primary and secondary endpoints for the main study are provided in the study  protocol and in the 
main study SAP and SAP Addendum.  Endpoints described in this section are relevant to the 
booster sub -study  only. 
2.6.1 Immunogenicity Endpoints

2.7 Interim  Analysis  
An interim topline analysis is planned when all subjects enrolled in the booster sub-study have 
completed the BFU1 visit .  Refer to Appendix  6.3 for the tables that will be provided for the 
interim topline analysis.  
3 Study Desig n  
Refer to the schedule of events in Appendix 6.2. 
4 Statistical Methods  
4.1 Planned Sample Size  
From two treatment groups selected based on immunogenicity/safety parame ters following 
primary vaccination, approximately 43 subjects will be recruited into the booster sub -study (86 
subjects in total).  Out of these 86 subjects, approximately 26 subjects (13 subjects for each dose 
group) will be recruited from the PBMC subgroup.  
Based on the variability observed in the log 10 titers for PRNT (A strain) 2 weeks after the second 
vaccination in the main study, the standard deviation (SD) is estimated to be 0.335 for the log 10 
titers 2 weeks after the booster vaccination . A total of 40 evaluable subjects per group will 
provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.213 (log10 -scale) at a significance level of 5% 
(two-sided), which corresponds to a ratio of 1.63 in GMTs.  Considering  a drop -out rate of 5% , 
43 subjects per group  will be enrolled to receive a booster vaccination.  
The sample size for the main study has been  initially estimated based on the need to detect a 
significant difference between the two doses to select the optimal dose  for further development .  
However, onl y a descriptive comparison is planned between the two dose groups in the sub -
study .   
The primary objective of the booster sub -study is to demonstrate that the immune response of 
subjects previously vaccinated with MVA -BN-RSV vaccine can be boosted one yea r later with a 
single MVA -BN-RSV vaccination.  When the sample size is 40, a paired t -test with a 0.025 one -
sided significance level will have >80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the difference in 
immune response (log 10 titers)  after the initial vaccination and that after the booster vaccination is 
0.08 or farther from zero when the expected difference is 0, assuming that the standard deviation 
of the differences is 0.168  (log10 -scale) .  This comparison is also considered descrip tive.

Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 15 of 43 
 4.2 Analysis Populations  
Two analysis sets are defined for the booster sub -study.  
4.2.1 Booster Full Analysis  Set (BFAS)  
This is the subset of subjects who received a booster dose of MVA -BN-RSV vaccine and for 
whom any post -booster data are available . 
4.2.2 Booster Immunogenicity Analysis Set (BIAS)  
This is the subset of subjects in the BFAS who were from the PBMC subgroup.  
Additional analysis sets may need to be defined during the d ata review meeting and would be  
described in the clinical study report.  
4.3 Data Handling Conventions  
4.3.1 Missing Immunogenicity Data  
Analysis of immunogenicity variables will be done on a valid case basis, i.e. for missing 
observations , no imputation technique such as “l ast observation carried forward” will be applied, 
since this could in troduce an optimistic bias into the analysis.  
For assay results that are below the detection limit, refer to Appendix 6.1.  
4.3.2 Missing or Partial Dates in Adverse Eve nt and Concomitant Medication Data  
In the case of incomplete AE and/or medication start and end dates, the following rules will be 
used to assign AEs to the vaccination  period and medications as prior/concomitant:  
For analysis purposes of any Prior and Con comitant Medication or any AE, imputation of partial 
start and end dates will be performed based on the following rules:  
Missing  Rule for start date  Rule for end date  Flag for imputation  
Day First day of month  Last day of month  D 
Month† January 1  December 31  M 
Year† Vaccination date  Last BATP visit date  Y 
† It is assumed that a missing month implies a missing day as well, and that a missing year implies a missing month and day.  
 Partial/Missing Start Date  
• If day is missing, then impute the 1st of the month as in the table above, but if the month is 
the same as the month of the booster  vaccination date then assign the imputed start date as 
the vaccination date.  
MVA -BN-RSV  Final Version 1.0  Statistical Analysis Plan  
Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 16 of 43 
 • If month and day are missing, then impute as above to January 1 unless the year is th e 
same as for the vaccination date then assign imputed start date as the vaccination date.  
• If the date is completely missing, then impute the vaccination date unless the end date 
indicates that the AE/medication could have started/been taken prior to this in which case 
the date is imputed to January 1 of the same year as the start date.  
Partial/Missing End Date  
• If day is missing, then impute the last day of the month as in the table above unless the 
month is the same as the month of the last BATP visit date then impute the end date as the 
last BATP visit  date.  
• If month and day are missing, then impute as above to December 31 unless the year is the 
same as the last BATP visit  date then assign imputed end date as the last BATP visit  date.  
• If the date is comple tely missing, check if AE/medication is ongoing before imputing a 
date and when the AE/medication started in relation to vaccination date. If the ongoing 
flag is missing, then assume that the AE/medication is still ongoing/medication is still 
being taken. In this case, do not impute the date. If the AE/medication stopped and the 
start date is prior to the last BATP visit  date, then impute with the last BATP visit  date. If 
the AE/medication started on or after the last BATP visit  date, then impute an end dat e 
which is one day after the last BATP visit  date.  
These imputation methods will be used for assigning AEs to the vaccination period, and 
medications as prior/concomitant .  Listings will display the original dates as captured in the 
eCRF.  
4.3.3 Assignment of AEs  to Trial Phase   
Each AE will be assigned to the booster active trial phase  (BATP)  or booster follow -up (BFU) 
phase  using date/time of vaccination and date/time of onset of the AE:  
• All AEs starting at or after the booster  vaccination but before the BEAP visit will be 
assigned to the booster active trial phase.  For subjects who missed the BEAP visit, AEs 
within the booster vaccination + 28 day will also be assigned to the BATP .   
• Any AEs starting after the booster vaccination but are not assigned  to the BATP  belong to 
the BFU period.  
If onset time is missing and start date of AE coincides with the date of vaccination, the AE will 
be assigned to the BATP . 
Each AE starting on  or after the booster  vaccination not matching the definition of a solicite d AE 
is defined as an unsolicited AE. If a solicited AE begins outside of  the 8 -day period following the 
booster  vaccination it will be considered an unsolicited AE regardless  of the preferred term (PT). 
If start time of the AE is missing and start date co incides with date  of vaccination, it will be

Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 17 of 43 
 regarded as a treatment -emergent AE. If the start date is (pa rtially) missing the AE will be 
regarded as a treatment -emergent AE following the worst -case principle.  
Worst -case principle:  
To avoid a potential mis classification of an AE to the BATP , if an imputed start date corresponds 
to the first of the month or to the first of the year, and matches the month and year of the booster  
vaccination date, then the AE will be assigned to the BATP . If the AE cannot be a ssigned to  
either phase because of a (partially) missing start date then it will be assigned to the BATP . 
4.3.4 General Considerations for AEs  
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 19.1 will be used for coding of  
AEs.  
Duration of an AE w ill be calculated as follows:  
For Unsolicited AEs: expressed in [days]  
• End date – start date of AE + 1 day. Note that duration can be calculated even if time of 
day is missing for either start or end dates, or if time is missing for both.  
• In case of partially missing start date (month and/or day missing) or partially missing end 
date (month and/or day missing), duration will not be calculated.  
• In case of an ongoing AE, the duration will not be calculated.  
For Solicited AEs: expressed in [days]  
• End date of AE – start date of AE + 1, where end date is the last day  in which  the 
symptom is defined as an AE , and start date is the first day in which the symptom is 
defined as an AE ( disregarding if the AE occurred continuously between first and last 
day).  
• In case of an ongoing AE, the duration will not be calculated.  
Relative day of onset between vaccination and start of AE will be calculated as follows:  
For Unsolicited AEs: expressed in [days]  
• Start date of AE – booster  vaccination date.  
• In case of (parti ally) missing start date no calculation will be done.  
For Solicited AEs: expressed in [days]  
• The relative day is calculated as the day of first symptom intensity recording > 0.

 • Start date of AE – booster  vaccination date, where start date is the first day a 
symptom is defined as an AE; booster vaccination day corresponds to booster

Descriptive statistics for the demographics will be produced for the BFAS and BIAS. Continuous 
variables include: age at booster screening  (years), height at main study  screening  (cm), weight at 
booster screening  (kg) and BMI at booster screening  (kg/m2).  If there is a full rescreening then 
the information from the rescreening visit will be used.  
Frequencies and percentages of subjects will be tabulated for the categorical variables gender, 
race and ethn icity in the same table by treatment group and overall. Percentages will be based on 
the total number of subjects in each table pertaining to the BFAS or BIAS. 
The demographic listing will be presented for the BFAS.  
Medical History  
A summary of medical his tory by System Organ Class ( SOC ) and PT per MedDRA 19.1 will be 
produced by treatment group for the BFAS.   A medical history listing will be presented for the 
BFAS.

Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 25 of 43 
 4.5.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prior medication will be listed by Anatomical -Therapeutic -Chemical (ATC) class Level 2, 
Level 3, PT and Generic name per the September 2016 version of World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD) for the BFAS population .  Prior medication is defi ned as  
medications with end date that is before date of first administration of trial vaccine  in the main 
study .  Medications taken since the last follow -up visit in the main study and have ended prior to 
the booster sub -study are only to be captured in ca se the concomitant medication is related to a 
SAE . 
All Concomitant Medication s taken during the booster sub -study will be summarized by ATC 
class Level 2 and Level 3 for all subjects in the BFAS. A concomitant medication listing will also 
be presented for the BFAS. The table and listing “Concomitant Medication” includes ongoing 
medication or medication with missing end date or with end date after date of administration of 
the booster vaccine, as well as medication starting after administration  of the booster vaccine . 
All listings will display the original dates as captured in the eCRF.  
4.5.6 Compliance  
Compliance will be summarized  and listed  for the BFAS population with respect to  number and 
percent age of subjects with memory aid completed . 
4.5.7 Immunogenicity Analysis  
ELISA, PRNT and ELISPOT  
All serum and nasal swab immunogenicity results will be listed for the BFAS.  Immunogenicity 
results from PBMC samples will be summarized for the BIAS population.  
PRNT (A strain) titers  
The primary analysis of the endpoint is Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after a single booster 
MVA -BN-RSV vaccination  measured by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT; against 
strain A) 2 weeks pos t vaccination.  
PRNT (A strain) tite rs will also be summarized descriptively using the geometric mean of fold 
increase, positivity rates (including associated 95% CI’s), and response rates (including 
associated 95% CI’s) for each treatment group, and by age group  at each sampling point .  In 
order to compare immune responses after initial vaccination in the main study and after booster 
vaccination in the booster sub -study, the summary will include data from all sampling points in 
the main study as well as thos e in the booster sub -study  for the  BFAS .  Fold increase  and 
respon se rates  in the main study visits will be based on the main baseline; fold increase and 
MVA -BN-RSV  Final Version 1.0  Statistical Analysis Plan  
Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 26 of 43 
 respon se rates  in the booster visits will be based on the booster baseline .  In addition, fold 
increase for post booster baseline time points will also be summarized based on main baseline .  
Descriptive comparison of the ratios of the GMTs and GMFI’s between  the two  treatment groups 
(Group 3 / Group 1) by visit will be calculated along with the corresponding 95% CI by assuming 
that the lo g10 PRNT (A strain) titers and log10 PRNT (A strain) Fold Increases are normally 
distributed:  
Pair differences in log 10 titer (main study log 10 titer - booster sub -study log 10 titer) and fold 
increase from booster sub -study at similar post -vaccination time  points will be calculated, as well 
as their 95% CI .  This will be presented as ratio and the corresponding 95% CI in the original 
scale .  Fold increase in the main study visits will be based on the main baseline; fold increase in 
the booster visits will b e based on the booster baseline .  
Other  immunogenicity endpoints  
All other immunogenicity results (PRNT strain B, ELISPOT, ELISA IgG/IgA) will be considered 
as secondary descriptive analyses and will be analyzed similarly to PRNT (A strain) titers .  Fold 
increases will not be calculated or analyzed for ELISPOT assays.  
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs)  
For all ELISA and PRNT results the GMTs will be calculated by taking the antilogarithm of the 
mean of the log 10 titer transformations.  
Descriptive statistics will  be derived by visit including number of observations, Min, median, 
Max, GMT, with 95% CI (derived by the antilogarithm of 95% CI of the log 10 titer 
transformations based on the percentiles of the t -distribution).  
Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units (ELISPOT ) 
SFU/1  x 106 PBMC will be reported as whole numbers. Min and Max will be reported as whole 
numbers. Medians, GMSFUs, and CI will be reported to one decimal place.  
A non -parametric percentile based CI ( Hahn , 1991) will be placed around the median for each 
treatment group . 
The calculation of the 95% CI for the Geometric Means will be based upon the assumption that 
the logarithm of the  SFU has a normal distribution.  
Seropositivity rates  
RSV -specific ELISA and PRNT seropositivity rates will be presented by treatment group for 
each visit along with the Clopper -Pearson 95% CIs.

for each post main study baseline visit and post booster sub -study visit along with the Clopper -
Pearson 95% CIs. Response status is only applicable for subjects with a baseline titer available.   
Response rates in the main study visits will be based on the main baseline; response rates in the 
booster visits will be based on the booster baseline.   The same type of analysis of r esponse rates 
will be conducted for the ELISPOT results (IFN-γ and IL -4 results ). 
Responder rates (ELISPOT)  
The responder rates (based on the total number of subjects with responder status available) will 
also be presented by group with exact Clopper -Pears on 95% CI.  
4.5.8 Adverse Events  
A summary table will be presented as an overview of local and general solicited AEs and 
unsolicited AEs  during the BATP . This summary table will present the number and percentage of 
subjects who had at least one event as well as the corresponding total number of events for:  
• At least one AE documented  
• Any TEAE  
• Non-serious TEAEs  
• SAEs  
• Related TEAEs  
• TEAEs Graded ≥ 2  
• TEAEs Graded ≥ 3

Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 28 of 43 
 According to the clinical trial protocol no new AEs should be reported during the BFU Phase, 
except SAEs, but if any are reported then they will be listed but considered non -treatment -
emergent and no summary  will be presented . 
Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs (solicited and unsolicited) with onset from booster vaccination  up to and including 
BEAP will be summarized by SOC and PT. Related SAEs and SAEs which occurred during the 
BFU Phase will be presented in a similar fas hion.  
Related Grade 3 Adverse Events  
All Grade 3 or higher related AEs during the BATP will be summarized by PT for solicited AEs, 
and by SOC and PT for unsolicited AEs. Individual subject listings for Grade 3 or higher AEs 
will be presented.  
Solicited Local Adverse Events  
Solicited local AEs will be summarized by PT after vaccination, and broken down by maximum 
intensity. The incidence (i.e., the number of subjects developing a specified solicited local AE on 
the day of vaccination or over the seven day s after vaccination divided by the number of subjects  
with memory aid completed ) will be calculated. The incidence will also be calculated for any 
solicited local AE by treatment group. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher AEs will also be 
calculated as well  as the incidence of Grade 3 or higher AEs.  
The duration (in days) of the solicited local AEs will be summarized and presented in a listing. A 
similar table and listing will be presented for relative day of onset for solicited local AEs.  
Solicited General Adverse Events  
Solicited general AEs will be summarized in the same manner as solicited local AEs. In addition, 
a summary table will be produced for general AEs with reasonable possibility of relationship to 
trial vaccine, where relationship is defined as either possible, probable, definite, or missing.  
Also, the number of general AE s by intensity and relationship to trial medication will be 
presented.  
Pre-treatment Adverse Events  
AEs recorded after signing the informed consent form , but before administra tion of the booster 
vaccine , are considered pre -treatment AEs. These pre -treatment AEs will be presented in a 
subject listing.

 Unsolicited AEs  
Treatment -emergent unsolicited AEs in the BATP  will be summarized by SOC and PT.  
Separate tables for related trea tment -emergent unsolicited AEs, Grade ≥3 treatment -emergent 
unsolicited AEs, and related Grade ≥3 treatment -emergent AEs will be presented.   
The total number of events and percentages of all treatment -emergent unsolicited AEs will be 
presented by intensit y, relationship, and for related AE intensity.  
Non-treatment -emergent AEs will be flagged and included in the listing only, but will not be 
included in the summary tables.  
4.5.9 Clinical Laboratory Exams (Hematology, Chemistry)  
All measured hematology and chemis try values (and changes from booster baseline for 
continuous parameters) will be listed and summarized at each sampling visit using descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, Min and Max).  
Summary tables will be produced for the number of high and low labor atory values at BV0 , 
booster baseline, BV2 and BEAP  by hematology and chemistry parameter.  
In addition, all clinical laboratory values outside the normal range will be listed by subject, 
gender, age and flagging of abnormal values (LN=Below normal range, HN=Above normal 
range) with their clinical significance.  
Shift tables will be used to evaluate categorical changes from booster baseline  to BV2  with 
respect to normal ranges ( LN, Normal, HN) in hematology and biochemistry parameters.  
Booster baseline is de fined as last available measurements prior to the booster vaccination.  This 
will be different from the booster screening measurement when the subject has missing screening 
value or has multiple screening values.

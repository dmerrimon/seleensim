1.1 Study  Objectives
The purpose  of the study is to determine if the dose of contrast administered for computed 
tomographic arteriograms  (CTA) can be reduced without degradation of image quality. The hypothesis is 
that there is no difference in image quality using ultra-low dose contrast in CTA exams compared to 
routine dose exams. 
1.2 Primary  Study Endpoints
The objective is  to prospectively evaluate image quality of CTA examinations performed with an ultra-
low contrast dose protocol. The primary endpoint would be to show that there is no statistical 
difference in the quality of the images.
1.3 Secondary  Study Endpoints
Not Applicable
2.0 Background  
2.1 Scientific Background  and Gaps
Currently, at  our institution, routine CTA examinations are obtained with a dose of 100mL of 
intravenous contrast.  In the setting of renal dysfunction, this dose is reduced to 75mL to minimize the 
risk of  contrast induced nephropathy. This dose can be further adjusted giving some flexibility 
depending on  the BMI of the patient and type of scanner used. Given the recent advancements of 
computed tomography hardware,  the scanning speed has greatly increased allowing for reduction in 
contrast dose.  However, at our institution, the dosage and administration rate of intravenous 
contrast has  not yet been adjusted to take advantage of improvements in scanning hardware.
2.2 Previous Data
A small  number of patients have been imaged with a decreased contrast dose (up to 60% less contrast 
volume). By taking  advantage of scanner speed and number of detectors, a smaller overall dose can be 
given while  still obtaining adequate diagnostic imaging. Quantitative measurements of vascular 
enhancement (in  Hounsfield units) at select locations show no differences in vascular opacification. In 
addition, qualitative  evaluation of these images by board certified diagnostic radiologists show no 
difference in  image quality between examinations performed with reduced contrast dose versus 
examinations performed  with standard contrast dose. This data suggests that the same quality of 
images can  be obtained with a lower dose of contrast minimizing the risk of contrast induced 
nephropathy. No  references are available at this time regarding the rate of re-imaging due to non-
interpretable CTA  studies. In correspondence with several CT technologists, they stated that in their 
experience, rarely  does a CTA of the chest or chest, abdomen and pelvis have to be repeated
2.3 Study  Rationale
CTA is  the imaging of choice for the evaluation of the aorta. Aortic CTAs are performed for evaluation of 
acute aortic  syndromes, vasculitidies, as well as chronic conditions such as aortic aneurysms and 
congenital anomalies.  Examinations are performed for pre-operative evaluation and post-operative 
follow up  in many of these patients. This patient population includes patients with many comorbidities, 
such as  hypertension and diabetes, as well as elderly patients. All these conditions contribute to renal 
dysfunction. For  this reason, the radiology department at this institution has a policy to evaluate renal 
function before  a contrast enhanced CT scan in the setting of increased age (>60 years), history of renal 
dysfunction or  diabetes. Decreasing the contrast dose is important to prevent further damage to the 
kidneys by  contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). It is thought that reducing the contrast dose will reduce 
STUDY00003932
Approval: 11/16/2018
Page 4 of  14 (V.08/18/2015) the risk  of nephropathy. Development of a low dose protocol would potentially decrease the risk of 
contrast induced nephropathy  in this patient population.  
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion  Criteria
3.1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Any  adult patient scheduled for a computed tomographic arteriogram (CTA) of the chest or CTA of 
the abdomen  or CTA of the chest and abdomen or CTA of the abdomen and pelvis or CTA of the 
chest, abdomen  and pelvis who had undergone a prior CTA of the same region performed with the 
standard contrast  dose (100 mL) at this institution will be included in the study.
2. The  follow-up scan will be routine standard of care, no emergency imaging patient will be 
approached for this research.
3.2 Exclusion  Criteria
1. Patients  with no prior CTA imaging for comparison. 
2. Any  pediatric patient (age <18). 
3. BMI  >40
4. Inability  to follow instructions.
5. Allergy  to intravenous contrast.
6. GFR  less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 – GFR should be within normal range. This would allow a repeat study if 
needed and not pose an increased risk to renal dysfunction.
7. Cognitively Impaired  Adults
8. non-English speaking  patients
9. Pregnant  Females
10. Endoleak  studies – decreased contrast makes evaluation of an endoleak difficult on delayed imaging.
3.3 Early  Withdrawal of Subjects
3.3.1 Criteria  for removal from study
Patient may  decline or withdraw from participation at any time after the consent is signed.
3.3.2 Follow-up for  withdrawn subjects
The information  required for the study is obtained at the initial time of evaluation. If a person 
declines to participate, no data will be acquired. There is no reason to follow up withdrawn 
subjects.
4.0 Recruitment  Methods
4.1 Identification  of subjects
Medical records of  adult patients scheduled for a routine computed tomography arteriogram will be 
evaluated prior  to CTA imaging to identify subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
4.2 Recruitment  process
Patients scheduled  for routine CTA examinations will be screened, via medical records, to find out if they 
have had a prior CTA of the aorta with routine dose of intravenous contrast within the past two years. 
Those patients within this group that meet inclusion criteria and do not have any exclusion criteria will 
be offered to participate in the study.

disclosures or releases of identifiable information granted under this waiver will be accounted for and 
documented.
7.0 Study  Design and Procedures
7.1 Study  Design
Any adult patient  scheduled for routine CTA meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and providing 
consent will  be included in the study. The patient will be administered a low dose of intravenous 
contrast based  on the study examination as described below. The contrast agent being used is 
Omnipaque. The  scan will be performed under the supervision of the primary investigator or the 
described team members  to make sure that the study is of diagnostic quality.
The following dose  protocols will be followed:
CTA of  the chest: 40 mL of intravenous contrast at a rate of 5mL/sec. A region of interest (ROI) to trigger 
the scan will  be placed in the aortic arch. If scan is performed using high pitch helical mode, the scan 
delay will be  increased by 2 seconds. 
CTA of  the abdomen OR or CTA of the chest and abdomen or CTA of the abdomen and pelvis or CTA of 
the chest,  abdomen and pelvis: 50 mL of intravenous contrast at a rate 5mL/sec. A region of interest 
(ROI) to  trigger the scan will be placed in the aortic arch. If scan is performed using high pitch helical 
mode, the scan  delay will be increased by 2 seconds.
All other  imaging parameters will remain unchanged, given that the subjects enrolled will be clinical 
patients of the  principle investigator.
Following the  examination, the primary investigator (PI) or team members will evaluate the images 
obtained with  low contrast dose and each patient’s prior CTA examination performed with routine 
contrast dose.  This will be done by quantitative and qualitative measures. For the quantitative portion, 
the PI  or team members will place regions of interest on predetermined arterial locations to obtain 
measure the  degree of opacification. For qualitative measurement, the images will be presented in a 
blind fashion  to two thoracic trained board certified radiologists and a board certified interventional 
radiologist to  determine the quality of the images based on a Likert numerical scale. Qualitative and 
quantitative data for the  images obtained with low contrast dose and those for the prior CTA 
examinations performed  with routine contrast dose will be compared. This data along with details of the 
STUDY00003932
Approval: 11/16/2018
Page 8 of  14 (V.08/18/2015) scan protocol (dose,  dose rate, scanning parameters etc.) and demographic data (such as sex, age and 
BMI at  the time of examination) will be recorded in Redcap. 
7.2 Study  Procedures
7.2.1 Clinic  Visit
The process of  obtaining the CTA images will be unchanged from the patient’s standpoint. One 
difference will be that the examination will be supervised by a team member. The intravenous 
contrast dose administered will be decreased according to the parameters written above.  If the 
study is deemed non-diagnostic at the time of scanning, the study will be repeated. The 
standard of care at this institution in the setting of a non-diagnostic study is to repeat the study 
with a 75mL dose of contrast, for a total of 175mL of contrast. Given that the dose of contrast 
that will be administered for this study (40-50mL) is below the routine amount (100mL). 
Performing a repeat study with 75mL of intravenous contrast will not exceed the contrast dose 
that would have been normally administered.

11.0 Risks
There is  a minimal risk of loss of confidentiality.
There is  a risk of increased radiation if the scan needs to be repeated due to a non-diagnostic clinical exam. If 
the exam  is non-diagnostic due to inadequate vascular enhancement, the examination will be repeated. This 
may lead  to an increased radiation dose to the patient. It is important to note that non-diagnostic studies can, 
and do  occur with the standard volume of contrast currently administered for these examinations. When this 
occurs, the  examination is repeated with a second standard or reduced dose of contrast.  Given the low dosage 
of intravenous  contrast of the planned low dose protocol, a repeat examination can be performed without 
exceeding the  standard of care contrast dose to the patient, 
12.0 Potential Benefits  to Subjects and Others
12.1 Potential  Benefits to Subjects
There is  no guaranteed benefit from participating in this study. Potential benefits to the patient include 
a decrease  in contrast dose which inevitably reduces the risk for development of contrast induced 
nephropathy.
12.2 Potential  Benefits to Others
Given the  increasing number of contrast enhanced studies performed in the hospital each day, the risk 
of contrast  induced nephropathy has theoretically increased. Specific populations of patients are 
susceptible to  contrast induced nephropathy. Avoidance of this complication by low dose examinations 
can preserve  renal function and potentially decrease hospital stay and health care costs.

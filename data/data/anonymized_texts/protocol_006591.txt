TITLE:  
A 6-Week, Randomized, Evaluator Blinded, in vivo  
within Subject Repeat Test to Evaluate the Irritation and Sensitization Potential of OmezaTM 
Collagen Matrix in Healthy Volunteers  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
OMZRIP1F  
OBJECTIVES:  
To assess th e sensi tization potential  of OmezaTM Collagen Matrix compared to that of a 
negative control (0.9% sodium chloride, NaCl) us ing 9 conse cutive continuous  applicat ions o n 
the back area over a 3 -week induction period, a 10 -17-day rest period, and a c hallenge  
phase of approximately 48 hours exposure with evaluations over 7 2 (+2) hours.  
The secondary objective is to assess the safet y of OmezaTM Collagen Matrix by m onitoring 
adverse events through out the study . 
POPULATION:  
A sufficient number of subjects  will be qualified for the  study to randomize approx imately 60 
subjects with th e intention that a minimum  of 50 subjects will comple te the challenge phase.   
STUDY DESIG N AND DURATION:  
The study de sign is based on a Modified Draize  Human Repeat Ins ult Patch Test. This is a  single 
site, evaluator -blind ed study us ing a within -subject randomized design. Each subject will 
receive  all inves tigational products at the  same t ime. The t rained skin evaluator and 
Investigator will be blinded to the identity of the test materials. The investigational products will 
be OmezaTM  Collagen Matrix an d a negative control (0.9 % aqueous so dium chloride). The  
study will inv olve repetit ive an d co ntinuo us patch applications of all investigational products 
to the same test sites on the back approximately 48 hours on week days and f or approx imately 
72-hour periods over weekends over 3 weeks, for a total of 9 induct ion applications. Sites o n 
the ba ck a rea wi ll be evaluated  by the blinded trained evaluator after each patch removal. 
Subjects will have a rest period of 10 – 17 days, foll owed by challenged applications of each 
investigational product to naïve  sites for a pproximately 48 hours. Eval uation s of the c hallenge 
sites will be made at  approximately 30 minutes, 24 ( +1), 48 ( +2), and 72  (+2) hours post 
removal. The study will require 1 5 visits to th e testing facility .  Total study duration after 
screening will be ap proximately 5 -6 week s for each subjec t.

DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
• Investigational Product  : 
 Approximately 0.2 ml of OmezaTM Collagen  Matrix  – Batch no. PVP8  
• Control  Product : 
Approximately  0.2 ml of 0.9% aqueous NaCl  
The patc h system  will be  patc h pads made f rom Webril ® and affixed with an occ lusive 
hypoallergenic tape , unless the ski n condition becomes sufficiently  irritated to r equire a 
change to a semi -occlusive  tape or even an open dressing, at the discretion of the 
investigator.   Additio nal t ape may be us ed to ensure patches stay adhered to the test sites.    
EVALUATION OF IRRITATION AND SENSITIZATION:  
All subjects will be evalu ated using the Sk in Irritation Sc ale: 
Inflammatory Responses:  
0 = No visible reaction  
+ = Slight, confluent or p atchy  erythema  
1 = Mild erythema (pink)  
2 = Moderate erythema (definite redness)  
3 = Strong erythema (very intense redness)  
Definition of letter  grades appended to a numerical grade:  
E     =  Edema - swelling, spongy feeling when p alpated  
P     =  Papu le - red, s olid, pinpoin t elevation  
V     =  Vesicle - small elevat ion containing fluid  
B     =  Bulla reaction - fluid-filled lesion (blister)  
S     =  Spreading - evide nce o f the reaction beyond the Webril pad area  
W    =  Weeping - resul t of a vesicular or bulla react ion - serous exudate  
I      =       Induration - solid, elevated, hardened, thickened skin  
Superficial Effects  
g     =  Glazing  
y     =  Peeling 
c     =  Scab , dried film of serous exudate of vesicular or bulla reaction  
d     =  Hyperpigmentation ( reddish -brow n discolorati on of test site)  
h     =  Hypopigmentation (loss of visible pigmentation at test site)  
f      =     Fissuring grooves in the su perficial layers of the skin  
All skin responses observed with the investigational pro ducts during the ind uction a nd 
challenge phase s will be reported.  Skin responses to eac h patch application will be 
examined and graded u nder light supplied by a 100 -watt  incandescent blu e bu lb.  The 
evaluator and Investigator will be blinded to treatment assignment and any p revious score s.  
The same individual will conduct all skin evaluatio ns of the test sites , but a qualified back -up 
individual will be available if need ed.   
Individual inves tigational products during the induction phase will be applied t o the assigned 
PRINCETON CONSUMER RESEA RCH: OMZRIP1F  29 Octo ber 2019  
Final Protocol   Page 7 of 23 skin site unl ess t he site react ions become so strong as to make it inadvi sable. If excessive 
irritation, (for example, a n umer ical score of 2 or greater) i s noted, that sit e wil l be 
discontinued from further patching  and a new site adjacent to the original site will  be used  for 
the rema inder of the required applications.  If excessive irritation occurs at the move  site, a 
second move  site may be used. Excess ive irritation at  the sec ond move site would require 
discontinuation of that investigational product . 
The challeng e pat ches  will be applied to naïve sites on the o pposite side of the back for 
approximately 48 hours. Challen ge sites will be evaluated  approximately  30 minute s, 24 (±1), 
48 (±2) and 72 (±2) hours after patch removal.  Evaluatio n of the test articles for t he po tential 
to se nsitize should include the  site scores as well as a narrative description of any reaction a nd 
an opinion from the investigator as to whether the re action is indicative of a contact 
sensitization.  
Phot os will b e taken of any reactions of conce rn and will b e shared with the sponsor  but will 
not be part of the final report . 
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS:  
Safety will be as sessed by monitoring of adverse eve nts re ported during the study.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Data from the individual patch sites is pre sente d in tabular format.  No statistical an alysis of the 
data will be  performe d. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
Based on prior experience with contact s ensitization studies in humans approximately 60 
subjects will be randomized to ensur e 50 subjects completi ng th e study.   There is no statistical 
calculation of sample size for this study.  
SITES:  
This study will be conducted at 1 site located in the United States .

Final Protocol   Page 10 of 23 1 INTRODUCTIO N, RATIONALE , AND OBJECTIVE S 
1.1 Intro duction 
1.2 Rationale  
This study design has been selected by the sponsor  to address comments provided by the FDA 
in order to aid in  identifying and eliminating any pot entia l irritants  or sensitization  in future 
produ ct development  and is based on a Modified Draize Human Repeat Ins ult Pat ch Test 
design . The Modified Draize Procedure1 is used as a predictive test for c ontact sen sitizati on in 
humans.  The procedure involve s the  application of a discontinuous series of mult iple occlusive 
patches to human skin over a three -week induction period.  Induction is followed by an 
approximate two -week rest period.  Challenge cons ists of a single a pplication to naive skin.

1.3 Objective  
To asses s the sensitization potential  of Omez aTM Collagen Matrix compared to  that of a 
nega tive control (0.9% sodium chloride, NaCl) using 9 consecutive continuous applications o n 
the back area over a 3 -week induction p eriod, a 10 -17-day res t period, and a  challen ge 
phas e of approximately 48 hou rs ex posure followed by evaluations over 72 (±2) ho urs. 

PRINCETON CONSUMER RESEA RCH: OMZRIP1F  29 Octo ber 2019  
Final Protocol   Page 11 of 23 The secondary objective is to assess the safe ty of OmezaTM Collagen Matrix by moni toring 
adverse events thro ughout the study. 
 
2 INVESTIGATIONAL PLA N  
2.1 Overall Study  Design  
This is an evaluator -blind ed study using a within -subject r andomized design. Each  subject will 
receive  all investigational products at the  same time. The trained skin evaluat or and 
Investigator will b e blinded to the  identity of the test material s. The i nvestigationa l products will 
be Omeza TM Collagen Matrix liquid and a negative contr ol (0.9 % aqueous so dium chloride). 
The study will inv olve repetitive and continuous  patch app lications of all investiga tional 
products approxi mately 48 hours on wee kdays and  for approxim ately 72 -hour perio ds ov er 
weekends over 3 weeks , for a total of 9 ind uction applications. Sites o n the back area will  be 
evaluated  by the blinded trained evaluato r after each patch removal . Subjects will have a 
rest period of 10 – 17 days, fo llowed by challenged application s of each investigational 
product to naïve  sites fo r approximately 48 hours. Eval uations of the challenge sites will be 
made approximately 30 minutes, 24 ( +1), 48 ( +2) and 72  (+2) hour s post rem oval. Total study 
dura tion aft er screening wi ll be approx imate ly 5-6 weeks for each subjec t.  
2.2 Randomization and Blinding Procedure  
To eliminate skin evaluator bias, the assignment of the test product  code s to the subject ’s test 
sites will be rand omized among t he subjects so tha t each t est product  code (see secti on 5. 1) 
occupies individual skin sites within the panel of test subjects with equ al frequency. The 
randomiz ation scheme will be provided by  the site .

4.1 Identity of Test Products  
The f ollowing tes t products will b e used on this study .  Test product  Cod e A will be provided by 
the Sponsor .  Test prod uct Code B  (negative control)  will be provided by Princeton Con sumer  
Research . 
Both PCR  Code s A and B wi ll be placed onto the patch pads at the quant ities listed above.  
These patch pads will be adhered to the application sites located on th e back and marked  
with a skin marker.  Additional adhesive tape may be used to ensure patc h contact wi th the 
skin. 
4.2 Test Product Storag e and Accountability  
Upon receipt, the tes t products will be inventoried and  stored at room temperature (about 15 -
30ºC). 
Physiological saline (0.9% A queous Sodium Chloride ) will serve as a negative control.  
Both products  will be place d on patches no more than  30 minutes before application . 
All application and removal of test materials will be recorded f or each subject.  
All unused test produc ts (excluding the negative control ) will be returned to  or destroye d 
following  Sponsor instructi on after  completion of the study.  
4.3 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
At the testing facility , a unique 3-digit  screening n umber will be assigned to ea ch subject after 
written I nformed Consent  is obtained. Subject  screening n umbers will be as signed sequentially 
at th e testing facility . Princeton Consumer Research  will develop  the randomization scheme. 
At Visit 2, a 2-digit  randomiza tion number will be as signed by Princeto n Consumer Research to 
each  subject in a  sequential mann er as they become  eligible for randomizati on. To eliminate 
any position bias, the assignment of the test product  codes  to the test sites will be randomize d 
amon g the subjects so  that each test product  code occupies individual s kin sites within panel 
of tes t subjects with e qual frequency .  The randomization number will corresp ond to a 
predetermined assignment design. Randomization numbers must not be re -used  once 
assigned, even if  the subject is not administered the test products . There will be n o 
replacemen t of subjects who  are withdrawn prior to completion of the study . Princeton

occlus ive tape  (approximately 4 x  4 cm)  and will be applied as per s tudy d esign and 
randomization scheme  onto designated  sites located on the back of each subject  unless the 
skin condition becomes sufficiently  irritated to r equire a change  to a semi -occlusive  tape or 
even an open dressing , at the discretion of t he investig ator.   
The patch es will be reinforced with additional non-irritating tape as deem ed necessary by the 
patch applicator .  Subjects will be instructed to keep all patc hes dry during showering so that 
the test sites are prot ected from accidental water exposure for the d uration of the study.   
Two test  sites located on one side of the paras pinal region  of the back  will be utilized for 
application. The assign ment of the te st pro duct  codes  to indiv idual skin sites will be 
random ized so that each test  product code occupies i ndividual ski n sites w ithin the panel of 
test subjects, with approximat ely equal frequency, in o rder to eliminate any position bias.  The 
sites of patch/te st pro duct application wi ll be marked by a skin marker so that the location of  
the patch  pad/applicati on site is cl early indicated for evalua tions.  
The test products will be  applied and removed by study personnel. The study will involve 
repetitive and cont inuous  patc h applications of all investigational product s, Code s A and B,  
appro ximately 48 hours on we ekdays and fo r approximately 72 -hour periods over weekends 
over 3 weeks , for a total of 9 induction applications . All application s for individual test products  
will be made to the same site unless reactions bec ome so stron g as t o mak e this inadvisable . If 
excessive irr itation, (for example, a numer ical score of 2 or greater) is noted, that site will be 
discontinued from further patching  and a new site adj acent to  the original site will be used for 
the remainder of the required applications  (move site 1) .  If excessi ve irritation occurs at the 
move  site, a second move  site may be used. Excessive irritation at the second move site would 
require discontinuati on of th at pa tch.  Residue on the skin from any test patch  will be removed 
by study  staff pr ior to skin evaluation (if observed)  by gently wiping the patch application  site 
with a moistened gauze pa d. 
Phot os will b e taken of any reactions of concern  and will be sh ared with the sponsor  but will 
not be part of the final report .   
4.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
Since all tes t products are to be administered in -clinic,  100% compliance is anticipated. 
Subjec ts are required to attend all visits . 
4.6 Blinding and Unb linding Method  
Study products will be adminis tered in a singl e-blinded fashion, i.e., the treat ment assignment 
will not  be known to the skin evaluator.  
 
5 SCHEDULE OF PROCEDUR ES AND ASSESSMENTS

 5.8 Protocol Deviatio ns 
This study is intended to be co nducted as describ ed in  this protocol. In the event of a 
significant deviation from t he protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake, the 
Principal Investigator m ust determine whether the subject should contin ue in t he study.  
 
6 DETAILED  DESCRIPT ION OF ASSE SSMENTS  
6.1 Infor med C onsent  
Written  Informed Consent  will be obtained fr om each subject before any s tudy procedures 
are perfor med. All potentially eligible  subjects for the  study will be given a copy of the 
inform ed cons ent form to read. The p rotocol wil l be discussed in detai l with each  potentially 
eligible subject. The study  subject must sign the I nformed Consent  form if he /she decide s to 
participate in the study. No study  procedures will be performed , or study prod ucts applied to 
any subject who h as not sign ed the I nformed Consent  form . 
6.2 Eligibility Review  
Princeton Consumer Research (PCR)  staff under the oversight of the Princi pal Investigator 
reviews e ligibility criteria at Visit 1.  Each  subject ’s elig ibility will  also be reviewed  prior to 
randomization.  
Scree n Failure : A screen failure is defined as a subject who was consented but who was not 
randomized. Screen failures may n ot re-screen for the study.  
6.3 Brief Examination of the Back  
A brief dermal exam ination of the subject ’s back will be conducted  by a trained associ ate 
and will consist of an evaluation of the dermal acceptability  of the skin for patching  after 
consent and p referably prior to moving  to the int erview .  Exclusive co nditions would include 
excessive hair, moles, tattoos, dermatologic al conditio ns, etc. 
6.4 Preg nancy  Tests  
Urine  pregnancy tests will be conducted at the testing facility  on women of childbearing 
potential  to confirm pregnancy status . 
6.5 Patch Application and Removal  
PCR staff wil l apply the patches according to the predetermined randomization schedule . 
Each test product  will remain on the skin for approximately  48 hours  on the we ek d ays and 72 -
hour pe riods ov er the weekend for the Induction p hase of the study  for a total of 9 indu ction  
application s.  App lication 1 will occur at Visit 1. At Visit 2 and every  day of patch removal,  
there should be an a pproximate  15-minute waiting per iod to let any erythema from p atch 
removal subside prior to the  skin evaluation . All remaining patch applications will occur 
follow ing the same randomization scheme as on Visit 1. 
For the Challeng e Phase o f the study, patches will be ap plied once and be wo rn for 
approximately 48 hours.  There will be an approximate 30-minute waiting period from patch 
removal prior to the first evaluation .  Subsequent evaluations will take place 2 4 (±1), 48 (±2) 
and 72 ( ±2) hours post challenge patch removal.  
All p atch prepar ation, application, removal , and evaluation times w ill be record ed on source 
documents .

6.6 Skin Assessments and Procedures  
All subjects will be evalua ted using the Skin Irritatio n Sca le: 
Inflammatory Responses:  
0 = No visible reaction  
+ = Sligh t, confluent or patchy erythema  
1 = Mild ery thema (pink)  
2 = Moderate erythema (definite redness)  
3 = Strong erythema (very intense redness)  
Definition  of letter g rades appended to a numeric al gr ade:  
E     =  Edema - swelling, spongy feeling when palp ated  
P     =  Papu le - red, solid, pinp oint elevati on 
V     =  Vesicle - small elevat ion containing fluid  
B     =  Bulla reaction - fluid-filled lesion (blister ) 
S     =  Spreading - evidence of the r eacti on beyond the Webril pad area  
W    =  Weeping - result o f a vesicular or bulla reaction -  serous exudate  
I      =  Induration - solid, elevated, hardened, thickened skin  
Superficial Effects  
g     =  Glazing  
y     =  Peel ing 
c     =  Scab, dried film of s erous  exudate of vesicular or bulla reaction  
d     =  Hyperpigmentation  (reddish -brown disco loration of test si te) 
h     =  Hypopi gmentation (loss of visible pigmentation at test site)  
f      =     Fissuring groove s in the sup erficial layers of the skin  
 
All skin responses observed during the i nduction and challeng e phases will be reported.  Skin 
responses to each pa tch application will be exa mined an d graded unde r light supplied by  a 
100-watt incandescent blue bulb.  The e valuator and Investigator will be bli nded to treatment 
assignment and any  previous scores.  Th e same individual will conduct all sk in evaluations o f 
the test sites , but a qua lified b ack-up individ ual will be availab le if neede d.   
Individual investigationa l products during the induction phase  will be applied to t he assigned 
skin site unless the sit e reactions become so strong as to mak e it inadvisabl e. If excessive 
irritation,  (for ex ample, a numer ical score of 2 or greater  or any grade(even 0 ) if appen ded 
with a letter grade  of E, P, V or B ) is noted, that site will be discont inued from further patching  
and a new site adjacent to the o riginal site wi ll be used for the remainde r of the  required 
applications.  If excessive irrit ation occurs at the move  site, a second move  site may be used.  
Exces sive irritation at the second move site would require di scontinuation of that patch 
material.  
PRINCETON CONSUMER RESEARCH: OMZRIP1 F                   29 Octo ber 2019  
Final Protocol   Page 19 of 23 
 The challenge pa tches will be applied to na ïve site s on the opposite side of the back for 
appr oximately 48 hour s. Challenge sites will be evaluated appro ximately  30 mi nutes, 24 (±1 ), 
48 (± 2) and 72 ( ±2) hours after patch removal.  Evaluation of the test articles for the p otential 
to sensitize shou ld includ e a review of the induction site s cores as well as the challenge site 
scores and a narrative description of any  reac tion observed at chal lenge will be recorde d.  
The opinion from the investigator as to whether the react ion is indicative o f contact 
sensitiz ation  will be documented in the study records and reported in the final report .  
Photos will be taken of any re actio ns of concer n and will be shared with the sponsor but will 
not be par t of the final report . 
6.7 Randomization  and/or Treatment Assignment  
To elim inate any position bias, the assignment of the  test product  code  to the test sites will be 
randomized among th e sub jects so tha t each test product  code occupies individual skin sites 
within the panel of test subjects wit h equal frequency.  
6.8 Assessment of Sensitization  
Subjects who  had all 9 i nduction patches and completed the challenge phase ( at least the 
24-hour po st ch allenge skin assessment) will be consid ered evalua ble subjects for the study. 
The Principal Investigator in consul tation with the irritation  grader will review all induction and 
challenge  scores recorded for all evaluable subject s.  The induction of d ermal  sensitization is 
determined by  enhancement of the skin reaction observed at Challenge  greater than tha t 
observed during Induction. Low grad e reactions observed during Induction,  but which are not  
observed at Challenge are considered to be irritant in  natu re. 
An erythematous and edematous reaction to the test article  (and none to the negative 
contr ol) during Challenge  is indicative of dermal s ensitization.   Usually  the skin irritation s core  
response is great er than  scores observed during induction  phase and often spreads outside of 
the pat ch site.   If sensitization is suspected , a full descr iption of the skin responses observed wi ll 
be document ed and reported in the final report . 
7 STATIST ICAL METHODS  
7.1 Randomization  
A computer -generated randomiz ation sc hem e wil l be used to obt ain a balanced allocation 
of each test code to each treatment site . 
7.2 Statistical Analysis  
Data from the individual pa tch site s will be  presented  tabular format.  No statistical analysis of 
the data will be  perfo rmed . 
 
8 ADVERSE  EVENT /EXPE RIENC E MONITORING  
8.1 Definition  
An Adverse Event/Experience  is any unexpected o r undesirable experience occurring  to a 
subject during a study, which may or may not be related to the test device. All adverse events 
will be recorded and reported acc ording to th e Sta ndard Operating Procedu res of Princeton 
Consumer R esearch . 
PRINCETON CONSUMER RESEARCH: OMZRIP1 F                   29 Octo ber 2019  
Final Protocol   Page 20 of 23 
 Events should be considered AEs if they:  
• resul t in discontinuation  from the study,  
• require treatment or any other therapeutic intervention,  
• require further dia gnostic evaluation (ex cluding  a repeti tion of the same procedure 
to confirm the abnormal ity), 
• are associated with clinical signs or symptoms ju dged by the Investig ator to have a 
significant clinical impact.  
An Adverse Event is not:  
• A surgical procedure  
• A situation where an unto ward ev ent did n ot occur, (e.g. a social hosp italization)  
• Baseline  conditions that have not worsened in severity or frequ ency  
Skin irritation  is expected and graded at Visits 3 – 23 and wil l not be reported as an adverse 
event unless it leads to withdrawal  from t he study.  
A Serious Adverse Event/Expe rience  is any adverse  experience occurring that results in any of 
the follow ing outcomes:  
* deat h; 
* a life -threatening adverse experience;  
* inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization ; 
* a persistent  or significant disability/in capacity;  
* a congeni tal anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical event/experi ences that may not r esult in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a serious a dverse experience when , based  upon 
appropriate medical judgment, th ey may jeopardize the  patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical  intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
An Unexpected Adverse Event/Experience  is any adverse event/exp erience  not listed in the 
current labeling fo r the test device.  
8.2 Follow-up 
Investigators should follow AEs until the event  has resolved, the c ondition has stabilized, is well 
characterized, or referred for appropriate medical managemen t, whichever comes fir st. 
Events and f ollow -up information occurrin g after the last visi t should be recorded in the source 
documentation. Inves tigators are not obl iged to solicit adverse events after a subject’s final 
visit, however, if an investigator lea rns of an SAE that is believe d to be p ossibly related to the 
study products, an SAE r eport form should be submitted.  
8.3 Notification  
The Sponsor w ill be notified of all adverse event/experiences. Any Serious or  Unexpected 
Adverse Event/Experience which occurs  during the study must  be rep orted pro mptly by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor and the r eviewing IRB, as applicable, within 24 hours of the 
information being repor ted to Princeton Consumer Research .

Final Protocol   Page 21 of 23 
 8.4 Severity  
Adverse events are first graded according to ser iousness and then  seve rity. 
The Invest igator will evaluate the seve rity of each AE. Adve rse events will be graded as  
Mild:   Awareness of sympto ms but easily tolerat ed  
Moderate:   Discomfort enough to interfere with but not prevent daily activity  
Severe:   Unable to perform usual  activity  
8.5 Relationship  
The Investigator will judge the likelihood that the AE was related to the study products 
acco rding  to the following crite ria 
Not related:  There is no temporal or causal rela tionship to the study products.  
Relat ed:  There is a possib le temporal  or causal rela tionship to the stu dy products.  
8.6 Action T aken and Outcome  
The Action Taken with study products f or every AE will be repo rted as either: Dose Not 
Changed, Dose Interrupted, or Dose Withdrawn. Other actions take n can include none, 
medication re quire d, or other intervention docu mented on the AE. The Outcome of each AE 
will be entered as either: Recovere d/Resolved, Recovered/Re solved with Sequelae, Not 
Recovered/Not Resolved, Fatal, or Unknown.  
 
9 INVESTIGATOR OBLIGA TIONS  
9.1 Ethical and Regu latory Cons idera tions  
This study will be cond ucted in accordance w ith GCP, Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations ( CFR), Part 50, Subparts A and B; Part 56, and the Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) of Princeton Consumer Resea rch and the study prot ocol an d protoco l amendment(s) if 
any.  
9.2 Instit utional Review Board  
The Principal Investigator will ensure that an appropri ately constituted Institu tional Review 
Board (IRB), in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 56, reviews and  approves the 
clinical  study befo re th e study is initiated. IRB app roval must refer to t he study by exact 
protocol title, number, and amendment  number, (if applicable),  identify the documents 
reviewed, and state the date of review.  
The Principal Investigat or will ensure that Omeza approve s any changes to the I nformed 
Consent ( IC) form  prior to submission to  the IRB.  
Should changes to the IC form become necessary during the st udy, the Principal Investigator 
will ensure that the protocol amendment and IC is approved by the IRB pri or to 
imple menta tion. The Principa l Investigator will ensure that p rotocol administrativ e changes 
have been reviewed by t he IR B. 
9.3 Informed Consent  
A properly e xecuted  and written IC, in compliance with 21 CFR Part 50 and HIPAA  
authorization, will be obtaine d from each  subject prior to enrol lment and the initiation of 
PRINCETON CONSUMER RESEARCH: OMZRIP1 F                   29 Octo ber 2019  
Final Protocol   Page 22 of 23 
 scree ning evaluati ons requ ired by this protocol. Consent fo rms will be written in language fully  
comprehensib le to the prospective subject.  Consent for photographs  of test sites will be 
obtained . 
9.4 Subject C onfid entiality  
All comm unications, reports, and subject score s will b e identified only by a coded number 
and/o r initials to mai ntain subject confi dentiality. All records will be kept confidential t o the 
extent permitted by law. If a waiver or au thorization  sepa rate from the sta tement in the IC is 
required for permitting acc ess to a subject’s medical records (e.g. HIPAA), the investigator will 
obtain  such authorization prior to enrolling a subject in the stud y. The Principal Investigator 
should ke ep a separa te lo g of subjects , codes, names, and addresses. Docume nts which 
iden tify the subject by name (for example, th e IC form) should be kept in strict confidence.  
Princeton Consumer Research  and its business ass ociates agree to keep all sub ject infor mation 
conf ident ial. Only coded, blinded data will be released. Data resulting f rom analyses will be 
entered into a datab ase that is  not accessible to the pu blic. Subject data will be identified 
only by the subject sc reen number, random ization number and i nitials,  not by any other 
annotat ion or identifying information. Princeton Consu mer Research  and its business 
associates will take every possible step to red uce the risk of releasing information to the public 
that wou ld enable subjects to be personally ide ntified.  
 
10 STUDY  MONITORING  
Monito ring visits may be made during t he study. The Principal Investigator will make a 
reason able amount of time available to the sponsor monitor on reasonable notice to assist 
with monitor ing.

Background:  
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease and people with T1D are at high -risk of both hyper - 
and hypoglycemia which can lead to severe acute and chronic complications. Due to the burden 
and complexity of managing T1D, the vast majority of people with T1D  do not reach the target 
HbA1c of <7% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association. Data from the T1D 
Exchange, which includes 64 diabetes centers, demonstrated that 69% of patients in the 
exchange had HbA1c levels of >7.5% [1] The benefits of optimal glycemic control are well 
documented, including significant reductions in micro vascular disease [2] and to a lesser degree 
macrovascular disease [3]. There are a multitude of barriers to improved glycemic control, 
including fear of hypoglycemia, particularly in those with hypoglycemia unawareness, which can 
lead patients to under -dose insulin despite the known benefits of improved glycemic control [4, 
5]. In addition to fear of hypoglycemia, the process of determining the correct insulin dose is 
challenging and can lead to errors. Ahola et al. found that 64% of patients miscalculated their 
prandial insulin need, of ten resulting in repeated hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia  [6]. Severe 
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can have significant consequences, including hospitalization. 
Data from the T1D exchange demonstrated that 11.8% of adults had one or more severe 
hypoglycemic events and 4.8% developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the prior 12 months 
[7], with an even higher rate of DKA in children [8].  
 
Achieving optimal glycemic control requires frequent glucose monitoring by finger -stick and/or 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in combination with either multiple daily injection (MDI) 
or insulin pump therapy, or most recently, with an artificial pancr eas (AP) system. AP systems 
automate insulin delivery based on CGM values to minimize hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, 
and in some cases also deliver glucagon to prevent and treat hypoglycemia. AP systems have 
been tested extensively in both the inpatient a nd outpatient settings [9-14]. In a multi -center 
study by the AP@home consortium, adults with type 1 diabetes completed two months each of 
insulin pump therapy and sensor -augmente d pump with AP use from dinner to waking up in a

 cross -over design [15]. This study was the first to show a reduction in HbA1c, with a reduction 
of -0.2% between conditions favoring the AP system (p=0.047). In a study by Thabit et al, 24 
adults and 16 adolescents each participated for 2 months with  use of sensor -augmented pump 
therapy during the day and for half of the nights used an AP system overnight and the other 
nights continued sensor -augmented pump therapy [13]. Mean HbA1c for participants was 8.1%. 
The use of the AP system improved time in target range overnight by 18.4% (61.2% vs 73.2%, p 
= 0.0004), improved mean glucose by 14.4 mg/dL (p=0.0013), and had no impact  on time <70 
mg/dL (1.7% vs 1.7%). In a subsequent study, Thabit et al. showed that for 58 adults with T1D 
who used a single -hormone AP over 12 weeks, better glucose control and lower hypoglycemia 
were observed as well as a reduced HbA1c ( -0.3%) compared w ith sensor -augmented pump 
therapy [14].  
 
These studies have proven that AP systems are safe, but they have only demonstrated modest 
reductions in HbA1c in the patient populations that have been  studied thus far. It is very likely 
that a reduction of HbA1c of 0.2 -0.3% is not sufficient to reduce hyperglycemia -related 
complications. As a comparison, long term complications were significantly reduced in the 
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [2] in the case where peoples’ HbA1c levels were 
lowered by 2% in the intensively treated gro up as compared to the conventional group. 
Additional data is clearly needed to identify which populations will most benefit from AP 
systems. The intent of this pr otocol  is to target a high-risk patient population and determine the 
most effective treatment options .  
 
The study described within this protocol is designed to test the efficacy of a new insulin -only 
closed -loop al gorithm  using a model predictive control (MPC) framework  that will incorporate a 
new feature to handle meals that are consumed without a pre -bolus of insulin called the Robust 
AP (R -AP) system . Model predictive control (MPC) is a control strategy whereby a model is 
used to predict the response of a system to a receding horizon of inputs.  MPC uses the model to 
predict how the system will respond to current and future inputs and selects an optimal control 
output based on how well the predicted output of the system matches an optimal control 
trajectory. The power of MPC is in its predictive ability such that systems, which have very long 
response times, can be modelled to avoid over or under -delivery of control outputs of the MPC 
algorithm  to the system  which thereby lead to instability.  An early paper describing an approach 
to MPC using a glucoregulatory model was Hovorka et al. [16]. This group has gone on to use 
MPC within their single -hormone control system, which has been evaluated clinically [14].  The 
group at University of Virginia developed an MPC for use within an AP [17] and they have 
published results on this algorithm within  a multi -center trial [18]. The Padova group has also 
done work on MPC algorithms within an AP including an algorithm that uses an auto -regressive 
model that adapts over time called a run -to-run algorithm [19].   
 
The robust R -AP system used in this protocol has be en designed to handle a variety of real -world 
scenarios that are critical to a high -risk patient population . We will test how well the new 
algorithm  handl es missed or inaccurate meal announcements . This type of algorithm may 
significantly improve glucose control over the standard model predictive control (MPC) closed -
loop algorithm  without these new algorithm features for patients with type 1 diabetes.

 Primary Objectives:  
• To evalu ate performance  of the OHSU Robust R -AP closed -loop system as measured by 
area under the curve  (AUC)  in the 4 hours following first meal period, versus t he OHSU 
MPC closed -loop system.  
• To evalu ate performance of the OHSU Robust R -AP closed -loop system as measured by 
percent of time with sensed glucose between 70 – 180 mg/dl  in the 4 hours following the 
first meal period , versus the OHSU MPC closed -loop system . 
Secondary Objective:  
• To evalu ate performance of the OHSU Robust R -AP closed -loop system versus the 
OHSU MPC closed -loop system  in the 4 hours following the first meal period , as 
measured by other glycemic outcomes.  
Study Hypothesis:  
We propose that the use of the OHSU Robust R -AP closed -loop system as compared to the 
OHSU MPC  closed -loop system  will decrease AUC and increase the time in range  as measured 
by sensed glucose values.   
 
Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint:  
• Incremental AUC  of postprandial glucose in the 4 hours following the start of first meal.  
AUC (mg/dL *min ) will be calculated using a trapezoidal method  [20], which  sums all 
CGM values in the 4 hour period following the meal  above the starting glucose.  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose between 70 – 180 mg/dl  in the 4 hours following the 
start of first meal.  
Secondary Endpoints  (all measured in the 4 hours following the start of meals) :  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose <70 mg/dl across the study duration  
• Number of carbohydrate treatments (defined as 15 or 20 grams of carbohydrate)   
• Number of provider -administered insulin injections  due to hyperglycemia   
• Mean sensed glucose  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose <54 mg/dl  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose >180 mg/dl  
• Percent of time with sensed glucose >250 mg/dl  
• Mean amount of insulin delivered per day (in units/kg)  
Study Type  
This i s a single -center , crossover trial designed to compare the glucose control resulting from the 
use of the OHSU Robust  R-AP system  as compared to the OHSU MPC  AP system.  
 
Study Population  
IRB 23343 Protocol v5       [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Date: January 31 , 2022  
   
4 | P a g e  
 Study population will be adults with type 1 diabetes, ages 18 – 65 years of age . Younger 
participant s are excluded as it is appropriate to assess safety first in the adult population. Fifteen  
participant s will be recruited to participate in studies.   
 
Power Analysis  
This study is to obtain feas ibility and assessment of variability in the primary outcomes that will 
inform a future larger, sufficiently powered efficacy stud y. A sample size of 15 is a feasi ble 
number to recruit and complete the study in timely fashion. This sample size will allow ad equate 
estimation of the outcomes and variability of those estimates.  
 
Protocol Summary:  
Participant s will undergo two visits at OHSU  that will evaluate missed meal bolus detection .  
Participant s will arrive at approximately 7am for all visits , be monitored through the afternoon 
and discharged before dinner . See Figure 1  for a diagram of the study flow.  During each of these 
intervention visits, participant s will wear an Omnipod to deliver insulin and a Dexcom G6  CGM 
to measure glucose.  The closed loop system will receive activity data through a Polar M600 
watch worn by the participant. The studies will test the abil ity of the system to adapt to a missed 
meal bolus. For one missed meal bolus study, glucose will be controlled using the Rob ust R -AP 
closed -loop mode.  During the other missed meal bolus study, glucose will be controlled using 
the MPC closed -loop mode.  For the R -AP study, p articipant s will eat self selected meals at 10 
am and 2pm . The 10am meal will be the only meal given duri ng the MPC study . The 10am meal 
will be the same  across both arms. A meal bolus will not be given before any meals.

Visit Procedures  
IRB 23343 Protocol v5       [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Date: January 31 , 2022  
   
7 | P a g e  
 Negative COVID -19 screening is required f or face -to-face visits.  Study staff will perform 
COVID -19 screening on all participants and participant households, to ensure that there is no 
COVID -19 or COVID -19 symptoms.  OHSU COVID -19 policy provides the option to complete 
visits virtually in order to  minimize face -to-face contact with participants.  
 
Screening (Visit 1)  
Screening will take place within 12 weeks prior to the 1 week run -in period (Visit 2).  All 
screening visits will take place at OHSU’s Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute 
(OCTRI) outpatient clinic, the Biomedical Engineering Point of Care (BME POC) Laboratory or 
at the Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center. This visit will take approximately 1.5 hours.  
 
The participant  will be sent the consent form prior to the screening by email so that they can 
have time to read it fully at their leisure and prepare any questions they might have. Upon arrival 
and prior to any procedures, study staff will explain the study, give the participant  ample time to 
ask questions and consider par ticipation, and ensure that the participant  voices their 
understanding of the informed consent and study requirements. To minimize the possib ility of 
coercion and to ensure that participant  is signing the appropriate version of the consent, an 
informed con sent checklist will be used by study staff. After the participant  has signed the 
consent,  a copy of the consent/authorization form will be given to the participant . The original 
will be kept for the source document.  
 
A capillary blood glucose (CBG) will be obtained and measured by a Contour Next glucose 
meter and recorded after consenting. Prior to measurement of any blood samples, the meter will 
undergo quality control testing with two different glucose levels, one high  and one low, and both 
values must fall within the accepted range for a meter to be used.  
 
Study personnel will review medical history, and medications. Height, weight, pulse, and blood 
pressure will be obtained.  A study investigator will perform a physical examination, excluding 
breast and pelvic exams. Individuals of child -bearing potential w ill take a urine pregnancy test, 
which must be negative to participate.  A venous blood sample will be taken for the following 
tests: hemoglobin A1C, complete blood count, complete metabolic set (including creatinine, liver 
set, and electrolytes).  If a pa rticipant had any of these labs drawn with in the last 6 months and 
results are available for review within Epic or CareEverywhere for the study investigat or to 
review, than those labs do not need to be drawn at the Screening Visit. A study investigator wi ll 
assess inclusion/exclusion criteria and may review the participant ’s medical record for 
clarification as needed.  Participants will complete a hypoglycemia awareness questionnaire.  
The participant’s insulin pump, and if applicable glucose sensor, may b e downloaded at the time 
of the screening visit to assess the participant’s insulin settings. A three -digit participant ID 
number will be assigned to the participant .   
 
Dexcom CGM insertion visit  
The purpose of this visit is to have the participants learn how to insert the Dexcom G6 CGM 
device. This visit will take 30 -60minutes. This visit can occur directly after the screening visit if 
all screening criteria are met OR anytime within 12 weeks of t he screening visit. After arrival at 
IRB 23343 Protocol v5       [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Date: January 31 , 2022  
   
8 | P a g e  
 the OHSU OCTRI outpatient clinic, the Biomedical Engineering Point of Care (BME POC) 
Laboratory or Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center clinic, women of childbearing potential 
will receive a urine pregnancy test if t he last pregnancy test was more than 7 days prior.  This 
test must be negative before further participation is allowed.  
 
Participant s will receive training on how to use and calibrate the Dexcom G6 CGM system . The 
wire glucose sensor is sterile and commerc ially available from DexcomTM and will be used for 
single use only as directed by the manufacturer.  Participant s will be trained to insert the sensor 
into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen or flank after appropriate preparation of the 
abdominal skin as per the manufacturer’s directions.  Participant s will be trained how to pair the 
Dexcom G6 transmitter to the  Dexcom app on a provided study smart phone  to start and stop a 
new sensor session and how to enter calibrations. The CGM alerts will be set at 70 mg/dL and 
300 mg/dL. Participants will be given a Dexcom G6 transmitter and sensor to insert the day 
before e ach treatment visit along with a Contour Next meter for measuring their capillary blood 
glucose. The transmitter and sensors can be given to the participant at the CGM insertion visit or 
delivered via courier.  
 
To reduce the risk of COVID -19 and to comply with OHSU modified operations, sensor 
insertion visits can be completed using Webex  video conferencing software . Study devices , 
including a urine pregnancy test,  will be delivered to participants via a courier. Using the Webex 
platform, study staff can con nect virtually with participants for training on the devices and study 
procedures while they are at home.  
 
1 day Treatment Visits  
Participants will be asked to check  glucose from CGM at 2am each morning before their 
treatment visit. I f the CGM value is above 150 mg/dl, participants will be asked to enter this 
value into his/her pump calculator and take 80 percent  of the correction bolus.  The participant  
will be asked to check his/her glucose  before driving to the clinic and to bring a snack in the car 
in case hypoglycemia does occur (in which case, the participant  must park and treat the 
hypoglycemia).  After the first treatment visit, the washout period will be 3 to 30  days calculated 
from the day of admission until th e start of the next admission.   After arrival at the OHSU 
OCTRI outpatient clinic, the Biomedical Engineering Point of Care (BME POC) Laboratory or 
Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center clinic at approximately 7am, women of childbearing 
potential will receive a urine pregnancy test if the last pregnancy test was more than 7 days prior.  
This test must be negative before further participation is allowed.  
 
An assessment will take place at the beginning of the participant’s first closed -loop study. We 
will inquire whether the participant has h ad changes in their medications and/or medical history 
to confirm the participant hasn’t developed any study exclusion criteria.  A capillary blood 
glucose (CBG) will be obtained and measured b y a Contour Next glucose meter .  When they 
arrive, participant s will be given 15 -20 grams of oral carbohydrate if the CBG reading is less 
than 70 mg/dl.  CBG values > 300 mg/dl will be managed at the discretion of the investigator 
with a correction bolus  and s erum ketones will be checked.  If serum ketones are ≥ 0. 6 m M, the 
study will not be started  and insulin therapy will be guided by the onsite investigator.

During each  visit, glucose will be controlled using either: 1) the OHSU Robust R -AP closed -
loop mode or  2) the OHSU MPC  closed -loop mode . The order of the visits will be randomized. 
A code team is available by page at all times  in all locations . 
 
An Omnipod will be filled with Novolog or Humalog  insulin for all studies . The Omni pod will 
be primed and inserted into the skin of the participant ’s abdomen or flank as directed by the 
manufacturer.  Participant s will disconnect his/her own pump and remove his/her own insulin 
infusion set once insulin delivery  has started via the Omnipod. Participants will wear a Polar 
watch to inform the controller . The research staff will initialize the system and begin the closed -
loop study. Two staff will review each of the settings to confirm the settings are inputted 
correctly. A member of the study staff will remain with the participant  for the duration of the  
study with the study investigator on call. Research staff will set up and run the system and 
respond to all alerts.  
 
The algorithm will push data up to a cloud server that can be monitored remotely every 5 
minutes. The iPancreas  will generate alerts on the smartphone according to Appendix D. In order 
to push alerts to study coordinators and study investigators, the cloud server used for remote 
monitoring will have a drop down menu for study staff to sign in and out for the durati on of their 
monitoring shift.   Each study coordinator and investigator listed in the menu will have a cell 
phone number on file that can receive texts with pushed alerts.  
 
During all studies, sensed glucose data will be wirelessly transmitted via BTLE fr om the 
Dexcom G6 transmitter to the insulin -delivery algorithm every five minutes.  The insulin -
delivery algorithm will calculate insulin doses and will run on a Samsung  smart  phone. The 
smart phone will wirelessly communicate via BTLE to a PDM communicati ng to an Omnipod 
for automated insulin delivery . Participant s will wear a Polar watch for collecting heart rate and 
accelerometry data. The Polar watch transmits this data to the smartphone controller via 
Bluetooth. iPancreas will convert the heart rate an d accelerometry data into an estimated energy 
expenditure.  
 
If at any time the study staff determines that a sensor can no longer be used, a new sensor will be 
inserted. If the participant ’s blood glucose is < 70 mg/dl or is experiencing symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, he/she will be instructed to treat with 15 grams of carbohydrates . Glucose tablets 
will be provided to the participant s.  
 
For participant  safety, if a sensor value is not available for 20 minutes or communication with 
the Omni pod is lost for  more than 30 minutes, the insulin Omnipod will begin insulin delivery 
according to a pre -set basal profile(s) inputted for the participant  at study start. When this occurs 
for a lost sensor, the iPancreas  system will activate a predictive low glucose susp end feature if 
the last known sensor value was within the range of 70 -140 mg/dl and predicted to fall below 90 
mg/dl within thirty minutes or if the sensor glucose is less than 70 mg/dl. Maximum insulin 
suspension time is 2 hours. Prediction of sensor gluc ose is based on linear regression of the prior

 ten minutes of sensor glucose data. When communication with the sensor or Omni pod is 
restored, the system will automatically resume, updating the IOB accordingly.  
 
After a run -in period of 2 hours  whereby the participants are using the AP algorithm s, 
participants  will eat self selected meals around 10 am. During the R -AP study only, another meal 
will be given four hours later around 2 pm. The self selected meals will have a minimum of 45 g 
of carbo hydrates , and a maximum of 120 g of carbohydrates . These self selected breakfasts will 
be identical across both study sessions . Participant s will not enter a meal bolus for the meals.  
CBG and blood ketone measurements will be taken every 30 min (for safety  purposes only, not 
for input into the AP systems)  until study discharge . If CBG >250mg/dL before the lunch meal, 
then study will be stopped early and the participant will be given the option to return on a 
different day for the second meal.  
 
The study will be stopped if:  
(1) the CBG reaches > 300 mg/dL with ketones > 0.5 mM,  
(2) the CBG reaches > 300 mg/dL for over an hour (even when ketones are <0.5 mM),  
(3) the CBG reaches > 450 mg/dL,  
(4) participants exhibit nausea or vomiting or both.  
The Robust -AP system will  use the Missed Meal Detection algorithm to identify a missed meal 
bolus. If the R -AP system detects a missed meal, the system will send an alert to the user 
indicating that a meal was detected, and the system will also return the estimated carbohydrate 
content of the detected meal. The user will be required to acknowledge this alert. The user can 
modify the carbohydrate content that was estimated by the R -AP system. Then the R -AP will use 
that carbohydrate content to calculate a meal bolus, which will then  be dosed by the R -AP 
system via insulin pump as described in the equation below . A study investigator will evaluate 
the meal insulin dose prior to delivery, considering insulin -on-board and time since meal 
consumption, and the investigator will modify the  insulin dose if needed for participant safety. 
Otherwise, if stopping procedures (1) -(3) are reached, the study investigator will calculate a meal 
bolus with correction dose as in the equation below. The final dose that is delivered to the 
participant wil l be adjusted if needed by a study investigator considering insulin -on-board, time 
since meal consumption, and CGM trend. The investigator will check the Omnipod site and 
determine if the insulin should be delivered via the Omnipod, syringe, or via the par ticipant’s 
own insulin pump after it is reconnected. The study team will monitor the participants CGM  
levels and ketones will be checked every 30 minutes until ketone levels are less than or equal to 
0.2 mmol/L. Participants will be provided with plenty of water to drink to avoid dehydration. 
Additional subcutaneous insulin doses will be given approximately every three hours to treat 
hyperglycemia at the investigator’s discretion.  Participants will be evaluated by investigator for 
possible transfer  to the  emergency room if ketone level is 3.0 mmol/L or higher or earlier at the

 Participants can be discharged after 4pm when: (1) CBG >80 and < 250 mg/dl, (2) ketones ≤ 0.2 
mM and (3) the participant is feeling well . For values outside this range, t reatment wi ll be at 
the discretion  of the study investigator. Participants will be given a snack to take with them for 
the trip home. Participants will also be advised to monitor their glucose for any symptoms of 
hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, before their next meal, and at bedtime.  
 
Disch arge from clinic  
The study will be terminated and the participant ’s own insulin pump will be restarted. The study 
investigator will consult with the participant  regarding appropriate insulin dosing for the 
remainder of the day. The Polar watch, Omnipods an d Dexcom sensor will be removed from the 
participant . All infusion sites and the sensor site will be inspected for signs of irritation or 
infection. In addition, the sensor will be inspected for the possibility of breakage or fracture. If 
there is any evid ence of sensor breakage, it will be recorded. If an area of inflammation of 1 cm 
or greater exists around the point of insertion, a de -identified photograph will be taken of the 
area and the participant  will return 1 -3 days later for a follow -up visit.  
 
If a study visit is stopped prematurely, such as due to technical problems, the participant  will be 
asked if they can repeat the study visit that was terminated early with additional compensation 
provided. Repeating the study visit will be optional.  
 
Hypogl ycemia Treatment Guidelines  
• CBG < 70 mg/dl  
Give 15 grams of oral carbohydrate.  
Repeat treatment every 15 minutes as needed to raise blood glucose ≥70 mg/dl.   
• Presence of STUPOR, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS, or SEIZURE  
Give 1 mg glucagon IM  
Verify that insulin is turned off.  
Further management per study investigator.  
 
Cleaning and Disinfecting  
All devices will be cleaned and disinfected between participant s.  The smart phone, Dexcom G6 
transmitter  and Omnipod PDMs are cleaned by study staff.   Technicians who are disinfecting 
units will wash hand s thoroughly and wear gloves.  All items will undergo intermediate -level 
disinfection using Oxivir TB  disposable wipes. The disinfectant will be applied and allowed to 
air dry . After disinfection, when the units are completely dry, they will be placed in a sealed bag 
labeled with  participant  information.  
 
Stopping Rules   
Individual study stopping rules  
The closed -loop study will be stopped and open -loop control will be resumed under the guidance 
of the on call study investigator if any of the following occur after the start of the  study: 1) 
IRB 23343 Protocol v5       [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Date: January 31 , 2022

 capillary blood glucose falls to < 40 mg/dl at any time point, 2 ) serum keton es are above 1.5 mM 
at any time and 3 ) seizure or unconsciousnes s associated with hypoglycemia .  
Entire study stopping rules  
Triggers for reporting unanticipated problems are seizure, hospitalization, death or any other 
occurrence considered s erious by the PI. If any studies are stopped for severe hypoglycemia or 
diabetic ketoacidosis, then the entire study will be halted. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as 
event that required the assistance of another person due to altered consciousness, and re quired 
another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis is classified as: symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or 
vomiting, serum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or moderate/large urine keton es, either arterial blood 
pH<7.3 or venous pH<7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15, and treatment provided in a health care 
facility. If an event of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis should occur, the study will 
be halted and a description of the serio us adverse event and a new risk mitigation plan will be 
submitted to the FDA. The study will only resume once FDA approval is received. In addition, if 
there is any unexpected event such as death or patient hospitalization, the studies will be stopped 
until the root cause is evaluated.  
 
Description of the MPC  and R -AP algorithms  
Our MPC algorithm uses a glucoregulatory model to predict glucose outcomes  over a predicted 
horizon (Np) , and mathematically so lve for the optimal insulin doses across the control horizon 
(Nc) to bring the participant to target.  The model is  updated  at each timestep  by a Kalman filter, 
which uses the difference between CGM observations and model predictions to update the 
physiolog ic model states .  In short, a model -predictive controller uses a physiologic model to 
calculate how much insulin is required to bring s omeone to glucose target, and these predictions 
are adapted to the specifi c participant using a K alman filter.   
 
The R -AP is a modified MPC algorithm. A new feature in the algorithm includes a model for 
missed meal insulin detection.  The model includes estimations for carbohydrate consumption 
based glucose patterns to determine if that person has consumed a meal wit hout announcing it to 
the system. We refer to this algorithm as Missed Meal Insulin Detection. Our Missed Meal 
Insulin Detection algorithm is unique in that it presumes that the patient will generally announce 
their meals to the system. However, if the par ticipant does not announce, the algorithm will 
detect it using machine learning methods, and then adjust dosing based on this detected meal.  
 
Statistical methods  
The primary study endpoint s are (1)  incremental  area under the curve (AUC)  of glucose in the 4 
hours following unannounced meals and (2) percent of time with glucose sensor 70 -180 mg/dL. 
The hy pothesis to be tested is the R -AP closed -loop system will increase time in range and 
decrease AUC as compared to the MPC -AP closed -loop system. We will estimate the difference 
between systems using a fixed effect in a standard 2x2 crossover model with a random 
participant effect. While we do not anticipate statistically significant effects for the following, we 
will also control for sequence (AB o r BA) and period (1 or 2).  
 
IRB 23343 Protocol v5       [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Date: January 31 , 2022

 We anticipate that the primary outcomes will be approximately normally distributed. We will 
review the appropriateness of this assumption using both goodness -of-fit tests and diagnostic 
plots, such as quantile -normal plots. If the normality assumption holds, possibly with a 
transformation of the outcome, we will test the difference between the robust -AP and standard 
MCP visits using a paired t -test. In the case of mild departures from normality or unequal 
variances at the two ti me points, we will re -analyze the primary outcome as the difference 
between the two visits  using bootstrapped standard errors, which avoid distributional 
assumptions. We will use two -sided tests at the 0.05 level of significance.  
 
Missing data : Missing sensed glucose values will be interpolated for up to 30 min segments. 
Longer periods of missing data will be omitted if they represent <3% of observation time (which 
will be truncated if a participant leaves the study early). If the missing data are >3% of 
observation time, we will use available CBG values to interpolate or impute using 
measurements. In the case that >2 participants fail to complete the study, we will analyze the 
primary outcome under multiple imputation using baseline values.  
 
Confidentiality and Protection of Human Subjects  
RISKS and BENEFITS  
Risks:  The risks of the protocol procedures are considered minor. Nonetheless, since pumps and 
sensors used within automated glucose control systems are imperfect, there is a risk for 
hyper glycemia and hypoglycemia  All studies will have frequent glucose and ketone samplings 
and a member of the study staff will be present for studies with a study investigator on call at all 
times.  
Rarely, there can be allergic responses to insulin, such as skin redness, hives, itching of the skin, 
swelling of the mouth, or breathing difficulties. The se reactions are considered very unlikely.  
There is a small risk of sensor fracture, and in such a case, a piece of the sensor could be left in 
the tissue after sensor removal. For this reason, the study investigator will inspect each removed 
sensor for the possibility of breakage or fracture. Any evidence of sensor breakage will be 
recorded and reported to FDA and the sensor company . 
 
Benefits:  The participant  may not directly benefit from being in this study; however, their 
participation may help to advance automated insulin delivery technology.  
 
COSTS :   
Participant s will receive $ 340 for completion of all study visits.  If a participant  withdraw s early 
from the study, compensation will be given as follows: $40 for the run -in visit and $150 for each 
of the 2 study visits . There is no compensation for the screening visit. If a participant  is asked to 
repeat a study due to technical problems, he/she will receive an additional $ 150.    
 
Monitoring Entity:  
This investigation will be monitored by the co - investigator Leah Wilson MD. Dr. Wilson has no 
commercial interest in any of the companies which manufacture any of the devices used in this

 study. Drs.  Jessica Castle, Peter Jacobs and Joseph El Youssef are inventors on patents regarding 
the algorithms.  
 
Data Collection:  
Participant  privacy will be protected by using a three -digit identifying number to code study 
documents. All paper source documents wil l be kept in a locked cabinet for a minimum of five 
years. All data from the study files on the smart  phone master controller will subsequently be 
entered into the authorized elec tronic OCTRI  Cloud database.  
 
Recording of Data:  
Investigators and staff will record data collected during the clinical trial on the CRF’s. The CRFs 
will include:  
• Screening form  
• G6 Training Visit  
• First Closed -loop Study Assessment  
• First Closed -loop Study Visit  
• Second Closed -loop Study Visit  
• Adverse Event form  
• Serious Adverse Event form  
• Concomitant Medications  
The Principal Investigators may authorize other personnel to make entries in the CRF.  
 
The coded data collected during this study will be used for analysis of the primary and secondary 
endpoints listed in this protocol. The key to the code for this study will not be stored in the 
repository and only named study members on this project will h ave access to the key for this 
study. Researchers who request data from the repository will not receive any identifiers aside 
from date and we do not anticipate that the date will allow those researchers to re -identify the 
data. However, some of the resear chers named on this project may use the data from the 
repository which would mean that the repository data will still be potentially identifiable to those 
who have access to the key as part of this project. The coded data will also be stored in the 
OregonA PC repository according to IRB protocol 19858.  During screening, all new participants 
will sign the consent form to store their study data in the data repository. The data to be collected 
includes: (1) glucose sensor data, (2) blood glucose data, (3) insu lin data, (4) physical activity 
data, and (5) food data. All data, except for blood glucose, is aggregated by the iPancreas  app. 
The blood glucose data is collected through downloading the Contour Next BG meters and 
exporting data as an excel file. There a re no biological specimens collected during this study.

(Seoul, 2008), and 64th (Brazil, 2013) General Assemblies. The  investigator will ensure that the 
study described in this protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles, the 
protocol, current FDA regulations, ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines, loc al ethical and regulatory requirements, including the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), 
any IEC requirements relative to clinical studies.  
Should a conflict arise, the investigator will follow whi chever law or guideline affords the 
greater protection to the individual participant . The investigator will also ensure thorough 
familiarity with the appropriate use and potential risks of use of the study device, as described in 
this protocol, prior to the initiation of the study.  
Unanticipated problems will be detected by reviewing descriptions of known or foreseeable 
adverse events and risks in the IRB -approved research protocol and the current IRB approved 
consent form, any underlying disease or conditions of the participant  expe riencing the adverse 
event, a careful assessment of whether the adverse event is related or possibly related to the 
participant ’s participation in the study.  
 
Any adverse event (AE) and/or unanticipated problem (UP) will be reported to the investigator 
monitor immediately by one of the investigators. Hypo - and hyperglycemia will not be 
considered AEs unless participant  has positive ketones or displays symptoms of hypoglycemia 
such as: loss of consciousness, slurred speech, hospitalization or EMS services ca lled.  One of 
the investigators will always be on -call during the closed -loop studies and will write up a 
description of the adverse event/unanticipated problem. All reportable new information (RNI) 
will be reported to the IRB within five calendar days aft er the PI learns of the event. RNI is any 
information that might meet the regulatory definition of an unanticipated problem involving risks 
to participant s or others or serious or continuing noncompliance that might impact the criteria for 
IRB approval. Th e report will be submitted to the IRB by the principal investigator or study 
coordinator. A summary of all UP's and adverse events, including those that do not meet the 
requirement for RNI, will be submitted with the continuing review. The FDA will be noti fied of 
any unanticipated adverse event related to the use of the study device. Notification will be made 
within 10 days after the Principal Investigator becomes aware of the event.  
 
Confidentiality Procedures:  
To protect confidentiality, standard institut ional practices will be followed as described in the 
OHSU Information Security and Research Data Resource Guide 
(http://ozone.ohsu.edu/cc/sec/isg/res_sec.pdf) to maintain the confidentiality and security of data 
collected in this study. Study staff will be  trained regarding these procedures. See IRB protocol 
19858 for a complete description of the confidentiality and security of the study data collected 
during this study to be stored in the OregonAPC repository.  
Data for this project will be stored in an A WS server developed by our group that has undergone 
a security review.  
Paper files will be stored in locked filing cabinets in restricted access offices at OHSU. After the 
study, source documents will be maintained at the participating clinical center (or offsite record 
storage facilities) 2 years after a marketing applicatio n is approved for our group's decision 
support device or discontinuance of pursuit of marketing approval.

2 Missed_meal_detection
_alert:  This alert triggers 
if the Missed Meal 
Detection algorithm 
detects that carbohydrates 
were consumed 
approximately 25 minutes 
ago. The user 
acknowledges the 
alert and either 
doses insulin or 
declines that  a 
missed meal.  
 
20 minutes have 
passed since the 
alert trigger.  The missed meal 
detection alert 
will trigger if 
glucose is rising 
rapidly and the 
prior 
carbohydrate 
intake is indicated 
by the algorithm.  
The algorithm 
presumes the 
meal was 
consumed 25 
minutes prior to 
the tr igger.  The 
alert will expire 
after 20 minutes 
from triggering.  “Your 
glucose 
appears 
to be 
rising.  
Did you 
consume 
a meal 
that you 
want to 
dose 
insulin 
for?”

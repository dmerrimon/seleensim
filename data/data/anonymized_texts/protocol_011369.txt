Amendment  7: 11 O ctober 2022  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment change  
The purpose of the amendment 7 is to shorten the safety follow -up period to 6 months in 
subjects who have not reached the 6 -month safety follow -up after the last dose, at the 
time this amendment takes effect , as the comprehensive safety data in this popula tion 
indicates that the safety of the trial participants is not jeopardize d and does not pose any 
meaningful threat. These data include all previous pivotal clinical studies, the recent ly 
completed V72_72 study in the same population and post -marketing exp erience in 
countries where  Menveo  and Bexsero  are marketed , and in majority of cases are given 
concomitantly.  
The purpose of this amendment is also to extend the visit window to 28 days post 
reference day  to mitigate the impact of COVID pandemic, includin g quarantine, 
mandatory vaccination, or other disturbances in the study procedures.

11 October  2022  18 1. SYNOPSIS  
Indication:  
Active immunization against invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis  serogroup B 
strains. Although the meningococcal group B vaccine was developed for individuals aged 
2 months and older, the actual age range for which this recommendation extends varies 
depending on the approval from different health authorities. In the US, the current 
indication is for individuals 10 through 25 years of age.  
Rationale:  
• Rationale for the study  
Data from clinical studies conducted in several age groups show that rMenB+OMV NZ 
and MenACWY are well tolerated and immunogenic when administered with a number 
of other vaccine antigens, including Diphtheria, Tetanus and acellular Pertussis (DTP a). 
Data from an infant study showed that both rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY were well 
tolerat ed and immunogenic when administered concomitantly in healthy infants. No data 
is currently available on the concomitant use of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY in 
adolescents.  
The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, the safety , and t he 
tolerability of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY vaccines when concomitantly 
administered to healthy subjects 16 -18 years of age.  
• Rationale for the study design  
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and demonstrate the non -inferiority of the 
antibod y responses of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY vaccines when concomitantly 
administered compared to either alone in healthy subjects 16 -18 years of age. The 
subjects will be randomi zed to one of the 3 parallel treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive the concom itant rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY vaccines (Group 
MenB+MenACWY) or rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine + placebo (Group MenB) or 
MenACWY vaccine+ placebo (Group MenACWY) in 2 different arms.  
• Rationale for the use of placebo  
In order to ensure proper blinding, placebo will b e administered to subjects in all groups 
in a staggered fashion. Subjects in Group MenB and Group MenACWY will be 
administered Placebo at Visit 1 and for subjects in Group MenB+MenACWY,  placebo 
will be administered at Visit 4 (study Day 91) .

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  19 Objectives and  Endpoints  (Amended 11 O ctober 2022) : 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
To assess the safety and tolerability of rMenB+OMV 
NZ and MenACWY, when administered 
concomitantly or alone, in healthy subjects 16 -18 
years of age.  • The frequencies and percentages of subjects with 
solicited local (i.e., injection site pain, erythema, 
swelling, induration) and systemic (i.e., fever 
[temperature ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F ], nausea, fatigue, 
myalgia, arthralgia, headache) adverse events 
(AEs) during the 7 days (including the day of  
vaccination) following the first (Visit 1 , Day 1/Month 
0), the second (Visit 3 , Month 2 ) and the third (Visit 
4, Month 3 ) vaccination for all groups.  
• The frequencies and percentages of subjects with 
any unsolicited AEs (including all SAEs), AEs 
leading to  withdrawal and medically attended AEs 
during the 30 days (including the day of 
vaccination) following the first (Visit 1 , Day 1/Month 
0), the second (Visit 3 , Month 2 ) and the third (Visit 
4, Month 3 ) vaccination for all groups.  
• The frequencies and percentages of subjects with 
SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, and medically 
attended AEs, throughout the study period  (Day 
1/Month 0 to Month 9). 
• The frequencies and percentages of subjects  (who 
received rMenB+OMV NZ)  with AESI throughout 
the study period  (Day 1/Month 0 to Month 9). 
• Among subjects who are followed for 12 
months after their last dose:  
o The frequencies and percentages of 
subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to 
withdrawal, between SFU 5/ Month 9 and 
SFU 7/ Month 15 .  
o The frequencies and percentages of 
subjects (who received rMenB+OMV 
NZ) with AESI between SFU 5/ Month 9 
and SFU 7/ Month 15.  
 
To demonstrate the non -inferiority of the antibody 
response to rMenB+OMV NZ given concomitantly 
with MenACWY to healthy subjects 16-18 years of 
age compared to rMenB+OMV NZ administered  
alone , as measured by serum bactericidal assay 
using human complement (hSBA) Geometric Mean 
Titers (GMTs) against N. meningitidis  serogroup B 
indicator strains M14459 (fHbp), 96217 (NadA), 
NZ98/254 ( PorA) and M07 -0241084 * (NHBA), at one 
month after the second vaccination with rMenB+OMV 
NZ. 
Criterion: Non -inferiority will be demonstrated if for 
each of the four serogroup B test strains, the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the 
betw een-group ratio of hSBA GMTs (rMenB+OMV 
NZ with MenACWY versus rMenB+OMV NZ alone) is 
>0.5.  • Co-primary endpoints for Group MenB+MenACWY 
and Group MenB are the hSBA GMTs for 
rMenB+OMV NZ against each of the four serogroup 
B test strains (M14459 , 96217, NZ98/254  and M07 -
0241084 ) at one month after the second 
vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ (Visit 4 , Month 3 ).

3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1. Study r ationale  
Data from clinical studies conducted in several age groups show that rMenB+OMV NZ 
and MenACWY are well tolerated and immunogenic when administered  with a number 
of other vaccine antigens, including DTP a. Data from an infant study showed that both 
rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY were well tolerated and immunogenic when 
administered concomitantly in healthy infants (aged 3 to 13 months). No data is currently  
available on the concomitant use of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY in adolescents.  
The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, the safety and the 
tolerability of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY vaccines when concomitantly 
administered to heal thy subjects 16 -18 years of age.  
3.2. Background  
Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) occurs when the normally asymptomatically 
carried bacterium Neisseria meningitidis  (N. meningitidis)  enters the bloodstream, 
multiplies and causes sepsis. If the bacteria cros s the blood –brain barrier, meningitis 
occurs [ Khatami , 2010].  
IMD  occurs worldwide. Although incidence varies in different regions of the world, 
infants, children and adolescents are the most vulnerable to developing invasive disease. 
Symptoms of the disease occur rapidly and often result in severe outcomes within a few

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  28 hours; otherwise , healthy individuals can be permanently disabled or disfigured or die of 
the disease. Despite the availability of medical treatment and effective antibiotics for IMD , 
approximately 9% of European patients die, with case -fatality rates gen erally increasing 
with age [ECDC , 2016].  In the US, the overall case -fatality ratio remains at 10% –15%, 
and 11% –19% of survivors have long -term sequelae [ Cohn , 2013].  
No reliable estimates of the global burden of disease are currently available as case 
definitions differ and surveillance data from many regions are incom plete [ WHO , 2011] . 
The overall incidence of confirmed IMDs in European countries in 2012 ranged from 
0.11 to 1.77 cases per 100,000 populations [ ECDC , 2016]. In the US, the incidence was 
0.18 cases per 100,000 population in 2014 [ Adams , 2016].  
Curre ntly, 13 serogroups of pathogenic N. meningitidis  [Harrison , 2013 ] are known to 
exist; however, virtually all meningococcal meningitis and septicemia ar e caused by only 
six serogroups: (i.e. , A, B, C, W, Y and X). The introduction of conjugate serogroup C 
meningococcal vaccines has dramatically changed the epidemiology of disease in 
industrialized nations, showing potential for broader control with A, C, W and Y 
conjugates, and leaving serogroup B as the predominant cause of disease. Development 
of vaccines for prevention of serogroup B disease in industrialized nations and serogroup 
A conjugate vaccines for Africa could lead to global co ntrol of meningoco ccal disease 
[Khatami , 2010 ].  
For the US, the 2015 Centers  for Disease Control  (CDC ) data indicate a total of 370 cases 
and 60 deaths attributable to meningococcal disease, with the majority of these caused by 
serogroup B, C and Y infections [ Cohn , 2013; CDC , 2015]. In Europe, the incidence of 
disease due to serogroup B is particularly high in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Denmark , 
and Spain. These same countries had early introduction of Meningococcal serogroup C 
vaccination after high incidences of serogroup C infections in the late 1990s [ ECDC , 
2016].  
In Eur ope, the majority of disease occurs in infants under 1 year of age, followed by 
children from 1 to 5 years of life. A second peak occurs in adolescents 15 to 19 years of 
age. In the US, incidence of meningococcal disease peaks in 3 age groups: infants and 
children aged <5 years, adolescents and young adults aged 16 through 21 years, and 
adults aged ≥65 years. Approximately 60% of disease in the first year of life is caused by 
serogroup B [ Cohn , 2013].  
Capsular polysaccharide vaccines have been used successfully in preventing disease and 
limiting epidemics and outbreaks caused by meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y.  
However , the capsular polysaccharide of serog roup B is poorly immunogenic in humans, 
possibly due to antigenic similarities in serogroup B carbohydrate moieties to 
carbohydrates widely distributed in the human body. As a result, research has focused on 
proteins in the outer membrane of meningococci a s potential antigens for candidate 
vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines based on protein -containing outer membrane vesicles 
(OMV) have been safe and effective in controlling epidemic disease caused by strains 
homologous to the vaccine strain in Cuba, Brazil, Chi le, Norway, and New Zealand.  The 
use of these OMV vaccines to combat serogroup B meningococcal disease has been 
CONFIDENTIAL  
205419  (MENB REC 2ND GEN -045 ( V72_79))  
Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  29 limited; however due to the strain -specific nature of the protection and the lack of 
consistent efficacy in young children.  
The knowledge gaine d during vaccine development for the Norwegian (MenBvac) and 
New Zealand (MeNZB) epidemics, together with the identification of the N. meningitidis  
serogroup B genome sequence, was used to develop GSK’s serogroup B meningococcal 
vaccine (rMenB+OMV NZ). The  availability of the bacterial genome sequence allowed 
identification of conserved surface -exposed outer membrane proteins of serogroup B 
strains that were targets for bactericidal antibodies [Pizza , 2000 ]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On 23 January 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a biologics licence 
application for GSK meningococcal group B vaccine according to the regulations for 
accelerated approval; the vaccine was approved for use in individuals 10 through 25 
years of age.  
Data from clinical studies conducted in several age groups show that both rMenB+OMV 
NZ and MenACWY are well tolerated and immunogenic when adm inistered with a 
number of other vaccine antigens, including DTP a. Data from an infant study showed 
that both rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY were well tolerated and immunogenic when 
administered concomitantly in healthy infants  [Clinicaltrials.gov ]. However, no data is 
currently available on the concomitant use of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY in 
adolescents.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  30 3.3.1.  Risk a ssessment  
Important Potential/Identified Risk  Data/Rationale for Risk   Mitigation Strategy  
Investigational vaccine: rMenB+OMV NZ ( Bexsero ) 
   
Important potential risk: Guillain -Barre 
Syndrome (GBS)  GBS has been observed with other vaccines. No cases have been 
identified in the Bexsero  clinical development program . The potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
aetiology that might occur is mentioned in the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF). GBS will be monitored through the 
potential immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs)  and SAE 
collection  (see Section 12.5.5.2 ). 
Important potential risk: Acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis (ADEM)  ADEM has been observed with other vaccines. No cases have been 
reported during the Bexs ero clinical development program .  The potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
aetiology that can occur is mentioned in the ICF. ADEM will 
be monitored through the pIMD  and SAE  collection  (see 
Section 12.5.5.2 ). 
Important potential risk: Anaphylaxis and 
anaphylactic shock  No cases of anaphylaxis to be related to Bexsero  have been 
reported in the Bexsero  clinical development program. However, 
one case of anaphylaxis within 30 minutes following vaccination was 
reported in a third party expanded access program (V72_70TP).  
Allergic reaction (including anaphylactic reaction) is listed in the 
Bexsero  US PI.  Anaphylaxis following the administration of Bexsero  
constitutes a contraindication (see section  7.7). Subjects 
will be observed closely for at least 30 minutes following 
the administration of the vaccines, with appropriate medical 
treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis (see 
Section  8.2.1 ). 
Hypersensitivity, including allergy to any component of 
vaccines, are exclusion criteria in this study (see Section  
6.2). 
Important potentia l risk:  
Arthritis  This potential risk is based on a signal observed for Bexsero . 
Attenuated live virus vaccines (rubella) were reported to be 
associated with joint -related diseases [Tingle , 1986 ]. Among 
inactivated vaccines, different manifestations of arthritis following 
hepatitis B vaccination (psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, etc.) 
were described [ IOM, 2011] . However , no association with 
meningococcal vaccines has been reported in the literature. One 
clinical case of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) possibly related to 
Bexsero  and 6 spontaneous reports considered to have a possible 
causal relationship have been observed . Arthritis will be monitored through the AESI collection  (see 
Section 12.5.5.1 ).

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  31 Important Potential/Identified Risk  Data/Rationale for Risk   Mitigation Strategy  
Investigational vaccine: MenACWY ( Menveo ) 
Important Identified risk:  
Reconstitution errors  Cases describing medication errors due to administration of the 
MenCWY conjugate liquid component only without reconstitution 
with the MenA conjugate lyophilized component, or due to 
administration of the MenA conjugate lyophilized component only 
after reconstitution with a different solvent, have been reported 
during the MenACWY clinical development program.  In several sections of the pr otocol (e.g., Section  7.1. 
“Description of study vaccines”) it is clarified that the 2 
vaccine components have to be reconstituted before 
vaccine injection.  
Important potential risk:  
GBS GBS has been observed with other vaccines. No cases have been 
reported during the MenACWY clinical development program.  The potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
aetiology that might occur is mentioned in ICF. GBS will be 
monitored through the pIMDs and  SAE collection (see 
Section 12.5.5.2 ). 
Important potential risk:  
ADEM  ADEM has been observed with other vaccines. Two serious cases 
from clinical trials were retrieved from the GSK’s global safety 
database for MenACWY. None of t hem has provided sufficient 
evidence of a causal association between ADEM and MenACWY.  The potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
aetiology that can occur is mentioned in the ICF. ADEM will 
be monitored through the pIMD and SAE collection (see 
Section 12.5.5.2 ). 
Important potential risk:  
Thrombocytopenia  Immune thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in association 
with several licensed vac cines. One serious case related to 
MenACWY has been reported during the clinical development 
program. This case didn’t provide sufficient evidence of a causal 
association between thrombocytopenia and MenACWY vaccine.  Immune thrombocytopenic purpura  will be monitored 
through SAE collection  (see Section 12.5.5.2 ). 
Important potential risk:  
Facial paresis  Facial paresis was recognized as an import ant potential risk 
following the results of a sponsored observational study 
(V59_34OB) which found an imbalance of cases of facial paresis 
following vaccination with MenACWY, mainly when administered 
concomitantly with other vaccines. No cases of facial pa resis were 
reported from interventional clinical trials.  Paralysis of the face is mentioned in the list of side effects 
in the ICF. Facial paresis will be monitored through SAE 
collection.  
Study Procedures  
Risk of blood sampling  Blood sampling is associated with a risk of syncope, dizziness, and 
infection after or during venipuncture.  Blood samples will be obtained by a trained professional 
and medical assistance will be available. The potential risk 
of feeling faint, experiencing mild local pain, bruising, 
irritation or redness at the site where blood was taken, is 
mentioned in the ICF. The amount of blood to be taken for 
sampling will not be harmful to the health of the subject.

11 October 2022  32 3.3.2.  Benefit a ssessment  
• Receiving GSK’s meningococcal vaccines Bexsero  and Menveo  during the study 
duration may protect against meningococcal IMDs caused by N. meningitidis  
serogroups A, B, C, W, Y.  
• Medical monitoring and evaluations/assessments associated with this st udy. 
3.3.3.  Overall Benefit:  Risk c onclusion  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this 
study, the potential or identified risks identified in association with rMenB+OMV NZ 
and MenACWY are justified by the potential benefits (prevention) that may be afforded 
to subjects receiving rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY .

*The NHBA indicator strain M07 -0241084 may be subject to change during the study, before clinical testing starts. In 
this cas e, this change will be documented in the clinical report.  
The study will be deemed successful if both:  
1. the non -inferiority of  the antibody response to  rMenB+OMV NZ when given 
concomitantly with MenACWY versus rMenB+OMV NZ alone and  
2. the non-inferiority of the antibody response to MenACWY when given 
concomitantly  with rMenB+OMV NZ versus MenACWY alone are demonstrated.  
5. STUDY D ESIGN  
5.1. Scientific rationale for study design  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the non -inferiority of the antibody response in 
terms of Human Serum Bactericidal Assay (hSBA) using human complement GMTs  
against N. meningitidis  test strains indicative of serogroups A, C, W, Y, and B, after 
concomitant rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY vaccine administration to either vaccine 
alone in healthy subjects 16 -18 years of age.  
The selection of the study population is based on ACIP recommendations for us e of 
meningococcal vaccines [ ACIP , 2011 ]. Routine administration of a MenACWY vaccine 
for all persons aged 11 through 18 years is recommended. A single dose of vaccine 
should be administered at 11 or 12 years of age, a nd a booster dose should be 
administered at 16 years of age. Adolescents who receive their first dose at 13 through 15 
years of age should receive a booster dose at 16 through  18 years of age. In Europe, 
Menveo  has been approved by EMA for active immunizat ion of children (from  2 years of 
age), adolescents and adults at risk of exposure to N . meningitidis  groups A, C, W  and Y,

11 October 2022  36 to prevent invasive disease. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official 
recommendations.  
To be eligible for this s tudy design, all subjects must have received a previous 
vaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY; Menveo  
or Menactra ) at least 4 years prior to study start . The available data support 
interchangeability of the 2 licensed  meningococcal conjugate vaccines [ACIP , 2013 ]. 
Consequently, a booster dose of Menveo  can be administered, regardless of the vaccine 
brand used for the previou s dose . 
Data collected from this study may support the concomitant use of rMenB+OMV NZ and 
MenACWY in healthy subjects 16 -18 years of age.  
5.1.1.  Rationale for the use of placebo  
In order to ensure proper blinding and uniformity, placebo will be administered at V isit 1 
(study Day 1) to subjects in Groups MenB and MenACWY. In addition, at Visit 4 (study 
Day 91), placebo will be administered to subjects in Group MenB+MenACWY  while 
subjects in Groups MenB and MenACWY will receive MenACWY and rMenB+OMV 
NZ respectively .

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  46 • Study vaccination will be performed on Day 1 (Visit 1), Day 61 (Visit 3) and Day 91 
(Visit 4).  
• All subjects will undergo a physical exam and safety related assessments at each 
Visit (5 clinic visits on study days 1, 31, 61, 91 and 121, respectively).  
• After  completing all prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, vaccines should be 
administered by unblinded study personnel as a deep intramuscular (IM) injection, 
preferably into the deltoid area of the arm. To be able to efficiently distinguish local 
AEs after the concomitant vaccination at study Day 1 (Visit 1), the 2 injections will 
be separately administered into both arms. The second and third study vaccination 
occurring at study Day 61 (Visit 3) and study Day 91 (Visit 4) will be preferably 
administer ed into the deltoid area of the non -dominant arm. The exact anatomic 
location of each injection must be carefully recorded in the Medical Chart and in the 
eCRF  (refer to Section  7.1 for detailed description of the vaccines administration 
procedure).  
If the investigator or delegate determines that the subject’s health on the day of 
administration temporarily precludes vaccines administration, the visi t will be 
rescheduled within the allowed interval for this visit (refer to  Table 4). 
The subjects will be observed closely for at least 30 minutes following the administration 
of the vaccines, with appropriate medical treatment readily available in case of 
anaphylaxis  and s yncope . 
As with all injectable vaccines, trained medical personnel and appropriate medical 
treatment should be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions following vaccine 
administration. For example, epinephrine 1:1000, diphenhydramine, and/or ot her 
medications for treating anaphylaxis should be available.  
In the event of any foreign particulate matter and/or variation of physical aspect being 
observed, do not administer the vaccine and report the issue to the manufacturer. For 
rMenB+OMV NZ and Me nACWY vaccines the issue should be reported as a 
Pharmaceutical Technical Complaint. The vaccine should not be discarded until 
authori zed by GSK. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed 
of in accordance with local requirements.  
Detailed vaccine preparation and administration instructions will be provided to 
investigators in the Clinical Trials Supply Manual  prior to study start.  
Vaccine administration error is defined as receiving a dose of study vaccine that was not 
reconstituted as instructed or administered by a different route from the intended route of 
administration. An overdose of study vaccine (whether accidental or intentional) is 
defined when a dosage higher than the recommended dosage is administered in one dose 
of study vaccine rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY.  
An overdose would also occur if 2 doses of the study vaccine are administered within 
half the time of the recommended interval between doses, as defined in the protocol.  
Any vaccine administration error or overdose of stud y vaccine detailed in this protocol 
must be reported as an AE, and if the vaccine administration error or overdose is 
associated with a serious AE, it must be reported as such within 24 hours to the Sponsor.

7.2.1.  Subject identific ation  
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially to the subjects who have 
consented to participate in the study, according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to each study center . 
7.2.2.  Randomi zation of treatment  
7.2.2.1.  Randomi zation of supplies  
The randomi zation of supplies within blocks will be performed at GSK  Biologicals , using 
MATerial EXcellence (MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS®) (Cary, NC, USA) by GSK  Biologicals . Entire blocks will be shipped to 
the study centers /warehouse(s).  
To allow GSK  Biologicals  to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than 
anticipated at individual cent ers in this multi -center study and to thus reduce the overall 
study recruitment period, an over -randomi zation of supplies will be prepared.  
7.2.2.2.  Treatment allocation to the subject  
The treatment numbers will be allocated by component . 
7.2.2.2.1.  Study group and treatment number allocation  
The t arget will be to enroll  approximately 945 eligible subjects who will be randomly 
assigned to 3 study groups in a 1: 1: 1 ratio (approximately 315 subjects in each group).  
Subjects will be randomi zed in the source data base for internet randomi zation  system  
(SBIR ) system  to one of the 3 parallel treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive:  
• Group MenB+MenACWY: rMenB+OMV NZ given concomitantly with 
MenACWY at study Day 1; rMenB+OMV NZ at study Day 61; Placebo at study 
Day 91.  
• Group MenB: rMenB+OMV NZ given concomitantly with Placebo at study Day 1; 
rMenB+OMV NZ at study Day 61; MenACWY at study Day 91.  
• Group MenACWY: MenACWY given concomitantly with Placebo at study Day  1; 
rMenB+OMV NZ at study Day 61 and at study Day 91.  
The Subject ID will be the subject’s unique identification number for all eCRFs and 
associated study documentation that will be used for duration of the study.  
Allocation of the subject to a study group at the investigator site will be performed using 
a random ization system on internet  (SBIR). The randomi zation algorithm will use a

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  48 After obtaining the signed /witnessed/thumb printed  and dated ICF/IAF from the subject/ 
subject’s parent/ LAR and having checked the elig ibility of the subject, the site staff in 
charge of the vaccine administration will access SBIR. Upon providing the subject 
identification number, the randomi zation system will determine the study group and will 
provide the treatment number to be used for each component . 
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.  
When SBIR is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the Study Procedures 
Manual (SPM) for specific instructions.  
If for any reason, after signing the informed consent form (ICF), the subject who is 
eligible and enrolled fails to be randomi zed, this is called a randomi zation failure and the 
early termination study procedures must be applied. The reason for all randomi zation 
failures should be recorded in the Screening and Enrolment Log and in the source 
document as specified in the Source Documentation Agreement Form  (SDA). The 
information on subjects who are randomi zation failures should be kept distinct from 
subjects wh o are screen failures, as described in section  6.4. 
If for any reason, after randomi zation the subject fails to undergo treatment, this is an 
Early Termination and the reason should be recorded in source document as specified in 
the Source Data Agreement. The information on these Early Termination subjects should 
be kept distinct in the source documentation from randomi zation failures.  
Note: In case o f supplies shortage for the next assigned vaccine according to the 
randomi zation schedule at the clinical site, the SBIR system will use the forced 
randomi zation procedure in order to continue to enroll  and vaccinate subjects. The 
system moves seamlessly t o the next treatment in the minimization algorithm arm for 
which the vaccine supplies are available. The site will not be aware of the forced 
randomi zation event.  
7.2.2.2.2.  Treatment number allocation for subsequent doses  
For each dose subsequent to the first dose, the study staff in charge of the vaccine 
administration will access SBIR, provide the subject identification number, and the 
system will provide a treatment number consistent with the allocated study group.  
The number of each administered treatment must be  recorded in the eCRF the Vaccine 
Administration screen.  
7.3. Blinding  and unblinding  
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By observer -blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study, the vaccines recipient and those responsible for the 
evaluation of any study endpoint (e.g. safety and reactogenicity) will all be unaware of 
which vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine preparation and administration will 
be done by qualified healthcare professional  who will not participate in any of the  study 
clinical evaluation s.

11 October  2022  49 The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing will be blinded to the treatment  as well 
as to the subject number. In addition, a different subject code will be used for each 
timepoint tested. This subject coding will preven t the laboratory from linking the 
consecutive visits to a specific subject.  
The serological data, which would lead to the unblinding of the study groups, will not be 
available during the course of the study to any investigator or any person involved in the  
clinical conduct of the study (including data cleaning).  
7.3.1.  Emergency unblinding  
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur only in the case of a 
medical emergency when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the clinical 
management  or welfare of the subject.  
The emergency unblinding process consists of the automated Internet -based system 
(SBIR) that allows the investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to 
the subject’s individual study treatment.  
As back up proce ss, the investigator has the option of contacting a GSK Helpdesk (refer 
to Table 11) if he/she needs support to perform the unblinding (i.e. , he/she ca nnot access 
the automated Internet -based system).  
Non-investigator physician (e.g. , physician from emergency room) or subject/care 
giver/family member can also request emergency unblinding either via the investigator 
(preferred option) or via the GSK Helpd esk (back up process). Contact details of 
investigator and GSK Helpdesk are reported in the patient/subject card.

11 October  2022  50 7.4. Handling , storage and  replacement of study 
vaccine(s)/product(s)  
7.4.1.  Storage and handling of study vaccines  
The study vaccine  must be stored at the respective label storage temperature conditions in 
a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to authori zed study 
personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre -study activities under the 
responsibility of the sponsor study contact. The storage temperature should be 
continuously monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature monitoring  
device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for 
more details on storage of the study vaccines.  
A temperature excursion is any temperature that is not in range of the label storage 
temperature conditions. Temperatures outside the range of label storage temperature 
conditions must be reported and/or documented. Temperature excursion impacting study 
vaccines must be reported and/or documented.  
In the frame of the reporting, the lack/absence of temperature monitoring docum entation 
from a device , meeting GSK requirements has to be considered as a temperature 
excursion.  
Study vaccines that are impacted by a temperature excursion may not be used and must 
be quarantined at label storage conditions until usage approval has been obtained 
from/via the local study contact (e.g. , Site Monitor).  
Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for details and instructions on 
the temperature excursion reporting and usage decision process, packaging and 
accountability of the st udy vaccines.  
The Sponsor will ensure the following:  
• Supply the study vaccines.  
• Appropriate labelling  of all study vaccines provided that complies with the legal 
requirements of each country where the study is to be performed.  
The investigator must ensure the following:  
• Acknowledge receipt of the study vaccines by a designated staff member at the site, 
including:  
− Confirmation that the vaccines were received in good condition  
• Appropriate use of the study vaccines, including:  
− Use only in accordance with the a pproved protocol.  
− Proper handling, including confirmation that the vaccine has not expired prior to 
administration.

11 October  2022  51 − Appropriate documentation of administration of vaccines to study subjects 
including:  
Date, dosage, batch/lot numbers, expiration dates, uniq ue identifying numbers 
assigned to subjects and study vaccines, and time of vaccine administration. 
This information will be maintained in an accountability log that will be 
reviewed by the site monitor.  
Reconciliation of all vaccines received from the Spo nsor. Reconciliation is 
defined as maintaining records of which and how many vaccines were received, 
which vaccines were administered to subjects, which vaccines were destroyed at 
the site, and which vaccines were returned to the Sponsor, as applicable.  
• Proper adherence to the local institutional policy with respect to destruction of study 
vaccines.  
• Complete record keeping of vaccine use, wastage, return or destruction, including 
documentation of:  
− Copy of the site’s procedure for destruction of hazardous ma terial.  
− Copy of destruction Certificate  
Vaccines that have been stored differently from the manufacturer’s indications must not  
be used unless the Sponsor provides authorization for use. In the event that the use cannot 
be authori zed, the Sponsor will make  every effort to replace the vaccine supply. All 
vaccines used in conjunction with this protocol must be stored separately from normal 
hospital/practice stocks to prevent unintentional use of study vaccines outside of the 
clinical study setting.  
Monitoring  of vaccine accountability will be performed by the study monitor during site 
visits and at the completion of the study.  
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the 
investigator must ensure that all unused study v accines, packaging and supplementary 
labels are destroyed locally (upon approval from Sponsor) or returned to the Sponsor.  
7.4.2.  Replacement of unusable vaccine  doses  
In addition to the vaccine  doses provided for the planned number of subjects (including 
over-randomi zation when applicable), at least  20% additional vaccine doses will be 
supplied to replace those that are unusable.

vaccinations  
7.5.1.  Recording of concomitant medications/products and 
concomitant vaccinations  (Amended 11 O ctober 2022)  
At each study visit/contact, the investigator or delegate should question the subject and/or 
the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  about any medications/products taken and vaccinations 
received by the subject.  
The following concomitant medication(s)/product(s)/vaccine(s) must be recorded in the 
eCRF : 
• All concomitant medications/products, except vitamins and dietary supplements, 
administered during the period  of 30 days post -vaccination . 
• Relevant medications/products administe red during the period (Day 1 to Day 451)  or 
(Day 1 to Day 271) for subjects who have not reached Day 271 at the time this 
amendment takes effect.  
• Any concomitant vaccination administered in the period starting  14 days before the 
first dose of study vaccin es and ending at the last study contact (Day  -14 to Day  451) 
or (Day 1 to Day 271) for subjects who have not reached Day 271 at the time this 
amendment takes  effect.  
• Prophylactic medication (i.e. medication administered in the absence of ANY 
symptom and in  anticipation of a reaction to the vaccination).  
E.g. an anti -pyretic is considered to be prophylactic when it is given in the absence 
of fever and any other symptom, to prevent fever from occurring [fever is defined as 
temperature  38.0°C/100.4°F regardl ess the location of measurement]. The 
preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will be the oral cavity.  
• Any concomitant medications/products/vaccines leading to the withdrawal or non -
eligibility of the subject from the study . Please refer  to the section 7.5.2  for further 
details . 
• Any concomitant medications/products/vaccines relevant to a n SAE/ Adverse Event 
of Special interest ( AESI ) to be reported as per protocol or administered at any time 
during the study period for the treatment of a n SAE/ AESI. In addition, concomitant 
medications relevant to SAEs and AESI’s  need to be recorded on the expedited 
Adverse Event report.  
• The use of antipyretic and/or other medications to prevent (prophylactic use) and/or 
treat fever during the first 7 days after vaccination to be recorded in the eCRF as 
well.  
• The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding 
concomitant or prior therapy.

elimination of a subject from per -protocol analyses  
The use of the following concomitant medications/products/vaccines will not require 
withdrawal of the subject from the study b ut may determine a subject’s evaluability in the 
per-protocol analysis. See Section 10.2 for populations to be analysed.  
• Any investigational or non -registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study 
vaccines  used during the study period.  
• Immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs defined as follows:  
− Systemic administration of corticosteroids (PO/IV/IM) for more than 14 
consecutive days  within 90 days prior to informed.  This will mean prednisone 
20 mg/day (for adult subjects) or 0.5 mg/kg/day  or 20  mg/day whichever is 
the maximum dose for  paediatric subjects, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical 
steroids are allowed . 
− Administration of an tineoplastic and immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy 
within 90 days prior to informed consent.  
• Long -acting immune -modifying drugs administered at any time during the study 
period (e.g. infliximab).  
• Immunoglobulins and/or any blood products administered  during the study period.  
• Investigational or non -registered medicinal products within 30 days prior to 
informed consent/assent.  
• Drug and/or alcohol abuse . 
7.6. Intercurrent medical conditions that may lead to elimination 
of a subject from per -protocol analyses  
At each study visit subsequent to the first vaccination/the vaccination visit, it must be 
verified if the subject has experienced or is experiencing any intercurrent medical 
condition  that may lead to elimination from per protocol analysis . If it is the ca se, the 
condition(s) must be recorded in the eCRF.  
7.7. Contraindications to subsequent vaccin e(s) administration  
Prior to receipt of additional study vaccination, subjects must be evaluated to confirm that 
they are eligible for subsequent vaccination. If subje cts meet any of the original exclusion 
criteria or the criteria listed below, they should not receive additional vaccinations. 
However, these subjects should be encouraged to continue study participation.  
• Anaphylaxis following the administration of vaccine s 
• Pregnancy (see Section  12.5.7.1 ) 
• Any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make IM injection 
unsafe.

assessed by the investigator before administration of the second dose of study 
vaccine.  
• Subjects who experience any serious adverse event  (SAE)  judged to be possibly or 
probably related to study v accine or non -study vaccines, including hypersensitivity 
reactions.  
• Subjects who develop any new condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, 
may pose additional risk to the subject if he/she continues to participate in the study.   
• Occurrence of a new AESI or the exacerbation of an existing AESI . Refer to Section  
12.5.5  for the definition of AESIs.  
7.8. Warnings and precautions  
Warnings and precautions to vaccination must be checked at the beginning of each  
vaccination visit.  Refer to the approved product label/package insert.  
7.9. Treatment after  completion  of the study   
The investigator is encouraged to share the immunological assay results for non -
responders with the study subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s).  
For the subjects identified as non -responders, it remains the responsibility of the 
investigator in charge of the subject’s clinical management to determine the  medical care 
needed  as per local/regional practices (such as re -vaccination of  the subject (s)). 
8. STUDY ASSESSMENT S AND P ROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timing are summari zed in the SoA  (Section 2).  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed unless ne cessary for the management of 
immediate safety concerns.   
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject (s) should discontinue study 
treatment . 
Adherence to the study desi gn requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
subject s meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all subject s screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
Procedures conducted as part of the subject ’s rou tine clinical management (e .g. blood 
count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utili zed for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and was performed  
within the time frame defined in the SoA.

8.2. Pre-vaccination procedures  
8.2.1.  Data Collected from Subjects  
The following data will be collec ted from each subject over the duration of their study 
participation:  
• Demographic Information.  
• Medical history (any significant past diagnoses including allergies, hospitalizations, 
surgeries requiring in -patient hospitalization, any other medical conditions which 
may impair the assessment of safety of the rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY 
vaccines).  
• Vaccination history as confirmed by vaccination records, if accessible.  
• Pre-vaccination body temperature.  
• Post-vaccination immediate reactions observed for at l east 30 minutes after injection: 
signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, allergic phenomena (such as rashes, itching, or 
other allergic manifestations). Local and systemic solicited data (including e.g., use 
of medication to treat or prevent fever, and/or pain).  
• Post-vaccination solicited local and systemic AEs collected at home by subject 
and/or subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and recorded on Subject Diary (eDiary) for 7 days 
following each vaccination visit.  
• Adverse Events.  
− Unsolicited AEs occurring within 30 days a fter each vaccination will be 
collected for all subjects by interviewing the subject and/or subject’s

• Prior and concomitant medication as defined in Section  7.5. 
All data collected must only be identified usi ng the GSK Subject ID, as described in 
Section  7.2, documented in the source documents and entered in the eCRF*.  
*Only the solicited local and syste mic AEs 30 minutes post vaccination are entered in the 
eCRF. The solicited local and systemic AEs during 7 -day post -vaccination period are not 
entered in the eCRF and are documented only in eDiary.  
8.2.2.  Collection of demographic data  
Record demographic data such as date of birth, sex, height and weight, race and ethnicity 
in the subject’s eCRF.  
8.2.3.  Medical history  
Obtain the subject’s medical  history by interview and/or review of the subject’s medical 
records and record any pre -existing co nditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a 
subject prior to the first  study vaccination in the eCRF.  
Medical history will be collected at Visit 1, including but not limited to any medical 
history that may be relevant to subject eligibility for study pa rticipation such as prior 
vaccinations, concomitant medications (refer to Section  7.5.2 ), and previous and ongoing 
illnesses or injuries. Relevant medical history can also include any medical history that 
contributes to the understanding of an AE that occurs during study participation, if it 
represents an exacerbation of an underlying disease/pre -existing problem.  
Review of systems is a structured interview that queries the subject/subjects’ 
parent (s)/LAR (s) as to any complaints the subject has experienced across each organ 
system. This will be performed before enrolment and used to guide physical examination . 
8.2.4.  Physical examination  
Physical examinati on is to be performed by a qualified health care professional. 
“Qualified health care professional” refers to a licensed or certified health care 
professional with documented training and experience, as determined by the Principal 
Investigator (PI), and wh o is permitted by institutional policy to perform protocol 
required procedures, and who is identified on the Study Staff Signature Log.

11 October  2022  57 The physical examination of the subject  will include  assessment of body temperature 
(preferably oral) and resting vital signs: systolic/diastolic blood pressure  and heart rate  
after at least 10 minutes of rest.  
Medical history -directed physical examination to assess eligibility will be performed 
during Visit 1.  
Physical examination at each study visit subsequent to the firs t vaccination visit, will be 
performed only if the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) indicates during questioning that 
there might be some underlying pathology(ies) or if deemed necessary by the Investigator 
or delegate  (symptom -directed physical examinat ion). 
These data will be written in the source document. Should the physical assessment reveal 
any abnormal values or events, these must be documented in the eCRF Adverse Events 
Form.  
If the investigator determines that the subject’s health on the day of v accination 
temporarily precludes vaccination, the visit will be rescheduled.  
Treatment of any abnormality observed during physical examination has to be performed 
according to local medical practice outside this study or by referral to an appropriate 
healt h care provider.  
8.2.5.  Pregnancy test  
Female subjects of childbearing potential are to have a urine  pregnancy test prior to any 
study vaccine administration. The study vaccines  may only be administered if the 
pregnancy test is negative.  
Urine will be collected for pregnancy testing in females of child -bearing potential, before 
vaccination at Visits 1, 3, and 4, and the results recorded in the source document and the 
eCRF.  
Note: Pregnancy test must be performed even if the subject is menstruating at the time of 
the study visit.  
8.2.6.  Pre-vaccination body temperature  
The body temperature (preferably oral) of each subject needs to be measured prior to any 
study vaccines  administration.  If the subject has fever [fever is defined as temperature 
38.0°C/100.4°F regardless th e location of measurement] on the day of vaccination, the 
vaccination visit will be rescheduled within the allowed interval for this visit (see Table 4

Please refer to the SPM and central laboratory manual for details on biospecimen 
management (handling, storage and shipment).  
Samples will not be labelled with information that directly identifies the subject but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).  
Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related to 
the improvement, development and quali ty assurance of the laboratory tests described in 
this protocol. This may include the management of the quality of these tests, the 
maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test methods, as well 
as making sure that new tests are co mparable to previous methods and work reliably.  
It is also possible that further  findings may make it desirable to use the samples acquired 
in this study for further  research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, all 
subjects /subjects parent (s)/LAR( s) will be asked to give a specific consent to allow GSK 
or a contracted partner to use the samples for further  research. Further  research will be 
subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries and will only be performed 
once an independent Ethics Committee or Review Board has approved this research.  
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be  obtained from GSK  
Biologicals . 
Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual 
subject/subj ect’s parent(s)/LAR(s) . 
Refer also to the  Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform any other biological assays e xcept those described in th e protocol or its 
amendment(s).  
If additional testing is performed, the marker priority ranking given in Section 8.3.4  may 
be changed.  
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 years (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra r equirements need to be communicated formally to and discussed 
and agreed with GSK.  
8.3.1.  Use of specified study materials  
When materials are provided by GSK  Biologicals , it is MANDATORY  that all clinical 
samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those 
materials in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the

definition of populations  for analyses ). The investigator must ensure that his/her 
personnel and the laboratory(ies) under his/her supervision comply with this requirement. 
However, when GSK  Biologicals  does not p rovide material for collecting and storing 
clinical samples, appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used. Refer to 
the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM  or the central laboratory manual . 
The above applies to any external partners designated by GSK as well.  
8.3.2.  Biological samples  
Blood samples will be collected from all subjects for serology evaluation. Refer to the 
Module on Biospecimen Management in the SPM or central laboratory manual for 
detailed instructions for the collec tion, handling and processing of the samples.  
8.3.2.1.  Blood sampling for immunogenicity response assessments  
Blood samples will be taken during certain study visits as specified in Section  2. 
• Before vaccination a blood sample will be obtained at Visit 1 and Visit 4 for 
serologic evaluation.  
• A volume of approximately  20 mL of whole blood should be drawn from all subjects 
before first vaccination (Visit 1, stud y Day 1), 1 month after the first vaccination 
(Visit 2, study Day 31) and 1 month after the second vaccination and before the third 
vaccination (Visit 4, study Day 91) for immunogenicity evaluation. After 
centrifugation, serum samples should be kept at –20°C/ –4°F or below until 
shipment. Refer to the SPM and the central laboratory manual for more details on 
sample management and storage conditions.  
• The total amount of blood collected over the study period per subject will be 
approximately 60 mL.  
A topical anesthetic (e.g. EMLA adhesives or cream) may be used at the site of blood 
sample draw, according to local practice in order to minimize pain.  
The blood will be processed, identified and stored according to the Central Laboratory 
manual.  
In clinic visits where a blood draw and a vaccination are planned, ensure that all samples 
collected for immunogenicity assessment s are taken prior to any vaccination. The 
following are clinical circumstances that warrant delay of blood samples collection for 
immunogenicity assessments in this study:  
• Receipt of systemic antibiotics within the previous 3 days (72 hours) before blood 
sample collection at Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 4.  
In the event that a subject meets the criterion for delay of blood samples c ollection, blood 
samples collection may proceed once the appropriate window for delay has passed  and

8.3.2.2.  Other biological samples  
Urine sampling: Urine test is the preferable method to test pregnancy. Urine will be 
collected for pregnancy testing in females of child -bearing potential, before each 
vaccination at Visits 1, 3, and 4, and the results recorded in the source document and 
eCRF.  
Note: Pregnancy test must be performed even if the subject is mens truating at the time of 
the study visit.  
8.3.3.  Laboratory assays  
The measures of immunogenicity used in this study are standard, i.e., widely accepted 
and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant (able to describe the quality 
and extent of the im mune response).  
The immunogenicity of the rMenB+OMV NZ and of MenACWY vaccines will be 
assessed in this study by measuring the serum bactericidal activity which is a functional 
measure of the ability of antibodies, in conjunction with human complement, to kill 
meningococci, and is widely accepted and generally recognized as the serological 
surrogate of protection.  
The induction of antibodies directed against serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococci 
following MenACWY vaccination will also be measured by Enzyme -Linked 
Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA). The ELISA procedure is used to detect the amount of 
sera immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in response to N. meningitidis  polysaccharide 
antigens.  
Please refer to Appendix 2 for a detailed description of the assays performed in the study.   
Please refer to Appendix 3 for the address of the clinical laboratories used for sample 
analysis.  
Serological testing for immunogenicity to rMenB+OMV NZ and to MenACWY va ccines 
will be performed at GSK  Biologicals’  laboratories or in a laboratory designated by GSK  
Biologicals  using standardized and validated procedures (refer to  Table 13).

11 October  2022  63 In case of insufficient blood sample volume to perform assays for all antibodies, the 
samples will be analysed according to priority ranking provided in  Table 14.  
8.3.5.  Immunological correlates of protection  
For the N. meningitidis  serogroup C antigen in the MenACWY vaccine , an 
immunological Correlate of Protection  (CoP)  has been established as ≥ 1:4 hSBA.  
No generally accepted immunological  CoP has been demonstrated s o far for the other 
antigen(s) used in the candidate vaccine(s) . 
The immunological assay results will be communicated to the investigator when ready 
and available . 
Refer to the section 7.9 for details regarding treatment for non -responders.  
8.4. Safety Assessments  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. The investigator and any 
designees remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to  
the study treatment or the study, or that caused the subject to discontinue the study 
treatment or study.  
The measures of safety used in this study are routine clinical procedures. They include a 
close vigilance for, and stringent reporting of, selected l ocal and systemic AEs routinely 
monitored in vaccine clinical studies as indicators of reactogenicity.  
8.4.1.  Safety definitions  
Please refer to Section 12.5 for safety definitions.  
8.4.2.  Follow -up Clinic Visit  
Follow -up clinic visits will be performed on study Days 31 (Visit 2), 91 (Visit 4) and 121 
(Visit 5).  
During the follow -up clinic visit on study Days 31 (Visit 2), 91 (Visit 4) and 121 (Visit 
5), the eDiary  will be reviewed by the staff. Study -specific requirements are described in 
the SPM. At last Follow -Up clinic visit (Day 121), the eDiary should be returned to the 
study site and collected. For details on the eDiary see Section  12.5.8 . 
The subject and/or parent(s)/LAR(s) will be interviewed to determine if any unsolicited 
AEs occurred and if any concomitant medications associated with those events  or 
vaccines were taken/received in the time since the last clinic visit. The healthcare 
professional reviewing these data will discuss the symptoms (if any) reported by the 
subject and will determine if any additional diagnoses and/or AEs are present. AEs  
reported by the subject and/or parent(s)/LAR(s) at this follow -up clinic visit must be

in Section 8.4. 
Perform a brief symptom -directed physical examination if necessary according to 
symptoms the subject has reported. This is a physical examination that will include an 
examination of organ systems that are relevant to the investigator based on review of the 
subject’s reported AEs, concomitant medication use. This assessment may include 
measurement of vital signs, body temperature (preferably oral) and a check of general 
appearance.  The physical assessment must be per formed by the investigator or designee 
of the investigator, who is qualified to perform a physical assessment in accordance with 
their institutional policy  (see glossary of terms  for definition of a qualified healthcare 
provider) . Any relevant clinical finding  (when deemed abnormal)  resulting from the 
symptom -directed physical examination  should be documented in the subject’s source 
docume nt and eCRF(s).  
Approximately 20 mL of blood will be drawn from all subjects for immunological 
evaluation at Visit 1 (Day 1), Visits 2 (Day 31) and Visit 4 (Day 91) . Refer to Section 
8.3.2 . 
The site should schedule the next study visit with the subject and/or parent(s)/LAR(s). 
The subject and/or parent(s)/LAR(s) will be reminded to contact the site if there are any 
questions and to contact the site immediately (or as soon as the subject is medically 
stable) if the subject has a medical condition that leads to a hospitalization or an 
emergency room visit.  
8.4.3.  Safety Follow -up calls  (Amended 11 O ctober 2022)

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  68 A post -study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting period defined in Table 15. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs 
or SAEs in former study subjects.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, 
including a death, at any time after a subject  has been discharged from the study, and 
he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study vaccines, the investigator 
will promptly notify the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs.  
For further details, please see Section 12.5.11.1.2 . 
8.4.5.  Method of d etecting AEs and SAEs  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing intensity , causality  and outcome  of

8.4.6.2.  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification of an SAE by the investigator to the sponsor is essential for meeting 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities for the safety of subjects and the safety of a 
study treatment under clinical investigation.  
The sponsor has a legal r esponsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting  to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory re quirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (e .g. summary or listing of SAE s) from the sponsor will 
review and t hen file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
All SAEs must be reported by the investigator to his/her corresponding EC/ IRB or 
applicable regulatory authorities in accordanc e with institutional policy/regulatory 
requirements and adequate documentation of this notification must be provided to the 
Sponsor.  
8.4.7.  Medical device deficiencies   
Per Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a device is:  
An instrument, apparatus,  implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or 
other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is:  
1. recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, 
or any supplement to them,

3. intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, 
and w hich does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action 
within or on the body of man or other animals and  which does not achieve its 
primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or 
other animals and whi ch is not dependent upon being metabolized for the 
achievement of its primary intended purposes. The term "device" does not include 
software functions excluded pursuant to section 520(o).  
The study intervention is a combination product constituted of a device and biologic 
product (e.g. pre -filled syringes). Refer to the Glossary of terms  for the definition of 
combination product and medical device de ficiency.  
8.4.7.1.  Detection, follow -up and prompt reporting of medical device deficiency  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation and prompt reporting of 
any medical device deficiency occur ring during the study to GSK. This applies to any 
medical device provided for the conduct of the study.   
Device deficiencies will be reported to GSK within 24 hours  after the investigator 
determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a device deficiency. Refer to 
Section 12.7 for definitions and details on recording and reporting of these events.  
The sponsor will be the contact for the receipt of device deficiency reports.  
The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any additional investigations to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the deficiency. Follow -up applies to all 
participants, including those who discontinue study intervention or the study.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the  originally completed form with all 
changes signed and dated by the investigator and reported to GSK within  24 hours.  
Regulatory reporting of medical device deficiency when used as combination product  
The investigator will promptly report all device defic iencies occurring with any medical 
device provided for use in the study in order for the sponsor to fulfil the legal 
responsibility to notify appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about certain 
safety information relating to medical devices  being used in clinical studies. Refer to 
Section 12.7.3  for details of reporting.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local require ments (e.g. the head of 
the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements 
relating to the reporting of device deficiencies to the IRB/IEC.

After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject  at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of special interest 
(as defined in Section 12.5.5 ), will be followed until the event is resolved, stabili zed, 
otherwise  explained, or the subject  is lost to follow -up. Further information on follow -up 
procedures is given in  Section 12.5.11 . 
8.4.9.  Treatment of adverse events  
Treatment of any AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice. Any medication administered for the treatment of a SAE/ AESIs  
should be recorded in Expedited Adverse Event Report of the subject’s eCRF (refer  to 
Section 7.5). 
8.4.10.  Subject card  
Study subjects /subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be provided with the address and 
telephone number of the main contact for  information about the clinical study.  
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each 
subject /subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) . In an emergency situation , this card serves to inform 
the responsible attending physician that the subject is in a clinical study and that relevant 
information may be obtained by contacting the investigator.  
Subjects /subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to keep subject car ds in their 
possession at all times during the study duration.  
8.5. Genetic Research (Pharmacogenetics)  
Genetics are not evaluated in this study.  
8.6. Study conclusion  
• The study termination call will occur on study Day 451 ( after safety follow up call 7)  
or (Day 271  [Month 9]) for subjects who have not reached Day 271  [Month 9]  at 
the time this amendment takes effect.  The termination visit will be a phone call  
(Amended 11 O ctober 2022 ).  
• The date of termination is the date of the last contact (clinic visit or telepho ne call) in 
which the subject’s health status was assessed or, in cases where the subject does not 
agree to any further safety follow -up, it is the date consent is withdrawn. This date 
should be recorded on the termination eCRF page. For visit procedures t o be 
performed for a subject whose planned study participation ends prematurely, please 
see below.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  72 • At the Termination visit, the following procedures will be performed: interview of 
subject and/or parent(s)/LAR(s) to collect any medically attended AEs, AEs  leading 
to withdrawal, AESI, SAEs, and/or concomitant medications/vaccinations. Any 
concomitant medications associated with those events will also be collected and 
recorded in the subject's records and on the eCRF.  
• The site will review with the subject an d/or parent(s)/LAR(s) the plan of when 
information relating to the subject’s participation in the study may be available (e.g., 
study results, treatment assignments). It will also be discussed how information 
relating to the subject’s participation in the study will be shared with the subject’s 
healthcare provider if the subject and/or parent(s)/LAR(s) chooses to share this 
information or if it is required by local regulations.  
• The site will complete the termination eCRF page and this will mark the completi on 
of the subject’s participation in the study.  
8.6.1.  Early Termination  
When a subject is withdrawn from treatment or withdraws from the study, the 
investigator will notify the Sponsor and, when possible, will perform the procedures 
listed below. The reason(s) f or the early termination will be included in the subject’s 
source documentation.  
During the telephone call, the following procedures will be performed:  
• review of Subject eDiary (if applicable).  
• interview of subject and/or parent(s)/LAR(s) to collect unsolicited AEs, medically 
attended AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, AESI.  
• interview of subject and/or parent(s)/LAR(s) to collect concomitant 
medications/vaccinations administered to treat AEs collected in the study.  
Additionally, the following 2 procedures will be performed at the clinic visit:  
• perform a symptom -directed physical assessment (including e.g., measurement of 
vital signs, body temperature [preferably oral] and a check of general appearance).  
• blood sampling to test immunogenicity (if with drawal occur at or prior to Visit 4 
[study Day 91]).  
If the Early Termination Visit is a telephone call, collect as much information as possible. 
Early Termination Visits include subjects who were randomi zed but not treated.  
The site will review with the subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s)  the plan of when 
information relating to the subject’s participation in the study may be available (e.g., 
study results, treatment assignments). It will also be discussed how information relating 
to the subject’s participati on in the study will be shared with the subject’s healthcare 
provider, if the subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s) chooses to share this information.

the subject’s participati on in the study.  
8.7. Study procedures during special circumstances  
During special circumstances (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance from 
local public health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be a pplied. For the duration of such special circumstances, the 
following measures may be implemented for enrolled subjects:  
• If the eDiary device was provided to the subject, it may be returned to the site by 
conventional mail after the end of the relevant da ta collection period (Visit 5).  
• Biological samples may be collected at a different location* other than the study site 
or at subject’s home. Biological samples should not be collected if they cannot be 
processed in a timely manner or appropriately stored u ntil the intended use.  
*It is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an alternate location. The investigator 
should ensure that this alternate location meets ICH GCP requirements, such as adequate 
facilities to perform study procedures, appropriate  training of the staff and documented 
delegation of responsibilities in this location. This alternate location should be covered by 
proper insurance for the conduct of study on subjects by investigator and staff at a site other 
than the designated study si te. Refer to local regulatory guidance on conduct of clinical 
trials during COVID -19. 
Impact on the Per Protocol Set (PPS) for immunogenicity will be determined on a case by 
case basis.  
9. DISCONTINUATION CRIT ERIA  
9.1. Discontinuation from the study  
From an analysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study refers to any subject who 
was not avail able for the concluding contact  foreseen in the protocol.  
All data and samples collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will 
be used for t he analysis.  
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study when no study procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.  
Investigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for  
scheduled visits or follow -up. 
Primary reason for study withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF . The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study  was made by 
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  74 the subject himself/herself, by the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s), or by the investigator, as 
well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:  
• SAE s requiring expedited reporting (p lease refer to section 12.5.9.2  for the details)  
• Unsolicited non -serious AE 
• Solicited adverse event  
• Protocol deviation  
• Withdrawal by subject, not due to an adverse event*  
• Migrated/Mov ed from the study area  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor study termination  
• Other (specify)  
*In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she/the subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for 
withdrawal of consent, if specified by the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s), in the 
eCRF . 
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/AEs must be clearly 
distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study as result of a SAE/AE until resolution 
of the e vent (see Section 12.5.11 ). 
The reasons for premature withdrawal from the stud y include adverse event, death, 
withdrawal of consent, lost to follow -up, administrative reason, and protocol deviation. 
These reasons are described in greater detail below.  
Adverse Event:  
For any subject withdrawn from study participation prior to the planned Study 
Termination Call, it is important to determine if an AE wa s associated with the reason for 
discontinuing the study. This AE must be identified on the AE eCRF page by indicating 
“Withdrawn from study due to AE”. Any ongoing AEs at the time of study withdrawal 
must be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
Subjects who develop a SAE judged to be possibly related to the study vaccine, including 
hypersensitivity reactions, should not receive subsequent vaccination.  
Death:  
For any subject withdrawn from study participation due to death, this should be noted on 
the Study Termination eCRF page and the associated SAE that led to the death must be 
reported.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
205419  (MENB REC 2ND GEN -045 ( V72_79))  
Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  75 Withdrawal of consent:  
The subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s) can withdraw consent for participation in the study 
at any time without penalty or loss of benefit to whi ch the subject is otherwise entitled. 
Reason for early termination should be deemed as “withdrawal of consent” if the subject 
withdraws from participation due to a non -medical reason (i.e., reason other than AE). If 
the subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s) intend(s) to withdraw consent from the study, the 
investigator should clarify if the subject will withdraw completely from the study or if the 
subject will continue study participation for safety, or a subset of other study procedures. 
If the subject requests complete withdrawal from the study, no further study interventions 
will be performed with the subject.  
If a subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s) withdraw(s) consent but does not revoke the HIPAA 
(The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) authoriz ation, the Sponsor will 
have full access to the subject’s medical records, including termination visit information. 
If a subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s) revokes only the HIPAA authorization, the Sponsor 
will have full access to all of the subject’s medical  records prior to the date and time of 
written revocation.  
Lost to Follow -Up: 
For subjects who are not accessible through call for final visit (study Day 451), or for 2 
consecutive visits, study staff are encouraged to make at least 3 documented attempts to 
contact the subject by telephone and at least one documented written attempt to contact 
the subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s) to encourage the completion of study termination 
procedures. These efforts to contact the subject should be recorded in the source 
document. The termination date for the subject to be captured on the Study Termination 
eCRF page is the date of the last successful contact (clinic visit or telephone) with the 
subject.  Please refer to Section 9.3 for further details.  
Administrative Reason:  
Examples for subjects withdrawn from the study due to administrative reason can 
include: Sponsor decision to terminate the study, subject meeting a pre -specified 
withdrawal criterion, subject discontinuation for insurance issues, moving, no time, etc. 
This reason should be noted in the Study Termination eCRF page and any ongoing AEs 
at the time of study withdrawal must be foll owed until resolution/stabilization.  
If the clinical study is prematurely terminated by the Sponsor, the investigator is to 
promptly inform the study subjects and local EC/IRB and should assure appropriate 
therapy and follow up for the subjects. All proced ures and requirements pertaining to the 
archiving of study documents should be followed. All other study materials (study 
medication/vaccines, etc.) must be returned to the Sponsor.  
For subjects who are withdrawn from the study due to receipt of an exclude d 
medication/vaccination or due to significant protocol non -compliance, this reason should 
be noted in the Study Termination eCRF page.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  76 Protocol Deviation:  
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of a study protocol. In general, subjects associated with protocol deviations 
may remain in the study unless continuation in the study jeopardizes the subject’s health, 
safety, or rights.  
Investigators will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Un der no 
circumstances should the investigator contact GSK or its agents, if any, monitoring the 
study to request approval of a protocol deviation, as no authori zed deviations are 
permitted. If the investigator feels a change to the protocol would improve th e conduct of 
the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment 
is agreed upon by GSK and approved by the IRB/EC and health authorities  it cannot be 
implemented.  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study, despite the protocol requirement for 
highly effective method of contraception, will not receive further vaccinations but should 
be encouraged to continue participating in the study for safety follow -up. The site must 
complete a Pregnancy Report eCRF (initial repor t) as soon as possible after learning of 
pregnancy occurrence (see Section 12.5.8  for further details). If the subject withdraws 
from the study for any of the above categories except death, the site will obtain 
permission from the subject to continue to remain in contact with her until the outcome of 
the pregnancy is known, even if the  outcome is not known until after the subject reaches 
the end of follow -up period.  
9.2. Discontinuation of study vaccine(s)  
A ‘withdrawal’ from the study vaccine(s)  refers to any subject who does not receive the 
complete treatment, i.e. when no further planned dose is administered from the date of 
withdrawal. A subject withdrawn from the study vaccine(s)  may continue further study 
procedures (safety or immunogenicity) if planned in the study protocol, as deemed 
appropriate by the investigator.  
Primary reason re lative to premature discontinuation of the study vaccine(s)  will be 
documented on the Vaccine Administration page/screen of the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to discontinue further vaccination/treatment was 
made  by the subject h imself/herself , by the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) , or by  the 
investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for 
withdrawal:  
• Adverse event requiring expedited reporting  
• Non-serious AE (specify)  
• Unsolicited non -serious AE 
• Solicited adverse event  
• Not willing to be vaccinated  
• Other (specify).

11 October  2022  77 9.3. Lost to follow -up 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The follow ing actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon 
as possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the a ssigned 
visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possi ble, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s 
medical record.  
• Should the subject continue to be unreachabl e, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up.  
10. STATISTICAL C ONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.  Sample size determination  
The target sample size is 750 subjects evaluable for immunogenicity (250 subjects per 
study group). Evaluable subjects mean  all subjects included in the set for the primary 
statistical analysis defined in Section  10.2) Considering that approximately 20% of the 
enrolled subjects might withdraw or not be evaluable for immunogenicity, the target 
sample size to be enrolled is 945 subjects (315 subjects p er study group). These sample 
sizes were calculated based on the standard deviations from corresponding treatments in 
the mentioned studies, the non -inferiority margin of 0.5 and the expected ratio GMR of 
the GMTs (or GMCs) of 0.9.  
10.1.1.  Hypotheses related to pr imary and secondary objectives  
10.1.1.1.  Primary Immunogenicity Objectives  
The statistical hypotheses and analyses are based on the common assumption that the 
logarithmically (base of 10) transformed hSBA titers are normally distributed.  
Non-inferiority of concomitant rMenB+OMV NZ with MenACWY to rMenB+OMV NZ  
The null (not non -inferiority) and the alternative (non -inferiority) hypotheses are:  
 versus

and M07 -0241084 , and  and are the population means of the 
logarithmically (base of 10) transformed hSBA titers for the ith serogroup B strain at one 
month after the second vaccination in Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenB 
respectively.  
Non-inferiority of conc omitant rMenB+OMV NZ with MenACWY to MenACWY  
The null (inferiority) and the alternative (non -inferiority) hypotheses are:  
versus

where j=1,…,4 is an index over the four serogroups A, C, W and Y, and 
j MenACW YA , ,  and

are the population means of the logarithmically (base of 10) transformed 
hSBA titers for the jth MenACWY serogroup at one month after the first vaccination in 
Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenACWY respectively.  
The threshold of 
3 . 0 2 log ) 5 . 0 ( log10 10 −  − =  is the non -inferiority margin.  
The choice of non -inferiority margin of 0.5 for the assessment of GMT ratios for the four 
serogroup B test strains is based on previous clinical study results (post -vaccination 
GMTs) showing that individual titers would, on average, rem ain protective for all 4 
strains if individual titers were reduced to half (see section 10.1). 
The non -inferiority margin of 0.5 for the assessment of GMT ratios for the MenACWY 
serogroups was found appropriate in view of the Center for Biologics Evaluation & 
Research (CBER) concurrence with the 2 -fold equivalence margin (for a lot -to-lot 
consistency study) at the End -of-Phase II meeting in 2006.  
The 8 hypotheses associated with the primary objective  will be tested simultaneously, to 
control for the type I error rate.  The testing of the hypotheses will be done simultaneously 
on all the strains and serogroups  . 
10.1.1.2.  Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives  
There is a non -inferiority test associated with the concomitant rMenB+OMV NZ with 
MenACWY to MenACWY using ELISA GMC s.

11 October  2022  80 10.1.2.  Sample size calculation  
For the immune response to rMenB+OMV NZ, sample size calculations are based on 
hSBA titer data from the GSK V102_03 and V72_41 studies and for the immune 
response to MenACWY, data from GSK V59P13E1 study and V102_02 study (ELISA 
GMC s) is used.  
Sample size/power calculations are based on specific fixed values for the  
• non-inferiority margin,  
• standard deviations of (the distributions of) the logarithmically transformed (b ase of 
10) hSBA titers for the strains  M14459 , 96217, NZ98/254 and M07 -0241084.  
• standard deviations of (the distributions of) the logarithmically transformed (base of 
10) hSBA titers for the serogroups A, C, W and Y,  
• ratios of the GMTs medians of (the dist ribution of) the hSBA titers for strains 
M14459, 96217, NZ98/254 and M07 -0241084 when rMenB+OMV NZ is 
administered with MenACWY versus when rMenB+OMV NZ is administered alone  
(one ratio per strain),  
• ratios of the GMTs/GMCs of (the distribution of) the hSB A titers for the serogroups 
A, C, W and Y when MenACWY is administered with rMenB+OMV NZ vs when 
MenACWY is administered alone  (one ratio per serogroup).  
Standard Deviations for hSBA Titer:  
In Table 19 the standard deviations are listed that were used in the power calculation, 
along with the 80% upper limit of the confidence interval  (CI) for standard deviation.  
For the primary objective 1, hypothesis 1,  testing of rMenB+OMV NZ when given 
concomitantly with MenACWY to rMenB+OMV NZ given alone, test of treatment 
Group MenB+MenACWY versus treatment Group MenB, the standard deviations from

group need to be enrolled. For the study, with 3 treatment groups, N=945 subjects need to 
be enrolled to have 750 eligible subjects.  
10.2.  Populations for a nalyses  
For purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined:  
Analysis Set  Description  
Enrolled  All subject s who sign informed consent  
Exposed  All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment. The allocation in a group is done 
in function of the administered tr eatment.  
Full Analysis  All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment and have post -vaccination 
immunogenicity data  
Per Protocol  All subject s who received at least 1 dose of the study treatment to which they are randomi zed and 
have post-vaccination data (Full Analysis Set) minus subjects with protocol deviations that lead to 
exclusion  
10.3.  Statistical  analyses  
10.3.1.  Subjects d isposition  
Number of subjects enrolled, vaccinated subjects and completed  will be described by 
group. Reason for early withdraw will be described by group. Full analysis and per -
protocol analysis population set will be described by group.  
10.3.2.  Demography and baseline characteristics analyses  
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum) 
for age, height, weight and body mass  index (BMI)  at enrolment will be calculated 
overall and by Group.  
Distributions of subjects by sex, race, ethnic origin, geographical locations (US sites, 
non-US sites, if applicable) and according to the pre-vaccination  hSBA titer (per strain, 
<LLOQ or ≥LLOQ)  will be summarized overall and by Group.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  84 10.3.3.  Immunogenicity analyses  
The primary analysis will be based on the Per Protocol Set of immunogenicity for the 
primary and secondary (non -inferiority) immunogenicity objective. If, in any study 
group, the percentage of enrolled or vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded 
from the per -protocol set for analysis of immunogenicity is 5% or more, a second 
analysis based on the Full Analysis Set  (FAS)  will be performed to complement the per -
protocol analysis. Supportive analyses using the FAS will also be performed for the 
primary immunogenicity endpoints.  
Endpoint  Statistical  Analysis Methods  
Primary  Within group assessment  
• For Group MenB+MenACWY and Group MenB: hSBA GMTs for rMenB+OMV NZ against each 
of the four serogroup B test strains (M14459, 96217, NZ98/254  and M07 -0241084 *) at one 
month after the second vaccination for rMenB+OMV NZ (Visit 4) will be calculated.  
• For Group MenB+MenACWY and Group MenACWY: hSBA GMTs against each of the four 
serogroups A, C, W and Y for MenACWY at one month after the study vaccination of 
MenACWY (Visit 2) will be calculated.  
Between group assessment  
• The ratio of hSBA GMTs between Grou p MenB+MenACWY versus Group MenB when 
administered alone  [Group MenB] , at one month after the second vaccination  of MenB  will be 
calculated . 
• The ratio of hSBA GMTs between Group MenB+MenACWY versus Group MenACWY when 
administered alone [Group MenACWY], at one month after the (study) vaccination of 
MenACWY will be calculated.  
Secondary  Within groups assessment  
• ELISA GMCs  against each of the four  serogroups A, C, W and Y at one month after the (study) 
vaccination  of MenACWY  for Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenACWY.  The percentage of 
subjects  (and 2 -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CIs)  with hSBA titers ≥LLOQ for each  and all  
serogroup B test strains at one month after the first and second vaccination for Groups 
MenB+MenACWY  and MenB;  and for serogroups A, C, W and Y at one month after the (study) 
vaccination for Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenACWY . 
• hSBA GMTs against each of the four serogroup B test strains  at baseline and one month after 
first vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ for Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenB . 
• hSBA GMRs (c ompared to baseline) against each serogroup B test strains at one month after 
the first and second vaccination for Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenB; and against  
serogroups A, C, W and Y at one month after the (study) vaccination for Groups 
MenB+MenACWY and MenACWY.  
• The percentage of subjects  (and 2 -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson CIs)  with fourfold increase in 
hSBA titers relative to baseline for each serogroup B test strains at one month after the first 
and second vaccination for Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenB; and for serogroups A, C, W 
and Y at one month after the (study) vaccination for Groups MenB+MenACWY and MenACWY.  
Between group assessment  
• For all four serogroups A, C, W and Y, non-inferiority of the responses to MenACWY when 
given with rMenB+OMV NZ compared to MenACWY administered alone will be assessed in 
terms of ELISA GMC s. 
• The ratio of hSBA GMTs between Group MenB+MenACWY versus Group MenB when 
administered alone  at one month after the first vaccination , will be calculated . 
• Between group  differences (Group MenB+MenACWY vs Group MenB ; and Group 
MenB+MenACWY vs Group MenACWY), at one month after the first and the second 
vaccination  (as applicable)  will be calcu lated, as well as their associated 95% CIs.  
*The NHBA indicator strain M07 -0241084 may be subject to change during the study, before clinical testing starts. In 
this case, this change will be documented in the clinical repo rt.

All safety analyses will be performed on the exposed  set. 
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  Analysis of Solicited Adverse events  
• Frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each AE will be presented for each 
symptom severity. Summary tables showing the occurrence of any local or systemic AE 
overall and at each time point will also be presented.  
• Post-vaccination solicited AEs reported from Day 1 (of vaccination) to Day 7 will be 
summarized for the intervals Day  1-3, Day 4 -7, Day 1 -7 by maximal severity and by group, 
excluding the 30-minute  measurement, which will be summarized separately. The severity of 
solicited local AEs, including injection -site erythema, induration, and swelling will be 
summarized according  to categori es based on linear measurements  as presented in Table 
29. 
• Injection site pain and systemic AEs (including fever) occurring up to 7 days after each 
vaccination will be summarized according to “mild”, “moderate” or “severe ”. 
• Each solicited local and systemic AE will also be further summarized as “none” versus “any”.  
Use of antipyretics and analgesics will be summarized by frequency by type of use (prophylactic 
versus treatment) and percentage of subjects reporting use.  
• Body temperature will be summar ized by 0.5 °C increments from 38.0 °C /100.4°F  up to ≥40 
°C/104.0°F  and will be broken down according ly by route of measurement.  
Analysis of Unsolicited Adverse Events  
This analysis applies to all AEs occurring during the study, judged either as possibly related, or not 
related to vaccination by the investigator, recorded in AE eCRF, with a start date on or after the 
date of first vaccination. All AEs starting prior to t he first vaccination will only be listed. The original 
verbatim terms used by investigators to identify AEs in the eCRFs will be mapped to preferred 
terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) dictionary. The AEs will then 
be grou ped by MedDRA preferred terms into frequency tables according to system organ class.  
All reported AEs, as well as AEs judged by the investigator as possibly related to study vaccine, will 
be summarized according to system organ class and preferred term wit hin system organ class. 
These summaries will be presented by vaccination group and by interval of study observation. 
When an AE occurs more than once for a subject, the maximal severity and strongest relationship 
to the group will be counted.  
Separate summ aries will be produced for the following categories:  
• Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
• Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)  for subjects who received rMenB+OMV NZ  
• Adverse events that are possibly related to vaccine.  
• Adverse event leading to withdrawal.  
• Adverse events leading to a medically attended visit.  
• Data listings of all AEs will be provided by subject. In addition, AEs in the categories above 
will be provided as listed data.  
Between groups assessment  
No statistical tests for between -group compariso ns will be performed . 
• The percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs during the 7 days 
(including the day of vaccination) following the first (Visit 1), the second (Visit 3) and the third 
(Visit 4) vaccination for all groups will be calc ulated.  
• The percentages of subjects with any unsol icited AEs (including all SAEs)  during the 30 days 
(including the day of vaccination) following the first (Visit 1), the second (Visit 3) and the third 
(Visit 4) vaccination  for all groups will be calculated.  
• The percentages of subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, and medically attended 
AEs, throughout the study period will be calculated.  
• The percentages of subjects with AESI throughout the study period will be calculated  (for 
subjects who  received rMenB+OMV NZ) .

11 October  2022  91 12.1.2.  Glossary of terms   
Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed 
medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce 
expected benefits (i. e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Adverse Event of 
Special Interest:  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs): are predefined 
(serious or non -serious) adverse events of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the product or program, for which 
ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the 
investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate, because such 
an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.  
Blinding:  A procedure in which  1 or more parties to the trial are kept 
unaware of the treatment assignment in order to reduce the 
risk of biased study outcomes. The level of blinding is 
maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, and only when 
the data are cleaned to an acceptable le vel of quality will 
appropriate personnel be unblinded or when required in  case 
of a serious adverse event. In an observer -blind study, the 
subject and the site and sponsor personnel involved in the 
clinical evaluation of the subjects are blinded while oth er 
study personnel may be aware of the treatment assignment 
(see Section 7.3 for details on obse rver-blinded studies).  
Certified copy:  A copy (irre spective of the type of media used) of the original 
record that has been verified (i.e. by a dated signature or by 
generation through a validated process) to have the same 
information, including data that describe the context, content, 
and structure, as th e original.  
Child in care:  A child who has been placed under the control or protection 
of an agency, organi zation , institution or entity by the courts, 
the government or a government body, acting in accordance 
with powers conferred on them by law or regul ation. The 
definition of a child in care can include a child cared for by 
foster parents or living in a care home or institution, provided 
that the arrangement falls within the definition above. The 
definition of a child in care does not include a child wh o is 
adopted or has an appointed legal guardian.

11 October  2022  92 Combination 
product:  Combination product comprises any combination of  
− drug  
− device  
− biological product  
Each drug, device and biological product included in a 
combination product is a constituent part.  
Eligible:  Qualified for enrolment into the study based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
End of Study (EoS)  
(Synonym of End of 
Trial)  Last subject last visit (LSLV) (Visit X) or Date of the last 
testing/reading released of the Human Biological Samples or 
imaging data, related to primary and secondary endpoints, 
whichever occurs later. EoS must be achieved no later than 8 
months after LSLV. EoS cannot be before LSLV . 
Epoch:  Interval of time in the planned conduct of a study. An epoch is 
associated with a purpose (e.g. screening, randomi zation, 
treatment, follow -up), which applies across all arms of a 
study. NOTE: Epoch is intended as a standardi zed term to 
replac e: period, cycle, phase, stage.

11 October  2022  93 Investigator : A person  responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at a 
trial site. If a trial is conducted by a team of individuals at a 
trial site, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team 
and may be called the principal investigator.   
The investigator can  delegate trial -related duties and functions 
conducted at the trial site to qualified individual or party to 
perform those trial -related duties and functions  
Legally acceptable 
representative : 
(The terms legal 
representative or 
legally authori zed 
representative are 
used in some 
settings.)  An individual or juridical or other body authori zed under 
applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective subject, 
to the subject's participation in the clinical trial.  
Medical device 
deficiency : A device d eficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with 
respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or 
performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use 
errors and information supplied by the manufacturer.  
Medically attended 
adverse events:  Symptoms or illnesses requiring hospitalization, or emergency 
room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider.  
Menarche:  Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a young 
female and is preceded by several changes associated with 
puberty including breast development and pubic hair growth. 
Menarche usually occurs within 1 -2 years of breast 
development, thelarche. However, a young female can 
become pregnant before her first menses. Thus, a conservative 
definition of non -childbea ring potential in a pre -menarcheal 
female is a young female who has not yet entered puberty as 
evidenced by lack of breast development (palpable glandular 
breast tissue).  
Menopause:  Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of 
menstrual cycl es, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive 
potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts 
menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate 
clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years.

11 October  2022  94 Pharmacogenomics : The Internat ional Council on Harmoni zation  (ICH) E15 
Guidance for Industry defines pharmacogenomics as Study of 
variation of DNA and RNA characteristics as related to drug 
or treatment response. Pharmacogenetics, which is a subset of 
pharmacogenomics, is “the study of  variations in DNA 
sequence as related to drug response.” Pharmacogenomic 
biomarkers include germline (host) DNA and RNA as well as 
somatic changes (e.g. mutations) that occur in cells or tissues. 
Pharmacogenomic biomarkers are not limited to human 
samples  but include samples from viruses and infectious 
agents as well as animal samples. The term pharmacogenomic 
experiment includes both the generation of new genetic or 
genomic (DNA and/or RNA) data with subsequent analysis as 
well as the analysis of existing  genetic or genomic data to 
understand drug or treatment response (pharmacokinetics, 
safety, efficacy or effectiveness, mode of action). Proteomic

meningococcal B indicator strains M14459, 96217, NZ98/254 and M07 -0241084 *. Each 
of these strains measures bactericidal activity primarily directed against one  of the major 
bactericidal antigens included in the vaccine: strain M14459 measures hSBA against the 
741 part of the 936 -741 antigen, also known as fHbp variant 1.1; strain 96217 measures 
hSBA against antigen 961c, also known as NadA; strain NZ98/254 measu res hSBA 
against PorA P1.4, the immunodominant antigen in the OMV NZ vaccine component; 
strain M07 -0241084 measures hSBA against  the 287 part of the 287 -953 antigen , also 
known as NHBA.

11 October  2022  97 MenACWY serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBA) - Menveo : 
• The induction of functional anti -meningococcal activity by bactericidal antibodies 
directed against N. meningitidis  serogroups A, C, W and Y will be also determined 
by a validated hSBA with a new format, so -called agar overlay hSBA, using a higher 
throughput colony counting method compared to the manual hSBA based on the Tilt 
method.  
This new hSBA that has been  validated  for the 4 MenACWY serogroups  is also based on 
the measurement of human complement -dependent bactericidal killing of meningococci . 
As with all functional hSBAs, the assay includes a first step of heat inactivation of the 
human serum samples to inactivate the endogenous complement, followed by serial 
dilution of the serum samples in which a fixed amount of bacteria and of human 
exogenous complement are added. The reactions are incubated to allow the association of 
meningococcal specific antibo dies and their target antigen. The antibody -antigen 
complex activates the classical pathway of complement which ultimately results in 
bacterial lysis.  
As a measure of the meningococcal specific antibody titer of each serum sample, the 
MenACWY agar -overlay hSBA follows the principle of detecting and counting the 
surviving meningococcal bacteria after bacterial growth within solid agar media, using an 
automatic colony counter . 
MenACWY IgG ELISA  
• The anti -MenACWY total IgG antibody (Ab) concentrations will be m easured by 
using a validated Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to evaluate the 
immunogenicity of the capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, W and Y in 
MenACWY vaccine.  
• As per recent recommendation from Authorities, this MenACWY IgG ELISA is 
under re -validation for the 4 serogroups in alignment with the most recent guidelines 
and accepted practices on assay validation.  
• The assay characteristics (e.g. validated assay cut -offs and units) for each of the 
serogroup will be determined during the cou rse of the study at the time of the 
generation of new validated data. Any of these changes will be documented in a 
protocol amendment or in the clinical study report.  
Protocol -specific requirements for inclusion or exclusion of subjects are detailed in 
Section 6 of the protocol.  
The investigator is not allowed to do extra testing on samples outside of what has been 
agreed upon by the ethic committees.

− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB/IEC, European regulation 
536/2014 for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable local 
regulations . 
12.4.1.1.  Responsibilities of the Investigator  
Prior to study start  and at any time the protocol is amended during study conduct, the 
investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to 
conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and 
procedures fo und in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to 
GSK monitors, auditors, GSK Clinical Quality Assurance representatives, designated 
agents of GSK, IRBs/ECs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the 
clinical  site is requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must inform GSK 
immediately that this request has been made.  
In addition to what is stated in the  Investigator  Agreement , the investigator is also 
responsible for the following:  
• Maintaining a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigator has 
delegated significant study -related duties.  
• Demonstrating the capability of recruiting the required number of suitable subjects 
within the recruitment period.  
• Demonstrating sufficient time and staffing to properly conduct and complete the 
study within the agreed study period.  
• Ensuring that qualified trained health ca re professionals (see glossary of terms ) are 
responsible for all study -related medical decisions and for ensuring appropriate 
medical car e of subjects experiencing any adverse event (AE) related to the study.  
• If permission to do so is given by the subject’s parent (s)/LAR(s) , ensuring that the 
subject’s primary qualified healthcare provider is informed of the subject’s 
participation in the s tudy.  
The investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol 
without agreement by the Sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favourable 
opinion from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an  
immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor(s), change of telephone 
number(s)). In addition, the investigator, or person designated by the investigat or, should 
document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol.  
The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects without prior IRB/IEC 
approval/favourable opinion.  As soon as possible, the implemented deviation or change,

11 October  2022  100 the reasons for it, and, if appropriate, the proposed protocol amendment(s) should be 
submitted:  
• to the IRB/IEC for review and approval/favourable opinion,  
• to the Sponsor for agreement and, if required,  
• to the regulatory authority(ies).  
12.4.1.2.  Protocol Amendments  
An amendment is a written description of change(s) to or formal clarification of a study 
protocol which may impact on the conduct of the clinical study, potential benefit of the 
clinical study , or may affect subject safety, including changes of study objectives, study 
design, subject population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative 
aspects. An administrative change of a study protocol is a minor correction or 
clarificat ion that has no significant impact on the way the clinical study is to be 
conducted and no effect on subject safety (e.g., change of telephone number(s), logistical 
changes). Protocol amendments must be approved by GSK, health authorities where 
required, a nd the IRB/EC. In cases when the amendment is required in order to protect 
the subject safety, the amendment can be implemented prior to IRB/EC approval. 
Notwithstanding, the need for formal approval of a protocol amendment, the investigator 
is expected to  take any immediate action required for the safety of any subject included in 
this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, GSK 
should be notified of this action, the IRB/EC at the study site, and, if required by local 
regulations, the relevant health authority) should be informed within 10 working days.  
12.4.2.  Financial d isclosure  
Investigators and sub -investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate 
financial information as requested to allow the sponsor  to submit complete and accurate 
financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interest s during  the 
study and for 1 year after completion of the study.  
12.4.3.  Informed consent process  
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject  or his/her legally authori zed representative and answer all questions regarding the 
study.  
Subject s must be informed that their participation is voluntary.  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing written informed 
consent or assent. Before the start of the study, the investigator will have the informed 
consent and any other materials that will be provided to the subjects reviewed and 
approved by the IRB/EC. This review and approval will be documented and stored with 
other study documents. The investigator or designee must fully inform the subject or 
subject's parent(s)/LAR(s)  of all pertinent aspects of the study. A copy of the written 
informed consent will be given to the subject or the designee. The subject/designee must

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  101 be allowed ample time to ask about the details of the study and to make a decision as to 
whether or not t o participate in the study. The subject and/or LAR(s) must  sign the 
consent form indicating their agreement to participate in the study before any study -
related procedures are conducted. The informed consent process may be conducted 
approximately  2 weeks  prior to vaccination on day 1. If the subject and/or LAR(s) is 
unable to read and write, a witness must be present during the informed consent 
discussion and at the time of informed consent signature.  
Freely given and written or witnessed /thumb printed info rmed consent must be obtained 
from each subject and/or each subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and subject informed assent, as 
appropriate, prior to participation in the study.  
The content of Informed Consent Form (ICF)  must meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50, 
local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study center . 
GSK will prepare a model ICF which will embody the ICH GCP and GSK required 
elements. While it is s trongly recommended that this model ICF is to be followed as 
closely as possible, the informed consent requirements given in this document are not 
intended to pre -empt any local regulations which require additional information to be 
disclosed for informed consent to be legally effective. Clinical judgement, local 
regulations and requirements should guide the final structure and content of the local 
version of the ICF.  
In accordance with the ICH Harmoni zed Tripartite Guidelines for GCP , those subjects 
who c an only be enrolled in the study with the consent of the subject’s legally acceptable 
representative (e.g. minors), should be informed about the study to the extent compatible 
with the subject’s understanding and, if capable, the subject should sign and pe rsonally 
date a written IAF. It is required that the assent be signed by each subject, if capable, in 
addition to the informed consent that is to be signed by his/her legal representative. It 
should be assessed whether an assent is required depending of th e age of the study 
population and the local requirements.  
The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained 
before the subject  was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was 
obtained. The authori zed person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF.  
For subjects who become legally emancipated during the course of the study, e.g. become 
of the legal age of consent, re -consent is sought in accordance with local laws and 
regulations. The subj ect can provide consent by signing an ICF, similar to that provided 
to the parent(s)/ LAR(s) at the study start, which summari zes the study and includes a 
consent statement and documents that the subject agrees to continue participating in the 
study.  
Subjec ts must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) or an  ICF 
addendum during their participation in the study.  
A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the subject  or the subject ’s parent(s)/LAR(s) .  
Subjects who are rescreened are required  to sign a new ICF.

his/her participation in a study. The investigator is also acc ountable for determining a 
minor's capacity to assent to participation in a research study according to the local laws 
and regulations.  
12.4.4.  Data protection  
Subject s will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any subject  records or 
datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject  names 
or any information which would make the subject  identifiable will not be transferred.  
The subject  must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the subject .  
The subject  must be informed that his/her medical records m ay be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance auditors or other authori zed personnel appointed by the sponsor, by 
appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
12.4.5.  Publication policy  
GSK aims to publish the results of th is stud y in searchable, peer reviewed scientific 
literature . GSK will target to submit  within 18 months from LSLV for interventional 
studies and from the completion of the analysis for non -interventional studies and follows 
the guidance from the International Committ ee of Medical Journal Editors.  
12.4.6.  Dissemination of clinical study d ata 
The key design elements of this protocol will be posted on the GSK Clinical Study 
Register and on publicly accessible registers including Clinicaltrials.gov . Where required, 
protocol summaries will also be posted on national or regional clinical trial registers or 
databases (e.g. EudraCT database) in compliance with the applicable regulations.  
GSK also assures that results will be submitted to Clinicaltrials.gov  within the required

retention period. No records may  be destroyed during the retention period without the 
written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or 
party without written notification to the sponsor.  
12.4.8.  Source d ocuments  
Source documents provide evidence for the exist ence of the subject and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Investigator should maintain a record of the location(s) of 
their source documents.   
Data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent 
with the s ource documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may 
need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. 
Also, current medical records must be available.  
Definition of what constitutes source data  and source documents  can be found in  the 
section 12.1.2 . 
12.4.9.  Study and s ite closure  
GSK  Biologicals  or its designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the 
study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of GSK  Biologicals , provided there 
is sufficient notice given to account for patient’s safe exit from study participation . Study 
sites regular closure  will be upon study completion. A study site is considered closed 
when all required data/documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site 
closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include 
but are not limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines

recordi ng, evaluating, follow -up, and r eporting  
12.5.1.  Definition of AE  
12.5.1.1.  AE Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the 
study treatment.  
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavo urable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment.  
12.5.1.2.  Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerb ation of the condition/indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccines  administr ation even 
though they may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
vaccines  or a concurrent m edication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).  
• Signs, symptoms temporally associated with study vaccines  administration.  
• Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action.  
• Pre- or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated procedures 
(i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
• Medically attended visits related to adverse events (e.g. Hospital stays, physician 
visits and emergency room visits).  
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section  12.5.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
Solicited AEs are derived from organized data collection systems, such as Subject Diaries 
or interview.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  106 The signs, symptoms, and/or clinica l sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
12.5.1.3.  Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience adm ission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms pre sent in a subject prior to the 
first study vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history section 
of the eCRF.  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.  
12.5.2.  Definit ion of SAE  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death,  
b. Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe.  
c. Requires hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization , 
Note: In general, hospitali zation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospitalization  are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hosp italization  or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospitali zation’ occurred , or was necessary, 
the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization  for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, OR  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained 
ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in t he offspring of a study subject . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
205419  (MENB REC 2ND GEN -045 ( V72_79))  
Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  107 Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporti ng is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization  but may jeopardi ze the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsion s 
that do not result in hospitalization . 
All AEs which do not fall into these categories are defined as non -serious . 
It should be noted that a severe AE need not be serious in nature and that a SAE need not, 
by definition, be severe.  
SAEs will be captured both on the Vaccines Serious Adverse Event (VSAE) form as well 
as on the AE eCRF. All SAEs will be evaluated by the investigator for relationship of the 
event to study vaccine.  
12.5.3.  Solicited adverse events  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to solicited signs an d symptoms (“solicited adverse 
events”) occurring in the hours and days following a vaccination, to be collected by the 
subjects/parent(s)/LAR(s) for 7 consecutive days  (with ongoing solicited AEs collected 
until resolution or day 30, whichever occurs first) , using a pre -defined Subject Diary  . 
The following solicited adverse events are included in the Subject Diary. Each adverse 
event is to be assessed using the scoring system reported in parentheses below:  
The collected data will be entered into the Subject eDiary. Please see Section 12.5.8  for 
more detail.  
a. Solicited local (injection -site) adverse events  
The following local (injecti on-site) AE s will be solicited:  
Table 26 Solicited local adverse events * 
All age groups  
Pain at injection site  
Redness  at injection site  
Swelling at injection site  
Induration at injection site  
* Solicited local AEs occurring within 30 minutes after vaccination.  
b. Solicited systemic  adverse events  
The following systemic  AEs will be solicited:

Adolescents (from 11 years of age) and adults  
Fatigue  
Fever (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/ 100.4°F)  
Nausea  
Headache  
Myalgia  
Arthralgia  
Note: Subjects/parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to measure and record the body 
temperature  (preferably oral)  in the evening. Should additional temperature 
measurements be performed at other times of day, subjects/parent(s)/LAR(s) will be 
instructed to record the highest temperature in the eDiary. 
The study staff must review the data entered into the Subject Diar y as described in 
Section  12.5.8 . 
12.5.3.1.  Other Solicited Adverse Events  
The use of analgesics/antipyretics for either prophylactic or treatment purposes wi ll be 
recorded as other solicited events in the Subject Diary (eDiary) and subsequently 
recorded onto the eCRFs and subject medical records.  
The study staff must review the data entered into the Subject Diary as described in 
Section  12.5. 8. 
Note: Any solicited adverse event that meets any of the following criteria must be entered 
into subjects’ source document (see Section 12.5.8 ) and also as an adverse event on the 
Adverse Event eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic adverse event that leads to a visit to a healthcare provider 
(medically attended a dverse event, see Section  12.5.8.3.3 ). 
• Solicited local or systemic adverse event leading to the subject withdrawing from the 
study or the subject being withdrawn from the study by the investigator (adverse 
event leading to withd rawal).  
• Solicited local or systemic adverse event that otherwise meets the definition of a 
serious adverse event (see Section  12.5.2 ). 
12.5.4.  Unsolicited  adverse events  
An unsolicited adverse event is an adverse event that was not solicited using a Subject 
Diary and that was spontaneously communicated by a subjects /parent(s)/LAR(s)  who has 
signed the informed consent . Please see Section 12.5.3.1  for more detail , where the 
criteria are listed . 
Parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the site as soon as possible to report 
potential unsolicited AEs that required hospitalization , or emergency room visit, or visit 
to/by a health care provider  that were of concern to the subjects/parent(s)/LAR(s). The 
detailed information about the reported unsolicited AEs will be collected by the qualif ied 
site personnel during the interview and will be documented in the subject’s records.

205419  (MENB REC 2ND GEN -045 ( V72_79))  
Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October  2022  109 Unsolicited AEs  will be collected during interview with the subjects/parent(s)/LAR(s) 
and by review of available medical records at the next visit.  Unsolicited AEs will be 
reviewed at the safety follow -up calls as well.  
All unsolicited AEs will be collected during the first 30 days after the first (Visit 1), 
second (Visit 3) and third (Visit 4) injection. Unsolicited AEs leading to vaccine/study 
withdrawal, medically attended AEs, AESI and SAEs will be collected during the entire 
study period starting from signature of informed consent until study termination.  
12.5.5.  Adverse events of special interest  (AESI s) 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are pr edefined (serious or non -serious) 
adverse events of scientific and medical concern specific to the product or program, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor 
can be appropriate, because such an event might w arrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.  
12.5.5.1.  Arthritis  
Cases of arthritis are defined according to the following ad -hoc definition:  
• Presence of a physical exam findings of swelling, redness, heat, or limitation in 
range of motio n and/or  
• Presence of a diagnostic imaging studies interpreted by a health care provider as 
demonstrating evidence of joint inflammation and/or arthrocentesis results 
evidencing inflammation.  
Due to the heterogeneity of the presentation of arthritis which c an be either acute or 
chronic, the threshold of duration of signs/symptoms  of 6 weeks is to be considered.  . 
The list of PTs corresponding to the diagnosis of arthritis, are those included in the 
MedDRA SMQ Narrow “Arthritis”. For any new diagnosis of arthritis (serious or non -
serious) in a study subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete, an electronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and an ad -hoc eCRF page on arthritis to further 
characterize this AESI.  
12.5.5.2.  Potential immune -mediated diseases  
Potential immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of AESIs that include 
autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest 
which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology. AEs that need to be recorded and 
reported as pIMDs include those listed in the Table 28. Please refer to section 12.5.9.2  for 
reporting details . 
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. pathophysiology 
involving systemic or organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be 
recorded as a pIMD.

11 October 2022  112 When there is enough evidence to make any of the above diagnoses, the AE must be 
reported as AESI. Symptoms, signs or conditions which might (or might not) represent 
the above diagnoses, should be recorded and reported as AEs but not as AESI until the 
final or definitive diagnosis has been determined, an d alternative diagnoses have been 
eliminated or shown to be less likely.   
In order to facilitate the documentation of pIMDs in the eCRF , a pIMD standard 
questionnaire and a list of MedDRA preferred terms (PTs)  and PT codes corresponding 
to the above diagno ses will be available to investigators at study start.  
12.5.6.  Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying as adverse events or serious adverse events  
In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, 
haem atology, urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g. x-ray imaging studies ) that 
are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as AE or SAE 
if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Sections 12.5.1  and 12.5.2 ). 
Clinically significant abnormal labor atory findings or other abnormal assessments that 
are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study will also 
be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings 
or other abnormal assessm ents that are associated with the disease being studied,  unless 
judged by the investigator as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, or 
that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be 
reported as AEs or  SAEs.  
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  
12.5.7.  Events or outcomes not qualifying as adverse events or serious 
adve rse events  
12.5.7.1.  Pregnancy  
Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating at the time of vaccination must not receive 
additional doses of study vaccines  but may continue other study procedures at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
While pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE, any adverse pregnancy outcome or 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded 
and reported as an AE or a SAE.  
Note: The pregnancy  should always be recorded on an electronic pregnancy repo rt. 
The following should always be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in 
Sections 12.5.9.1  and 12.5.9.4 : 
• Spontaneous pregnancy loss, including:  
− spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy loss before/at 22 weeks of 
gestation)

11 October 2022  113 − ectopic and molar pregnancy  
− stillbirth (intrauterine death of foetus after 22 weeks of gestation).  
Note: the 22 weeks ’ cut-off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the 
EMA Guideline on pregnancy exposure [ EMA , 2006 ]. It is recogni zed that national 
regulations might be different.  
• Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 
days of life).  
• Any congenital anomaly or birth defect identified in the offspring of a study subject 
(either during pregnancy, at birth or later) regardless of whether the foetus is 
delivered dead or alive. This includes anomalies identified by prenatal ultrasound, 
amniocentesis or examination of the products of conception aft er elective or 
spontaneous abortion.  
Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy AND considered 
by the investigator to be reasonably related to the study vaccines  will be reported to GSK  
Biologicals  as described in Section  12.5.9 . While the investigator is not obligated to 
actively seek this information from former s ubjects , he/she may learn of a pregnancy 
through spontaneous reporting.  
12.5.8.  Detecting and recording adverse events, serious adverse events 
and pregnancies  
An Electronic Diary (eDiary)  hereafter referred to as Subject Diary will be used in this 
study to capture solicited and unsolicited adverse events . The subject or subject’s 
parent/LAR  should be trained on how and when to complete each field of the Subject 
Diary.  
The subj ects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately should the subjects manifest any signs or sym ptoms they p erceive as 
serious.  
Subject  Diary training should be directed at the individual(s) who will perform the 
measurements of adverse events and who will enter the information into the Subject 
Diary. This individual may not be the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR (s), but if a person 
other than the sub ject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  enters information into the Subject 
Diary, this person’s identity must be documented in the  subject’s source record . Any 
individual that makes entries into the Subject Diary must receiv e training on completion 
of the Subject Diary at the time of the visit when Subject Diary is dispensed. This 
training must be documented in the subject’s source record.  
The same individual should preferably complete the Subject eDiary throughout the  
releva nt reporting period . 
The sub ject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) should be trained on how to self -measure local 
solicited adverse events and body temperature.  
The measurement of solicited local adverse events is to be performed using the ruler 
provided by the site.

(preferably oral) in the evening. Should additional temperature measurements be 
performed at other times of day, subjects/parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to r ecord 
the highest temperature in the Subject eDiary.  
Subject eDiary assignment and use:  
• Each sub ject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be assigned a Subject eDiary and 
shown how to use the device – this will include how to access the diary, performing 
test d ata entry on sample questions, and how to charge and store the device.  
• The sub ject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  will self -select a numeric access code secret 
to themselves. The same individual should preferably make the assessments and 
complete the Subject e Diary throughout the reporting period  (Visit 1 -Visit 5) . 
• The sub ject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  will select an alarm time that suits their daily 
routines whilst ensuring compliance with protocol requirements.  
Subject eDiary instructions must ensure that the sub ject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  
understands the following:  
• Timely completion of the Subject eDiary on a daily basis is a critical component to 
study participation.  
• The Subject eDiary will allow certain time windows for completion of each day’s 
observations.  
• The Subject eDiary employs the use of audio -visual alarms to ensure timely 
completion of data entry.  
• The trained and assigned user of the Subject eDiary must not share access codes with 
anyone.  
• A helpdesk will be provisioned for users of Subj ect eDiary in case of technical 
issues, though it must be stressed that the Helpdesk is not a replacement for normal 
medical care and no medical issues can be discussed with the agents.  
• The Subject eDiary itself must never be considered a substitute for di rect medical 
care and any concerns must be communicated to site staff as soon as possible.  
− The subje ct/parent(s)/LAR(s) will be contacted by the site staff on Days 15, 75, 
105, 181,  271, 361, and 451 (or Days 15, 75, 105, 181, and 271 for subjects 
who have  not reached Day 271 at the time this amendment takes effect via a 
scripted safety follow -up phone call. At, or in advance of each phone call the 
site will review the eDiary web -portal for responses entered by the

the phone call e.g. related to unsolicited adverse events,  concomitant 
vaccinations/medication and medically attended events  (Amended 11 O ctober 
2022 ). 
• Any new safety  information  reported  during  the safety follow -up phone call or site 
visits  (including  a solicited  adverse event ) cannot  be entered  into the Subject  eDiary.  
Such  information  must  be described  in the source  documents  as a verbally -reported

instructed to fully complete the Subject Diary each day, as per the instructions 
provided.  
• At or just in advance of each subject visit, site staff must review the Subject Diary 
data via the provider’s web portal.  It is necessary for site staff to acknowledge in the 
source documents that review of Subject Diary data for the preceding post -
vaccination period has been performed. At the end of the study it is necessary for the 
investigator to acknowledge in the eCRF t hat the review of Subject Diary data has 
been performed for each subject.  
• For vaccination visits, site staff must ensure that each subject’s Diary is prepared for 
data capture in the ensuing post -vaccination period by confirming the visit within the 
eDiary /eDiary system.  
• Any new safety information reported during the site visit (including a solicited 
reaction) cannot be entered into the Subject Diary. Such information must be 
described in the source notes as a verbally -reported event. Any adverse reaction 
reported in this fashion must be described as an unsolicited reaction and therefore 
entered on the adverse event page of the eCRF.  
12.5.8.1.  Post -vaccination reminders  
Reminder calls or alerts are not intended to be an interview for collection of safety data. 
If the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  wishes to describe safety information, this 
information should only be collected by a healthcare professional at the site, and the 
safety data described must be written down in the subject’s medical chart.  
12.5.8.1.1.  Subject Diary A lerts  
The subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will receive daily reminders via the Subject Diary 
device’s in -built audio -visual alarms to alert the user to complete the diary during the 
post vaccination period, which is from Day 1 though Day 7, after each v accination visit . 
The Subject Diary system will also allow for regular alerts to be issued via email to site 
staff indicating where subjects may need to be contacted due to:  
CONFIDENTIAL  
205419  (MENB REC 2ND GEN -045 ( V72_79))  
Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  116 • Non-compliance (i.e. failing to enter or transmit diary data),  
• Reporting of any severe solicited reactions,  
• Subject experienced an unsolicited adverse event that required hospitalization or visit 
to the emergency room or medically attended events that were of concern to the 
parents/LAR(s).  
Sites must assess these alerts when received and contact subjects as necessary. Please 
refer to Section 5.3 on the premature withdrawals from the study and  Section  12.5.8.3  on 
the evaluation of Adverse Events for guidance on necessary action in the event of one of 
these alerts.  
12.5.8.2.  Time period for detecting and recording adverse events, serio us 
adverse events and pregnancies  
All AEs during  30 days following administration of each dose  of study vaccines must be 
recorded into  the appropriate section of the e CRF , irrespective of intensity or whether or 
not they are considered vaccination -related.   
Any solicited AE that has not resolved within 30 days post vaccination and is reported 
during clinic visits or safety follow -up calls will be entered into the subject’s eCRF as an 
unsolicited AE. It will also be included in the subject’s source documents  at the site by 
the investigator/site staff as a verbally reported event. It will not be included in the 
Subject eDiary. These AEs will be analysed as unsolicited AEs (i.e. in the Unsolicited 
Safety Set).  
The time period for collecting and recording SAEs w ill begin at the first  receipt of study 
vaccines  and will end  12 months  following administration of the last  dose of study 
vaccines  for each subject. See Section  12.5.9  for instructions on reporting of SAEs.  
However, any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g. study treatment, 
protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to 
a GSK  Biologicals  product will be recorded from the time a subject consent  to participate 
in the study.  
All AEs occurring after the ICF is signed but prior to receiving study vaccine will be 
documented as an AE and recorded within source document and eCRF. However, any 
AEs occurring prior to receipt of any study vaccine will be analyzed separately from 
“treatment emergent” AEs (AEs occurr ing after administration of the first study vaccine). 
All AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study will be collected and recorded from 
the time of the first  receipt of study vaccines  until study end . 
In addition to the above -mentioned reporting requir ements and in order to fulfil 
international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study participation (i.e. 
protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy) or are 
related to a concurrent GSK  Biologicals  medication/va ccine will be collected and 
recorded from the time the subject consents to participate in the study until she/he is 
discharged from the study.

11 October 2022  117 The time period for collecting and recording pregnancies will begin at the first  receipt of 
study vaccine s and wi ll end 12 months following administration of the last  dose of study 
vaccine s. See section 12.5.9  for instructions on reporting of pregnancies.  
The time period for collecting and recording of AESIs will begin at the first  receipt of 
study vaccine s and will end 12 months following administration of the last  dose of study 
vaccine s. See section 12.5.9.5  for instructions on reporting of AESIs . 
12.5.8.3.  Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events  
12.5.8.3.1.  Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse 
events  
As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject or  the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) 
should be asked a non -leading question such as:  
‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccines or since the previous 
visit? ’ (for subjects above 18 years of age)  
OR 
‘Has your c hild acted differently or felt different in any way since receiving the vaccines  
or since the last visit? ’ (for subjects below 18 years of age)  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital p rogress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE in the eCRF. The investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the 
subject’s medical records to GS K Biologicals  instead of appropriately completing the 
eCRF. However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases 
are requested by GSK  Biologicals . In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded 
on the copies of the me dical records prior to submission to GSK  Biologicals . 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SA E and not the individual signs/symptoms.  
12.5.8.3.2.  Assessment of adverse events  
1. Assessment of intensity  
The intensity of the following solicited AEs will be assessed as described:

*Fever is defined as temperature 38.0°C/100.4°F. The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will 
be the oral cavity for subjects.  
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the  duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
Every effort should be made by the investigator to evaluate safety information reported 
by a s ubject for an underlying diagnosis and to capture this diagnosis as the event in the 
AE page. In other words, the practice of reporting only symptoms (e.g., “cough” or “ear 
pain”) are better reported according to the underlying cause (e.g., “asthma exacerb ation” 
or “otitis media”).  
CONFIDENTIAL  
205419  (MENB REC 2ND GEN -045 ( V72_79))  
Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  119 The intensity should be assigned to 1 of the following categories:  
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
2 (moderate)  = An AE which is  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities  
(In adults/adolescents, such an AE would, for example, prevent 
attendance at work/school and would necessitate the 
administration of corrective therapy.)  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘se rious’ when it meets 1 of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in Section  12.5.2 . 
2. Assessment of causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess  the relati onship between study vaccine(s) and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. In case of concomitant 
administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investigator should specify 
if the AE could be causally related to a specific vaccine/product administered (i.e . 
investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causal relati onship to 
a specific vaccine(s) cannot be determined,  the investigator should indicate the AE to be 
related to all products.  
Alter native plausible causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of th e event to the 
study vaccine(s) will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult  
the IB and/or Summary of Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) and/or Prescribing 
Information for marketed products to determine his/her assessment.  
There may be  situations when a SAE has occu rred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the in itial report to GSK  Biologicals . However, it is very 
important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to GSK  Biologicals . The 
investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingly. The causality assessment is  1 of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be  considered causally related to 
vaccination . Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the 
following question:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have b een caused by the study vaccine ? 
YES  : There is a reasonabl e possibility that the study vaccines  contributed to 
the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study vaccine(s). There are other, more likely 
causes and administration of the study vaccine(s)  is not suspected to 
have contributed to the AE.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  120 If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section  12.5.2 ), addit ional 
examinations/tests will be performed by the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.  
Possible contributing factors include:  
• Medical history.  
• Other medication.  
• Protocol required procedure.  
• Other procedure not required by the protocol.  
• Lack of efficacy of the vaccine(s) , if applicable.  
• Erroneous administration.  
• Other cause (specify).  
AEs will also be evaluated by the investigator for the co -existence of any of the other 
following conditions:  
“Medically attended AEs”: an AE that leads to a visit to a healthcare provider.  
AEs leading to withdrawal: AEs leading to study or vaccine withdrawal.  
If solicited or unsolicited AEs have been reported and the subject and/or 
parent(s)/ LAR(s) indicated that the symptoms requi red medical attendance or were of 
concern, the subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s) must be contacted for further information.  
When the subject and/or parent(s)/ LAR(s) is contacted for any of these reasons, the 
contact must be documented in the subject’s source  documentation.  
All AEs, regardless of severity, will be monitored until resolution or until the investigator 
assesses them as chronic or stable. All subjects experiencing AEs - whether considered 
associated with the use of the study vaccine(s) or not - must be monitored until symptoms 
subside and any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline, or until there is a 
satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until death, in which case a full 
pathologist’s report should be supplied, if pos sible. The investigator’s assessment of 
ongoing AEs at the time of each subject’s last visit should be documented in the subject’s 
medical chart.  
The end date of AEs ongoing at the time of each subject’s last visit and judged by the 
investigator as not ch ronic or stable should be documented in the source documents.  
3. Assessment of outcomes  
The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) 
recorded during the study as:  
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving.

• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.  
• Fatal (SAEs only).  
12.5.8.3.3.  Medically attended visits  
For each solicited and unsolicited symptom the subject experiences, the subject/subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked if the subject received medical attention defined as 
hospitalization , or an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel fo r any 
reason, including emergency room visits. This information will be recorded in the eCRF . 
12.5.8.4.  Recording  of AEs related to COVID -19 
For COVID -19 infection -related AEs, sites should follow routine AE/SAE processes as 
outlined in the protocol, using the following terms according to the latest  COVID -19 case 
definitions  criteria in effect  at the institution : 
• Suspected COVID -19 case  
• Probabl e COVID -19 case  
• Confirmed COVID -19 case  
If subject is diagnosed with COVID -19 as above , report each occurrence in the COVID -
19 Coronavirus Infection Assessment form . In addition, complete for each occurrence  as 
AE on the Non -Serious Adverse form or as SAE  on the Expedited Adverse Event Report 
form (depending on the level of seriousness as assessed by the Principal Investigator or 
deleg ate). Please also report the relevant medication s related to this event.  Follow the 
guidelines applicable for those forms on how to record COVID -19. 
12.5.9.  Reporting of serious adverse events, pregnancies, and other 
events  
12.5.9.1.  Prompt reporting of serious adverse events, pregnancies, and other 
events to GSK Biologicals   
SAEs that occur in  the time period defined in Section 12.5.8  will be reported promptly to 
GSK within the timeframes described in  Table 17, once the investigator determines that 
the event meets the protocol definition of a SAE.  
Pregnancies that occur in the time period defined in Section 12.5.8  will be reported 
promptly to GSK within the timeframes described in  Table 17, once the investigator 
becomes aware of the pregnancy.  
AESI s that occur in the time period defined in Section 12.5.8  will be reported promptly to 
GSK within the timeframes described in  Table 17, once the investigator determines that 
the event meets the protocol defin ition of a AESIs .

11 October 2022  122 12.5.9.2.  SAEs requiring expedited reporting to  GSK Biologicals   
Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the 
investigator (or designate) must complete the information in the electronic Expedited 
Adverse Events  Report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The report will always be completed as 
thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event. Even if the investigator does 
not have all information regarding a SAE, the report should still be completed within 24 
hours. On ce additional relevant information is received, the report should be updated 
WITHIN 24 HOURS.  
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report. The investigator will be required to confirm the review of the SAE causality by 
ticking the ‘reviewed’ box in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 72 
hours of submission of the SAE.  
12.5.9.3.  Back -up system in case the electronic reporting system does not work  
If the electronic reporting system does not work, t he investigator (or designate) must 
complete, then date and sign a paper Expedited Adverse Events Report and fax it to the 
Study Contact for Reporting SAEs (refer to the Sponsor Information ) or to GSK  
Biologicals  Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department within 24 hours.  
This back -up system should only be used if the electronic reporting system is not working 
and NOT if the system is slow. As soon as the electronic reporting system is working 
again, the investigator (or designate) must complete the electronic Expedited Adv erse 
Events Report within 24 hours. The final valid information for regulatory reporting will 
be the information reported through the electronic SAE reporting system.  
12.5.9.4.  Completion and transmission of pregnancy reports to GSK Biologicals   
Once the investigator becomes aware that a subject is pregnant, the investigator (or 
designate) must complete the required information onto the electronic pregnancy report 
within  24 hours . 
Note: Conventionally, the estimated gestational age (EGA) of a preg nancy is dated from 
the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) of the cycle in which a woman conceives. 
If the LMP is uncertain or unknown, dating of EGA and the estimated date of delivery 
(EDD) should be estimated by ultrasound examination and recor ded in the pregnancy 
report.  
12.5.9.5.  Reporting of AESI’s  to GSK Biologicals   
Once a n AESI is diagnosed (serious or non -serious) in a study subject, the investigator 
(or designate) must complete the information in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events 
Report WITH IN 24 HOURS after he/she becomes aware of the  diagnosis. The report 
allows specify that the event is a n AESI  and whether it is serious or non -serious. The 
report will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the 
event, in  accordance with the AESI s standard questionnaire provided. Even if the 
investigator does not have all information regarding a n AESI , the report should still be 
completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the report 
should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS.

12.5.10.  Updating of SAE, pregnancy, and AESI i nformation after removal 
of write access to the subject’s eCRF  
When additional SAE, pregnancy, or AESI  information is received after removal of the 
write access to the subject’s eCRF, new or updated information should be recorded on the 
appropriate paper report, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. The 
updated repor t should be faxed to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs (refer to the

After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s con dition to GSK  
Biologicals  (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to  Table 17). 
All SAEs and AESIs  (serious or non -serious) documented at a previous visit/co ntact and 
designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits/contacts until the last visit /contact  of the subject.  
All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not 
resolv ed or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until the 
last visit/contact of the subject . 
12.5.11.1.2.  Follow -up after the subject is discharged from the study  
The investigator will follow subjects:  
• with SAEs, AESIs  (serious or non -serious) , or subjects withdrawn from the study as 
a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabili zed, disappeared, or 
until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  
• with other non -serious AEs, until one year after LSLV or if the subject is  lost to 
follow -up.

he/she will provide this information to GSK  Biologicals  using a paper/e lectronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy report as applicable.  
GSK  Biologicals  may request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possib le 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. If a 
subject dies during participation in the study or during a recogni zed follow -up period, 
GSK  Biologicals  will be provided with any available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
12.5.11.2.  Follow -up of pregnancies  
Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. At the end 
of the pregnancy, whether full -term or premature, informa tion on the status of the mother 
and child will be forwarded to GSK  Biologicals  using the paper pregnancy follow -up 
report/electronic pregnancy report  and the Expedited Adverse Events Report if 
applicable. Generally, the follow -up period doesn’t need to be  longer than 6 to 8 weeks 
after the estimated date of delivery.  
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study, if the pregnancy outcome is a 
SAE, it should always be reported as SAE.  
The following should always be considered as SAE.  
• Spontaneou s pregnancy loss, including:  
− spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy loss before/at 22 weeks of 
gestation)  
− ectopic and molar pregnancy  
− stillbirth (intrauterine death of fetus  after 22 weeks of gestation).  
Note: the 22 weeks cut -off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the 
EMA Guideline on pregnancy exposure. It is recognized that national regulations 
might be different.  
• Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 
days of life).  
• Any congenital an omaly or birth defect [as per Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital 
Defects Program [MACDP ] guidelines] identified in the offspring of a study subject 
(either during pregna ncy, at birth or later) regardless of whether the foetus is 
delivered dead or alive. This includes anomalies identified by prenatal ultrasound, 
amniocentesis or examination of the products of conception after elective or 
spontaneous abortion.

pregnancy i nformation  
12.6.1.  Definitions  
12.6.1.1.  Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below)  
12.6.1.1.1.  Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
• Premenarchal  
Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a young female and is preceded by 
several changes associated with puberty including breast development and pubic hair 
growth. Menarche usually occurs within 1 -2 years of breast development, thelarche. 
However, a young female can become pregnant before her first menses. Thus, a 
conservative definition of non -childbearing potential in a pre -menarcheal female is a 
young female who has not yet entere d puberty as evidenced by lack of breast 
development (palpable glandular breast tissue).  
• Premenopausal female with ONE of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can co me from the site personnel’s: review of subject ’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle s timulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measu rement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 
of the non -hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT t o allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment.

sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception  should be used. )  
Male partner sterili zation  prior to the female subject’s entry into the study, and this male is the sole 
partner for that subject,  
(The information on the male sterility can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject’s 
medical  records; medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview provided 
by her or her partner).  
Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered  a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse du ring the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject .)  
NOTES:  
a. Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subject s in clinical studies.  
b. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to  interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of 
the contraceptive method. In this case  2 highly effective methods of contraception should be utilised  during the 
treatment period and for at least 2 months  after the last dose of study trea tment .

11 October 2022  127 12.6.3.  Collection of pregnancy i nformation  
12.6.3.1.  Female Subject s who become pregnant  
• Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject , who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study.  
• Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to GSK within 
24 hours  of learning  of a subject 's pregnancy.  
• Subject  will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
investigator will collect follow -up information on subject  and neonate, which will be 
forwarded to GSK . Generally, follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks beyond the estimated delivery date.  
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or 
SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such.  
• Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is considered 
reasonably related to the study treatment by the investigator, will be reported to GSK 
as described in 12.5.9 . While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study subject s, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.  
Any female subject  who becomes pregnant while participating will  discontinue study 
treatment . 
12.7.  Appendix 7: Definition of medical device AE, adverse device 
effect (ADE), serious adverse device effect (SADE) and 
unanticipated SADE (USADE)  
12.7.1.  Definition of medical device AE and ad verse device effect (ADE)  
• Medical device AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in a clinical study 
participant, users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention  whether or not considered related to a medical device. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of a medical device. This definition includes events related to the medical d evice 
or comparator and events related to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. This 
definition includes any AE resulting from:  
− insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user er ror), or  
− any malfunction of a medical device, or  
− intentional misuse of the medical device.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  128 12.7.2.  Definition of medical device SAE, SADE and USADE  
A medical device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
c. Led to death  
d. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either resulted in:  
• A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the definition of 
‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an  event, which hypothetically might have caused 
death, if it were more severe.  
• A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
• Inpatient or prolonged hospitalisation. Planned hospitalisation for a pre -existing 
condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, without serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered an SAE.  
• Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
e. Led to fetal distres s, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
f. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any  of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had not 
been taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE (USAD E) definition  
• An USADE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has 
not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report (see Section 
3.3). 
12.7.3.  Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs, SADEs and 
USADE  
• Any device deficiency must be reported to GSK within 24 hours after the investigator 
determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• E-mail/Facsimile transmission of the paper ‘Medical device or combination product 
with device deficiency/incident report form’ is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the sponsor.  
• In rare circumstances and  in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of ‘Medical device or combination product with 
device deficiency/incident report form’ sent by overnight mail or courier service.  
• Contacts for reporting can be foun d in Section 8.4.6.1 . 
• GSK will review all device deficiencies and determine and document in writing 
whether they could have led to an SAE. These dev ice deficiencies will be reported to 
the regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs as required by national regulations.

instead of 3 years prior.  December 2019. As a result, the company 
intends to align the inclusion criterion in the 
V72_79 study with the recently introduced 
booster recommendation in the US, and 
amend the protocol accordingly to allow 
inclusion of subjects who have received a 
meningococcal ACWY vaccine 4 years or 
greater in the past . 
Amendment 1  
Across the document  Assay validations have been updated:  
• Develop, validate, and use a new 
“agar overlay” serum bactericidal 
assay using human complement 
(hSBA) and automated colony 
counting method in order to 
quantify serogroup -specific 
immunogenicity of the MenACWY 
vaccine against N. meningitidis  
serogroups A, C, W and Y 
(MenACWY agar -overlay hSBA);  
• Validate the MenB manual (Tilt) 
hSBA for the use of the M14459 
(fHbp), 96217(NadA) NZ98/254 
(PorA) and M07 -0241084 (NHBA) 
indicator strains to measure 
immunogenicity of Bexsero  against 
N. meningitidis  serogroup B.  
• Modification of the 4 -fold increase 
in post -vaccination hSBA titer 
definition when the pre -vaccination 
titer is below the limit of detection.  
• Modification of the population set 
to be used for safety analysis; 
exposed set is to be used for all 
safety analyses . To support the primary endpoint analyses 
of this study and based on the most recent 
expectations set by Center for Biologics 
Evaluation & Research (CBER) 
recommendation.

• Section 12.7: Appendi x 7: Definition of medical device AE, adverse device effect 
(ADE), serious adverse device effect (SADE) and unanticipated SADE (USADE)  
12.7.1 Definition of medical device AE and adverse device effect (ADE)  
Medical device AE is any untoward medical occurren ce, in a clinical study participant, 
users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study intervention  
whether or not considered related to a medical device. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a 
medical device. This definition includes events related to the medical d evice or 
comparator and events related to the procedures involved.  
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. This 
definition includes any AE resulting from:  
• insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user er ror), or  
• any malfunction of a medical device, or  
• intentional misuse of the medical device.  
12.7.2 Definition of medical device SAE, SADE and USADE  
A medical device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
g. Led to death  
h. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either resulted 
in: 
• A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the definition 
of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refe r to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death, if it were more severe.  
• A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
• Inpatient or prolonged hospitalisation. Planned hospitalisation for a pre -existing 
condition, or a procedure  required by the protocol, without serious deterioration 
in health, is not considered an SAE.  
• Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function

j. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted  in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had 
not been taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less 
fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE (USADE) definition  
• An USADE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome 
has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report (se e 
Section 3.3). 
12.7.3 Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs, SADEs and USADE  
• Any device deficiency must be reported to GSK within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• E-mail/Facsimile transmission of the paper ‘Medical device or combination 
product with device deficiency/incident report form’ is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to the sponsor.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of ‘Medical device or combination product 
with device deficiency/incident report form’ sent by overnight mail or courier 
service.  
• Contacts for reporting can be found in Section 8.4.6.1.  
• GSK wil l review all device deficiencies and determine and document in writing 
whether they could have led to an SAE. These device deficiencies will be reported 
to the regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs as required by national regulations.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  161 Detailed description of Protocol Amendment 2:  
• Inclusion criteria has been updated  (Section 6.1) : Previous vaccination with one dose 
of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY , Menveo or 
Menactra ) at least 4 3years prior to informed consent and assent as applicable 
(according to the subject’s age).  
• Exclusion criteria has been updated  (Section 6.2. 1): Systemic administration of 
corticosteroids (PO/IV/IM) for more than 14 consecutive days within 90 days prior 
to study vaccination. This will mean prednisone 205 mg/day (for adult subjects) or  
0.5 mg/kg/day or 20  mg/day  whichever is the maximum dose  for (paediatric 
subjects ), or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.  
• The End of Study definition  (Section 12.1.2)  has been updated to adapt to the study 
design: For studies with collection of human biological samples and/or imaging data, 
the End of Study is defined as follows: Last subject last visit ( last concluding 
contact on Day 451 Visit 4 ) or Last testing results released of samples collected at 
Visit 4*.  
* In this case EoS must be achieved no later than 8 months after LSLV (last 
concluding contact) . 
• Sentence referring to implausible measurements in Section 10.3.4 has been deleted 
as this has been explained in Section 12.5.8 of the protocol: Implausible 
measurements (for further definition see SAP) will be left out of the analysis.  
• Treatments administered table ( Section 7.1; Table 8) has been updated to  reflect the 
correct concentration for rp961c antigen in the Bexsero  formulation.  Additional 
editorial changes have been included in Table 8, that do not impact the vaccine 
formulatio n. As the study will be conducted in the US, EU specifications for the 
vaccines from the footnote has been deleted.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  163 Detailed description of Protocol Amendment  1: 
The major changes made to this amendment were with regard to transferring the protocol 
to the GSK protocol template (DS-BIO-CLIN -1000 v16.0) and the incorporation of 
protocol template -specified mandatory text. These changes have not been listed here. The 
changes with regard to CBER feedback in the main sections of the protocol are described 
here.  
Throughout the protocol , the study group names were changed as follows:  
• Vaccine Group A to Group MenB+MenACWY  
• Vaccine Group B to Group MenB  
• Vaccine Group C to Group MenACWY  
The introduction section and rationale for the study were updated to include the following 
data from V72_5 6 infant study, as follows:  
Data from an infant study showed that both rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY were 
well tolerated and immunogenic when administered concomitantly in healthy infants. 
However, no data is currently available on the concomitant use of rMenB+OMV NZ and 
MenACWY in adolescents . 
The success criterion for primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives were re -
written for clarity as follows ( Synopsis  and Section 4): 
Primary Im munogenicity objectives:  
• To demonstrate the non -inferiority of the antibody response to rMenB+OMV NZ 
given concomitantly with MenACWY to healthy subjects 16 -18 years of age 
compared to rMenB+OMV NZ administered without MenACWY, as measured by 
serum bacteri cidal assay using human complement (hSBA) Geometric Mean Titers 
(GMTs) against N. meningitidis  serogroup B test strains M14459 (fHbp), 96217 
(NadA), NZ98/254(PorA) and M07 -0241084 (NHBA), at one month after the second 
vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ.  
Criteri on: Non -inferiority will be demonstrated if for each of the four serogroup B 
test strains, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the between -
group ratio of hSBA GMTs null hypothesis that the difference in the population 
means (of the lo garithmically [base of 10] transformed hSBA titers) of 
(rMenB+OMV NZ with MenACWY versus rMenB+OMV NZ alone) is >less than 
or equal to log10(0.5) is rejected.  
• To demonstrate the non -inferiority of the antibody response to MenACWY given 
concomitantly with r MenB+OMV NZ to healthy subjects 16 -18 years of age 
compared to MenACWY administered alone , as measured by hSBA GMTs against 
each of the serogroups A, C, W and Y, at one month after the (study) vaccination 
with MenACWY.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  164 Criterion: Non -inferiority will be de monstrated if for each of the four serogroups A, 
C, W and Y, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the between -group ratio of 
hSBA GMTs (null hypothesis that the difference in the population means (of the 
logarithmically [base of 10] transformed hSBA ti ters) of rMenB+OMV NZ with 
MenACWY versus MenACWY alone) is >less than or equal to log10 (0.5) is 
rejected.  
Secondary objectives:  
• To assess the non -inferiority of the responses to MenACWY when given 
concomitantly with rMenB+OMV NZ to healthy subjects 16 -18 years of age 
compared to MenACWY administered alone as measured by ELISA Geometric 
Mean Concentration s (GMC s) against each of the serogroups A, C, W and Y, at one 
month after the (study) vaccination with MenACWY.  
Criterion: Non -inferiority will be demonst rated if for each of the four A, C, W and Y 
strains, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the between -group ratio of ELISA 
GMCs (null hypothesis that the difference in the population means (of the 
logarithmically [base of 10] transformed hSBA titers) o f MenACWY with 
rMenB+OMV NZ versus MenACWY alone) is >less than or equal to log10 (0.5) is 
rejected.  
Details regarding the blinding process to the lab personnel performing clinical testing are 
updated. Following the integration of the two legacy blinding p rocesses with regards to 
lab personnel, a duly assessment confirmed that the laboratory in charge of the clinical 
testing can be blinded to the treatment as well as to the subject number.  Moreover, in 
order to prevent the laboratory from linking the conse cutive visits to a specific subject, a 
different subject code will be used for each timepoint tested.  
• The 4 -fold increase in post -vaccination hSBA titer definition when the pre -
vaccination titer is below the LOD , has been modified to: For a pre -vaccination  titer 
< LOD, a post -vaccination titer of ≥ fourfold the LOD or ≥ LLOQ, whichever is 
greater.  
Section 7.5.1, Recording of concomitant medication/products and concomitant 
vaccinations , the following criteria was added : 
• The use of antipyretic and/or other me dications to prevent (prophylactic use) and/or 
treat fever during the first 7 days after vaccination to be recorded in the eCRF as 
well.  
In Section 8.2.1 Data collected from subjects,  the following change was made:  
• Vaccination history as confirmed by vaccination records, if accessible.  
• In Section 8.2.3, Medical history, text on qualified healthcare professional was added 
as follows:  
A general physical examination is to be performed by a qualified health care 
professional. “Qualified health care profess ional” refers to a licensed or certified 
health care professional with documented training and experience, as determined by 
the Principal Investigator, and who is permitted by institutional policy to perform 
protocol required procedures, and who is identif ied on the Study Staff Signature Log.

Protocol Amendment 7 Final  
11 October 2022  165 The physical examination will include a check of general appearance, the 
measurement of vital signs ( body temperature [preferably oral]  and heart rate), 
auscultation of heart and lungs, measurement of length and weight . The medical 
history -directed exam of other body parts and systems to assess eligibility will be 
performed during Visit 1.  
In Section 8.2.4, Physical examination , changes were made to clarify that only 
abnormal findings from physical examination will be d ocumented in the eCRF. The text 
was modified as follows:  
These data will be written in the source document. Should the physical assessment 
reveal any abnormal values or events, these must be documented in the eCRF Adverse 
Events Form. Collected information  needs to be recorded in the eCRF.  
In Section 8.3.3, Laboratory assays, the humoral immunity table (Table 12) has been 
updated to capture the hSBA assay cut -off values (LOD and LLOQ) for MenB and 
MenACWY.  
In Section 12.5.3.1, Other solicited adverse events , the following changes were made:  
The use of analgesics/antipyretics for either prophylactic or treatment purposes will be 
recorded as other solicited events in the Subject Diary (eDiary) and subsequently 
recorded onto the eCRFs and subject medical record s. 
The following criteria was added for solicited AEs which need to be entered into 
subject’s source documents and also as an AE on AE eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic adverse event that continues beyond day 7 after 
vaccination.  
In Section 12.5.5, Adverse  events of special interest,  Arthritis was added as an AESI 
and following related text was added  under Section 12.4.5.1 : 
Cases of arthritis are defined according to the following ad -hoc definition:  
• Presence of a physical exam findings of swelling, redness,  heat, or limitation in 
range of motion and/or  
• Presence of a diagnostic imaging studies interpreted by a health care provider 
as demonstrating evidence of joint inflammation and/or arthrocentesis results 
evidencing inflammation.  
Due to the heterogeneity of  the presentation of arthritis which can be either acute or 
chronic, the threshold of duration of 6 weeks is to be considered.  
The list of PTs corresponding to the diagnosis of arthritis, are those included in the 
MedDRA SMQ Narrow “Arthritis”. For any new  diagnosis of arthritis (serious or non -
serious) in a study subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete, an electronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and an ad -hoc eCRF page on arthritis to further 
characterize this AESI.

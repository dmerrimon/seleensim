Protocol Title  An Expanded Access Study Using the CliniMACS® System to Offer Therapeutic  
Manipulated Grafts that are CD34+ Cell Enriched and T Cell Depleted for Allogeneic 
Stem Cell recipients with Matched or Mismatched Related Donors or with Borderline 
Organ Function  
Clinical Phase  Phase II  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Background and 
Rationale  Hypothesis:  Transplantation of stem cells that have been CD34+ selected and T 
cell-depleted with the CliniMACS® device will prevent severe (grade III/IV) acute 
GvHD without the use of prophylactic post -transplant immunosuppression. The  
incidence of grade I II/IV acute GVHD is predicted to be <10% after cell 
manipulation.  
 
Background:  The CliniMACS® System (Device, Reagents, Tubing Sets, 
Instruments and PBS/EDTA Buffer) is manufactured and controlled under an ISO 
13485 and ISO 9001 certified quality system. In Europe, the CliniMACS System and 
Reagents are available as CE -marked medical devices for use in humans. Inthe 
USA, CliniMACS® System is available for use only under an approved  
Investigational New Drug (IND) application or Investigational Device Exempti on 
(IDE). Its safety has been tested in multiple eIND and eIDE FDA submissions. As of 
2011, eighty four IDE protocols utilize the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent to select 
CD34+ cells from heterogeneous hematologic cell populations. In 2011, Milte nyi 
Biotec h HDE s ubmitted CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System as a Humanitarian  
Use Device (HUD) in its Registration Pathway in the U.S. Clinical data from BMT 
CTN 0303 Clinical – a phase II multi -center clinical trial sponsored by the BMT CTN 
(BB-IDE 11965) wh ich enrolled 47 A cute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients after 
myeloablative therapy for HLA -matched allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients, 
without additional GvHD prophylaxis from October 2005 to December  
2008 -- supports “safety” and “probable benefit” arguments of the  CliniMACS® 
System. In January, 2014, the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System received FDA 
approval as a Humanitarian Use Device for processing hematopoietic progenitor 
cells collected by apheresis from an allogeneic, HLA -identical , sibling donor to 
obtain a CD3 4+ cell -enriched population for hematopoietic reconstitution following a 
myeloablative preparative regimen without the need for additional GvHD prophylaxis 
in acute myeloid leukemia. (44)  
 
Rationale:  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is now re cognized as an 
effective form of therapy for an increasing number of malignant and non - malignant 
disorders. Therefore, extending the donor pool to alternative source of 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that is capable of rec onstituting hematopoiesis 
after intensive myeloablative therapy is an important goal in this field. The preferred 
donor for an allogeneic HSCT is an HLA identical sibling. However,  less than 25% of 
patients requiring a transplant will have such a donor. The purpose of this protocol 
is to provide access to the CliniMACS® System to patients who only have donors 
with a significant HLA -mismatched compatibility (alternative donors)  or have a 
matched related donor but cannot receive post immunosuppressive therapy due to 
organ function . By manip ulating the product graft through this platform, we can offer 
a CD34 enriched and T -cell depleted graft that addresses the main morbidity and 
mortality issue for this type of hematopoietic stem cell transplant  (HSCT):  
overwhelming (grade III/IV) graft -versus-host disease (GvHD). The cell manipulation 
provides cellular therapeutic GvHD prophylaxis, therefore  

 
4  eliminating the need of post -HSCT immunosuppressant therapies making this 
process also a viable alternativ e to deliver a life -saving HSCT for patients who do 
not have a matched related donor and for those with borderline organ function -- 
who might not endure the often -toxic side -effects of traditional post -HSCT 
immunosuppressive therapy.  
 
 
 
Objectives  This is a prospective study to provide  access to an investigational device and 
reagents used for progenitor cell sorting of a stem cell transplant donor graft to 
determine the ability of CD34+ cell selection and T Cell depletion (using the 
CliniMACS® device as the sole GvHD prophylaxis) to prevent severe (grade III - 
IV) acute GvHD in recipients of mismatched related  or unrelated donor 
hematopoietic stem cell transplants or with borderline organ function -- who might 
not endure the often toxic side -effects of traditional post -HSCT immunosuppr essive 
therapy.  
Primary Endpoint(s)  The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of severe (grade III/IV) acute 
GvHD occurring by Day +100 after transplant.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary Endpoint(s)  Outcomes measures for the secondary endpoints will include:  
Engraftment: The incidence of primary graft failure and graft rejection  will be  
determined.  
Chimerism at Day 100: The percentage of donor cells will be reported  for all 
evaluable (without disease progression)  patients.  
Immune recovery: The time to CD4 coun t >100 and > 200 and PHA  ≥ 10% and 30% 
will be  calculated.  
Severe toxicities: The incidence of severe toxicities will be  determined. This will 
include grade 3/4 stem cell product infusion -related  toxicity.  
Post-transplant infections (bacterial, viral and f ungal): Post -transplant infections will 
be described by incidence and  type.  
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD): The incidence  of PTLD will be  
calculated.  
Transplant -related mortality (TRM): The incidence of TRM will  be calculated at Day 
100 after transplant and at one  year.  
Disease -free survival.  
Overall survival: Overall survival will be estimated using the  Kaplan -Meier method.  
Device (CliniMACS®) performance parameters: The parameters will  be 
summarized for all products that are processed and median and ranges will be 
determined.  
 
 
Study Design  Participants will be enrolled with alternative (mismatched/haplocompatible) 
related /unrelated  donors  or matched related /unrelated donors  for an initial HSCT.  
 
Study Centers  This is a Stanford University, Principle Investigator (PI)  initiated protocol conducted 
at LPCH and Stanford Hospital and Clinics.  
Duration of Study per 
Subject  Individual participants will be followed for outcomes related to the experimental 
device including acute and chronic GvHD and engraftment for a minimum of one  
year. Subsequent follow -up care will follow the standard for all transplant patients.

Discontinuation Criteria 
(Safety Considerations)  Principal Investigator will evaluate and report all grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions that 
are unexpected and possibly related to the investigation in process and are not 
expected TRM as per protocol definition. If it becomes clear that the study treatment 
is less effective than other available treatments or the toxicity is unacce ptable we 
will follow the stopping rules.  
 
Stopping rule for primary graft failure: The first 30 enrolled patients (related and 
unrelated) will be evaluated for the stopping rule for primary graft failure. The trial is 
stopped if there are ≥ b graft failures out of k resolved patients. Only points where 
stopping is possible are listed.  
 
 
 
 
The stop ping rule for graft failure yields the probability of stopping the trial of 0.05 if 
the rate of graft failure is 0.1. The probability of stopping the trial is 0.41 if the graft 
failure rate is 0.2, 0.82 if the graft failure rate is 0.3, and 0.96 if the graft failure rate 
is 0.4. These probabilities were calculated based on the binomial distribution.  
 
If the study reaches a stopping boundary, the study will be  suspended. Proper use 
of the stopping rule table will be ensured by the Study Investigator.  
 
Stoppi ng rule for Grade ≥ IV toxicity: If any patient develops grade ≥ IV acute  
GvHD, grade ≥ IV infection, or any unexpected grade ≥ IV toxicity by 4 weeks post -
transplant, the protocol will be halted and the processing re -evaluated before

1.0 OBJECTIVES  
A major issue in alternative donor (mismatched related and unrelated donor) transplantation is the development 
of graft -versus -host disease (GvHD). For those who cannot receive post -transplant immunosuppressive therapy, 
any form of graft versus host disease, even with a matched related or unrelated donor can also be a complication. 
Several clinical trials have shown that the use of T cell -depleted per ipheral blood stem cells (PBSC) reduces 
GvHD in  hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT).  By using a purified stem cell graft, there is a reduced risk of 
post-transplant graft versus host disease in patients who have a mismatched donor or cannot receive post-
transplant immunosuppression.  
 
This is a prospective study to provide access to an investigational device and reagents used for progenitor cell 
sorting. The hypothesis is that the CliniMACS® System will allow for a manipulated graft – with augmented 
CD34+ cells and T cell -depleted numbers --- in a ratio that will prevent severe (grade III/IV) acute GvHD (as 
defined on appendix C) without the use of prophylactic post -transplant immunosuppression. The incidence of 
grade III/IV acute GVHD is predicted to be lesser than 10% based on similar ongoing trials  (17).  
 
The objective is to manipulate (alter the ratio) specific cells in the donor graft to determine the ability of 
augmented CD34+ cells and T cell -depleted products to prevent severe (grade III/IV) ac ute GvHD in recipients of 
mismatched related donor hematopoietic stem cell transplants as well as to candidates of allogeneic (allo) 
transplant with borderline organ function -- who might not endure the often toxic side - effects of traditional post -
HSCT im munosuppressive therapy.  
 
The patients will receive conditioning therapy based on their diagnosis  and per instructional guidelines for treating 
the disease . The transplant recipients will be followed for one year post - transplant for the development of GvHD, 
engraftment, post -transplant infections, disease relapse, and overall survival.  
 
1.1 Primary Objective  
To determine the ability of CD34+ cell selection using the CliniMACS® device as the sole GvHD prophylaxis to 
prevent severe (grade III -IV) acute GV HD in recipients of alternative donors hematopoietic stem cell transplants 
and/or potential matched -related allogeneic SCT recipients with borderline organ function (who might not tolerate 
traditional post -HSCT GvHD prophylaxis without increased  morbidity) .  
 
1.2 Secondary  Objectives  
Assess the ability of this approach to serve as a platform for strategies to accelerate post - transplant 
immunological recovery.  
 
Evaluate chimerism at day +100 (from the date of transplant graft infusion), and the rate of engr aftment in 
recipients of CD34+ cell selected, T cell -depleted transplants from mismatched related donors.  
 
Evaluate the rates of post -transplant occurrences, including:  
a) Graft rejection and graft  failure  
b) Immune recovery  
c) Transplant -related severe  toxicities  
d) Post-transplant  infections  
e) CMV infection and  disease  
f) EBV-related post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder  (PTLD)  
g) Relapse of malignant -diagnosis  
h) Transplant -related  mortality  
i) Disease -free survival (DFS) and overall survival  (OS)  
 
Monitor device performance:  
a) Cellular composition of final  product  
b) Yield of CD34+  cells 
c) CD3+ cell depletion  
d) Sterility  
e) Purity

2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Previous Studies  
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is now recognized as an effective form of therapy for an 
increas ing number of malignant and non -malignant disorders. Therefore, extending the donor pool to alternative 
sources of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are capable of reconstituting hematopoiesis after intensive 
myeloablative therapy is an important goal i n this field. The preferred donor for an allogeneic HSCT is an HLA 
identical sibling. However, less than 25% of patients requiring a transplant will have such a donor. Alternative 
stem cell sources include volunteer matched unrelated donors (URD) and unrel ated donor cord blood (CB).(1) 
For patients lacking either a matched sibling donor or a suitable unrelated donor in a timely fashion, mismatched 
related donors could be a potential option.  
 
To overcome the lack of suitable donors, transplant centers around  the world started using mismatched 
(haplocompatible or sharing only one of two haplotypes) related donors. In the past, the major challenges have 
been engraftment, graft -versus -host disease (GvHD), and an increased incidence of infection and disease 
relap se. 
 
Outcomes have improved markedly in recent years with the availability of cell selection devices that allow the 
administration of a large number of stem cells with a low dose of T cells and the development of more intensely 
immunosuppressive conditioni ng regimens. In an effort to reduce the high risk of fatal GvHD associated with 
these mismatched donors, the stem cells need to be processed to significantly reduce the number of donor T 
cells present in the graft. CD34 is a receptor that is expressed on e arly hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). 
Monoclonal antibodies are available that efficiently bind to the CD34 antigen. Studies have shown that positive 
selection of CD34+ marrow or blood cells results in a significant (> 4 log) depletion of T cells from the p reparation 
(8-10). This approach is less time -consuming and may be more efficient than earlier approaches because it 
specifically targets the HSC. A cell separation system for clinical use is available for evaluation in the US after 
extensive use in Europe  (11,12). The Miltenyi Biotec Inc. CliniMACS® CD34+ Reagent System has the 
advantages of the best T cell depletion efficiency achievable and a very high efficiency of CD34+ cell recovery so 
that fewer apheresis are necessary. The CliniMACS® device uses a s terile, closed magnetic sorting system to 
isolate CD34+ stem cells.      
 
The bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell product obtained from the donor is incubated with a murine anti -
CD34 monoclonal antibody conjugated to small super - paramagnetic beads co mposed of iron dextran 
(commercially available to treat iron deficiency). The murine antibody has been used in clinical trials in humans. 
The dose administered to the transplant after processing is 100 times lower than therapeutic levels. Following 
incubat ion, unbound reagent is removed by washing the cell product and the product loaded onto the 
CliniMACS®. The cells are passed through a strong magnetic field applied to the CliniMACS® column and the 
CD34+ cells retained on the column while other cells (T, B , and NK cells, monocytes, and neutrophils) pass 
through into a waste bag. The magnet is withdrawn and the CD34+ cells eluted from the demagnetized column 
into a blood transfer pack for final formulation prior to release for  infusion.  
 
It has been well established that allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) recruited into the blood by 
administering G -CSF can successfully and durably engraft in both matched (13,14) or mismatched (15,16) 
transplant settings. PBSC recruited with cytokines generally e ngraft earlier and contain a larger number of HSC 
compared to marrow HSC  (14,15).  
 
Much of the work that has been done with this approach has been reported by a group in Perugia, Italy. They 
used the CliniMACS® device to lower the T cell content of the don or PBSC to a median of 1 x 104/kg (range 0.04 
– 3 x 104/kg). Ninety -one percent of patients had primary engraftment. Six of seven patients who did not have 
primary engraftment were successfully engrafted after a second transplant, making the overall engraf tment rate 
99%. Grade III -IV acute GvHD occurred in 2% of patients. The transplant -related mortality was 37%, with the 
majority of deaths due to infection (bacterial, viral, and fungal). Relapse occurred in 16% of 66 patients who were 
in remission at the t ime of transplant. The two -year EFS for patients in remission was 48% for AML and 46% for 
ALL (17).  
  
The results of haplocompatible transplantation in children have been encouraging. Handgretinger reported a 46% 
 
12 two years EFS in patients with ALL in CR1 -3 (18) Ortin et al. reported 75% EFS of patients with ALL in CR2/3 
with median follow -up of 18 months (range 6 -29) (19). The international experience was reviewed at a conference 
in Naples in 2004. Lang updated the Tubingen, Germany experience when he repor ted a 44% 2 years EFS for 21 
children with ALL in CR1 -3 (20)  
 
Advantages of haplocompatible transplantation are rapid engraftment and the very low incidence of severe acute 
GVHD. Ortin et al. reported a median time to ANC > 500 and to platelet count > 50,0 00 of 12 and 20 days, 
respectively, with the incidence of grade III/IV acute GvHD being 5% (19). Lang reported a 1% incidence of grade 
III/IV acute GvHD (21).  
 
In a retrospective review of the experience of 3 investigators in the U.S. (Cowan, Gilman, Sleig ht) with alternative 
(haplocompatible) donor transplant using CD34+ cell selection for T cell depletion, 13/18 (72%) were surviving 
with follow -up of 7 months – 7 years (median 31 months)(22). The median patient age was 8 years (range 1 -20). 
Patient with m alignancy (n=13) included: AML - CR1 (primary  induction failure, failed cord blood transplant) [1], 
CR2 [3]; MDS - RA/RARS [2], RAEB [2]  AM  (and Fanconi anemia, FA) [1]; CML - CP2 [1]; ALL - CR3 [2]; NHL - 
CR2 [1]. Patients with non -malignant (n=5) diseas e included severe aplastic anemia (1 with prior bone marrow 
transplant three years earlier) [4] and Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome [1].  
 
Fourteen donors were a 3/6 HLA match and 5 were a 4/6 match (one patient had two transplants using different 
donors). A CD34 -positive selection device – Miltenyi CliniMACS® (15), Isolex (3) – was used to select stem cells 
and deplete T lymphocytes. Patients received a median of 18 x 106 CD34+ (stem) cells/kg (range 6 -28) and 3 x 
104 CD3+ (T) cells/kg (range 0.3 -11). 
 
Sustained p rimary engraftment occurred in 15/18 (83%) patients. Primary graft failure occurred in one patient. 
Two patients had immunological rejection following HHV -6 reactivation. They both engrafted after a second 
transplant; therefore the overall engraftment rate  was 94%. The median time to an ANC >0.5 x 109/L was 12 days 
(range 9 -21). Platelet recovery occurred in 16/18 at a median of 17 days (range 9 -22). Grade II acute GvHD was 
seen in 4/17 patients (24%). Grade III -IV acute GvHD was seen in 1 pt. (6%) with ove rlap syndrome (acute + 
chronic GvHD) associated with HHV -6 reactivation. Nine patients received DLI and/or stem cell boosts (boosts for 
graft rejection); 4 had grade II GvHD (3/4 had a history of acute GvHD) and none had grade III -IV GvHD. After 
DLI and/or  stem cell boost, two patients developed extensive chronic GvHD and one developed overlap 
syndrome. The day 100 mortality and one year transplant -related mortality were 11% and 19%, respectively. Four 
patients (of 13 at risk, 31%) have relapsed; 1 patient with cytogenetic relapse is in CR > 1 year later. The 2 year 
predicted survival is 64% (60% for 13 patients with malignant disease and 75% for 5 patients with non - malignant 
disease).  
 
Infections were common. All patients were at risk for CMV reactivation.  Seven patients (39%) reactivated CMV. 
All cases were responsive to anti -viral therapy and/or DLI. No CMV disease was seen. Seven patients had 
adenovirus reactivation and six had HHV -6 reactivation. EBV reactivation occurred in 5/18 (28%) patients, three 
of whom manifested signs of post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.  
Patients received a median of 3 x 104 CD3+ cells/kg at the time of transplant. Some patients received additional 
donor T cells (DLI) for viral reactivation. At three months post -trans plant, only 4 of the 15 evaluable patients had a 
CD4 count > 100. By nine months post -transplant, 10 of the 13 evaluable patients had a CD4 count > 200.  
 
There is an ongoing study at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center of a prospecti ve trial of 
CD34+ selected (with the CliniMACS® device) PBSC from mismatched related donors (protocol CC# 01151). 
Patients received a conditioning regimen including TBI 1200 cGy, thiotepa, fludarabine, and rabbit -ATG (3.5 
mg/kg). Patients received a fixed T cell dose of 3 x 104/kg at the time of transplant. Seventeen evaluable patients 
have been reported with the following diagnoses: ALL (3), AML (6), biphenotypic leukemia (1), CML (1), MDS (1), 
aplastic anemia (2), congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopen ia (1) combined immunodeficiency (1), and 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (1).  
 
Twelve of the 17 (65%) were alive and well as of 2010, with follow -up ranging from 3 months to 6.5 years (median 
follow -up 2.5 years). Survivors include 7/12  (58%) with malignant disease and 5/5 (100%) with non -malignant 
disease. One patient died at 7 months after transplant due to parainfluenza and Paecilomyces infections and
 
13 another died at 23 months after transplant due to disseminated Mucor infection, a fungus from the class of 
Zygomycetes. There was no severe (grade III/IV) acute GvHD. Only 3/17 (18%) of patients achieved > 100 CD4+ T 
cells/uL by 100 days after transplant and 3/4 of these patients either had received donor T cell infusion for serious 
viral infections prior to 100 days or had GvHD (in which case the T cells probably represented those causing the 
GvHD and not providing protection against infection).  
 
A variety of genetic diseases of lymphohematopoiesis have been effectively treated and eith er cured or ameliorated 
by allogeneic HSCT from an HLA -matched histocompatible healthy sibling [45, 46]. The conditioning regimen of 
myeloablative high dose Busulfan along with immunoablative high -dose cyclophosphamide (BU - CY) ± anti -
thymocyte globulin (A TG) was developed in the 1980’s after important clinical studies were conducted to better 
understand the prerequisites for replacement of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) carrying deleterious mutations with 
those derived from matched healthy donors [46]. The se studies established that, in the setting of histocompatible 
transplant, ablation of host hematopoietic stem cells with high -dose BU (16 mg/kg, 600 mg/m2, or 640 mg/m2) and 
of host immunity with CY ± ATG allowed durable engraftment of donor HSCs.  
 
Since most patients lack a histocompatible sibling donor, a major challenge in the treatment of the genetic 
lymphohematological disorders is the development of HSCT regimens that result in high levels of engraftment while 
avoiding regimen -related toxicity and GV HD. Higher risks of graft rejection and GVHD with the use of alternative 
donors, including unrelated donors (URD), mismatched related donors (mMRD), umbilical cord blood units, and 
haplo -identical donors, makes these transplants high risk and are associate d with high rates of TRM as well.  
Consequently, the results of HSCT for patients with genetic disorders, using alternative donors has been both limited 
and suboptimal [47 -54]. 
 
Given the especially increased risk of rejection with haploidentical transplant s in patients with non -malignant 
disorders [52,54] , we are proposing the use of additional immunosuppression to the standard back -bone of 
Busulfan/cyclophosphamide/anti - thymocyte globulin, by adding Fludarabine.  
 
Miltenyi supported a Phase II multi -center clinical trial sponsored by the BMT CTN (BB -IDE 11965) which enrolled 
47 AML patients from October 2005 -December 2008 Evaluated the use of the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System 
for selecting CD34+ cells from HLA -matched related donors for allogen eic stem cell transplantation after 
myeloablative therapy in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in 1st or 2nd CR, without additional GvHD 
prophylaxis

Post processing outcomes in all centers were able to process grafts that met t he study criteria.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CD34+ Target Dose  
 
 All patients received the minimum CD34+ dose (> 2.0 x 106 cells/kg)  
 84.1% of patients received > 5 x 106 CD34+  cells/kg

Final Cellular Product Summary  
 
 All Gram stains/14 day cultures were  negative  
 All endotoxin < 5.0  EU/kg  
 No significant infusion related toxicities  observed  
 
Primary Endpoint 6 Month Disease -Free Survival of >75%  
The BMT CTN 0303 conclusions was that HCT following myeloablative preparative regimen for patients with AML in CR1 
or CR2 can be performed in a multicenter setting using the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System without additional post - 
transplant pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis  
All 1º and most 2º endpoints were met, demonstrating:  
 81.8% Disease -Free Survival 6 months post  TX 
 No primary graft failure; consistent neutrophil and platelet  engraftment  
 Acute GvHD grades II -III <23%. No Grade IV  aGvHD  
 Chronic GvHD at 2 years 19%; extensive  6.8%  
 TRM <20% at 2  years  
 Overall risk of relapse was low at 23.7% at 2  years  
 
The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System consistently produced a graft with > 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg and < 1 x 105 CD3+ 
cells/kg with no reported device related toxicities.  
 
In January, 2014, the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System received FDA approval as a Humanitarian Use Devi ce for 
processing hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis from an allogeneic, HLA -identical , sibling donor to 
obtain a CD34+ cell -enriched population for hematopoietic reconstitution following a myeloablative preparative regimen 
without the need for additional GvHD prophylaxis in acute myeloid leukemia.(44)   
 
In summary, the use of CD34+ selected PBSC and manipulated bone marrow grafts without post -transplant GvHD 
prophylaxis for children was associated with rapid engraftment, low 100 -day mor tality, very low incidence of severe 
GvHD, and excellent survival. The overall survival compares favorably with matched -related and URD HSCT. Immune 
reconstitution was slow and post -transplant infections contributed to morbidity and mortality .

2.3 Rationale  
Cell dose is the most important factor affecting clinical outcomes in adult patients undergoing transplantation. 
Transplantation with a cell dose of less than 2.5 x 107 nucleated cells per kilogram or a CD34 dose of less than 1.7 x 
105 per kilogram is associated with higher rat es of non -engraftment, non -relapse mortality and lower survival (14). 
Alternative donors can provide ideal cell dose grafts and have the advantage of being rapidly available, but the 
higher probabilities of severe acute and extensive chronic GvHD due to HL A-mismatched is a significant source of 
morbidity and mortality. This study provides access to a model that potentially benefits from alternative NMDP and 
related donor pools to test the safety and efficacy of manipulated grafts using the CliniMACS® System . The aim is to 
ensure robust cell dose grafts with the best available donor for allogeneic HSCT recipients while providing a method 
for T cell depletion through CD34+ selection as the single form of GvHD prophylaxis. Currently, there is not a FDA -
approved  method for this process in the United States.  
 
The outcomes in relatively small studies for children receiving unrelated donor transplants using the CliniMACS® 
have been comparable to or better than those receiving T cell depleted transplants with post -transplant 
immunosuppression (21, 25). This study will enroll up to 30 transplant recipients at Stanford. As the recommended 
prescription of allogeneic transplantation for different  underlying diseases grows, enrollment on this protocol is 
expected to gradua lly increase in relation to the overall number of transplants performed in our center.  
 
2.4 Study  Design  
This is a PI -initiated, single institution, open (no masking is used), prospective study to provide access to allogeneic 
graft manipulation through Cli niMACS® System for qualifying candidates.  
 
Currently, no FDA -approved method for T cell depletion exists. Recent experience with the CliniMACS® device has 
produced results with a 70 -75% survival in children, many of whom were high -risk patients (19, 22, 36 ). 

 
18  
Patients will be enrolled with alternative (mismatched/haplocompatible) donors for an initial transplant.  
 
The results with mismatched related  or unrelated  donor transplants so far justify expanding this approach to related  
donor recipients who have co ntraindications to post -transplant immunosuppression due to borderline organ function. 
Matched -related  or unrelated  donor recipients with borderline organ function will be allowed  to enroll.  
 
It is anticipated that the use of the CliniMACS® device will re sult in a very low risk of GvHD without the need for post -
 transplant immunosuppression.  
 
This protocol will allow the use of patient -specific conditioning regimens that are available through open IRB studies 
in our institution or through open treatment pl ans from either the pediatric or adult stem cell transplant groups at 
Stanford University.  
 
The follow -up schedule and affiliated data collection forms for the allogeneic recipients in this study are the standard 
CIBMTR data forms and procedures.  
All recip ients enrolled in the study and will be assessed for: neutrophil and platelet engraftment, graft rejection, 
serious infusion reaction, transmission of infection from HSCs infusion, EFS, TRM, acute and chronic GvHD, HSCT -
related toxicities.  
 
3. PARTICIPANT SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT  PROCEDURES  
Refer to the Participant Eligibility Checklist in Appendix A.  
 
3.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
 Participant s greater than one month of age . 
 Participant has a disorder that can be treated with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant  
 Participant’s is eligible for an allogenic HSCT as per current institutional SOP and  FACT standards.  
 Participant must have a related or unrelated matched or mismatched -related donor who  is: 
 Able to receive granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) and undergo apheresis either through 
placement of catheters in antecubital veins or a temporary central venous catheter OR agrees on a bone 
marrow  harvest;  
 Healthy as per donor selection screening (following current SOP based on standards of foundation for 
accreditation of cellular therapy and stem cell transplantation – FACT);  
 Willing to participate and sign  consent . 
 Participant or Legal Authorized Representative is able to sign  informed consent (and signed assent, if 
applicable) for  transplant.  
 
3.2 Exclusion  Criteria:  
 Participant does not qualify for an allogeneic transplant due to medical screening, underlying disease, or 
lack of alternative  donors.  
 Any condition that compromises compliance with the procedures of  this protocol, as judged by the principal  
investigator.  
 
3.3  Informed Consent  Process  
All participants will be provided a consent form describing the experimental nature of the study with sufficient 
information for participants to make an informed decision regarding their participation.  
 
The attending p hysician discusses the rationale, logistics, risks, and benefits of the study with the patient. Alternative 
therapies are discussed. The subject's bill of rights is reviewed. The recipient is given a copy of the consent form to 
take home and read. Then a m eeting is scheduled for a consent conference to review the rationale, logistics, 
treatment plan, risks, benefits and consent form. The subject's bill of rights is reviewed with an emphasis placed on 
voluntary participation. Patients are given time to ask q uestions and do not need to sign the consent form until they 
are ready to proceed. In general, there is one hour devoted to the consent discussion with a clinical nurse specialist 
or research nurse educator.  The attending physician is available to discuss  the study with the patient at any time. 
 
19 For pediatric patients, all efforts will be made to have both parents sign. If one parent is unable to sign, the reason 
will be documented in the consent note that is part of the patient permanent electronic medical  records.  
 
During the consent teaching, the physician, clinical nurse specialist or research nurse frequently asks questions of 
the subject to assess their understanding and a consent note is written documenting the patients understanding. For 
patients tha t are not fluent in English, the consent procedure is performed with an interpreter present (or via 
telephone), or a signer for those that are hearing impaired. Consents are translated into Spanish as needed. 
Patients are evaluated by a physician, nurse co ordinator, clinical  research nurse or clinical nurse specialist and 
social worker. Any member of the team can request a psychiatric evaluation if a concern of competency to provide 
consent is raised  
 
3.4  Study  Timeline  
There will be no primary completion timeline to this study since the goal isto care for all HSCT recipients that need 
manipulated transplant graft. Subjects will continue to be followed on study until death or per institutional guidelines, 
whichever is longer.  
 
4. PATIENT CONDITIONING, TRANSPLA NT, AND POST -TRANSPLANT  CARE  
4.1 Patient  Conditioning  
Patient conditioning will be determined by disease and institutional guidelines for treatment.  
 
4.2 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Standard supportive care guidelines will be followed as per institutional standards  and may vary with the condition or 
problems of the individual patients.  
 
4.3 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Conditions for individual patient termination:  
 Disease  progression  
 Need for exclusionary concurrent treatment (per PI  discretio n) 
 Withdrawal of informed  consent  
 Protocol  non-compliance  
 
The Principal Investigator may terminate the study for any of the following reasons:  
 Significant toxicities related to the product  graft 
 If it becomes clear that the study treatment is less effecti ve than other  available treatments.  
 
4.4 Duration of Participation in the Study and  Follow -up. 
Patients will remain in the hospital until there is evidence of engraftment of donor cells as well as recovery from the 
side effects of transplant  conditioning . When the  patient has engrafted and meets institutional hospital discharge 
criteria , they will be discharged from the inpatient facility. Patients will be followed as outpatients at regular intervals 
in the Bass Center Outpatient Center in the Stem Cell Tra nsplant Clinic. Duration of participation and follow up in 
study will conclude at day 100 post -transplant.  
 
 
5 DONOR  SELECTION  AND PROCEDURES  
Donors will undergo standard of care procedures for mobilization and leukapheresis. They will be asked to sign 
cons ents per standard of care procedures. There will be no research procedures for the donor.  
 
5.1 Mobilization Therapy for Peripheral Blood  Leukapheresis  
Following screening and enrollment, the donor will receive mobilization therapy per institutional guideli nes with daily 
G-CSF. Recommended dose of G-CSF is 16 mg/kg/day  subcutaneously (rounded off to the nearest vial size of 
either 300 or 480 µg). Donors will receive G -CSF once a day for 5 days, with the leukapheresis occurring on day 5. If 
needed, an additio nal dose of G -CSF and leukapheresis procedure may occur on day 6 if needed to meet cell dose 
requirements. Plerixafor (mozibil) may also be given per institutional standards to increase peripheral blood stem 
cells prior to leukapheresis procedure.  
 
20  
Target  post-selection cell dose is 20 x  106 cells/kg with a CD3 cell dose of less than  or equal to  3 x 104 cells/kg.   
  
5.2 Donor  Follow -up 
Donors will be followed per institution guidelines following FACT standards of care.  
 
6 INVESTIGATIONAL PROCEDURE INFORMATION  
6.1 Investigational Procedure  
CD34+ Selection  
CD34+ cell selection will be performed according to procedures given in the CliniMACS Users Operating Manual 
and institution SOPs. The processing will be performed at the Stanford BMT Cellular Thera peutics & Transplantation 
Laboratory at the Stanford University Medical Center.  
 
The target cell doses will be ≥ 20 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. A minimum dose of ≥ 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg will be 
acceptable. The target T cell dose will be ≤ 3 x104 CD3+ cells/kg.  
 
The stem cells will be infused via central venous line into the recipient.  
 
If > 20 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg are available, then 20 x 106/kg will be infused and the remainder will be cryopreserved 
in aliquots of 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.  
 
Additional cell doses may be cryopreserved  for future use.  
6.2 Release of product for  transplant  
Sterility (routine USP culture for bacteria and fungi), endotoxin testing, gram stain, and viability  studies will be 
performed in addition to the cell immunophenotyping . We already have experience with all of these procedures in 
other protocols at this institution (A Feasibility Trial of Post -Transplant Infusion of Allogeneic Regulatory T Cells 
Simultaneously with Allogeneic Conventional T Cells in Patients with Hematologic Malignanc ies undergoing 
Allogeneic Myeloablative Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation from Haploidentical Related Donors) and through 
pediatric stem cell transplant eIND and eIDEs submitted from this  institution.  
 
Viability, gram stain and endotoxin testing will be d one prior to the release of the product for infusion. If the viability is 
≥70%, the Gram stain is negative, and the CD34+ cell and CD3+ cell doses meet the criteria, the product will be 
released for infusion (target cell doses will be ≥ 20 x 106 CD34+ cell s/kg. The target T cell dose will be ≤ 3 x104 
CD3+ cells/kg.)  
 
If the culture becomes positive, appropriate antibiotics, per institutional protocols, will be administered to the 
recipient. The donor will undergo a clinical evaluation for infection and the reagents (including the aliquoted 
reagents) and procedures will be tested and reviewed to try to identify the source. If the gram stain is positive, the 
cells will be cryopreserved until the culture results are back, and the donor will undergo another leuk apheresis 
providing he or she has no clinical evidence of infection.  
 
All donor apheresis collections will be assessed as follows:  
 Cell count by impedance counter (Coulter  Z1) 
 Viability by Propidium Iodide (PI) exclusion (flow cytometric assay) with target  viability  ≥70%,  
 Sterility in accordance with 21 CFR 610.12 using Fluid Thioglycollate medium and Tryptic Soy Broth 14 -day 
cultures  
 Phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry for cell surface expression of CD34 and CD 3 
 
Final Products for infusion, including CD34 selected cells and CD3 fractions will be assessed prior to cryopreservation 
as follows:  
a) Cell count by hemacy tometer as per SCTT current  SOP  
b) Viability by Propidium Iodide (PI) exclusion (flow cytometric  assay)  
c) Sterility in accordance with 21 CFR 610.12  using FTM and TSB 14 -day cultures as per current SCTT current  
SOP  
d) Phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry for cell surface expression of CD34 and CD3  
 
21 e) Endotoxin testing post -selection on each graft product as per SCTT  current SOP

7 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
None anticipated. These are part of transplant  issues but not specific to the use of the in vestigational device 
(CliniMACS® System).  
 
8 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING  PROCEDURES  
8.1 Potential Adverse  Events  
Risk of contamination of the cell preparation with biologic or other foreign material. The sterility of system 
components that contact the cell sample and the detailed processing steps are designed to minimize potential 
contamination.  
 
Significant animal and human studies have been done using these super -paramagnetic beads which are small in 
size (~50 nm in diameter) and are composed of iron oxide  and dextran conjugated to murine monoclonal antibodies. 
These magnetic particles form a stable colloidal suspension and do not precipitate or aggregate in magnetic fields. 
The concentration of the conjugate is equivalent to 22 µg of antibody protein per m l of reagent, 800 µg/ml of dextran 
and 800 µg/ml of iron. Detailed toxicity studies have been undertaken to assess the safety of the antibody reagent 
when delivered to monkeys and rabbits in dosages significantly greater than the projected maximum dosage 
anticipated in clinical use (CliniMACS® Investigator brochure). There have been more than 100 separations for 
clinical use of the CliniMACS® system.  
 
Reaction to CliniMACS® reagent - (murine monoclonal antibody is conjugated to an iron - dextran moiety. The iron 
dextran exposure from a single CliniMACS® separation is ~0.5 mg and less than 1 mg dextran.  
 
The other reagent is the murine monoclonal antibody in which there is a risk of an anaphylactic reaction. The anti -
CD34 monoclonal antibody, AC101 has been te sted for safety in conformance with US standards. Systemic 
reactions appear related to the dose and rapidity of administration. Therapeutic levels (for cancer therapy or 
prevention of graft rejection) of mAb appear to be in the range of 2.5 -5 mg/ml. The mo st commonly reported side 
effects have been myalgia, arthralgia, and flu -like symptoms. The CliniMACS® system results in the administration of 
a maximum of <15µg of antibody, 100x lower than therapeutic levels. Furthermore, studies have shown that the 
levels of antibody used in the CliniMACS® system do not induce complement activation in vitro.  
 
 
22 8.2 Adverse Event  Reporting  
Recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation face significant risks. The risk of treatment related 
morbidity and mortalit y following allogeneic transplant is related to the underlying disease, disease status at the time 
of transplant, prior therapies and other coexisting health problems. Significant risks  include:  
 Infection. Risks include bone marrow suppression, prolonged h ospitalization, invasive procedures, prior 
exposure to micro -organisms and immunosuppressive medications for the prevention and treatment of graft 
versus host disease. Infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa or  fungus.  
 Graft versus host dis ease. Acute GvHD can range from a mild and treatable problem to a life threatening 
complication. Chronic GvHD can vary from a mild to an extensive disorder affecting almost any body tissue. 
Chronic GvHD can negatively affect functional status and quality o f life. 
 Graft failure. Although rare, graft failure is a fatal  complication.  
 Infertility in both genders and premature menopause in women at  risk. 
 Relapse. All patients face a risk of relapse. The risk is highest for those patients with active or resistant  
disease at the time of  transplantation.  
 
Definitions used for Reporting  
Adverse Event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), a symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
a medicinal pr oduct, medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to medicinal product 
or treatment.  
 
Life Threatening Adverse Event: Any adverse event that, in the view of the investigator, places  the patient 
at immediate risk of death from the  reaction. 
 
Unexpected Adverse Event : An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the 
applicable product information (Investigator’s Brochure, product insert). For studies that do not involve 
investigational products or devices, an unexpected adverse event is an adverse event that is not described 
in the transplant medical literature or consent  form.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the following outcomes: 
death, a life threatening adve rse event, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly, 
requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Unless the Principal Investigator is using 
an investigational agent, s/he is not bound by the definition in  Title 22  CFR. Stanford IRB definition(s) and 
requirements apply when applicable, Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Participants or Others (UP s) 
and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UAD )  
 
All grades 3 -5 organ -related adverse events not due to the primary malignancy or pre -existing condition will be 
collected from day 0 through resolution of the SAE. Grade 4 infusion reactions will be reported expeditiously and as 
a separate listing in the FDA Annual Report.  
 
Distinction between Serious and Seve re Adverse Events: The term severe is used to describe the intensity 
(severity) of a specific event, for example mild, moderate or severe. The event itself however, may be of relatively 
minor medical significance, for example a severe headache. This is not  the same as serious, which is based on the 
patient/event outcome and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to the patient’s life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory  obligations.  
 
All Adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.3 found on the following website:  
 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html  
 
The Principal In vestigator (PI) or designee will assess each Adverse Event (AE) to determine whether it is expected 
or unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure; and its 
 
23 relationship to the investigational product.  
 
For the purpose of this study, only AE’s found to be directly related to a study -mandated intervention will be 
captured.  The following adverse events , if felt to be related to study treatment,  will be captured , but not reported as 
SAEs :  
 Hospitalization, prolo ngation of hospitalization, or escalation of care  due to study -mandated intervention   
 Disease  Relapse  
 Any problems with CliniMACS device during cell separation or inability to achieve CD34+ cell and CD3+ 
cell target  doses  
 Any positive culture of HSCT  produ ct 
 Failure to engraft or graft  rejection   
 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution . SAEs will be collected from the time of stem cell 
infusion until 30 days post cell infusion.  SAEs will be reported to the IRB if they meet the d efinition of expedited 
reporting per institutional regulations. All AE’s and SAE will be reported at continuing renewal.  
 
Reports (copy of faxed MedWatch) will also be sent to Miltenyi Biotec Incorporated , to the director of Regulatory 
Affairs and Safety Officer at (781) 782 -1920.  
 
Serious Adverse events will be reported on the MedWatch form 3500a when it meets the definition of expedited FDA 
reporting. All deaths will be examined to determine if they are related to the use of the CliniMACS device or infusion 
of manipulated product. If the death is determined to be related, the event leading to the death must be reported 
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the  event.  
 
The following SAEs requir e expedited reporting (as soon as possible but within at least 7 calendar days of the 
investigator learning of the event):  
 
Deaths: All deaths up to 100 days post -transplant. This includes deaths from the common and expected grade 3 -4 
toxicities noted belo w. Deaths that occur outside of Stanford will be reported within 5 working days of knowledge of 
the death. It must be noted that obtaining detailed information on the cause and circumstances of a death occurring 
at another institution can be difficult. Exc ludes deaths related to relapse of underlying disease, which will reported in 
the annual report . 
 
All serious and unexpected toxicities defined as those toxicities not  identifie d in the transplant literature or in the 
consent form  and that are felt to be related  to protocol -mandated procedures . 
 
The following will not be reported as SAEs:  
 
 Hospitalizations: Approximately 50% of allogeneic transplant recipients will be readmitted to the hospital. The 
most common indications for readmission of an allogeneic HCT recipient are fever, failure to maintain nutritional 
status and graft versus host disease.  Only hospitalizations felt to be related  to study mandated interventions 
should be reported as SAE’s.  
 Relapse of disease: Disease relapse unfortunately remains a  significant problem following both autologous and 
allogeneic transplantation. The risk of relapse is influenced by both patient and disease variables. The risk of 
relapse following allogeneic transplant is extremely dependent on the disease being treated but ranges from 
10% (for patients with severe aplastic anemia) to 80% (for patients with refractory acute  leukemia).   
 Common and expected grade 3 - 4 toxicities of HSCT that are well described in the transplant literature, the 
product inserts or stated in the consent form and do not result in death. This includes but is not limited to 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, thrombotic microangiopathy, bleeding requiring transfusions, edema, 
hypertension, hypotension, gastritis, mucositis,  nausea, vomiting, d iarrhea, hematuria, central venous catheter 
infections, febrile episodes, sepsis, mental status changes, insomnia, mood alterations, seizures, tremor, pain, 
hypoxia, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, incontinence, infertility, laboratory abnormalities, veno -occlusive disease, 
graft failure, cardiac arrhythmias and graft versus host  disease.  
 Secondary Malignancies. The occurrence of secondary malignancies and associated mortality is a known risk 
of cancer therapies. The occurrence of secondary malignancies will  be reported in the annual report . 
 
24  
9 DATA FORMS AND SUBMISSION  SCHEDULE  
Primary internal data monitoring will be performed by the Principal Investigator or designee. The PI will review data 
to assure the validity of data, as well as the safety of the subjec ts. The PI will also monitor the progress of the trial. 
The PI is responsible for maintaining the clinical protocol, reporting adverse events, assuring that consent is 
obtained and documented, reporting of unexpected outcomes, and reporting the status of t he trial in the continuing 
renewal report submitted annually to the IRB and SRC. The PI may designate any or all of these tasks to qualified 
and trained staff.  
 
Patient enrollment and toxicity/reporting will also be entered by the data -manager, coordinator, or designee into the 
CIBMTR and on the Program’s REDCap database by the research staff.  
 
10 MEASUREMENT  
10.1 Primary and Secondary Outcome  measures  
The primary outcome will be severe (grade III/IV) acute graft -versus -host disease.  
 
Secondary outc omes will be engraftment date (ANC>500 for 3 consecutive days, and  
>80% donor cells in blood), graft failure and graft rejection, immune recovery, infection, CMV infection and disease, 
EBV-related PTLD transplant -related toxicity and mortality, transplant -related mortality, grade 3/4 stem cell product 
infusion -related toxicity, relapse, DFS, OS.  
 
10.2 Stopping  Rules  
 The study includes stopping rules based on the incidence of graft failure (or graft rejection), and acute GVHD.  
 
Stopping rule for primary gra ft failure: The first 30 enrolled patients (related and unrelated) will be evaluated for the 
stopping rule for primary graft failure. The trial is stopped if there are ≥ b graft failures out of k resolved patients. Onl y 
points where stopping is possible ar e listed.  
 
k 2 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 21 23 24 25 26 27 28 30 
b 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 7 7 8 
 
25 The stopping rule for graft failure yields the probability of stopping the trial of 0.05 if the rate of graft failure is 0.1. 
The probability of stopping the trial is 0.41 if the graft failure rate is 0.2, 0.82 if the graft failure rate is 0.3, and 0. 96 if 
the graft failure rate is 0.4.  
 
These probabilities were calculated based on the binomial distribution. The s topping rule was generated as 
described by Ivanova et al. (40).  
  
If the study reaches a stopping boundary, the study will be suspended. At this point it may be terminated by the PI or 
submitted to the safety monitor with a description of the failures to d ate and a rationale for why the study should be 
continued. Proper use of the stopping rule table will be ensured by the Study Investigator.  
 
Stopping rule for Grade ≥ IV toxicity: If any patient develops grade ≥ IV acute GvHD, grade ≥ IV infection, or any 
unexpected grade ≥ IV toxicity by 4 weeks post -transplant, the protocol will be halted and the processing re -
evaluated before proceeding.  
 
11 REGULATORY  CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Institutional Review of  Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all f orms of participant information related to the study will be 
reviewed and approved by the Stanford IRB and other regulatory groups as necessary and required . Any changes 
made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by the I RB prior to implementation. 
The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating investigators.  
 
11.2 Data Management  Plan  
The PI, or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate participant ca se histories with 
observations and data pertinent to the study. Study specific Case Report Forms (CRFs) will document treatment 
outcomes for data analysis. Case report forms will be developed using the REDCap database system and will be 
maintained by the S CT clinical research nurse and/or program’s CRA.  
 
12 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
Interim descriptive analyses will be performed annually. As the eligibility for this protocol is very broad, analyses will 
be done separately for several pre -specified subgroups.  
 
First, analyses will be conducted separately for patients transplanted for malignant  diseases and those transplanted 
for non -malignant diseases. They will also be analyzed separately for transplants using mismatched related versus 
alternative donors. Fina lly, analyses will be conducted separately for primary vs. secondary allogeneic transplants. 
Further separation of the study population such as adults vs. pediatrics and myeloablative vs. non -myeloablative 
conditioning regimens will be considered depending  on the patient numbers. In particular, neutrophil and platelet 
engraftment will only be analyzed using transplants with myeloablative conditioning regimens.  
 
Baseline characteristics will be described using frequencies/percent or median/range as appropria te. 
 
The study will enroll 30 transplant recipients at Stanford. As the recommended prescription of allogeneic 
transplantation for different underlying diseases grows, enrollment on this protocol is expected to gradually increase 
in relation to the overall  number of transplants performed in our center.

31 APPENDIX A: Graft -Versus -Host Disease Grading  
 
The modified Keystone criteri a will be used for acute GvHD scoring for both pediatric and  adult participants. 
See tables  below.  
If the criteria are not met but clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with GvHD and systemic therapy was 
begun, then the diagnosis of acute GvHD can be made. The staging of acute G vHD in the affected organ will 
be determined by the scoring team based on the severity of symptoms  using the NIH Consensus Organ 
Scoring System of chronic G vHD, as a  guide.  
The onset date for acute G vHD will typically be the dat e when the systemic immunosuppression  is added or  
escalated.  
When acute GvHD progresses directly to chronic GVHD and a definite onset date cannot  be determined, 
d+100 will be used for the onset date of chronic  GvHD.  
The diagnosis of acute or chronic GvHD w ill typically be based on clinical signs and symptoms  and are not 
based on the time of symptoms after transplant or donor lymphocyte infusion  (DLI).  
The NIH Consensus recommendations will be used to establish the diagnosis of chronic  GVHD:  
 
Distinction fro m acute GvHD;  
At least one diagnostic sign OR at least one distinctive sign confirmed by biopsy or other  tests;  
Exclusion of other diagnosis.  
Chronic GvHD stated as suspected, presumed, and possible or not meeting the NIH  consensus criteria be 
reviewed at the team’s weekly patient  meetings.  
 
Signs and Symptoms described as:  Chronic GvHD?  
Inactive or Quiescent  No 
Irreversible symptoms present  Yes 
No symptoms, patient on GvHD therapy  No

mg/dL  
 
  Criteria for grading minimum degree of organ involvement required conferring that grade.  
† Use "rule of nines" or burn chart to determine extent of rash.  
Range given as total bilirubin  level.  
§ Volume of diarrhea applies to adults. For pediatric patients, the volume of diarrhea should be based 
on body surface area.  
¶ Persistent nausea with histologic evidence of GV HD in the stomach or the duodenum.  
 
Article  III. Chronic Graft -versus -Host Disease  Grading  
 
ONSET:  
 De Novo – no prior  aGVHD  
 Interrupted – prior aGvHD resolved before onset of  cGvHD  
 Progressive – prior aGvHD did not resolve before onset of  cGvHD  
 
GRADE:  
Limited – localized skin involvement and/or hepatic dysfunction due to cGvHD Extensive – one or more of 
the following:  
 generalized skin involvement;  or 
 liver histology showing chronic aggressive hepatitis, bridging necrosis or cirrhosis;  or 
 involvement of eye: Schirmer test with < 5 mm wetting;  or 
 involvement of minor salivary glands or oral mucosa demonstrated on labial biopsy;  or 
 involvement of any other target  organ  
 
SEVERITY:  
 Mild – signs and symptoms of cGvHD do not interfere substantially with functio n 
and do  not progress once appropriately t  treated with local therapy or standard 
systemic therapy (corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine or FK 506)  
 Moderate – signs and symptoms of cGvHD interfere somewhat with function despite appropriate 
therapy or are pr ogressive through first line systemic therapy  (corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine or 
FK 506)  
 Severe – signs and symptoms of cGvHD limit function substantially despite  appropriate therapy or 
are progressive through second line  therapy

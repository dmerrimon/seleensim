Phase 2 -3 
Title of Study : A Phase 2 -3 Multicenter, Randomized, Doubl e-blind Study of Selinexor 
(KPT -330) versus Placebo in Patients with Advanced Unresectable Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma 
(DDLS)  
Study Name: SEAL : Selinexor in Advanced Liposarcoma  
Protocol Number:  KCP -330-020 
Indication:  Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma (DDLS)  
Study Design  Overview :  
This is a Phase 2 -3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  study.  
Approximately 334 total patients will be randomized  (57 patients in Phase 2 and approximately 
277 patients in Phase 3) . Enrollment in Phase 2 has been completed. There was  no break between 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 enrollment.  The study overview is presented in the figure below : 
 
 
Patients in the placebo arm who have PD will have the option to cross over t o open -label selinexor.  
Phase 2 : 
Fifty -seven patients were randomized to selinexor or p lacebo in a 1:1 allocation. Randomization 
was stratified based on the  following stratification factors for patients enrolled under protocol 
Versions ≤ 4:  number of prior systemic therapies (1 versus ≥ 2) and prior eribulin use (prior 
eribuli n versus no prior eribulin ). The preplanned analysis of progression -free survival ( PFS; after 
40 PFS events were observed) was performed and served as a guideline to in form the final design 
of the Phase 3 portion of the study.  
Phase 3:   
The Phase 3 accrual period began immediately after enrollment of the Phase 2 portion was 
completed and will be approximately 30 months.  
Approximately 277 patients will be randomized to selinexor (~185 patients) or placebo 
(~92 patients) in a 2:1 allocation .  
Randomization  will be stratified based on (a) prior eribulin use (prior eribulin versus  no prior 
eribulin) , (b) prior trabectedin (Yondelis®) use (prio r trabectedin versus no prior trabectedin), and 
(c) the number of prior systemic therapies excluding eribulin and trabectedin  (2 versus ≥  3).  
All radiographic responses will be determined by the central reader (see the Imaging Manual  for

more details).  
Patients who have progressive disease ( PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST ) v. 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009 ), will discontinue blinded study treatment and their treatment 
assignment will be unblinded.  
• Patients in the placebo arm  who have PD  will have the option to cross over to open -label 
selinexor . 
• Patients in the selinexor arm who have PD will only be allowed to continue on selinexor 
(as open -label treatment) if the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, believes 
based on clinical judgement that the patient may derive benefit from continued treatment 
with selinexor.  
Patients who discontinue blinded study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator for reasons 
other than PD are not allowed to receive open -label selinexor.  
An interim analysis was conducted  after 108 PFS events  had occurred . Based on the safety and 
efficacy data, the DSMB recommendation was continuation of the study with no change to safety 
monitoring and no sample size adjust ment.  Approximately 34 months will be required to complete 
the primary Phase 3 PFS analysis. The primary endpoint analysis will be performed approximately 
4 months after enrollment of the last patient, on ce 209 PFS events are observed. Treatment 
assignment  for all patients will be unblinded at the time of the primary PFS analysis and all Phase 
3 patients will be evaluable for assessment of the primary endpoint.  
Patients who are on blinded study treatment at the time of the primary PFS analysis at the end of  
Phase 3 may proceed as follows:  
• Patients in the placebo arm may cross over to open -label selinexor (60 mg twice weekly).  
• Patients in the selinexor arm will continue selinexor but as open -label treatment.  
All patients who have PD while receiving open -label selinexor will discontinue selinexor and be 
followed for survival, unless the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, believes based on 
clinical judgement that the patient may derive benefit from continued treatment with selinexor.  
Objectives:  
Phase 2  
Phase 2 Primary Objective  
• Assess and com pare progression -free survival (PFS)  of patients with advanced unresectable 
DDLS treated with selinexor (60 milligrams [mg]) or placebo twice weekly.  PFS is defined 
as the time from date of randomization until the first date of PD, per RECIST v. 1.1, or death 
due to any cause.  
Phase 2 Secondary Objectives  
• Compare time to progression (TTP) on study treatment, per RECIST  v. 1.1, with TTP on 
the patient’s last prior systemic therapy.  
• Determine the overall response rate (ORR: Complete Response [CR] + Partial Response 
[PR]), supported by duration of response (DOR). Responses will be defined by RECIST  v. 
1.1.  
• Assess changes at 6 weeks in tumor glucose metabolism, density, and size using 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose -positron emission tomography (FDG -PET) and computed 
tomography (CT) (diagnostic).  
• Assess safety of each treatment arm.   
Phase 3  
Phase 3 Primary Objective  
Assess and compare PFS of patients with advanced unresectable DDLS treated with se linexor 
(60 mg) or placebo twice weekly. PFS is defined as  the time from date of randomization until

the first date of PD, per RECIST v. 1.1, or death due to any cause. Evaluation of the 
radiographic data for the PFS primary endpoint will be based on data from a scan review by the 
independent central reader.  
Phase 3 Secondary Objectives  
• Assess Overall Survival (OS), measured  from date of randomization until death due to any 
cause.  
• Compare TTP on study treatment, per RECIST v. 1.1, with TTP on the patient’s last prior 
systemic therapy.  
• Assess Quality of Life (QoL) and patient -reported outcomes as measured by the European 
Organ ization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality -of-Life 
Questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and the EuroQoL - Group Health Questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L). 
• Determine the ORR, supported by DOR. Responses will be defined by RECIST  v. 1.1.  
• Assess PFS according to th e Investigator based on clinical and/or radiologic criteria.  
• Assess safety of each treatment arm.  
Study Population :  
This study will enroll patients  ≥ 12 years of age with DDLS per World Health Organization 
(WHO ) Response Criteria ( Miller 1981 ) for Phase 2 and per RECIST v. 1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009 ) for 
Phase 3 who have received at least 2 but no more than 5 prior systemic therapies for the treatment 
of liposarcoma who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
Study Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Blinded Study Treatment (Phases 2 and 3) : Selinexor at a fixed oral dose of 60 mg or matching 
placebo will be given twice weekly during We eks 1 -6 of each 6 -week (42 -day) cycle until PD per 
RECIST v. 1.1, intolerability, cons ent withdrawal, or unblinding.  
Open -label Selinexor :  
Patients on open -label selinexor will receive selinexor 60 mg twice -weekly during Weeks  1-6 of 
each six -week (42 -day) cycle until PD, intolerability, or consent withdrawal.  
Duration  of Treatment and Follow -up:  
Following a 21 -day screening period, patients may receive study treatment until they meet the 
criteria for discontinuation of study treatment or withdraw from the study.  
Patients will be followed for survival until the end of the study, withdrawal criteria are met, or 
death.  
Statistical Methods:   
Based on the planned  analysis of PFS by WHO and RECIST v . 1.1 C riteria in the Phase  2 portion 
of the study, the response criteria for the primary analysis (PFS) were changed from WHO to 
RECIST v . 1.1 in Version 4.0 of the protocol. Consequently, data from the Phase 2 portion of the 
study will be excluded from the final efficacy analysis in order to maintain statistical integrity and 
preserve overall T ype I error rate . (Phase 2 safety data will be i ntegrated with the Phase 3 safety 
data in the final safety analysis .) 
Phase 2:  
All Phase 2 analyses will be conducted among Phase 2 patients only.  
Phase 2 Primary Endpoint Analysis:  
The primary endpoint PFS for Phase 2 is defined as  the time from date of randomization until the 
first date of PD , per RECIST v. 1.1, or death due to any cause.  
A preplanned preliminary analysis of PFS after 40 PFS events was conducted with an 
11 August  2017 data cut with 49 eligible patients whose treatment  assignments were available. 
Patients were analyzed in the treatment arm to which they were ra ndomized. The preliminary  PFS

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 35 1. OVERVIEW  
The nuclear export of most tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) and other growth modulators 
inactivates their anti -cancer and regulatory functions.  The vast majority of TSPs are exported 
from the nucleus exclusively by exportin 1 (XPO1, also called CRM1).  Selinexor (KPT -330) 
is an orally bioavailable, selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) that specifically blocks 
XPO1, leading to the nuclear ac cumulation and re -activation of TSPs and other growth 
modulators.  The reactivation of multiple TSPs through inhibition of a non -redundant, single 
protein represents a novel approach to the treatment of neoplastic diseases including those 
with multiple genomic alterations and resistance mechanisms.  
Liposarcomas are among the most frequent type of soft tissue sarcoma, accounting for 
approximately 15 -20% of all soft tissue sarcomas, and are most often located in the lower 
extremities or retroperitoneum.  Liposarcomas are classified into three main biologic groups: 
well-differentiated  liposarcoma  (WDLS) and dedifferentiate d liposarcoma  (DDLS), 
myxoid/round -cell liposarcoma (MLS), and pleiomorphic liposarcoma.  These subtypes range 
from WDLS, which tends to be slow -growing, to DDLS and MLS, which are more 
aggressive and have greater metastatic potential.  While surgery is the primary therapy for 
localized liposarcomas, there remains a need for additional therapeutic options, to treat 
advanced, recurrent, or metas tatic liposarcomas.  
This Phase 2 -3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study will consist of a Phase  2 
portion to compare progression -free survival ( PFS) obtained with selinexor versus  placebo, 
to adjust PFS assumptions and sample size for Phase 3, followed by a Phase  3 portion to 
assess whether the oral, single -agent selinexor can improve PFS ( versus  placebo) rates in 
patients with liposarcoma.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 36 2. LIPOSARCOMA  
Soft tissue sarcomas are a group of heterogeneous malignancies with over 50 histological 
types with diverse biological behavior and often unique genetics.  One of the most common 
subtypes is liposarcoma, which represents 24% of extremity sarcomas and 45% of 
retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas ( Crago 2011 ). Liposarcomas are malignant mesenchymal 
tumors and are classified into three main biologic g roups: (a) WDLS  and DDLS, (b)  MLS , 
and (c)  pleiomorphic liposarcoma ( Dickson 2013 ). 
WDLS c omprise 40% –45% of all liposarcomas and is classified as a low -grade neoplasm 
that is rarely metastatic and occurs most often in the retroperitoneum and limbs. WDLS 
malignancies have a tendency to recur locally ( Conyers 2011 ). WDLS/DDLS are considered 
to be a biphasic disease: DDLS represents progression from low -grade to high -grade 
nonlipogenic morphology within a WDLS. In contrast to WDLS, DDLS is more aggressive 
with a metastatic rate of 10% –20% and  overall mortality of 50% –75% ( Conyers 2011 ). 
Amplification of several oncogenes is associated with liposarcoma.  MDM2 is the most 
frequent amplification in WDLS/DDLS (close to 100%) while CDK4 is ampl ified in over 
90% of cases ( Dei Tos 2000 , Binh 2005 , Nakayama 1995 ). MDM2 is involved in  the 
destruction of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and CDK4 enha nces progression through the 
G1 cell cycle checkpoint by inactivating  the tumor suppressor protein retinoblastoma  (pRB). 
Thus, co -amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 proteins may result in prolif eration by blocking 
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through combined effects upon the tumor suppressor p53 and 
the cell cycle (Conyers 2011 ). MLS is characterized by a translocation that results in th e 
FUS-CHOP gene fusion that is present in over 95% of cases ( Antonescu 2001 , Crozat 1993 ). 
Recept or tyrosine kinases , particularly signaling thr ough the PI3K/Akt pathway, appear to be 
involved in MLS oncogenesis ( Conyers 2011 ).  
Surgery is the primary treatment for localized liposarcoma, but approximately 40% of 
patients will eventually die f rom advanced disease ( Gobble 2011 ). Advanced unresectable 
liposarcoma is relatively resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, providing few options 
for these patients ( Dickson 2013 ). Despite minimal responsiveness, most patients with 
liposarcoma currently receive anthracyclines and/or an alkylating agent. Olaratumab in 
combination with an anthracycline was granted acc elerated approval in soft tissue sarcomas 
including liposarcoma  based on an improvement in overall survival ( OS) compared to 
doxorubicin alone.  
Additional chemotherapeutic agents have recently shown PFS or OS benefits in randomized 
studies against the alky lating agent dacarbazine. In a recent Phase  3 study  (Study  SAR -3007 ) 
in patients with liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma  (LMS) , trabectedin (Yondelis®) had a 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of progressive disease ( PD), with a medi an PFS 
of 4.2 months versus 1.5  months with dacarbazine. There was no statistical ly significant 
diffe rence in OS  between the t wo arms. In a separate Phase 3  study, 452  patients with 
advanced soft tissue sarcoma were randomized to receive eribulin  or dacarbazine.  Treatment 
with eribulin (Halaven®) improved OS  by 7.2 months compared with dacarbazine in patient s 
with advanced LMS  or liposarcoma.  
Selinexor may represent a non -chemotherapy option for patients with liposarcoma . Because 
of the growth characteristics of liposarcoma, progression following selinexor or placebo  in

the study  design  (see Figure  1, Figure  2, and  Figure 3) allows crossover from placebo to 
selinexor in order to provide patients with access to this experimental non -chemotherapeutic

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 38 3. NUCLEAR EXPORT  
3.1. Inactivation of Tumor Suppressor Proteins (TSPs) by Nuclear 
Export  
Many important TSPs have been identified in cancer pathogenesis, including p53, p73, 
FOXO1 and 3a, IκB , BRCA1 and 2, APC, PP2A, and pRB (Turner 2012 ). TSPs mediate 
tumor suppression pathways via various functions including recognition of cellular 
(deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ]) damage, arrest of the cell cycle until repairs can be made, 
and induction of apoptosis in cells that have substantial DNA damage repair ( Brown 2011 ).  
The tumor -suppressing and anti -cancer activity of these proteins requires their presence in 
the nucleus.  Conversely, export out of the nucleus can inactivate the abilities of TSPs to 
identify DNA damage and regulate cellular processes ( Xu 2010 ). Cancer cells exploit normal 
nuclear export to inactivate TS Ps and evade normal DNA -damage controls as well as anti -
neoplastic therapy.  The nuclear import (following synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes) and 
nuclear export of TSPs require specific shuttle proteins in order to traverse the nuclear 
envelope through the  nuclear pore complexes (NPC) ( Turner 2012 ). Although there are seven 
known nuclear export shuttle proteins (Exportins 1 – 7), exportin 1 (XPO1, also called 
CRM1) is the only known exporti n protein for the vast majority of TS Ps.  
3.2. Inhibition of XPO1 in Human Cancer  
Based on the postulated role of XPO1 in driving malignancy and chemotherapy resistance, 
XPO1 is promising as an oncologic therapeutic target ( Turner 2012 ). XPO1 blockade causes 
the tran sient nuclear retention of TSPs and other growth modulators, re -establishing their 
tumor -suppressing and growth regulating effects on cancer cells and potentially reversing 
mechanisms leading to chemotherapy resistance, with clear implications for future 
combination therapies ( Lain 1999 , Kau 2003 , Turner 2008 ). In normal cells, XPO1 inhibition 
transiently arrests the cell cycle without cytotoxicity followed by recovery after the inhibitor 
is removed ( Lain 1999 , van der Watt 2009 , Gray 2007 ). In addition, the messenger 
ribonuc leic acid ( mRNA ) cap-binding protein eIF4E requires XPO1 in order to exit the 
nucleus with its cargo mRNA proteins.  The mRNAs coding for various short h alf-life 
oncoproteins such as c -MYC, MDM -2 and Cyclin D have m7 -guanine caps and require 
eIF4E for nucle ar export.  XPO1 inhibition prevents the eIF4E -mediated mRNA nuclear 
export and, therefore, the translation of these proteins, leading to their down regulation 
providing additional anti -neoplastic activity.  
Because restoration of TSP activity and reduction  in oncogenic signals are relevant to 
essentially any cancer, XPO1 inhibition is expected to have activity against liposarcoma and 
many other malignancies ( Table  3).

4.1. Introduction  
Several attempts to use XPO1 inhibitors as anti -cancer agents, based o n the natural product 
leptomycin B, have failed due to secondary off -target effects of the drugs, which caused 
significant weight loss, diarrhea, and marked fatigue and asthenia in both animal studies and 
initial clinical  studies  (Mutka 2009 , Newlands 1996 , Roberts 1986 ). Modification of the 
structure of leptomycin B led to the development of  parenterally administered compounds 
with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and substantially improved therapeutic 
windows in preclinical studies ( Mutka 2009 ), but clinical studies  were never i nitiated.  
Selinexor is an oral, first in class, slowly reversible, potent SINE compound that specifically 
blocks XPO1.  Selinexor restores many of the TSPs to the nucleus where they can carry out 
their normal functions.  It is selectively cytotoxic for cells  with genomic damage, ie, for 
tumor cells, both in vitro  and in vivo . All cell types exposed to SINE compounds in vitro  
undergo G1 ± G2 cell cycle arrest, followed by a ‘genomic fidelity’ review.  Cells with 
damaged genomes are induced to undergo apoptosis.  Normal cells, with an intact genome, 
remain in transient, reversible cell cycle arrest until the export block is relieved.  Selinexor 
and other SINE compounds are not intrinsically cytotoxic; rather, they can restore the highly 
effective tumor -suppressing pathways that lead to selective elimination of genomically 
damaged ( ie, neoplastic) cells.  Tumors of hematopoietic lineage are particularly susceptible 
to induction of apoptosis by XPO1 inhibition; normal hematopoietic cells and their functions 
are largely  spared.  Further details about the mechanism of action of selinexor are provided in 
the selinexor Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). 
4.2. Preclinical Data  
4.2.1.  Pharmacology  
Selinexor has shown potent pro -apoptotic activity with a median  inhibitory concentration, 
50% (ha lf maximal inhibitory concentration)  (IC50) of 90 nM across a panel of 46 tumor cell 
lines representing a broad spectrum of tumor types.  As noted above, selinexor had little effect 
on normal lymphocytes or other non -transformed cells, which correlated with  the low 
incidence in animals of the typical adverse drug reactions seen with most anti -cancer 
therapies, such as significant myelosuppression, alopecia, mucositis and other gastrointestinal  
(GI) dysfunction.  Selinexor and related SINE compounds have shown  substantial efficacy, 
with dosing regimens that match those currently under investigation in humans, in a variety 
of mouse models of hematological and solid tumors. These include DLBCL, ch ronic 
lymphocytic leukemia , Mantle Cell Lymphoma, acute myeloid leu kemia (AML), multiple 
myeloma, T -cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T -ALL), neuroblastoma, melanoma and 
prostate, breast, lung and ovarian cancers.  
Selinexor has shown potent in vitro  and in vivo anti -sarcoma activity.  Selinexor induced cell 
death through ap optosis in sarcoma cell lines, with nanomolar inhibitory concentrations in 
11 of 12 lines.  This cytotoxicity was associated with induction of p53 and p21 and reduction

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 41 in pRB  expression.  Furthermore, antitumor activity of selinexor was observed in two 
xeno graft models of human liposarcoma ( Nair 2013 ). Selinexor also completely suppressed 
tumor growth in human alveolar soft part sarcoma xenografts and this efficacy was 
associated with increased nuclear  retention of p53 and p21 and reduced expression of 
survivin ( Crochiere  2014 ).  
Results of a more recent study that investigated selinexor in vitro  and in vivo  using 17  cell 
lines and 9 sarcoma xenograft models confirm  that selinexor has potent in vitro  and in vivo 
activity against a wide variety of sarcoma models  (Nakayama 2016 ). Furthermore , in 
liposarcoma cell lines with MDM2 and CDK4 ampl ification, selinexor induce d G1 -arrest and 
apoptosis irrespective of p53 expression or mutation and irrespective of pRB expression. 
Selinexor increased p53 and p21 expression at the protein but not ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) 
level, indicating a post -transcriptional effect.  
4.2.2.  Pharmacokine tics and Toxicology  
The preclinical properties of selinexor were assessed in three species: mouse (CD1), rat 
(Sprague -Dawley), and monkey (cynomolgus).  While PK studies were limited to male 
animals for all three species, toxicokinetic (TK) evaluations were  conducted in both sexes for 
rats and monkeys as part of the selinexor toxicology studies, and no consistent sex -related 
differences were observed in either species.  No accumulation was observed in any of the 
multi -dose toxicology studies with an every -other-day dosing regimen for selinexor.  Overall, 
systemic exposure was generally dose -proportional in all TK studies that involved multiple 
dose levels.  Higher maximum plasma  concentration (C max) and earlier time to peak  plasma 
concentration (t max) values wer e observed in monkeys that were fasted versus  fed prior to 
dosing.  Systemic exposure (area under the curve from first to last plasma measurement, 
AUC last) to selinexor achieved with gelatin capsules was comparable to that achieved with 
oral suspension dosi ng, with lower C max and later t max values observed with capsules.  Results 
were not affected by the feeding status in monkeys.  Oral bioavailability (F%) of selinexor 
was remarkably consistent among the three species with average values of 66.5%, 61.2%, 
and 67.5% in mice, rats, and monkeys, respectively.  
Nonclinical toxicology studies indicated that the major adverse drug reactions (dose limiting 
toxicities, DLTs) across all species are reduced appetite with anorexia -induced weight loss 
partially consistent with satiety induction.  High calorie foods and glucocorticoids can 
mitigate weight loss in animals taking SINE XPO1 inhibitors.  
See the selinexor  IB for more information.  
4.3. Clinical Experience  
Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies are being conducted in advanced solid tumors and hematological 
malignancies (see the selinexor IB for a summary of clinical experience).  To date, more than 
2500 patients have received se linexor . Selinexor was generally well tole rated with supportive 
care given to prevent anorexia and fatigue.  The aggressive use of appetite stimulants has 
reduced the severity of the anorexia and fatigue and improved the long -term tolerability of 
selinexor treatment.  A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor has been determined to 
be 65  mg/m2 twice weekly (Days 1 and 3) in Phase 1 solid tumor patients.  The recommended

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 46 5. RATIONALE FOR THE ST UDY  
Nonclinical d ata indicate that selinexor shows cytotoxic effects at nanomolar concentrations 
on a variety of sarcoma cell lines, whereas non -cancer cells show cytotoxic effects at much 
higher concentrations of selinexor. In murine xenograft models, three times a week o ral 
treatment with selinexor inhibits the tumor growth of a variety of sarcomas including 
liposarcoma.  
Selinexor treatment resulted in SD in 30 of 52 (58%) evaluable patients with liposarcoma in 
the sarcoma Phase 1 study KCP -330-003 (Section  4.3.1 ). The most commonly reported 
TRAEs were nausea, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, anorexia, and hyponatremia, which were 
primarily Grade 1 or 2 (Section  4.3.4.1 ). Nausea and anorexia were well controlled with 
antinausea medications and appetite stimulants. These data further support the development 
of selinexor  for the treatment of liposarcoma.  
5.1. Rationale for the Doses and the Dosing Regimen  
To date, more than 2500 patients with advanced cancers have received selinexor orally in 
clinical studies  of selinexor  (Phase 1, 2, and 3) , and of these, 1 672 adult patients  in 
Karyopharm -sponsored studies were evaluat ed for safety as of 31 Ma rch 2018.  
Doses of 65 mg/m2 twice weekly have cleared DLT assessment and this is the MTD in the 
Phase 1 dose escalation study in advanced solid tumors, KCP -330-002. It should also be 
noted that while a dose of 70 mg/m2 cleared DLT in the AML arm of the Phase 1 study in 
patients with heavily pretreated hematological malignancies (KCP -330-001), escalating the 
dose beyond 70  mg/m2 twice weekly is prohibited in any study.  
In the present st udy, selinexor at a fixed oral dose of 60 mg (equivalent to ~35  mg/m2) or 
matching placebo  will be given twice weekly ( eg, Day 1 Monday and Day 3 Wednesday or 
Day 1 Tuesday and Day 3 Thursday or Day 1 Wednesday and Day 3 Friday) during 
Weeks  1-6 of each 6 -week (42 -day) cycle for a total of 12  doses per cycle.  
5.2. Rationale for Change in Response Criteria from WHO Response 
Criteria to RECIST v.  1.1 for the Primary Endpoint  
The Phase 2 primary PFS endpoint was evaluated using the WHO Response Criteria  (as 
specified in protocol V ersions ≤ 4 ). The WHO Response C riteria  were used based on input 
from the Sponsor’s Liposar coma Advisory Board. As RECIST C riteria have been 
traditionally used in sarcoma studies, including studies in liposarcoma, a prespecified 
analys is of PFS based on RECIST  v. 1.1  was also conducted  per protocol .  
The preplanned an alysis of PFS based on the WHO Response C riteria was conducted and the 
results of this blinded analysis (blinded to Sponsor and sites) were provided to the Data 
Safety Moni toring Board (DSMB).  
In addition, a  preliminary comparison of the PFS results by both WHO and RECIST v.  1.1 
Criteria  (48 PD events by WHO and 28 PD events by RECIST v. 1.1) for all eligible patients 
whose treatment assignments were unblinded in the Phase 2  portion of the study was carried 
out to inform the selection of the most clinically relevant response criteria for the Phase 3 
portion of the study . Preliminary Phase 2 results , updated as of 11 August 2017,  are

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
  
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 47 presented in  Section  4.3.2 . This analysis revealed that the WHO Response C riteria, which 
use a bi -dimensional evaluation of each lesion, resulted in the premature determi nation of 
clinically asymptomatic progression “events,” typically involving small lesions, while overall 
tumor burden was stable (as previously reported by other Investigators [ Therasse 2000 ]). 
Based on these results , the D SMB recommended that the analysis of the primary endpoint 
should use RECIST v . 1.1 C riteria, rather than WHO Response C riteria . The lead 
Investigators for the study, as well as the Sponsor, agreed with this recommendation . 
Furthermore, t he preliminary Phase 2 results using RECIST v. 1.1 Criteria were similar  to 
those obtained in the Phase 1 study of selinexor in patients with sarcoma including 
liposarcoma  (Gounder 2016 ). Based on these results  and consist ent with other studies in soft 
tissue sarcoma,  RECIST v.  1.1 has been  selected as the response criteria for the Phase  3 
primary PFS endpoint.  
5.3. Rationale for Change in the Primary Response Population  
Due to the change in the primary response criteria at the end of Phase 2, the pri mary response 
population  will now consist only  of Phase 3 patients who were assessed  for PD  throughout 
the study using RECIST v. 1.1 Criteria.  A formal analysis of all 56 eligible Phase 2 patients 
will be performed  separately.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 51 7. STUDY DESIGN  
7.1. Study Design Overview  
This is a Phase 2 -3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled study of 
patients diagnosed with advanced, unresectable liposarcoma.  Approximately 334 total 
patients will be randomized to study treatment (selinexor or placebo) as described below.  
Patients must provide written informed consent AND meet all the inclusion criteria and have 
none of the exclusion c riteria, before any screenin g tests not routinely performed  may be 
conducted.  The study flow chart is shown in Figure  1 and the disposition of patients  is shown  
in Figure  2 and Figure 3. 
Phase 2:  
• Fifty -seven patients w ere randomized to selinexor (60 mg) or pl acebo in a 1:1 
allocation.   
• Randomization w as stratified based on the following stratification factors for patients 
enrolle d under protocol V ersions ≤ 4: number  of prior systemic therapies (1  versus  ≥ 2) 
and prior eribulin use (prior eribulin versus  no prior eribulin ).  
The preplanned analysis of PFS was performed and served as a guideline to inform the final 
design of the Phase 3 portion of the study. See Section  4.3.2  for the preliminary  efficacy  
results for Phase 2.  
 
Phase 3:   
• Approximately 277 patients will be randomized to selinexor (60 mg) or placebo in a 
2:1 allocation ( ~185 selinexor,  ~ 92 placebo).   
• Randomization will be stratified based on (a) prior eribulin use (prior eribulin versus 
no prior eribulin), (b) prior trabectedin (Yondelis®) use (prior trabectedin versus no 
prior trabectedin), and (c) the number of prior systemic therapies excluding eri bulin 
and trabectedin ( 2 versus ≥ 3).  
An in terim analysis was conducted at 108 PFS events  (see Section  14.1.1.2.1 ). 
The Schedule of Assessments for Blinded Phase 2/Phase 3 Treatment and Open -label 
Selinexor are provided in  Table  1 and Table  2, respectively.  
Study treatment (selinexor or matching placebo) will be given twice weekly on Day 1 and 
Day 3 during Weeks 1 -6 of each six -week ( 42-day) cycle , without interrupti on between 
cycles.  
All radiographic responses will be determined by the central reader (see the Imaging Manual 
for more details).  
PD per RECIST v. 1.1. will be determined by the central r eader. Details for continuation of 
study treatment following PD and t he primary PFS analysis and follow -up after 
discontinuation of study treatment  are provided in Section  7.2.  
Treatment will continue until one or more of the following occurs:

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 53 7.2. Study Treatment  Following PD and the Primary PFS Analysis 
and Follow -up After Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Patients should  remain on blinded study treatment until the assessment of PD by the central 
reader.  
Prior to unblinding, the patient and the Investigator will be asked which study treatment 
(active [selinexor] or placebo) they believe the patient received during blinded study 
treatment. See  Section  10.7.2 . 
7.2.1.  Study Treatment After Determination of PD by the Central Reader  
Treatment assignment for patients who have PD pe r RECIST  v. 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009 ) 
determined by the central reader while receiving blinded study treatment will be unblinded. 
Note: WHO Response C riteria were used for Phase  2 patients whose treatment assignments 
were ava ilable at the time of the preplanned Phase 2 analysis.  
Patients who have PD may proceed as follows:  
• Patients in the placebo arm may cross over to open -label selinexor (60 mg twice 
weekly).   
o After their first PD on open -label selinexor, patients will discontinue study  
treatment and be followed for survival, unless the Investigator, in consultation 
with the Sponsor, believes based on clinical judgement that the patient may derive 
benefit from continued treatment  with selinexor  (see Section  7.2.4 ). 
• Patients in the selinexor arm who have PD will discontinue blinded study treatment 
and be followed for survival , unless the Investigator, in consulta tion with the 
Sponsor, believes based on clinical judgement that the patient may derive benefit 
from continued treatment  with selinexor (see Section  7.2.4 ). 
7.2.2.  Follow -up for Patients Without PD Who Discontinue Study Treatment  
Treatment assignment for patients who do NOT have PD determined by the central reader 
will not be unblinded until the primary PFS analysis at the end of Phase 3 .  
Patients who do NO T have PD determined by the central reader and/or who discontinue 
blinded study treatment may proceed as follows:  
• Patients should remain on blinded study treatment until the assessment of PD from 
the central reader is obtained .  
• Patients who discontinue blinded study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator 
for reasons other than PD  will be followed for survival. These patients are  not 
allowed to receive open -label selinexor (see Section  11.3.1  for unblinding 
exceptions).  
7.2.3.  Study Treatment Following the Primary PFS Analysis  
Treatment assignments for all patients will be unblinded when the required number of PFS 
events for the primary PFS analysis  at the end of Phase 3 have been obtained.  
Selinexor (KPT -330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
   
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 54 Patients who are on blinded study treatment at the time of the primary PFS analysis at the 
end of Phase 3 may proceed as follows:  
• Patients in the placebo arm may cross over to open -label selinexor.  
• Patients in the  selinexor arm will continue selinexor but as open -label treatment.  
All patients who have PD while receiving open -label selinexor will discontinue selinexor and 
be followed fo r survival, unless the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, believes 
based on clinical judgement that the patient may derive benefit from continued treatment  
with selinexor (see Section  7.2.4 ). 
7.2.4.  Exception for Patients Who May Derive Benefit from Continued Treatment  
with Selinexor  
After their first PD (determined by the central reader) on  selinexor  (either blinded or 
open -label)  the following patients may elect to continue selinexor as open -label treatment if 
the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, believes based on clinical judgement that 
the patient may derive be nefit from continued treatment  with selinexor : 
• Patients randomized to the selinexor arm  
• Patients randomized to the placebo arm who cross ed over to open -label selinexor  
• Patients randomized to the selinexor arm who continue d selinexor as open -label 
treatment at the time of t he primary PFS analysis  
Once these patients have a subsequent PD, they will discontinue open -label selinexor and be 
followed  for survival.  
7.3. Data Safety M onitoring Board  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up to review the safety of 
selinexor and to rev iew any SAEs  that occur during the study.  The DSMB will develop and 
follow a data and safety monitorin g plan and charter.  
The DSMB will be composed of at least two oncologists (at least one of whom specializes in 
sarcoma) and a statistician.  The DSMB will be provided with all reports of AEs including 
SAEs regardless of Investigator  causality assessments.  
DSMB meetings will occur on a periodic basis in accordance with the DSMB charte r.  
An independent unblinded statistician conduct ed the preplanned Phase 2 analysis, based upon 
calculated PFS by WHO Response Criteria  and provided the results of this blinded analysis 
(blinded to Sponsor and sites) to the DSMB  for review . In addition, a preliminary 
comparison of the PFS results  by both WHO and RECIST v. 1.1 C riteria (48 PD events by 
WHO and 28 PD events by RECIST v. 1.1) for all eligible patients whose treatmen t 
assignments were unblinded in the Phase 2 portion of the study was carried out to inform the 
selection of the most clinically relevant response criteria for the Phase 3 portion of the study. 
Preliminary Phase 2 results, updated as of 11 August 2017, are presented in  Section  4.3.2 . 
Based on these results , the DSMB recommended that the analysis of the primary end point 
should use RECIST v. 1.1 C riteria, rather than WHO Response C riteria.  
Selinexor (KPT -330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
   
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 55 An independent statistician will produce unblinded Phase 3 results for the DSMB, conduct 
the interim analysis that is planned after 105 PFS events are observed , and provide the results 
of this blinded analysis to the DSMB for review . The Phase 3 interim analysis will be based 
upon PF S calculated by RECIST v. 1.1. C riteria and analyzed for treatment futility (non -
binding) or sample size adjustment.  The Sponsor  (except for key team members as specified 
to monitor th e conduct of the study] and the sites ( eg, Investigators, staff, and patients) will 
remain blinded to the Phase  3 interim analysis results.  
The chairperson of the DSMB will be provided with SAE  reports, per the DSMB charter . 
The charter of the DSMB will s pecify that this committee is charged with providing periodic 
reports to Karyopharm that contain recommendations that include, but are not limited to, 
(a) continuation of the study ( or proposed changes to the study ), and (b)  termination of the 
study.  The charter will also describe a procedure for adjusting sample size, if needed.  
7.4. Stopping Rules  
The entire study or treatment of individual patients may be stopped under defined 
circumstances as outlined in Section 11: Discontinuation Criteria.  
Adverse Event Stopping Rules:  
The stopping rules  in the previous version of the protocol  have been revised based on the 
current selinexor safety profile and the decisions of the DSMB to continue the study without 
modifications. Stopping rules may be adjusted in the event of either the study re -opening to 
accrual or at any time during the conduct of the study and based on new information 
regarding the AE profil e of selinexor. Accrual may be suspended due to unexpected AE 
findings that h ave not crossed a  specified rule below.  
Accrual will be temporarily suspended if, at any time, an excessive death rate, attributed to 
study treatment, as determined by the DSMB is  observed.  
7.5. Criteria for E valuation  
Disease assessments at the date of surgical or radiotherapy intervention may be censored in 
patients receiving such care, since these patients are receiving non -protocol specified therapy 
(ie, intervention), which may impact endpoint(s).  
7.5.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
• Progress ion-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from date of randomization until 
the first date of PD, per RECIST v. 1.1, or death due to any cause. Evaluation of the 
radiologic data for the primary PFS endpoint will be based  on data from a scan 
review by  the independent central reader .

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 58 Key patient eligibility (inclusion /exclusion criteria) must be confirmed by the Sponsor for all 
patients participating in the s tudy prior to randomization.  
A Patient Enrollment Form will be sent from the site to the Karyopharm for evaluation. Upon 
confirmation of eligibility, Karyopharm will return the signed form to the site.  
7.6.1.  Study Patient Number  
Each patient in this study will be assigned a unique patient number and will keep this number  
for the duration of the study. Patient numbers will not be reassigned or reused for any reason.  
7.6.2.  Rescreening  
Rescreening is permitted in this stu dy. If a patient fails any of the inclusion or exclusion 
criteria, a patient may be rescreened after a suitable period of time (the exact length is 
dependent upon the reason for the screen failure) per the documented agreement of 
Karyopharm and the Investi gator. Any patient who is rescreened must be reconsented and 
will retain the same patient number. A patient may only fail screening once.  
7.6.3.  Screen Failures  
Patients who sign an informed consent but are not randomized for any reason will be 
considere d a screen failure. The reason fo r not being randomized will be entered on the 
eCRF. The demogra phic information (including screening number , informed consent date, 
and Inclusion/Exclusi on pages) must also be complete d for screen failure patients. No other 
data will be collected for patients who are screen 
failures, unless the patient experiences a 
SAE during the screening phase (see Section 13.2.2 for SAE reporting details). 
These data will also be retained in the Investigator’s study files and can be printed by the site 
in log format at the end of the study. The primary anal ysis for this study will be an 
intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis, therefore, screen failure data will not be analyzed.  
7.6.4.  Replacement of Patients  
Patients who fail screening may be replaced.  
Patients who withdraw from the study after randomization will not be replaced.  
7.7. Randomization  to Blinded Study T reatment  
In Phase 2, patients were random ized to either selinexor (60 mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization was stratified based on  the following stratification factors  for patients 
enrolle d under protocol V ersions ≤ 4: the number of prior systemic therapies (1 versus ≥ 2) 
and prior eribul in use (prior eribulin versus no  prior eribulin) . 
In Phase 3, patients will be randomized to selinexor or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Randomization 
will be stratified based on (a) prior eribulin use (prior eribulin versus no prior eribulin), (b) 
prior trabecte din (Yondelis®) use (prior trabectedin versus no prior trabectedin), and (c) the 
number of prior systemic therapies excluding eribulin and trabectedin  (2 versus ≥ 3).  
Specifically, randomization will be performed within each of the following 8 strata:  
1.≤ 2 prior systemic therap ies without prior eribulin use  or prior trabectedin use

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 59 2.≤ 2 prior systemic therapies without prior eribulin use but with prior trabectedin use
3.≤ 2 prior systemic therapies with prior eribulin use but without prior trabectedin use
4.≤ 2 prior systemic therapies with both prior eribulin use and prior trabectedin use
5.≥ 3 prior systemic therapies without prior eribulin use or prior trabectedin use
6.≥ 3 prior systemic therapies without prior eribulin use but with prior trabectedin use
7.≥ 3 prior systemic therapies with prior eribulin use but without prior trabectedin use
8.≥ 3 prior systemic therapies with both prior eribulin use and prior trabectedin use
Randomization will be performed by a centralized system after confirmation of patient 
eligibility by the Sponsor (see Section 7.7). 
Study treatment will be administered in a double -blinded manner until the analysis of the 
primary PFS endpoin t at the end of Phase 3, with the following exceptions: 1) patients in the 
placebo arm who have PD while they are receiving blinded study treatment may cross over to 
open -label selinexor, or 2) patients in the selinexor arm who  have PD but may derive benefit 
from continued treatment with selinexor may elect to continue selinexor, but as open -label 
treatment  (see Section  7.2.4 ). 
7.8. Blinding Procedures  
All study staff will be blinded to the patient treatment assignments and study treatment will 
be administered in a blinded manner  during blinded study treatment . To maintain the study 
blind, it is imperative that patient treatment assignme nts are not shared with the patients, their 
families, or any member of the study team, either at the study site or at Karyopharm  until 
unblinding is permitted  (See Section  11.3).

separate Assent Form must be signed by the patient at the time of informed consent. 
Procedures that are part of the clinical routine evaluations during the initial diagnostic work -
up of the patient may be performed b efore the ICF is  signed and dated ( ie, procedures that are 
not specific to the conduct of the study). A copy of the ICF must be given to the patient or to 
the person signing the form on behalf of the patient. The Investigator or designee must record 
in the  medical records of the patient the date when the study ICF was signed. The name and 
role of the witness should also be documented.  
The following screening assessments must be completed within 21 da ys prior  to C1 D1  
(except as noted), as specified in  Table  1: Schedule of Assessments and Study Activities .  
The screening period starts once a patient has provided written informed consent to 
participate  in the st udy and ends on the day of randomization .  
Rescreening is permitted in this study. See Section  7.6.2 .

A phone call will be made to the patient to evaluate supportive care medications, 
concomitant medications, and AEs/SAEs, and to adjust supportive care  as appropriate.  
9.1.6.  End of Blinded Treatment Visit ; Return to the Clinic  
At the time a patient permanent ly discontinues blinded study treatment or  has PD prior to 
unblinding of all patients  at the end of Phase 3  (ie, when the required number of PFS events 
for the primary PFS  analysis are observed ), a visit should be scheduled  as soon as possible 
(within 14  days), at which time all of the assessments listed for the E nd of Blinded Treatment 
(EoBT) V isit will be performed. Study procedures will be performed ≤  14 days after the last 
dose of study treatment , as specified in  Table  1. An EoBT CRF page will be completed, 
giving the date and reason for stopping th e study tre atment. Patients lost to follow -up should 
be recorded as such on the appropriate eCRF.  
For patients proceeding to open -label selinexor, the EoBT V isit will serve as the baseline for 
the open -label treatment phase.  After the unblinding following  the PFS analy ses, patients  in 
the selinexor  arm who are continuing on selinexor but as open -label treatment  must complete 
their EoBT V isit before their next scheduled selinexor dose .

• Concomitant medications  (throughout the cycle s) 
9.2.4.  End of Treatment Visit (≤  14 days after last dose of study treatment ); Return 
to the Clinic  
At the time a patient permanently discontinues selinexor a visit should be schedu led as soon 
as possible (within  14 days), at which time all of the assessments lis ted for the End of 
Treatment (EoT) V isit will be performed.  Study procedures will be performed ≤  14 days after 
the last dose of selinexor as specified  in Table  2. An EoT CRF page wi ll be completed, 
giving the date and reason for stopping the sel inexor. Patients lost to follow -up should be 
recorded as such on the appropriate eCRF.

• FDG -PET and CT (diagnostic) at screening and approximately 6 we eks after the 
first dose  of blinded study treatment  (ie, Day  1 of Cycle 2 ).  
• CT (preferred ) or MRI  scan will be performed a t approximately  12, 18, and 
24 weeks after the first dose of blinded study treatment (ie, Day  1 of Cycles 3, 4 , 
and 5), then every 12 we eks (ie, Day 1 of odd-numbered Cycles  ≥ 7) thereafter 
until PD or unblinding.  
Phase 3  
• CT (preferred ) or MRI will be performed at Screening and approximately 6, 12, 
18, and 24 weeks after the first dose of blinded study treatment (ie, Day 1 of 
Cycles  2, 3, 4 , and 5), then every 12  weeks (ie, Day 1 odd-numbered Cycles  ≥ 7) 
thereafter  until PD or unblinding.  
Open -label  Selinexor  
• CT (preferred ) or MRI at approximately 6 and 12 weeks after the first dose of 
open -label  selinexor ( ie, Day 1 of Open -label  Cycles 2 and 3 ), then every 12 weeks 
(ie, Day 1 of odd-numbered Cycles  ≥ 5) thereafter until PD. 
10.5.2.  Diagnosis/ Assessment of Progression/ Extent of Liposarcoma  
Assessment of liposarcoma per RECIST  v. 1.1  will be performed following each tumor scan.  
10.6. Safety Assessments  
Safety evaluations will be conducted as described below. Refer to  Table  1, Table  2, and 
Section 9 for the timing of all safety assessments.  
10.6.1.  Clinical Safety Assessments  
10.6.1.1.  Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
The physical examination will be performed according to the standards at each institution.  
Physical ex amination, including vital signs, will be performed on the scheduled day, even if 
study treatment is being interrupted . Physical examinations  should include general 
appearance, dermatological, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, respiratory, cardiovascular, 
abdominal, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, and neurological examinations.  
Selinexor (KPT -330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 79 All vital signs  will include:  
•Body temperature (oC or oF)
•Systolic and diastolic blood pressure  and pulse rate should be measured after the
patient has been in a supine or sitting position for 5 minutes. Blood pressure should
be assessed on the same arm throughout the study.
Information about the physical examination  must be present in the source documentation at 
the study site.  The result of the physical examination  prior to the st art of study treatment  
must be included in the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions eCRF.  
Clinically relevant findings made after the start of study treatment , which meet the definition 
of an AE, must be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
10.6.1.2.  Height, Weig ht, and BSA  
Height (without shoes) in centimeters (cm) and weight (indoor clothing without shoes) in 
kilograms (kg) will be measured. BSA will be calculated by the Dubois ( Dubois 1916 ) or 
Mosteller ( Mosteller 1987 ) method to verify that BSA >  1.2 m2 to ensure that an individual 
patient's selinexor dose would not exceed 70 mg/m2 twice weekly. If the patient’s weight 
fluctuates substantially, BSA should be re -calculated at each treatment visit. BSA should be 
re-calculated prior to any selinexor/placebo dose change.  
10.6.1.3.  ECOG Performance Status 
ECOG performance status assessments (Oken 1982) will be performed during the study to 
assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patients ( Appendix 3). 
10.6.1.4.  Electrocardiography  
Standard 12 -lead ECG s will be performed . The ECGs performed on Day 1 of Cycles  1 and  2 
during blinded study treatment are to be performed just prior to the blood sample taken 
2 hours postdose  (approximately at the expected t max of plasma selinexor). ECGs may also be 
performed as clinically indicated during the study.  
Patients must rest for  at least 5  minutes prior to any ECG recording.  The Investigator  will 
interpret the ECG using one of the following categories: normal, abnormal but not clinically 
significant, or abnormal and clinically significant.  The time the ECG was performed and the 
following parameters will be recorded in the eCRF: heart rate, PR interval, QT interval, QRS 
interval, and QT corrected using either Bazett’s or Fredericia’s formula.  
10.6.1.5.  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medi cations will be do cument ed for each patient at each scheduled visit. A 
detailed histo ry of m edications w ill be do cumented for each patient at sc reening and C1  D1. 
Subsequently, at each study visit, patients will be asked whether they have taken any 
medication other than the study treatment  through the end of the study . All concomitant 
medications including dietary supplements, over -the-counter medications, and oral herbal 
preparations, as well as changes in medication, will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Necessary supportive care such as appetit e stimulants, anti -emetics and anti -diarrheal 
medication, etc., will be allowed (see Section  12.2.5 ).

Information regarding AEs and  SAEs will be collected. See Section  13.1.2 . 
10.6.2.  Laboratory Safety Assessments  
10.6.2.1.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed by the sites’ local laboratories. In 
addition, laboratory tests will be coll ected and analyzed on the scheduled day, even if study 
treatment is being interrupted . More frequent assessments may be performed if clinically 
indicated, or at the Investigator ’s discretion and these should be recorded on the Unscheduled 
Visit eCRFs:  
• Hematology (blood s ample: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ) will include 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell (WBC) count, W BC 
differential, RBC count, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, band neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, platelets. WBC differential may be automated or manual as 
per institutional standards. Reticulocytes may be done only when clinically indicated.  
• Serum  Chemistry (blood  sample:  serum)  
- Complete Serum Chemistry will include sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphate, 
magnesium, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, lactate 
dehydrogenase ( LDH ), total protein , albumi n, creatinine kinase, uric acid.  
- Limited Ser um Chemistry will include  sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, 
BUN , creatinine, glucose, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and 
LDH.  
- If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.5 times the upper normal 
limit, total bilirubin should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting 
bilirubin.  
• Coagulation tests  will include prothrombin time (PT), international normalization 
ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).  
• Urinalysis will include  appearance, color, urine bilirubin, glucose, hemoglobin, 
ketones, pH, protein, specific gr avity, and urobilinogen . Microscopy will only be 
performed if clinically indicated . 
Blood chemistr y will be analyz ed at each study  center by a certified laboratory.  The 
Investigator  or designee will review the laboratory report after receipt of the results and 
assess the clinical significance of all abnormal values.  Results must be reviewed prior to 
dosing and appropr iate action taken for any clinically significant abnormal values.   
At any time during the study, abnormal laboratory values which are clinically relevant 
(eg, require dose modification and/or interruption of study treatment, lead to clinical 
symptoms or signs or require therapeutic intervention), whether specifically requested in the 
protocol or not, must be documented in the eCRF. If any abnormal laboratory val ue or test 
result constitutes an AE, then these must be recorded on the AE eCRF. Values will be 
documented on the laboratory report until stabilized, or the laboratory value returns to a

laboratory value that remains abnormal  at the EoBT  Visit (early discontinuati on patients) or 
EoT Visit (open -label patients) and that is considered clinically significant will be followed 
according to accepted medical standards for up to 30 days or until resolution of the 
abnormality or return to baseline.  
Toxicity will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE, v.  4.03.  
Karyopharm must be provided with a copy of the laboratory certification and normal ranges 
for each parameter measured. In ad dition, if at any time a patient has laboratory parameters 
obtained from a different outside laboratory, Karyopharm must be provided with a copy of 
the certification and normal ranges for that laboratory.  
10.6.2.2.  Pregnancy Testing  
Pregnancy testing will be perform ed for  females of childbearing potential  only. A negative 
serum hCG pregnancy test must be obtained at Screening within 3 days before the first dose 
of blinded study treatment. For females of childbearing potential who are proceeding to 
open -label selinexor a negative serum hCG pregnancy test  must be obtained  at the  EoBT 
Visit (or within 3 days before the  first dose of open -label selinexor ). Test sensitivity for hCG 
must be ≥ 25 mIU/mL.  
Pregnancy testing (serum hCG or high sensitivity urine) is als o required for females of 
childbearing potential prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles ≥ 2 during both blinded and open -
label treatment and at the EoT Visit (serum hCG). A positive urine pregnancy test will be 
confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  
Pregnan cy te sting may be performed if  clinically indicated during the study . 
10.7. Other Assessments  
10.7.1.  Quality of Life and Health -Related Outcomes  
QoL questionnaires s hould be completed prior to study treatment  administration on the days 
when QoL questionnaire is completed.  
EORTC QLQ -C30: The QLQ -C30 is a validated, patient self -administered instrument for 
assessing the health -related QoL of cancer patients participating in international clinical 
studies . It is a questionnaire containing both multi -item and single scales, incl uding five 
functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social and cognitive), three symptom scales 
(fatigue, nausea & vomiting and pain) and a global health status/QoL scale and six single 
items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea a nd financial difficulties).  
EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L: The EQ -5D-5L is a validated, patient self -administered instrument 
used for multiple health conditions and treatments, to provide a simple descriptive profile and 
a single index value of health status.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 82 10.7.2.  Treatment  Assignment Query  
Prior to unblinding, the patient and the Investigator will be asked which study treatment 
(active [selinexor] or placebo) they believe the patient received during blinded study 
treatment.  
Specifically:  
• After PD but prior to unblinding, the patient and the Investigator will be asked which 
study treatment (active [selinexor] or placebo) they believe the patient received 
during blinded study treatment and their responses will be recorded.  
• If blinded study treatment  is discontinued without PD, query should be performed at 
the time that blinded study treatment is discontinued and prior to unblinding.  See 
Section 11.3. 
• If unblinding is required for clinical management of a clinically important  SAE 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment and knowledge of the received study 
treatment is required for clinical management and treatment of the SAE, query should 
be performed prior to unblinding.  
10.7.3.  Nutritional Consultation  
It is strongly recommended that the Investigator, or his/her designee, provide patients with a 
nutritional consultation to discuss any food recommendations and strategies for managing 
potential nausea and appetite changes experienced with selinexor. This consultation does not 
need to be performed by a nutritionist.  
During bli nded study treatment, t he nutritional con sultation should occur on C1 D 1 before 
the first dose of blinded study treatment (or within the Screening Perio d). 
During treatment with open -label selinexor,  the nutritional con sultation should occur on 
C1 D1 before the firs t dose of open -label selinexor for patients in the placebo arm who cross 
over to open -label selinexor. The nutritional consu ltation is not required at C1 D 1 of 
open -label selinexor treatment for patients in the selinexor arm who continue on selinex or 
but as open -label treatment.  
The nutritional consultation may be also performed at any time during the study, as 
necessary.  
10.7.4.  Collection of Information on Antineoplastic Therapy  
Information on any antineoplastic therapies used after discontinuation  of study treatment will 
be collected at the EoBT Visit (Section 9.1.6 ), the EoT Visit (Section 9.2.4 ), Safety 
Follow -up Calls (Section  9.1.7  and Section 9.2.5 ), and d uring Survival Follow -up 
(Section  9.1.8  and Secti on 9.2.6 ). 
For patients who progress on post -study treatment antineoplasti c therapy, the Investigator 
should enter the date of progression  from the medical record  in the eCRF if that information 
is available to the Investigator.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 89 11.3. Unblinding  
11.3.1.  Unblinding of Treatment Assignment During Blinded Study Treatment  
Patie nts who have PD  per RECIST  v. 1.1 will discontinue blinded study treatment and their 
treatme nt assignment will be unblinded.  Unblinding will take place within 14 days of the last 
blinded dose and may occur on or before the patient’s EoBT Visit (Section  9.1.6 ). Only the 
patient, the Investigator at the study site, and key Sponsor team members  as specified to 
monitor the conduct of the study  will be unblinded to the treatment assignment . 
Treatment assignment s for patients who discontinue blinded study treatment without 
determination of PD by the central reader  (including patients who discontinue blinded study 
treatment for reason s other than PD ) will not be unblinded until the primary PFS analysis at 
the end o f Phase 3 and these patients a re not allowed to receive open -label selinexor.   
• Exception:  Treatment assignment may be unblinded in the event of a clinically 
important  SAE only if unblinding is required for clinical management of a clinically 
important  SAE leading to discontinuation of study treatment and knowledge of the 
received study treatment is required for clinical management and treatment of the 
SAE.  If the patient is on the placebo arm and PD has not been documented, the 
patient will not be elig ible t o receive open -label selinexor.  
11.3.2.  Unblinding of Treatment Assignment for All Patients at the Primary PFS 
Analysis  at the End of Phase 3  
Once the required  number of  PFS events for the  primary PFS analysis  at the end of Phase  3 
are observed , unblinding o f treatment assignment for all patients will take  place and the 
primary PFS analysis will be conducted.  Patients who did not have PD at the time of 
unblinding will 1) continue selinexor but as open -label treatment if they were in the selinexor 
arm, or 2) h ave the option to cross over to open -label selinexor if they were in the placebo 
arm. 
11.4. Definition of End of Study  
End of Study (EoS) will b e upon completion of the follow -up period for the last patient 
treated in the study. Completion of follow -up for the last patient will occur when the last 
patient in the study has expired, has been followed for 24 months after enro llment, has been 
lost to follow -up, or has withdrawn consent, whichever occurs first.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 90 12. TREATMENT  
Selinexor (KPT -330) immediate rele ase tablets for oral administration and matching placebo 
will be supplied in blister packs.  Selinexor tablets will be provided in a coated tablet strength 
of 20 mg.  
12.1. Dosing a nd Administration of Study T reatment  
12.1.1.  Labeling  
Medication labels for each blister pa ck of selinexor and matching placebo tablets will be in 
the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country. They will include 
storage conditions for the drug and the randomization number but no information about the 
patient.  
12.1.2.  Dispensi ng Directions  
The Investigator  or responsible site personnel must instruct the patient or caregiver to take 
the study treatment  as per protocol. Study treatment  will be dispensed to the patient by 
authorized site personnel only. Dispensing instruction will  be provided in the 
Pharmacy  Manual.  
12.1.3.  Dosing Information  
Selinexor tablets should be taken orally with at least 120 mL (4 ounces) of water. Selinexor 
can be taken with or without food . For additional details on drug formulation, preparation, 
and administration, please refer to the Pharmacy Manual and the selinexor IB . 
In order to avoid contact with skin, tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be 
crushed.  
Blinded Study Treatment  (Phases 2 and 3) :  
Selinexor and matching placebo will be administered as fixed  blinded oral doses of three 
20 mg tablets given twice weekly ( eg, Day 1 Monday and Day 3 Wednesday or Day 1 
Tuesday and Day 3 Thursday or Day 1 Wednesday and Day 3 Friday ) on Weeks 1 -6 of each 
6-week (42 -day) cycle  until PD, intolerability, consent withdrawal, or unblinding. Patients 
with a BSA  < 1.2 m2 as calculated per Dubois 1916  or Mosteller 1987  will be excluded from 
the study.  Selinexor will be administered as a flat -fixed dose, and not by body weight or 
BSA . 
Open -Label Selinexor :  
Patients on open -label selinexor will receive selinexor 60 mg twice -weekly during Weeks  1-6 
of each 6 -week (42 -day) cycle .  
The following 4 groups of patients may  receive open -label selinexor:  
(a) Patients in the placebo arm who have PD per RECIST v. 1.1 during blinded study 
treatment who elect to cross over to open -label  selinexor  
Selinexor (KPT -330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
   
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 91 (b) Patients in the selinexor arm who have PD per RECIST v. 1.1 during blinded study 
treatment who may derive benefit from continued treatment  with selinexor  (see 
Section  7.2.4 ). 
(c) Patients in the placebo arm who are receiving blinded study treatment at the time of 
the primary PFS analysis at the end of Phase 3 who elect to continue to cross over to 
open -label selinexor  
(d) Patients in the selinexor arm who are  receiving blinded study treatment at the time of 
the primary PFS analysis at the end of Phase 3 who elect to continue selinexor but as 
open -label treatment  
C1D1 of treatment with o pen-label selinexor for all 4  groups of patients listed above must 
occur wi thin 14 days of the patient’s EoBT Visit. For patients in the selinexor arm during 
blinded study treatment who continue selinexor but as open -label treatment there will be no 
break in the patient’s twice -weekly dosing schedule.  These patients must complete  the EoBT 
Visit before their next scheduled selinexor dose to maintain continuity of selinexor dosing 
from b linded to open -label treatment.  
12.1.4.  Dosing Instructions for the Study Participants  
Study treatment  will be provided for twice weekly dosing during Weeks  1-6 for all cycles. 
Patients will be provided adequate doses to take home to complete dosing until the next 
scheduled clinic visit.  Patients will be asked to bring remaining study medicine, if any, when 
returning to the clinic for any scheduled or unsched uled visit.   
The Investigator  should promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study 
treatment exactly as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patient’s 
safety and the validity of the study. The patient should be i nstructed to contact the 
Investigator  if he/she is unable for any reason to take the study treatment . 
Supportive treatment for the management of known toxicities will be provided as needed.  
All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose c hanges during the study 
must be recorded on the eCRF. Compliance to study treatment  will be recorded by study 
personnel after discussion with the patient and completion of drug accountability.  Medication 
compliance will be monitored by the Investigator  or a delegate and recorded in source 
documents.  The date will be recorded as per the study treatment  schedule.  The Investigator or 
designee will account for the number of tablets dispensed against those returned by the 
patient.  Any deviations and missed d oses will be recorded in the eCRF and drug 
accountability logs for verification of explanations for deviations.  The Investigator  or 
designee will try to ensure complete compliance with the dosing schedule by providing 
timely instructions to the patients an d re-education when necessary.  
12.2. Dose Reduction and Supportive Care Guidelines  
12.2.1.  Dose Modifications and Dose Delay  
For patients who do not tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments are 
permitted in order to allow the patient to continu e the study treatment. The criteria for dose 
modifications for toxicities considered related to the study treatment , as well as 
Selinexor (KPT -330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
   
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 92 recommended supportive care, are outlined below and in Section 12.2. All interruptions or 
changes to study treatment  administration must be recorded on the eCRF.  
A dose reduction should be considered  if the patient missed 2 consecutive doses or 
3 nonconsecutive doses in a cycle due to  an AE(s). The missed doses may be the result of a 
combination of AEs during the cycle ( eg, Day 1 doses of Weeks 1 and 2 missed due to 
nausea, Day  1 dose of Week 3 missed due to fatigue).  Following a dose reduction, d ose 
re-escalation is allowed  only after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
Patients who require extended dose interruptions without disease progression ( eg, 
unacceptable toxicities)  will remain on study and continue with tumor scans per schedule of 
assessments as specifie d in Table  1 and Table  2. 
Patients who withdraw  from the study for a study -related AE or an abnormal  laboratory value 
must be followed as described in Section  13.1.2 . Based on observations from the Phase  1 
studies in patients with advanced hematological and solid tumors, selinexor shows a 
reasonably wide therapeutic range with activities from ~10 mg/m2 to ≥ 60 mg/m2. Based on 
observations in over 1000 patients treated with selinexor alone or in combination with other 
agents, fatigue, anorexi a and weight loss associated with selinexor are highly variable and 
patient -specific . Therefore, in order to optimize specific anti tumor activity and the patient’s 
tolerability, we will allow for dose or schedule modifi cations as described in Section  12.2 
below and in  Table  9 (pre-specified dose/schedule modifications for AEs related to study 
treatment  and supportive care/dose adjustment guidelines, respectively.  Patients should also 
be treated aggressively with s upportive care to reduce toxicities.  If more than one different 
type of toxicity occurs concurrently, the most severe grade will determine the modification.  
For all ≥  Grade 3 hematological or Grade 3 non -hematological AEs that are NOT treatment  
related, af ter consultation with the Medical Monitor and at the discretion of the Investigator , 
dosing may be maintained provided that the patient can continue to take the agent by mouth.  
For all Grade 4 non -hematologic toxici ties, protocol -specified study treatment  
(selinexor /placebo) must be suspended and the Sponsor Medical Monitor consulted regarding 
options for continuation ( ie requirements for resuming study treatment  or permanent 
discontinuation).

If (corrected) sodium is Grade ≤3 and continues to be asymptomatic, 
then patient may continue current dosing without interruption provided 
that IV saline and/or salt tablets are provided and patient is followed 
closely.  
If Grade 3 is persistent or worsens or does not respond to treatment, 
interrupt selinexor dosing until resolved to Grade 1 or baseline and 
reduce selinexor by 1 dose level.  
Grade 3 with sodium levels 
<130 -120 mmol/L with 
symptoms or Grade 4 (<120 
mmol/L)  Rule out other causes including drug (eg, diuretic) effects.  
Be certain that reported sodium level is corrected for concurrent 
hyperglycemia (serum glucose >  150 mg/dL).  
Interrupt s elinexor dosing until resolved to Grade 1 or baseline and 
without symptoms. Reduce selinexor by 1 dose level.  
Diarrhea  
Grade 1  Maintain dose. Rule out other causes including drug effects. Treat per 
institutional guidelines with anti -diarrheals, such as loperamide.  
Grade 2  Rule out other causes including drug effects. Treat per institutional 
guidelines with anti -diarrheals. Interrupt selinexor dosing until resolved 
to Grade 1 or baseline.  
For first occurrence, restart selinexor at current dose.  
For  second occurrence, reduce selinexor by 1 dose level.  
Grade 3 or 4  Interrupt selinexor dosing until resolved to Grade 1 or baseline and 
patient is clinically stable. Reduce selinexor dose by 1  dose level.

Thrombocytopenia  
Grade 1 or 2  Maintain dose. Rule out other causes including drug effects.  
Grade 3 without bleeding  Rule out other causes including drug effects.  
For first occurrence: skip 1 dose and reduce selinexor by 1 dose level.  
If recurrent, unless  contraindicated, initiate treatment with mod erate to 
high doses of thrombopoietin stimulating agents such as romiplostim 5 
to 10  µg/kg SC weekly (preferred) or eltrombopag 100 to 150 mg QD.  
In cases where there is significant disease involvement in the bone 
marrow or pre -existing compromised marrow function (eg, due to prior 
marrow -toxic therapy), or if there is thrombocytopenia Grade 2 to 4 at 
baseline,  the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor may 
decide to continue selinexor dosing without dose reductions and/or 
interruptions as s pecified above, provided that platelet counts and 
bleeding symptoms/signs are closely monitored.  Thrombopoietin 
stimulating agents are recommended.  
Grade 4 without bleeding  Rule out other causes including drug effects.  
Interrupt selinexor until patient r ecovers to Grade 2 or baseline. 
Selinexor dosing may be reduced by 1 dose level (it is recommended to 
have only 1 dose modification per cycle)  
If recurrent, unless contraindicated, initiate treatment with moderate to 
high doses of thrombopoietin stimulating agents as above.  
In cases where there is significant disease involvement in the bone 
marrow or pre -existing compromised marrow function (eg,  due to prior 
marrow -toxic therapy), the Investigator in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor may decide to continue selinexor dosing without dose 
reductions and/or interruptions as specified above, provided that platelet 
counts and bleeding symptoms/sign s are closely monitored.  
Grade ≥3 with  bleeding  
 Interrupt selinexor dosing and check platelet counts weekly until the 
bleeding has stopped, patient is clinically stable and the platelets have 
recovered to Grade 2 or baseline. When resuming selinexor, red uce by 
1 dose level.  
If recurrent, unless contraindicated, initiate treatment with moderate to 
high doses of thrombopoietin stimulating agents as above.  
Neutropenia  
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
(afebrile)  
OR 
Febrile neutropenia  Institute colony stimulating factors and prophylactic antibiotics as 
clinically indicated per institutional guidelines.  
Interrupt selinexor and check neutrophils at least weekly until recovers 
to Grade  2 or baseline and without fever (if febrile) and the patient is 
clinically stable. Reinitiate selinexor therapy and colony stimulating 
factors per institutional guidelines.  
If recurrent, continue colony stimulating factors, interrupt selinexor until 
neutrophil counts improve to Grade ≤2 or baseline levels, and reduce 
dose of selinexor 1 dose level.  
Anemia  
Treat per institutional guidelines including blood transfusions and/or erythropoietins. Consider transfusing 
for symptoms with hemoglobin  >8 g/dL (Grade <3) or for any Grade 3 (hemoglobin <8 g/dL). If possible, 
maintain selinexor dose as long as patient is clinically stable, but if a dose reduction or interruption is 
desired, consult with the Medical Monitor.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 97 Toxicity and Intensity  Supportive Care and Dose Adjustment Guidelines  
Tumor lysis syndrome  
If TLS risk factors are identified, provide prophylactic IV hydration and regular monitoring of hydration 
(especially when increasing the dose of selinexor), renal function, urine output, and clinical laboratory 
measures of interest for TLS (eg, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, LDH, uric acid). Consider administration 
of hypouricemic agents to reduce the risk o f TLS.  
Hold  selinexor in patient with hyperkalemia (≥7.0 mmol/L) and/or symptoms of hyperkalemia, an increase in 
uric acid, or other changes in biochemical blood parameters suggestive of TLS. Start IV hydration, and 
consider hypouricemic agent until levels  return to normal. Selinexor can be reintroduced at the normal or 
reduced dose.  
Other selinexor -related adverse events  
Grade 1 or 2  Rule out other causes. Maintain dose. Start treatment and/or standard 
supportive care per institutional guidelines.  
Grade  3 or 4  Rule out other causes. Interrupt selinexor until recovers to Grade 2 or 
baseline and reduce selinexor by 1 dose level.  
Isolated values of Grade ≥3 alkaline phosphatase do NOT require dose 
interruption. Determination of liver versus bone etiology sh ould be 
made, and evaluation of gamma -glutamyl transferase, 5' -nucleotidase, or 
other liver enzymes should be performed.  
IV: intravenous; NCCN: National Comprehensive Cancer Network; QD: once daily; PO: oral; SC: 
subcutaneous: TLS: tumor lysis syndrome.  
aFor all  Grade ≥3  hematologic  or non-hematologic AEs  that are NOT  selinexor related, after consultation 
with the Medical Monitor and at the discretion of the Investigator, selinexor dosing may be maintained.  
bFor all selinexor -related AE’s, if the below pre scribed dose reductions/interruptions result in a stabilization 
of 4 weeks, a re -escalation may be considered after approval from the Medical Monitor.  
All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity.  
Note: When toxicities due to sel inexor have returned to baseline levels or the patient has stabilized, the dose 
of selinexor may be re -escalated in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
12.2.2.  Dose Reduction for Decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)  
Selinexor is not significantly eliminated by the kidney.  Therefore, no dose alteration of 
selinexor/placebo is required in patients with renal dysfunction.  
12.2.3.  Dose Adjustment in the Setting of Infection  
Patients with active uncontrolled or suspected infections should have treatment interru pted 
until the patient is clinically stab le. When ready to resume dosing , treatment may continue at 
the original dose.  Missed doses will not be replaced.  Patients may continue antibiotics for 
prolonged periods while re -initiating their treatment at the dis cretion of the Investigator .  
12.2.4.  Conditions N ot Requiring Dose Reduction  
The following conditions are exceptions to the guidelines.  Dosing does not need to be 
interrupted  in the following cases:  
• Alopecia of any grade  
• Electrolyte or serum analyte ( eg, urate) a bnormalities that is reversible with standard 
interventions  
• Isolated values of Grade ≥ 3 alkaline phosphatase. Determination of liver versus bone 
etiology should be made, and evaluation of gamma -glutamyl transferase, 
5' nucleotidase, or other liver enzymes  should be performed.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 98 12.2.4.1.  Missed or Vomited Doses  
Missed and Delayed Doses  
A maximum of 2 doses may be given per week.   
If a dose was missed , the schedule of that week should be altered to accommodate two doses 
in that week with at least 36 hr between two consecutive doses.  
If a dose must be skipped ( eg, due to recommendation of Investigator ), the next dose will 
be taken as per schedule. Doses should not be administered less than 36  hr apart and all 
missed and delayed doses should be documented.  
Vomited Doses  
If a dose is vomited within one hour of ingestion, it will be replaced.  If vomiting occurs more 
than one hour after dosing, it will still be considered a complete dose.  
If a patient missed a full week of dosing for non -study treatment  related events ( eg, a 
required medical procedure or an unanticipated personal emergency), the days missed will 
not be replaced.  For example, if patient m issed dosing fr om Cycle 2 Day 7 to Cycle  2 
Day 14, then the patient will re -start dosing on Cycle 2 Day 15.  
12.2.5.  Supportive Care and Concomitant Treatments  
12.2.5.1.  Required Prophylactic Therapy with 5 -HT3 Antagonists  
In order to minimize nausea, unless contraindicated,  all patients should  receive 5-HT3 
antagonists ( 8 mg or equivalent) starting before the first dose  of blinded study treatment  and 
continued  2-3 times daily thereafter , as needed . Alternative treatment may be provided if the 
patient does not tolerate 5 -HT3 antagonists.  
12.2.5.2.  Supportive Care  
General Supportive Care Recommendations  
Supportive measures for optimal medical care should be provided during part icipation in this 
clinical study . Based on clinical observations  1672  adult patients in Karyopharm -sponsored 
studies as of 31 Ma rch 2018, the main adverse drug reactions are primarily related to 
anorexia with poor caloric and fluid intake, fatigue, and nausea.  Thrombocytopenia also 
occurs, although it is rarely associated with bleeding. Besides the required 5 -HT3 
prophylaxis ( Section  12.2.5.1 ), supportive ca re including anti -nausea / anti -emetic therapy, 
acid suppression (proton pump inhibitors and/or H2-blockers) and other treatments may be 
administered as described below:

Additional options, incl uding D2 antagonists, can be found in the  NCCN CPGO for 
antiemesis  and anorexia/cachexia (palliative care ). 
c. Neurokinin 1 re ceptor antagonist (NK1R antagonist):  aprepitant or equivalent should be 
considered and will be covered for selected patients who have severe nausea and 
vomiting.  
Supportive Care and Dose Adjustment Recomme ndations for Specific 
Selinexor -Related Adverse Eve nts 
Please see detailed recommendations in  Table  9: Supportive Care and Dose Adjustment 
Guidelines.  
12.2.5.3.  Concomitant Medication and Treatment  
Concomitant medication includes any prescription or over -the-counter preparation, including 
vitamins and  supplements.  Patients may continue their baseline medication(s). All 
concomitant medication(s) must be reported in t he eCRF . Any diagnostic, therapeutic, or 
surgical procedure performed during the study period should be recorded, including the 
dates, desc ription of the procedure(s), and any clinical findings.   
Permitted Concomitant Medication  
Patients will receive concomitant medications to treat symptoms, AEs and intercurrent 
illnesses that are medically necessary as standard care.  Medications to treat concomitant 
diseases like diabetes, hypertension, etc., are allowed.  
Contraception Requirements  
For females of childbearing potential, a negative serum hCG pregnancy test must be obtained 
at Screening within 3 days before the first dose of blinded study tr eatment. For females of 
childbearing potential who are proceeding to open -label selinexor, a negative serum hCG 
pregnancy test must be obtained at the EoBT Visit (or within 3 days before the first dose of 
open -label selinexor).  
Patients should not become p regnant or father a child while on this study because the study 
treatments in this study can affect an unborn baby.  
Female patients should not breastfeed a baby while on this study. It is important that patients 
understand the need to use birth control wh ile on this study.  
Female patients of childbearing potential and fertile male patients who are sexually active 
with a female of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of contraception 
throughout the study and for 3 months following the l ast dose of study treatment.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are listed in Section  13.3.1 .  
Use of Blood P roducts  
During treatment, pat ients may receive RBC  or platelet transfusions, if clinically indicated, 
per institutional guidelines.  Patients who require repeated transfusion support should be 
discussed with the PI, Sponsor, and Medical Monitor.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 100 Appropriate anti -coagulation is allowed during the study ( eg, low molec ular weight  heparin, 
direct factor Xa inhibitors, etc.).  Warfarin is allowed during the study provided patients are 
monitored for INR twice a week during the first two cycles of therapy, then weekly to 
biweekly thereafter.  
Patients may receive supportive care with erythropoietin, darbepoetin, granulocyte -colony 
stimulating factor (G -CSF) or granulocyte macrophag e-colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF), 
pegylated growth factors, and platelet stimulatory factors, in accordance with  clinical 
practice or institutional guidelines , prior to entry and throughout the study.   
Glucocorticoid Therapy  
Glucocorticoids ≤  20 mg oral prednisone (or equivalent) per day are permitted at baseline 
and during the study for non -malignant conditions ( ie, asthma, irritable bowel disease, etc.), 
as needed, but patients should preferably have been on a stable dose for at least two weeks 
before study entry.  
Radiation Treatment  
If clinically indicated, palliative radiation therapy to non -target lesions is per mitted but study 
treatment  should be interrupted  for two days before the start of pal liative radiation therapy 
and 2  days after palliative radiation therapy.  Treatment shall not be discontinued solely due 
to palliative radiation.  (Radiation may be needed to treat the patient’s  liposarcoma and would 
require discontinuation  of study  treatment .)

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 103 13.  SAFETY DEFIN ITIONS, RECORDING , AND REPORTING  
13.1. Adverse Events  
13.1.1.  Definitions  
• Adverse event (AE) : Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and uni ntended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study 
treatment.  
• Treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) : Any event t hat was not present prior 
to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in 
either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment.  
• Adverse event of special interest (AESI) : Any AE (serious or nonserious) that is of 
scientific and medical concern specific to the study treatment, for which ongoing 
monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor is 
appropriate.  
• Serious adverse event (SAE) : Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, 
results in death; is life threatening (ie, an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe); requires inpatient hospitalization 
or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. (See Section  13.2.2  
for additional information about SAE reporting.)  
13.1.2.  Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs that begin or worsen after the patient has provided informed consent will be 
recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF, regardless of whether dosing with study drug has 
commenced. AE monitoring should be continued for at least 30  days following the last dose 
of study treatment (ie, through 30  days following last dose or until resolution or through the 
end of the study for events considered related to study treatm ent by the Investigator). AEs 
(including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be recorded as a separate 
AE. 
The Investigator should ask the patient non -leading questions to determine if AEs occur 
during the study. AEs may also be recorded when they are volunteered by the patient, or 
through physical examination, labor atory tests, or other clinical assessments.  
An AE should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 104 severity of the event, the sus pected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions 
required to treat the event, and the outcome.  
13.1.2.1.  Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (ie, are considered to be 
clinically significant, in duce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or 
require changes in  study treatment) should be recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF . 
Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia 
instead of low hemoglob in). Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for an AE should 
be followed until they have returned to baseline (at screening) or an adequate explanation of 
the abnormality is identified. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a 
sign/symptom of an already reported AE, it is not necessary to separately record the 
laboratory/test result as an additional event.  
A laboratory abnormality that does not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as 
an AE. A Grade 3 or 4 event (se vere per NCI CTCAE v.  4.03) does not automatically 
indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined in Section  13.1.1  and/or 
as per Investigator’s discretion. A laboratory abnormality that results in a dose being 
interrupted  or modified would, by definition, be an AE and must be recorded as such in the 
eCRFs . 
13.1.2.2.  Other Adverse Events  
13.1.2.2.1.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
As of Ma y 2018, 8 TLS cases have been  reported : 4 patients in Karyopharm -sponsored 
studies, 2 patients in Investigator -sponsored studies, and 2 patient s in the expanded access 
program (compassionate use). Of the 8 patients, 5 had MM reported as their underlying 
cancer and 3 had hematolo gical malignancies (including AML and acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia). The event onset latency ranged from 3  to 8 days (median 4 days). The total 
selinexor dose prior to event onset ranged from 40 mg to 320 mg (median 160 mg). The 
outcome was reported as rec overed in 4 patients, not recovered in 2 patient s, and the outcome 
was not reported  in 2 patient. The Investigators assessed 7 of the events as related to 
selinexor. Of the 8 cases summarized above, there were 3 cases with Grade 5 TEAEs 
reported. The cause  of death in each of these cases was reported as: respiratory failure 
secondary to advanced MM (Grade 5), sepsis (Grade 5), and respiratory failure, 
chemotherapy -induced cardiomyopathy and acute lymphoid leukemia (Grade 5). No fatal 
outcomes due to TLS hav e been reported in any studies with selinexor, or in the ongoing 
expanded access program. Although the incidence of TLS is low (~0.3%), the causal 
relationship between selinexor treatment and TLS cannot be completely excluded. Early 
recognition of signs an d symptoms in patients at risk for TLS, including identification of 
abnormal clinical and laboratory values, is key and Investigators must ensure that patients 
being treated with selinexor maintain adequate caloric and fluid intake. Close monitoring and 
management of patients with hematological malignancies for potential signs and symptoms 
of TLS are most relevant. See Table  9 for supportive care and Table  8 for selinexor dose 
modification guidance.

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
   
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 105 13.1.3.  Adverse Event Severity  
The severity of the AE will be graded by the Investigator according to the NCI CT CAE 
Grading Scale, v. 4.03 (the NCI CTCAE files can be accessed online at the following URL: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html).  
If NCI CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE, the severity will be characterized as “mild,” 
“moderate,” “severe,” o r “life -threatening (corresponding to Grades 1 to 4) according to the 
following definitions:  
• Grade 1 (Mild) events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s 
daily activities.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate) events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to 
the patient and may interfere with daily activities.  
• Grade 3 (Severe) events interrupt the patient’s usual daily activities.  
• Grade 4 events are Life -threatening.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself could be of 
relatively minor clinical significance (eg, ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as a 
“serious” AE.  
13.1.4.  Adverse Event Causality  
The Investigator will make a judgment regarding the relationship of the AE to study 
treatment, as defined below.  
• Not related:  These events will lack a temporal relationship of the event to 
the study treatment, making a causal relationship not 
reasonably possible . Exposure to other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions may provide a  
sufficient explanation for the event.  
• Related:  There is a temporal relationship of the event to the study 
treatment making a definitive relationship, and the event is 
more likely explained by exposure to the study treatment than 
by any other drugs, therap eutic interventions, or underlying 
conditions.  
13.2. Serious Adverse Events  
See Section  13.1.1   for the definition of an SAE. Please note that SAEs that o ccur at any time 
between the signing of the ICF up to the first dose of study treatment must be reported (in 
addition to SAEs that occur after the first dose of study treatment).   
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threaten ing, or do not 
require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 106 dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Events that Do N ot Meet the Definition of an SAE  
Elective hospitalizations to administer, or to simplify study treatment or study procedures 
(i.e., an overnight stay to facilitate 24 -hour urine capture) or other medical procedures are not 
considered SAEs. However, a hospi talization meeting the regulatory definition for ‘serious’ 
is any inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health 
care facility. An emergency room visit is not considered a hospitalization unless it results in 
an offic ial admission to the hospital (eg, undesirable effects of any administered treatment) 
must be documented as an SAE.  
Progression of the malignancy (including fatal outcomes) should NOT be reported as an SAE 
during the study or within the safety reporting pe riod (see  Section  13.2.2 ). Sudden and 
unexplained death should be reported as an SAE. If there is any uncertainty about a finding 
being due solely t o progression of malignancy, the finding should be reported as an AE or 
SAE, as appropriate,  Section  13.1.1 ).  
13.2.1.  Recording of Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to record and document all SAEs occurring from 
the signing of the ICF until at least 30 days after the patient has stopped study treatment. All 
SAEs must be reported on the designated sponsor SAE Report Form in ad dition to being 
recorded in the eCRF. The original SAE report form must be retained in the Investigator’s 
site file.  
All applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically 
thorough report. The Investigator must assess and re cord the relationship of each SAE to 
study treatment and complete the SAE Report Form (in English).  
See ICH E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Attachment 1) for key data elements that are required for e xpedited reporting.  
13.2.2.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Every SAE, regardless of the causal relationship to the study treatment, occurring after the 
patient has signed informed consent, until at least 30  days after the patient has stopped study 
treatment, must be reported to the Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance Department within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The investigational site personnel must use the SAE 
Report Form provided by Karyopharm for reporting any SAE to the Karyopharm 
Pharmacovigilance Department.  
Upon completion, the SAE Report Form must be immediately emailed or faxed to:  
Pharmacovigilance Department

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 107 Any SAE observed after the 30 -day follow -up period should only be reported to Karyopharm 
if the Investigator suspects that the SAE has a causal relationship to study treatment. 
Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be re ported as 
follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the Investigator receiving the follow -up 
information.  
An SAE should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more  frequently, if necessary) of any changes in 
severity of the event, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions 
required to treat the event, and the outcome.  
13.2.3.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serio us adverse reactions (SUSARs) are SAEs that are unexpected and 
judged by the Investigator or Karyopharm to be related to the study treatment administered. 
SUSARs will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with the FDA’s “Safety Reporting Requirements for 
Investigational New Drugs and Bioanalytical/Bioequivalence Studies” or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries.  
In addition, Karyopharm will communicate all cases of ce rebellar toxicity, Grade 3 or higher, 
to regulatory authorities, central ethics committees (eg, IRBs), and Investigators, in the 
format of an expedited Safety Report, within 7  days of awareness of the event.  
If required by local regulations, the Investiga tor is responsible for notifying his/her IRB or 
local ethics committee of all SAEs.  
13.3. Procedures for Handling Special Situations  
13.3.1.  Pregnancy and Breastfeeding  
Note: Pregnancy per se is not considered to be an AE; however, it is discussed here because 
of the im portance of reporting pregnancies that occur during studies and because a medical 
occurrence observed in the mother or fetus/newborn would be classified as an AE.  
During both blinded and open -label treatment, f emale patients of childbearing potential and 
fertile male patients will be informed as to the potential risk of conception while participating 
in this study and will be advised that they must use highly effective contraception listed 
below (ie, results in a low failure rate when used consistently and correctly) during the 
dosing period and for a period of at least 3 months after the end of treatment.  
Highly effective methods include:  
• combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
• progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 108 o oral 
o injectable  
o implantable  
• intrauterine device  
• intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• bilateral tubal occlusion  
• vasectomized partner  
• sexual abstinenc e 
During both blinded and open -label treatment a  pregnancy test will be performed on each 
premenopausal female patient of childbearing potential prior to the first dose of study drug, 
on Day 1 of Cycles ≥2 while on treatment, and again at treatment discont inuation during the 
End-of-Treatment visit. A negative pregnancy test must be documented prior to 
administration of study drug.  
If a patient is confirmed pregnant during the study, study drug administration must be 
discontinued immediately. The Investigator must immediately notify the sponsor medical 
monitor of this event and record the Pregnancy on the Pregnancy Form. The initial 
information regarding a pregnancy must be forwarded to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance by 
email or fax within 24 hours of  first knowledge of its occurrence. A pregnancy report form is 
provided by Karyopharm.  
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, 
congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Pregnancies must be reported to Karyopharm, regardless of whether the patient received 
selinexor or other study drugs, regardless of whether the patient withdraws from the study o r 
the study is completed, for 3 months after the patient receives his/her last dose of study 
treatment. Patients should be instructed to inform the Investigator regarding any pregnancies.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE rep ort form (eg, 
maternal serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in accordance with the 
procedure  for reporting SAEs.  
A pregnancy in a female p artner of a male patient must be reported to Karyopharm within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Pregnancies in female partners should only be 
followed if the male patient is being treated with a selinexor -containing regimen. Consent to 
report inform ation regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the female 
partner.  
It is not known whether selinexor passes into the breast milk. Mothers should not breastfeed 
while being treated with selinexor -containing regimen.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 109 13.3.2.  Overdose, Abuse, Misuse , Medication Errors, and Occupational Exposure  
All incidences of overdose, abuse, misuse, medication errors, and occupational exposure are 
required to be reported to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance on an SAE report form, emailed  to 
pharmacovigilance@karyopharm.com , regardless of whether or not there is an associated AE 
or SAE.  
13.3.2.1.  Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or accidental administration of any study treatment to a study 
patient, at a dose greater than that which was assigned to that patient per the study protocol. 
If an overdose occurs, the Investigator and Karyopharm should be notified immediately, and 
the patient should be observed closely for AEs. Resulting symptoms should be treated, as 
appropriate, and the incident of overdo se and related AEs and/or treatment should be 
documented in the patient’s medical record and in the eCRF. Overdose is to be reported on 
an SAE report form to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance regardless of whether or not an AE or 
SAE has occurred due to the ove rdose. If the overdose is associated with an SAE, the SAE 
report form must be submitted to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of 
awareness. If there is no AE or SAE, the report must be submitted within 24 hours of 
awareness . 
As selinexor is metab olized by GSH conjugation, it is possible, but not demonstrated, that 
hepatic GSH depletion might occur in case of extreme overdose. Therefore, in overdose 
cases, if patients develop liver function test abnormalities, supportive measures such as SAM 
or oth er drugs that can replace GSH might be considered as part of the overall management 
plan.  
13.3.2.2.  Abuse, Misuse, or Medication Error  
Abuse is the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study treatment which is 
accompanied by harmful physical or p sychological effects.  
A medication error is any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate study 
treatment use or patient harm while the study treatment is in the control of the health care 
professionals or patients. Such incident may be  due to health care professional practice, 
product labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for administration, and systems, 
including the following: prescribing, order communication, nomenclature, compounding, 
dispensing, distribution, administrati on, education, monitoring, and use.  
All occurrences of abuse, misuse, or medication error with any study treatment are to be 
reported on an SAE report form to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance regardless of whether or 
not an AE or SAE has occurred due to the ab use, misuse, or medication error. If the abuse, 
misuse, or medication error is associated with an SAE, the SAE report form must be 
submitted to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of awareness. If there is no AE 
or SAE, the report must be submitte d within 24 hours of awareness.  
13.3.2.3.  Occupational Exposure  
Occupational exposure is the exposure to a study treatment as a result of one’s professional 
or non -professional occupation.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 110 All occurrences of occupational exposure with any study treatment are to be reported on an 
SAE report form to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance regardless of whether or not an AE or 
SAE has occurred due to the occupational exposure. If the occupational exposure is 
associated with an SAE, the SAE report form must be submitted to Karyoph arm 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of awareness. If there is no AE or SAE, the report must 
be submitted within 24 hours of awareness.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 111 14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock.  Any deviation from 
the statistical plan will be described in the final report.  
14.1. General Considerations  
This is a multicenter randomized double -blind Phase 2 -3 study of the SINE selinexor given 
orally in patients with advanced unresectable liposarcoma.  
Enrollme nt in Phase 2 has been completed  and the preplanned analysis of PFS (after 40 PFS 
events were observed) was performed . Details are provided in Section  14.1.1.1 . 
There was no break between Phase  2 and Phase 3 enrollment.  
In Phase 3, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive selinexor (60 mg) or 
placeb o. Randomization details are provided in Section  7.7.  
Patients  in the placebo arm  who have PD while they are receiving blinded stud y treatment 
will be allowed to cross  over to open -label selinexor  (see Section  7.2.1).  
Patients who are on blinded study treatment at the time of the primary PFS analysis at the 
end of Phase 3 may proceed as follows:  
• Patients in the placebo arm may cr oss over to open -label selinexor.  
• Patients in the selinexor arm will continue selinexor but as open -label treatment.  
Tabulations will be produced for appropriate demographic, baseline, efficacy, and safety 
parameters.  For categorical variables, summary tabulations of the number and percentage of 
patients within each category (with a category for missing data) of the parameter will be 
presented, as well as two -sided 95% CIs, unless otherwise stated. For continuous variab les, 
the number of patients, mean, med ian, standard deviation , minimum, and maximum values 
will be presented.  Time -to-event data  will be summarized with Kaplan -Meier methodology 
using 25th, 50th (median), and 75t h percentiles with associated 2 -sided 95% CIs as well as 
percentage of censored observations .  
14.1.1.  Determination of Sample Size  
14.1.1.1.  Determination of Sample Size for Phase 2  
Enrollment in Phase 2 has been completed .  
Fifty -seven patients were randomized to selinexor or placebo in a 1:1 allocation. 
Randomization details are provided in Section  7.7.  
The preplanned analysis of PFS (after 40 PFS events were observed) was performed and 
served as a guideline to inform the final design of the Phase 3 portion of the study.  
A summary of the preliminary efficacy results  for Phase 2  is provided in  Section  4.3.2 .

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 113 Based on the safety and efficacy da ta, the DSMB recommendation was continuation of the 
study with no change to safety monitoring and no sample size adjustment.   
All sample size calculat ions were conducted using EAST V ersion 6.4  or higher  (East 2016 ). 
14.1.2.  Blinding and Randomization  
Study treatment  will be administered in a blinded manner.  Randomization will be performed 
across study sites within the stratification factor s, in ord er to maintain the required 
1:1 (selinexor:placebo in Phase 2) or  2:1 (selinexor:placebo  in Phase 3) randomization.  
Randomization will be performed by a centralized system after confirmation of patient 
eligibility by the Sponsor (see Section 7.6 and Section  7.7). 
14.2. Analysis Population  
14.2.1.  Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients who are randomized to study 
treatment  in Phase 3 . This population will be us ed for primary analyses of efficacy.  Patien ts 
will be analyzed in the treatment arm  to which they were randomized.  
14.2.2.  Per-Protocol Population  
The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of all patients in the ITT population who have 
no major protocol violat ions, including mis -randomizations,  that would compromise the 
assessment of efficacy; this would inclu de receipt of sufficient study treatment  
(80%  compliance or more).  Major violations will be determined independently of knowledge 
of response to study treatment . This population will be used for supportive inferences 
concerning efficacy.  Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
14.2.3.  Safety Population  
The safety population will consist of all patients who have received any amount  of study 
treatment . Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
14.3. Data Analysis and Presentation  
Summary tabulations will be provided for disposition, demographic, baseline, efficacy, and 
safety data as noted in the following sec tions.  All data collected on the eCRF will be 
provided in by -patient data listings.  
14.3.1.  Disposition of Patients  
A tabulation of patient disposition will be presented including the number in each analysis 
population, the number in each analysis population, the  number censored at each of the PFS 
and OS analyses, the number lost to follow -up, the number that withdrew, and reason(s) for 
withdrawal.  
A by -patient listing of patient disposition information including the reason for study 
withdrawal, where applicable, will be presented.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 114 14.3.2.  Demographic Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics will be summarized by treatment arm, as well as overall, and 
will include gender, race, ethnicity (Hispanic origin), and age at time of consent.  For gender, 
race, and Hispanic or Latino origin, the summary statistics will be the number and percentage 
of patients within each category.  The categories for race will be those recorded in the 
database. For age at time of consent, the mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard 
deviation  will be provided for each arm and the total sample.  No formal hypothesis testing of 
treatment differences will be performed.  
14.3.3.  Baseline Characteristics and Medical History  
Baseline characteristics include ECOG performance status, duration from initial diagn osis, 
response to previous therapy, types of prior therapy, and number of prior therapies. Baseline 
data will be summarized for each treatment group using summary statistics; no formal 
hypothesis testing of treatment differences will be performed.  
Medical history and physical examination  results at baseline will be tabulated by treatment.  
14.3.4.  Efficacy Analysis  
Disease assessments at the date of surgical or radiotherapy intervention may be censored in 
patients receiving such care, since these patients are receiv ing non -protocol specified therapy 
(ie, intervention), which may impact endpoint(s).   
Based on the preplanned  analysis of PFS by WHO and RECIST v . 1.1 C riteria  in the Phase 2 
portion of the study , the response criteria fo r the primary analysis (PFS) were  changed from 
WHO to RECIST v . 1.1 C riteria in Version 4.0 of the protocol. Consequently, data from the 
Phase 2 portion of the study will be excluded from the final efficacy analysis in order to 
maintain statistical integrity and preserve overall T ype I erro r rate.  
14.3.4.1.  Efficacy Analysis for Phase 2  
All Phase 2 analyses will be conducted among Phase 2 patients only.  
Phase 2 Primary Endpoint Analysis:  
The preplanned  analysis of PFS  after 40 PFS events  was conducted with an 11 August 2017 
data cut with 49  eligible patients whos e treatment assignments were available . Patients were 
analyzed in the treatment arm to which th ey were randomized. The preplanned PFS analysis 
was conducted by both WHO and RECIST v . 1.1 C riteria  and served as a guideline to inform 
the final d esign of the Phase 3 portion of the study . See Section  4.3.2  for a summary of the 
preliminary data.   
The primary endpoint PFS  for Phase 2  is defined as  the time from date of randomization 
until the first date of PD, per RECIST v. 1.1 , or death due to any cause. Evaluation of the 
radiographic data for the PFS primary endpoint will be ba sed on data from a  scan review 
by the independent central r eader.  
The formal primary Phase 2 PFS analysis will be pe rformed on all 56 eligible patients 
randomized to study treatment  in Phase 2 when their  treatment assignments  are unblinded . 
Patients will be analyzed in the treatment arm to which they are randomize d.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 116 Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model will be used to  assess PFS, adjusted for 
stratification factor and other prognostic covariates. Model assumptions will be examined, 
and in the presence of non -proportional predictors, str atification or including a 
time-dependent variable of the non -proportional predictor s will be considered as 
appropriate.  
14.3.4.2.2.  Phase 3 Secondary Key and Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
Secondary Key Endpoint Analysis  
Key s econdary  variables will include the following, assessed in hierarchical fashion in the 
order presented  (to preserve the overall Type I error for the study) , according to the 
definitions described in the objectives and study endpoints:  
• OS for non -inferiority  
• OS for superiority  
OS endpoints will be analyzed using the stratified log -rank test as described above. In 
sensitivity analysis for OS, the 2-stage estimation  method  will be implemented to assess the 
impact of cross -over on the effect of selinexor on OS  (Latimer 2017, Latimer 2018 ). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The compa rison of TTP in the current study to TTP on the most recent prior therapy will be 
performed as time -to-event using a stratified log -rank test stratified by patient IDs to 
account for correlation within patient and adjusted for treatment arm.  Note that TTP for the 
current study may represent censored results, therefore, to minimize the impact of 
censoring, this analysis may require maturation of the TTP data beyond the required time at 
which the number of events for the primary PFS analysis at the end of Pha se 3 have 
occurred.  
Comparison of ORR between the two treatment arms will  be performed using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) χ2 or exact test as appropriate, stratified by the 
randomization stratification factors. For OS, an additional descriptive compar ison of the 
median OS from the randomized selinexor arm will be made to historical OS to the extent 
feasible, to assist in providing the proper context for the ITT analysis of selinexor versus 
placebo.  
DOR and PFS according to the Investigator will be analyzed using the stratified log rank 
test as described above.  
QoL Analysis  
The QoL endpoint as assessed by the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L 
questionnaires will be analyzed as a total score, using a linear mixed effects model with 
fixed effect of tr eatment arm, randomization stratification factors, and the baseline value 
for the parameter in the model as a covariate, as well as random effect of subjects and 
repeated measures over time points. For EORTC QLQ -C30 the transformed score will be 
used, calc ulated according to the EORTC QLQ -C30 Scoring Manual . For the EuroQoL 
EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, the overall health score will be used.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 118 14.3.6.1.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and 
displayed in tables and listings using MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and Preferred 
Term.  
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are considered treatment -emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE with onset or worsening of a pre -existing 
condition on or after the first dose of study treatment through 30 days following the last dose 
of study treatment, or any event considered drug -related by the Investigator  through the end 
of the study.  AEs with partial dates will be assessed using the available date information to 
determine if treatm ent-emergent; AEs with completely missing dates will be assumed to be 
treatment -emergent.  No formal hypothesis -testing of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
AEs will be summarized by patient incidence rates; therefore, in any tabulation, a patient 
contr ibutes only once to the count for a given AE (preferred term).  The number and 
percentage of patients with any TEAE will be summarized for each treatment group, 
classified by SOC and preferred term.  The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs 
assessed by the Investigator  as related to treatment will also be tabulated.  The number and 
percentage of patients with a ny Grade  ≥ 3 TE AE will be tabulated in the same manner.   
The causal relationship between the occurrence of an AE and the study treatment  will be  
judged by the Investigator  as either related  or not related to study treatment . In the event a 
patient experiences repeat episodes of the same AE, then the event with the highest severity 
and/or strongest causal relationship to treatment will be used for purposes of tabulations.   
SAEs will also be tabulated.  
All AEs (treatment -emergent and post -treatment) will be listed in by -patient data listings, 
classified by treatment, patient and day on study.  In addition, separate by -patient listings will 
be provided  for the following: patient deaths; serious AEs; and AEs leading to withdrawal.  
14.3.6.2.  Laboratory Data  
Clinical laboratory values will be expressed using conventional SI units.  
For each treatment arm, the actual value and change from baseline (Day 1, prior to the first 
administration of study treatment ) to each on study evaluation will be summarized for each 
clinical laboratory parameter, including hematology, clinical chemistry,  coagulation and 
urinalysis.  In the event of repeat values, the last non -missing value per study day/time will be 
used.  In the event that Day 1 data are unavailable for a given patient/parameter, the screening 
value will substitute as the baseline value.  
Severity of select clinical lab measures will be determined using CTCAE criteria ( eg, those 
measures that have a corresponding CTCAE grade classification).  Labs with CTCAE grades 
greater than or equal to 3 will be presented in a data listing.  Shift tables t hat present changes 
from baseline to worst on -study and baseline to last on -study values relative to CTCAE 
classification ranges will be produced.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 119 14.3.6.3.  Vital Signs and Physical Examinations  
The actual value and change from baseline (Day 1, prior to the first ad ministration of study 
treatment ) to each on study evaluation will be summarized for vital signs.  
By-patient listings of vital sign measurements will be presented in data listings.  
Abnormal physical examination  resul ts at screening, and abnormal  physical ex amination 
results (AEs) during the study, will be summarized.  All physical examination  findings will be 
presented in by -patient data listings.  
14.3.6.4.  Concomitant Medications  
The use of concomitant medications will be included in by -patient data listings.  
14.3.7.  Procedur es for Handling Missing Data  
No imputation of missing efficacy data is planned for the primary analysis of efficacy 
endpoints.  For patient reported QoL measurements, missing data will be handled as described 
in the EORT C-QLQ -C30 and EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L Scorin g Manuals . Additional sensitivity 
analyses will be done using the Jump to Reference (J2R) and last observation carried forward 
imputation approaches.   
For time to event analyses, patients who have no efficacy evaluations will be considered as 
censored at time 0.  For OS, patients will be censored on the date they were last known to be 
alive regardless of disease status.  
For AEs, missing dates will not be imputed; however, if partial dates are available, they will 
be used to assess if the AE occurred during  the treatment period.  Missing severities of AEs 
will not be imputed and will be considered missing in any tabulations of AE severity.  If an 
AE is missing a response to the question regarding relationship to treatment, the event will be 
considered to be re lated.  
14.4. Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analysis  
All deviations from the original statistical analysis plan will be documented and provided in 
the final clinical study report.  
14.5. Clinical S tudy Reports  
A primary clinical study report (CSR) may be written based on all available patients’ data 
following completion of the primary PFS analysis.  The final CSR will be reported when all 
patients have  completed the follow -up period, wi thdrawn consent, lost to follow -up, or have 
died.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 120 15. DATA CO LLECTION AND MANAGEM ENT  
15.1. Data Confidentiality  
Information about study patients will be kept confidential and managed under the applicable 
laws and regulations. Those regulations require a signed patient authorization informing the 
patient of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research patient to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the Investigator , by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to th e revocation of patient 
authorization. For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect follow -up safety information ( eg has the 
patient experienced any new or worsened AEs) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
The data collection system for this study uses built -in security features to encrypt all data for 
transmission in both directions, preventing unauthorized access to confidential participant 
information. Access to the sy stem will be controlled by a sequence of individually assigned 
user identification codes and passwords, made available only to authorized personnel who 
have completed prerequisite training.  
15.2. Site Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visi t or at an Investigator ’s meeting, Karyopharm 
personnel (or desig nated contract research organization ) will review the protocol and CRFs 
with the Investigator s and their staff. During the study, the monitor will visit the site 
regularly to check the comple teness of patient records, accuracy of entries on the CRFs, 
adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice ( GCP), progress of enrollment, and 
to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  Key study personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these 
visits.  
The Investigator  must maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical 
information, la boratory data, ECG s, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All 
information recorded on CRFs must be traceable to source documents in the patient's file. 
The Investigator  must also keep the origi nal signed ICF  (a sign ed copy is given to the 
patient).  
The Investigator  must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency with the CRF entries. Karyopharm monitoring standards require full 
verification for the presence of informed conse nt, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data 
with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 121 15.3. Data Collection  
This study will utilize Electr onic Data Capture (EDC), the designated clinical site staff will 
enter the data required by the protocol into th e eCRF . The eCRFs have been built using fully 
validated secure web -enabled software that conforms t o 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. 
Clinical site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. 
Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs and allow 
modification or verification of the entered data by the Investigator  staff.  
The In vestigator is responsible for assuring that the data entered into  the eCRF is complete 
and accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner.  
Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using 
the WHO Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
classification system. Medical history/current medi cal conditions and AE s will be coded 
using the MedDRA terminology.  
15.4. Database Management and Quality Control  
Karyopharm personnel ( or des ignated contract research organization ) will review the eCRF 
data entered by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy. Electronic data queries 
stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies  
and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC system. Designated 
Investigator  site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and to make any necessary 
changes to the data.  
At the conclusion of the study, after discrepancies a nd missing values have been completed 
and the data have been verified to be complete and accurate, the database will be declared 
locked.  
For EDC studies, after database lock, the Investigator  will receive a CD -ROM or paper 
copies of the patient data for a rchiving at the investigational site.

16.4. Informed Consent  
Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, w here 
required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent . 
In addition to the signing of informed consent by their parents, adolescent patie nts (permitted 
only in countries in which adolescents have been approved by the national/local 
regulato ry/ethical authority ) should sign written Assent F orms (witnessed, where required by 
law or regulation).  
Informed consent for blinded study treatment must be obtai ned before conducting any 
study -specific procedures ( ie, all of the procedures described in the protocol). Informed 
consent for open -label selinexor must be obtained before any study -specific measures for 
open -label selinexor are co nducted at the Open -label C1 D 1 Visit. The process of obtaining 
informed consent  should be documented in the patient source documents. The date when a 
patient ’s Informed Consent was actually obtained will be captured in their CRFs.  
Karyopharm will provide to Investigator s, in a separate document, proposed ICF s that are  
considered appr opriate for this study and comply  with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory 
requirements. Any changes to the  ICFs suggested by the Investigator  must be agreed to by 
Karyopharm before submission to the IRB/IEC, and a copy of the approved version (s) must 
be provided to the Karyopharm after IRB/IEC approval.  
Females of  child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study treatment  may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that 
in order to participat e in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement s for the 
duration of the study. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they 
should not be entered in the study.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 123 16.5. Patient Confidentiality and Disclosure  
The Investigator  must ensure anonymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by 
names in any documents submitted to Karyopha rm. Signed ICF s and patient enrollment log s 
must be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site.  
16.5.1.  Study Documentation, Record Keeping and Retention of Documents  
Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and  research records for this study , 
in compliance with Section 4.9 of the ICH E6 GCP, and regulatory and institutional 
requirements f or the protection of confidentiality of patient s. As part of participating in a 
Karyopharm -sponsored study, each site will permit authorized representatives of 
Karyopharm and regulatory agencies to examine (and when required by applicable law, to 
copy) cli nical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of 
the study safety and progress.  
Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or othe r 
activities in a clinical study  necessary for  the reconstruc tion and evaluation of the study . 
Examples of these original documents and data records include, but are not limited to, 
hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patients’ diaries or 
evaluation checklists, p harmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and 
complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, and 
patient files and reco rds kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and medico -technical 
department s involved in the clinical study . 
Data collection is the resp onsibility of the clinical study  staff at the site, under the 
supervision of the site Investigator. The stu dy eCRF  is the primary data collection instrument 
for the study. The Investigator  should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported in the eCRFs and all other required reports. Data reported on 
the eCRF that are derived from s ource documents should be consistent with the source 
documents or the discrepancies should be explained. All data requested on the eCRF must be 
recorded. Any missing data must be explained. An audit trail will be maintained by the eCRF 
system.  
The Investig ator/institu tion should maintain the study  documents as specified in Essential 
Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6 Section 8) and as required by 
applicable regulations and/or guidelines. The Investigator /institution should take measures t o 
prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.  
Essential documents (written and electronic) should be retained for a period of not less than 
fifteen (15) years from the completion of the clinical study  unless Karyopharm provides 
written permission to dispose of them or, requires their retention for an additional period of 
time because of applicable laws, regulations and/or guidelines.  
16.6. Publication of Study Protocol and Results

Criteria  
(Adapted from Miller AB, et al., Reporting results of cancer treatment. Cancer. 1981;47:207 
214.)  
Characteristic  Criteria  
Tumor Burden  No maximal number of lesions specified.  
No limitations specified per organ site  
Measurability of 
lesions at 
baseline  1. Measurable, bidimensional  (product of LD and greatest perpendicular 
diameter)a  
2. Nonmeasurable/evaluable  (eg, lymphangitic pulmonary metastases, 
abdominal masses)  
Objective 
response  
 1. Measurable disease  (change in sum of products of LDs and greatest 
perpendicular diameters, no maximum number of lesions specified)  
CR: disappearance of all known disease, confirmed at ≥  4 wk  
PR: ≥  50% decreas e from baseline, confirmed at ≥  4 wk.  
• Bidimensional: single lesion, greater than or equal to 50% 
decrease in tumor area (multiplication of longest diameter by the 
greatest perpendicular diameter); multiple lesions, a 50% 
decrease in the sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters of the  multiple lesions.  
• Unidimensional: greater than or equal to 50% decrease in linear 
tumor measurement.  
• No new lesions or progression of any lesions.  
PD: ≥  25% increase of one or more lesions, or appearance new lesions  
NC (SD): neither PR or PD criteria met  
2. Nonmeasurable disease  
CR: disappearance of all unknown disease, confirmed at ≥  4 wk  
PR: estimated decrease of 50%, confirmed at ≥  4 wk  
PD: ≥  25% in existent lesions of appearance of new lesions  
NC (SD): neither PR or PD criteria met  
3. Bone Metastases  
CR: Complete disappearance of all lesions on x -ray or scan for at least 
four weeks.  
PR: Partial decrease in size of lytic lesions, recalcification of lytic 
lesions, or decreased density of blastic lesions for at least  four 
weeks.  
PD: Increase in size of existent lesions or appearance of new lesions.  
NC (SD): Because of the slow response of bone lesions, the designation 
of no change should not be applied until ≥  8weeks have passed from 
start of therapy.  
Occurrence of bone compression or fracture and its healing should not be 
used as the sole indicator for evaluation of therapy.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 131 Characteristic  Criteria  
Overall response  1. Best response recorded in measurable disease  
2. NC in nonmeasurable lesions will reduce a CR in measurable lesions to 
an overall PR  
3. NC in nonmeasurable lesions will not reduce a PR in measurable lesions   
Duration of 
response  1. CR: From date CR criteria first met to date PD first noted.  
2. Overall Response : From date of treatment start to date PD first noted.  
3. In patients who only ach ieve a PR, only the period of overall response  
should be recorded  
LD = longest diameter; CR = complete  response; PR = partial response; PD = progressive disease; NC = no 
change; SD =  stable disease.  
aLesions that can be measured only unidimensionally are considered measurable ( eg, mediastinal adenopathy, 
malignant hepatomegaly).

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 132 APPENDIX 2  RECIST Version  1.1  
(Modified from Eisenhauer 2009 ) 
All patients will have their BEST RESPONSE on study classified as outlined below:  
Complete Response  (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lym ph nodes (whether target or  
non-target) must have reduction in the short axis to <  10mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters.  
Stable Disease (SD)  
Steady state of disease.  Neither suff icient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD.  
Progressive Disease  (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured lesions taking as references the 
smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment start ed. In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Appearance of one or more new lesions will also constitute PD.  
Response Duration  
Response duration will be measured from the time measure ment criteria for CR/PR 
(whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or PD is 
objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.  
Stable Disease Duration  
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of therapy until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of PD at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deterioration” . Every effort should be made to document  the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 134 Method of Measurement  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  
Clinical Le sions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial ( eg, skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommend ed.  
Chest X -ray 
Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
CT (preferred) or MRI   
CT (preferred) and MRI imaging might be the best currently available and reproducible 
methods to measure target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and 
MRI should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral 
CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous rec onstruction algorithm. This applies to 
the chest, abdomen and pelvis.  Head & neck and extremities usually require specific 
protocols.  
Ultrasound  
When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) 
should not be used to measure tumour lesions that are clinically not easily accessible.  It is a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements for superficial palpable nodes, subcutaneous 
lesions and thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound might also be useful to confirm the complete 
disapp earance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.  
Cytology, Histology  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for example, 
residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, where known  residual benign 
tumours can remain).  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumour has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate be tween response or stable disease 
(an effusion may be an adverse drug reaction of the treatment) and/or  PD.

Version 2.1 Non substantial Amendment 2Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of terms
Baseline Assessments of subjects as they enter a study before they receive any 
treatment. 
Endpoint Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a study.
Enroll To register or enter a subject into a clinical study. Note: Once a subject has 
received the study drug or placebo, the clinical study protocol applies to the 
subject. 
Intervention The drug, device, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study that 
is believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study (e.g., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics). 
Investigational 
periodPeriod of time where major interests of protocol objectives are observed, and 
where the test drug or comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is 
usually given to a subject, and continues until the last assessment after 
completing administration of the test drug or comparative drug.
Post investigational 
periodPeriod of time after the last assessment of the protocol. Follow -up obs ervations 
for sustained adverse events and/or survival are done in this period.
Randomization The process of assigning study subjects to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Screening A process of active consideration of potential subjects for enrollment in a 
study.
Screen failure Potential subject who did not meet 1 or more criteria required for participation 
in a study .
Screening period Period of time before entering the investigation al period, usually from the time 
when a subject signs the consent until just before the test drug or comparative 
drug (sometimes without randomization) is given to a subject. 
Study period Period of time from the first site initiation date to the last site completing the 
study.
Variable Any entity that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event that can have 
different qualitative or quantitative values.

Study Design Overview:  
This is a combined phase 1, first -in-human (FIH), dose -escalation (Stage 1) and phase 2, dose- finding 
(Stage 2), observer -blinded study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of ASP3772 
in adult and elderly subjects. 
The objectives of this study are to evaluate safety, tolerability including reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity in ad ult subj ects 18 to 64 years of age in Stage 1 and in elderly subjects 65 to 
85years of age in Stage 2, who are naïve to licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine.  
The study population will consist of 3 different groups: Group 1 - Stage 1 PCV13 naïve subjects 
randomized within 3 sequential cohorts to ASP3772 or PCV13; Group 2 -Stage 2 PCV13 naïve 
subjects randomized within 3 sequential cohorts to ASP3772 or PCV13; and Group 3 -Stage 2 
subjects previously vaccinated with PCV13 tha t will receive PPSV23.  
To minimize the risk to subjects, a sentinel group of subjects (n =2; 1 ASP3772:1 PCV13) will be 
vaccinated in each cohort prior to initiating enrollment of the full cohort.  Safety data through day 7 
from sentinel subjects will be evaluated by the Dose Escalation Committee (DEC) prior to enrolling 
the remainder of the cohort.  Safety data through day 7 from all subjects within a dose cohort will be 
evaluated by the Dose Escalation Committee (DEC) prior to escalating to the next do se cohort within 
the adult and within elderly subjects. Based on the safety data through 30 days after immunization 
from the first 3 cohorts, the DEC will determine if Stage 2 can commence, and if sentinel dosing is 
required for Stage 2. All subjects withi n each cohort will remain under observation for approximately 
1 hour postimmunization, provided no reactions have occurred that require additional observation in 
the opinion of the investigator.  The DEC membership may include representatives from Astellas
Medical Science, Pharmacovigilance and Statistics personnel, as well as external independent safety 
physician(s).  The external safety physician will be selected based on expertise in vaccine clinical 
studies and other considerations such as the disease a rea. A DEC charter will detail the roles, 
responsibilities and procedures for decision -making.
See the Schedule of Assessments for details on procedures performed at each study visit for each 
group.
Stage 1 Group 1:
Stage 1 of the phase 1/2 design is a ran domized, active -controlled, observer -blinded, dose -escalation 
study of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the ASP3772 pneumococcal vaccine in adult 
subjects (18 to 64 years of age) compared with PCV13 with a 3:1 randomization (ASP3772: PCV13 ).  
After screening, subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 3 cohorts designated by escalating 
ASP3772 dose levels.  A single dose of ASP3772 will be administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular

Version 2.1 Non substantial Amendment 2Study Design Overview (continued) :  
injection into the deltoid muscle of the right or left arm on day 1 at 1 of 3 dose levels: 1, 2 or 5 g of 
ASP3772 for cohorts 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  The subjects randomized to PCV13 will receive a single 
injection of the standard dose of PCV13 on day 1.
After all subjects comple te dosing in Cohort 1 (low dose, 1 g of ASP3772 or PCV13), safety 
(including reactogenicity) and tolerability through 7 days post immunization will be assessed by the 
DEC.  Assessments of safety and tolerability by the DEC will occur prior to initiating th e next dose 
group, Cohort 2 (2μg of ASP3772 or PCV13) and then Cohort 3 (5 μg of ASP3772 or PCV13), based 
on safety and tolerability data through 7 days post immunization .  
Safety and tolerability assessments will continue through 30 days post immunization .  Safety 
assessments for serious adverse events (SAEs) and medically attended adverse events (MAAEs) 
including potential immune- mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs), and new -onset chronic disease 
(NOCDs) will continue through day 180 post immunization .  Data will be collected in an observer -
blinded manner (vaccine recipients and those responsible for evaluation of any study endpoint will be 
unaware of which vaccine the subject received).  
Serum samples to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) will be 
collected prior to the first study immunization on day 1 and on day 30 postimmunization .  
Stage 2 Group 2:
Stage 2 of the study is a dose -finding (sequentially higher doses), active -controlled, observer -blinded 
study with 3:1 rand omization (ASP3772: PCV13 ) in elderly subjects 65 to 85 years of age.
After screening, PCV13 naïve subjects will be randomized within each cohort to receive ASP3772 or 
PCV13.  Subjects randomized to ASP3772 will receive a single dose of ASP3772 administered as a 
0.5 mL intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right or left arm on day 1, at 1 of 3 dose 
levels: 1, 2 or 5 g of ASP3772 for Cohorts 4, 5 and 6, respectively.  The subjects randomized to 
PCV13 will receive a single injection of the st andard dose of PCV13. 
Approximately 396 subjects will be enrolled in Stage 2 of the study; 132 subjects per cohort 
(ASP3772 n = 99 and PCV13 n = 33).
Stage 2 will commence after the DEC has evaluated safety (including reactogenicity) data through 
30days from all cohorts in Stage 1.  Dose escalation to Cohort 5 (intermediate dose, 2 g) in Stage 2 
will commence once the DEC has evaluated Stage 2 Cohort 4 (1 g) safety (including reactogenicity) 
and tolerability through 7 days post immunization.  Dose escala tion into Cohort 6 (high dose, 5 g) in 
Stage 2 will commence once the DEC has evaluated Stage 2 Cohort 5.  Randomization for Stage 2 
subjects will be stratified by age (65 to 74 years of age and 75 to 85years of age) to ensure there is a 
balanced number of subjects immunized with PCV13 and ASP3772 with immunogenicity data across 
the elderly population.
Safety and tolerability assessments including adverse events (AEs) will continue through 30 days 
postimmunization .  Safety assessments for SAEs and MAAEs i ncluding PIMMCs and NOCDs will 
continue through day 180 post immunization .
Data will be collected in an observer -blinded manner (vaccine recipients and those responsible for 
evaluation of any study endpoint will be unaware of which vaccine the subject recei ved).  
Serum samples to measure IgG and OPA will be collected prior to study immunization on day 1 and 
postimmunization on day 30. 
Primary immunogenicity evaluation for dose finding is 30 days following the initial immunization .  
Stage 2 Group 3:
A sepa rate group of elderly subjects previously immunized with PCV13 will be enrolled and receive 
the recommended booster immunization with PPSV23 only (n =99) (Group 3) .

Version 2.1 Non substantial Amendment 2Grade 3 or higher lab abnormality considered related to the immunization occurs in 2 or more 
subjects [FDA Guidance for Industry, 2007].
The same type of reactogenicity event assessed as grade 3 or higher occurs in 2 or more subject s, 
or 1 of the sentinel subject s experiences a reactogenicity event assessed as grade 3 or higher, 
using the FDA toxicity grading scale for preventative vaccines [FDA Guidance for Industry, 
2007].
An imbalance of unsolicited AEs between ASP3772 and PCV13 is observed.
Decision Process for Dose Escalation :
After both sentinel subjects in a cohort have completed study procedures on day 7, the decision to 
open enrollment for the full cohort will be determined by DEC based on review of the Day 7 
reactogenicity and safety data of those 2 sentinel subjects. 
After all vaccinated subjects in a cohort have completed study procedures on day 7, the decision to 
dose escalate to next cohort within both stages will be determined by DEC based on the review of the 
following:
Day 7 reactogenicity and safety data (AEs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs) from the 
current cohort. 
Day 7 reactogenicity and safety data from all subjects of the preceding cohort(s).
To evaluate safety by DEC, day 7 data is needed from a minimum of 38 subjects in each cohort for 
Stage 1.
Stage 2 will commence based on DEC review of the following: 
Day 7 reactogenicity and safety data (AEs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs) from all 
subjects in Stage 1. 
Day 30 safety data (AEs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs) from a ll subjects in Stage 1.
To evaluate safety by DEC, day 7 data is needed from a minimum o f 129 subjects in each cohort for 
Stage 2.   Further details around the dose escalation process are included in the DEC charte r. 
Dose Escalation Criteria:
Depending on the nature, frequency and severity of the safety profile observed in the study, and the 
study vaccine received, the DEC will decide whether to:
Proceed with dose escalation.
Proceed from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
Determine need of sentinel dosing in Stage 2 c ohorts. 
Stop dose escalation.
Dose escalation may proceed unless 1 (or more) of the following apply in subject(s) receiving 
ASP3772:
Two or more subjects experience an AE of severe intensity related to ASP3772 or 2 or more 
subject(s) experience a reactogenicity event of grade 3 or higher intensity related to ASP3772.
One or more subject(s) experience a SAE related to ASP3772.

Statistical Methods: 
Sample Size Justification 
The sample size in Stage 1 is considered sufficient to obtain preliminary estimates in a phase 1 study 
of safety and reactogenicity in the adult population, ages 18 to 64. 
In Stage 2, approximately 495 evaluable adult subjects from 65 to 85 years of age are planned to be 
enrolled. For each PCV13 serotype, the OPA titer-1responses (geometric mean titer [GMT] and 
geometric standard deviation [GSD]) in subjects 60 to 64 years of age administered PCV13 (Sou rce 
Prevnar13®label) were assumed to be representative of the response following immunization with 
ASP3772. The width of 95% confidence intervals for each serotype with 30, 100 and 150 subjects 
were calculated. A sample size of 100 subjects treated with A SP3772 under these assumptions was 
considered sufficient to provide good estimates of OPA titer-1responses.
Analysis of Safety and Tolerability
Stage 1 and Stage 2 (Group 2):
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population; all subjects who receive study 
immunization. Data from PCV13 subjects in each cohort will be pooled for comparison with the 
ASP3772 groups.  For each immunization arm, the frequencies and percentages will be displayed for 
the following TEAEs (coded using the Medical Dictio nary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]) by 
system organ class and preferred term:
Overall
Serious
Related (yes or no) to study vaccine
Descriptive statistics for each laboratory test (e.g., hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis) and vital 
signs will be tabulated by immunization group, dose level for ASP3772 and scheduled time point.  
MAAEs, if any, will be summarized. 
For each local and systemic solicited reaction the percentage of subjects who reported each symptom 
by grade (None, Grade 1, 2, 3 or 4) w ill be summarized (n, %) by immunization group (PCV13 vs 
ASP3772) and dose level (ASP3772: 1, 2, 5 µg) and the percentage of subjects who reported any 
symptom.

response 30 days following administration of either ASP3772 or PCV13. The following measures will be provided for each immunization group (PCV13 vs ASP3772) and dose level (ASP3772: 1, 2, 5 μg). 
∀The GMT, GSD and 95% confidence interval (CI) for functional OPA for each serotype will be 
calculated. 
∀The ratio of the OPA GMT (each ASP3772 dose level/PCV13) and 95% CI will be provided.  
∀The geometric mean concentration (GMC), GSD and 95% CI for serotype-specific IgG for each 
of the serotypes will be calculated.
∀The ratio of the IgG GMC (each ASP3772 dose level/PCV13) and 95% CI will be provided.  
∀The GMFR, GSD and 95% CI will be calculated for each of the serotypes unique to ASP3772.  
∀The proportion of subjects with a #4-fold increase in anticapsular PS IgG and OPA relative to 
baseline will be calculated.
Stage 2; Group 2:
∀The GMT, GSD and 95% CI for functional OPA activity for each serotype will be calculated. 
∀The ratio of the GMT for functional OPA (each ASP3772 dose level/PCV13) for each serotype 
and the 95% CI will be provided.
∀The GMC, GSD and 95% CI for serotype-specific IgG for each of the serotypes will be 
calculated. 
∀The ratio of the GMC (each ASP3772 dose level/PCV13) and 95% CI will be provided for each 
serotype. 
∀The GMFR, GSD and 95% CI will be calculated for each of the serotypes unique to ASP3772.  
∀The proportion of subjects with a #4-fold increase in anticapsular PS IgG and OPA relative to 
baseline will be calculated. 
∀To assess the impact of ASP3772 dose, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with age 
(65 - 74, 75 - 85) as the covariate and immunization (ASP3772 1, 2, 5 μg or PCV13) as the factor 
of interest will be conducted on the natural logarithm (log) of pneumococcal OPA titers. 
∀To assess the impact of ASP3772 dose, an ANCOVA model with age (65 - 74, 75 - 85) as the 
covariate and immunization (ASP3772 1, 2, 5 μg or PCV13) as the factor of interest will be 
conducted on the natural logarithm (log) of the IgG concentrations.
In addition, for both Stage 1 Group 1 and Stage 2 Group 2, SP1500+0785 levels (ng/mL) will be 
collected for those subjects given either ASP3772 or PCV13. Levels of the following cytokines will 
be collected for subjects given ASP3772 or PCV13: Th17, IL-17,  IL-22,  
The units for all are pg/mL. Non-parametric methods will be used for 
these analyses. A Kruskal-Wallis test will be used to test for overall differences between the 3 dose 
levels and PCV13. All treatment groups in Stage 1 will be compared, followed by paired comparisons between each of the ASP3772 dose levels and PCV13 using a Wilcoxon Test. The same set of 
comparisons will be made for subjects in Stage 2, Group 2.
Stage 2; Group 3: 
For the 11 serotypes contained in PPSV23 and not in PCV13, immunological response will be 
evaluated by the following endpoints at 30 days after administration of PPSV23:
∀The GMFR, GSD and 95% CI
∀The proportion of subjects with a #4-fold increase in anticapsular PS IgG and OPA relative to 
baseline
∀The GMT, GSD and 95% CI for the OPA titers 
The GMC, GSD and 95% CI for serotype-specific IgG levels.CCI CCI

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 21 INTRODUCTION
Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae is a significant cause of morbidity  and mortality  among infants, 
young children, the elderly  and individuals who have certain underlying medical conditions.  
S.pneumoniae remains a leading cause of serious illness, including bacteremia, m eningitis and 
pneumonia among children and adults worldwide.  I t is also the most frequent cause of sinusitis 
and acute otitis media [CDC, 2010].  Pneumococcal disease can cause both invasive and 
noninvasive disease.  The most common form of noninvasive di sease, nonbacteremic 
pneumococcal pneumonia, remains one of the most frequent disease manifestation accounting for 
pneumonia hospitalizations.  I nvasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is defined as S.pneumoniae
isolated from a normall y sterile site (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, blood, joint fluid, pleural fluid or 
peritoneal fluid).  The highest incidence of I PD is found at the extremes of age –in elderl y adults 
and in y oung children < 2 y ears of age.  S.pneumon iaecauses approximately  17000 cases of 
invasive disease each year among children younger than 5 years of age, including 700 cases of 
meningitis and 200 deaths [CDC, 2000].  The highest morbidity  and mortality  rates have been 
reported in developing countri es, but the disease burden is also considerable in industrialized 
countries.
Two different vaccines for S. pneumoniae are currently  available in the US.  PCV13, a 13 -valent 
conjugate vaccine, has been approved for the prevention of I PD caused by  the 13 serotypes 
contained in the vaccine in children and for the prevention of pneumonia and I PD in adults. In 
this vaccine, conjugation of pneumococcal saccharides to the CRM197 protein creates a 
saccharide -protein complex, which is capable of inducing a T -depende nt immune response; thus, 
T helper cells are stimulated, leading to a substantial primary  response and a strong booster 
response at re -exposure [PREVNAR 13 prescribing information, 2017].  However, there are 
> 90 serot ypes of S. pneumoniae , and PCV13 prov ides protection only  against those 13 seroty pes 
contained in the vaccine.  While infections with S. pneumoniae of multidrug -resistant serot ypes, 
which are contained in PCV13 decreased after availability  of this vaccine, an increase of 
infections with multi drug-resistant serot ypes 35B, 23A, 23B and 15B, which are not included in 
PCV13, was noted.  Also, PCV13 appeared to have marginal activity  against seroty pe 3, as its 
prevalence persists in the population [Richter et al, 2014].
The second vaccine, Pneumova x®23 (PPSV23), is a 23- valent pol ysaccharide (PS) vaccine and is 
indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults ≥ 50 y ears of age or in persons 
≥ 2years of age at increased risk of pneumococcal disease.  It is composed of purified capsular
PS from 23 pneumococcal serot ypes.  While this vaccine protects against more serot ypes when 
compared to PCV13, it does not provide protection against the emerging seroty pes 35B, 23A and 
23B.  In addition, PPSV23 elicits a T- independent PS immune response that stimulates mature B-
lymphocy tes, but not T -lymphocy tes, and induces an immune response that is neither long -lasting 
nor anamnestic upon subsequent challenge.  In addition, PS -type vaccines are not used in infants 
and children < 2 years of age, because these children respond poorl y to T -independent antigens 
[Pneumovax 23 prescribing information, 2017; CDC, 2010].  Data suggest that PPSV23 protects 
adults and the elderl y against I PD; however, no consistent effect has been observed in the 
prevention of pn eumonia [Gruber et al, 2008].

Version 2.1 Nonsubstantial Amendment 2Thus, there is a medical need for a vaccine that provides T-cell dependent immunity against a 
broad range of serotypes of S. pneumoniae .  
Background
ASP3772 is an investigational vaccine that contains 24 serotypes of S. pneumoniae and a unique 
carrier protein (CP1) created by the fusion of 2 pneumococcal proteins (SP1500 and SP0785), which has the potential to induce a T- and B-cell response providing extended protection (refer to details in the [ASP3772 Investigator’s Brochure]). This novel pneumococcal vaccine is based on multivalent multiple antigen-presenting system (MAPS) platform containing each of the 13 pneumococcal capsular PS contained in PCV13 (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) and 11 additional pneumococcal capsular PS (serotypes 2, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 17F, 20B, 22F and 33F), individually biotinylated and complexed with a CP1 carrier protein.  In nonclinical studies, MAPS vaccines have also been shown to induce antigen-specific Th1/Th17 responses, which efficiently protect against pneumococcal disease [Zhang et al, 2013].
The MAPS platform takes advantage of the high affinity (dissociation constant 
[KD]≈10
-15M) noncovalent binding between biotin and rhizavidin, a biotin-binding protein, 
which has no significant predicted homology with human proteins.  Rhizavidin, a naturally occurring dimeric protein in the avidin protein family, was first discovered in Rhizobium etli , 
a symbiotic bacterium of the common bean.  Rhizavidin has only a 22% amino acid identity with chicken avidin, a protein commonly found in eggs, but with high conservation of amino acid residues involved in biotin binding.  No cross-reactivity to rhizavidin was observed in human serum samples obtained from subjects exposed to avidin [Helppolainen et al, 2007], suggesting that rhizavidin antibodies may not cross-react with chicken avidin.  Biotin conjugates have been used in several clinical applications without any reported adverse events (AEs) [Buller et al, 2014; Paty et al, 2010; Lazzeri et al, 2004].  The biotinylation of the PS and MAPS complexing process in ASP3772 has been optimized to consistently show no free biotin, thus reducing the potential for generating anti-biotin antibodies.
The total amount of aluminum per dose in ASP3772 vaccine formulation is expected to be 
0.625 mg, which is below the FDA/WHO maximum recommended dose of 0.85 mg to 1.25 mg.

Nonclinical and Clinical Data
The nonclinical pharmacology data demonstrated that ASP3772 is highly  immunogenic in 
New Zealand White rabbits.  The literature reported for conjugated pneumococcal vaccines 
suggests that an immunogenic response el icited in nonclinical programs is translatable to an 
immunogenic response in humans.  The successful translation between the rabbit 
immunogenicity studies and human efficacy observed for conjugated pneumococcal vaccines
supports the position that ASP3772 h
as the potential to be clinically effective. There were no 
treatment -related effects on survival, clinical signs, skin reaction, bod y weight/food 
consumption, ophthalmology , hematology  parameters, serum biotin, anti-biotin antibodies or 
organ weights.  With the exception of the injection sites, there were no treatment -related 
macroscopic post- mortem or histopathological findings in the tissues/organs examined.  
Analy sis of post -dose sera confirmed that animals treated with ASP3772 had robust serum 
immuno globulin G (IgG) antibody responses to all pneumococcal polysaccharides included 
in the ASP3772.
In the pharmacology  studies, intramuscular administration of ASP3772 in rabbits resulted in 
a higher immune response (antibod y production) in the ASP3772 group in comparison to the 
PCV13 group not only  for a majorit y of the PCV13 serotypes, but also for non -PCV13 
seroty pes contained in ASP3772.  Antibody  responses to the pneumococcal proteins were 
also robust in the ASP3772 group compared to the levels seen in t he PCV13 group in rabbits.
Intranasal administration with either purified pneumococcal proteins (components of carrier 
protein) in mice induced a strong antigen -specific Th17 response and a significant reduction in 
pneumococci colony -forming units recove red from the nasophary ngeal wash following 
challenge with t ype 6B pneumococci (603 strain).  Similar responses were observed in 
subcutaneous i mmunization of 12 -valent and 6 -valent MAPS with CP1 carrier protein in mice. 
These data suggest that ASP3772 has the potential to be clinically effective at protecting against 
pneumococcal infection following immunization.  
Please refer to the current I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) for the most recent data.
Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
No clinical studies of ASP3772 have been conducted to date.
In the 5 -cycle intramuscular dose toxicity  study  in rabbits (3772 -TX-0001), a total of 
5intramuscular injections of ASP3772 at dose level of 5 µg of each PS per animal given once 
every  2 weeks to male and female New Zealand White rabbits over a period of 57 days was 
well-tolerated.  There were no treatment -related effects on survival, clinical signs, skin reaction, 
body  weight/food consumption, ophthalmology , hematology  parameters, serum biotin, anti -
biotin antibodies or organ weights.  With the exception of the injection sites, there were no 
treatment -related macroscopic post -mortem or histopathological findings in the tissues/organs 
examined.  Analy sis of postdose sera confirmed that animals treated with AS P3772 had robust 
serum IgG antibod y responses to all pneumococcal PS included in the ASP3772.

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2In animals treated with ASP3772, slightly  elevated body  temperature, changes in clinical 
pathology  and histopathological findings at the injection sites were obse rved.  The elevated 
body  temperature and changes in clinical pathology  such as reductions in prothrombin time 
and/or activated partial thromboplastin time, as well as increased fibrinogen concentrations, 
and decreased albumin and albumin/globulin ratio, an d increased globulin, creatine kinase 
and C -reactive protein levels were considered to be consistent with the immune and/or 
inflammatory  reactions induced by  ASP3772 administration, which are expected responses in 
intramuscular immunization.  
Microscopic findings at the intramuscular injection sites included ASP3772- related findings 
consisting of minimal to moderate m yofiber degeneration/necrosis, minimal to mild histiocy
tic 
inflammation (muscle) and minimal histiocy tic inflammation (subcutis), as well as ASP3772 -
related exacerbation of local injection site findings that included minimal to moderate mixed 
cell inflammation (subcutis), minimal to marked mixed cell inflammation (muscle), minimal to 
mild mixed cell inflammation (dermis), minimal to moderate hemorrhage (subcutis), minimal to 
mild hemorrhage (muscle) and minimal serocellular crusts (epidermis).  These changes 
recovered or tended to recover after a 4- week recovery  period suggesting that the ASP3772 -
related findings were reversible.  
In clinical studies, measurement of bod y temperature, monitoring of subjective symptoms 
such as pain and soreness, observation of injection sites, evaluation of clinical pathology 
parameters including coagulation, clinical chemistry and C -reactive protein w ill be monitored 
[Table 4].

Risk  Benefit Assessment
Subjects participating in this clinical study  may  not benefit from administration of ASP3772. 
In contrast, subjects might exp erience AEs related to study  vaccines (e.g., allergic reactions) 
or procedural complications (e.g., blood draws or slight skin irritation from the adhesive on 
the electrocardiogram [ECG] electrodes).  
A summary  of the nonclinical safet y findings and risk minimization and characterization 
actions are given in Table 4. Overall, the toxicological target organs and AEs that were 
identified in the nonclinical toxicology  studies will be carefully  monitored so that subjects 
will not be exposed to undue risks. However, since this is the first study  of this vaccine in 
humans, the risk profile in humans is unknown.

To minimize the risk to subjects, a sentinel group of subjects (n =2; 1 ASP3772:1 PCV13) will 
be vaccinated in each cohort prior to initiating enrollment of the full cohort.  Safety data 
through day  7 from sentinel subjects will be evaluated by  the Dose E scalation Committee 
(DEC) prior to enrolling the remainder of the cohort.  Safet y data through day 7 from all 
subjects within a dose cohort will be evaluated b y the DEC prior to escalating to the next dose 
cohort within the adult and within elderly  subject s. Based on the safety  data through 30 days 
after immunization from the first 3 cohorts, the DEC will determine if Stage 2 can commence, 
and if sentinel dosing is required for Stage 2.  All subjects within each cohort will remain under 
observation for appr oximately  1 hour post immunization, provided no reactions have occurred 
that require additional observation in the opinion of the investigator.  The DEC membership 
will include Astellas Medical Science, Pharmacovigilance and Statistics personnel, as well a s 
external independent safety  physician(s).  The external safet y physician will be selected based 
on expertise in vaccine clinical studies and other considerations such as the disease area. A DEC 
charter will detail the roles, responsibilities and procedur es for decision -making.
See the Schedule of Assessments [ Table 1, Table 2and Table 3] for details on procedures 
performed at each stud y visit for Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3, respectively .

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 23:1randomization (ASP3772:PCV13).  After screening, subjects will be enrolled sequenti ally 
into 3 cohorts designated by  escalating ASP3772 dose levels.  A single dose of ASP3772 will 
be administered as a 0.5 mL  intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the right or left 
arm on day  1 at 1 of 3 dose levels: 1, 2 or 5 g of ASP3772 for cohorts 1, 2 and 3 respectivel y.  
The subjects randomized to PCV13 will receive a single injection of the standard dose of 
PCV13 on day  1.
Approximately  120 subjects will be enrolled in Stage 1 of the study ; 40subjects per cohort 
(ASP3772 n =30 and PCV 13 n = 10).
After all subjects complete dosing in Cohort 1 (low dose, 1 g of ASP3772 or PCV13), safet y 
(including reactogenicity) and tolerabilit y through 7 days post immunization will be assessed b y 
the DEC.  Assessments of safet y and tolerability by the DEC will occur prior to initiating the 
next dose group, Cohort 2 (2μg of ASP3772 or PCV13) and then Coh ort 3 (5 μg of ASP3772 
or PCV13), based on safety  and tolerability  data through 7 day s post immunization .  
Safety  and tolerability  assessments will cont inue through 30 day s post immunizatio n.  Safety  
assessments for serious adverse events (SAEs) and medically  attended adverse events (MAAEs) 
including potential immune
-mediated medical conditions (PI MMCs) and NOCDs will continue 
through day  180 post immunization .  Data will be collected in an observer -blinded manner 
(vaccine recipients and any  site staff who is responsible for evaluation of any  study  endpoint 
will be unaware of which vaccine the subject received).  
Serum samples to measure IgG and opsonophago cytic activity  (OPA) will be collected prior 
to the first study  immunization on day  1 and on day  30postimmunization .  
Stage 2 Group 2: 
Stage 2 of the study  is a dose -finding (sequentially  higher doses), active -controlled, 
observer -blinded study  with 3:1 randomization (ASP3772: PCV13 ) in elderly subjects 65 
to85 years of age.
After screening, PCV13 naïve subjects will be randomized within each cohort to receive 
ASP3772 or PCV13.  Subjects randomized to ASP3772 will receive a single dose of 
ASP3772 adminis tered as a 0.5 mL  intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the 
right or left arm on day  1, at 1 of 3 dose levels: 1, 2 or 5 g of ASP3772 for Cohorts 4, 5 and 
6, respectivel y.  The subjects randomized to PCV13 will receive a single injection of t he 
standard dose of PCV13.  
Approximately  396 subjects will be enrolled in Stage 2 of the study; 132 subjects per cohort 
(ASP3772 n =99 and PCV13 n = 33).
Stage 2 will commence after the DEC has evaluated safet y (including reactogenicity) data 
through 30 days from all cohorts in Stage 1.  Dose escalation to Cohort 5 (intermediate dose, 
2g) in Stage 2 will commence once the DEC has evaluated Stage 2 Cohort 4 (1 g) safet y 
(including reactogenicity) and tolerabilit y through 7 days post immunization.  Dose escalation 
into Cohort 6 (high dose, 5 g) in Stage 2 will commence once the DEC has evaluated

2.2.2 Dose Rationale
The proposed initial doses of 1, 2 and 5 g for this FIH clinical study  were chosen based on 
the PS levels contained in marketed PS conjugate vaccines and the ASP3772 nonclinical 
pharmacology  and toxicology  studies.
The 3 currently  licensed pneumococcal conjugated vaccines vary  in the number of serot ypes 
they contain, the carrier proteins used and the methods of conjugatio n employ ed.  The 
7-valent formulation (Pfizer’s Prevnar 7/Prevnar 7) with all seroty pes conjugated to 
diphtheria toxoid mutant (CRM197), using a reductive animation conjugation method, was 
first licensed in the year 2000.  The 10 -valent formulation (GlaxoS mithKline Biologicals’ 
Synflorix), with 8 serotypes conjugated to Protein D, a recombinant non -lipidated form of a 
highl y conserved 40 kDa cell -
surface lipoprotein of non- typeable Haemophilus influenzae, 
seroty pe 18C conjugated to tetanus toxoid and seroty pe 19F conjugated to diphtheria toxoid 
via bifunctional spacer, was licensed in Europe in 2009.  The 13-valent formulation (Pfizer’s 
PCV13/PCV13), with all seroty pes conjugated to CRM197 using reductive animation, was 
licensed in 2010.  In addition, Merck initiated the development of a 15 -valent formulation 
(V114), using the PS dose ranges used previousl y by the commerciall y available 
pneumococcal conjugated vaccines.  
In all of these cases, the P S doses ranged from 1 µg to 
4.4µg for each of the seroty pes.  A nonclinical immunogenicit y stud y with ASP3772 and 
PCV13 at one -tenth of the human PCV13 dose for each PS showed that ASP3772

02 Dec 2019 Astellas Page 44of 111
Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2seroty pe-specific responses to ASP3772 were comparable to those elicited by  PCV13 for the 
13 seroty pes in common between the va ccines. For the 11 noncommon seroty pes, there was a 
robust response elicited in rabbit for ASP3772 and no response for PCV13. I n the toxicology  
study  in New Zealand White rabbits, ASP3772 was adminis tered at 5 μg of each of the 24 PS 
every  2 weeks, for a t otal of 5 intramuscular injections (5 cy cles). The findings were mild in 
nature, and monitorable and reversible.
The above information, coupled with the literature showing successful translation between 
the rabbit immunogenicity studies and human efficacy for pneumococcal vaccines, support 
the position that ASP3772 has the potential to be clinically  effective at the proposed doses 
(1μg, 2 μg and 5 μg).

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Study  vaccine inventory  and accountability  record s will be kept by  thestudy  pharmacist. 
Study  vaccine accountability  throughout the stud y must be documented and reconciled. The 
following guidelines are therefore pertinent:
●The investigator, study  pharmacist agrees not to supply  study  vaccines to any  persons 
except the eligible subjects in this study  in accordance with the protocol.
●The study  pharmacist or designee will keep the study  vaccines in a pharmacy  or other 
locked and secure storage facilit y under controlled storage conditions, accessible only to
those authorized by  the investigator to dispense these study  vaccines.
●A study  vaccine inventory  will be maintained by  the study  pharmacist or designee. The 
inventory  will include details of material received and a clear record of when they  were 
dispensed and to which subject.
●At the conclusion or termination of this study , study  pharmacist or designee agrees to 
conduct a final vaccine supply  inventory  and to record the results of this inventory  on the 
Vaccine Accountability  Record or equivalent form in I nteractive Response Technology  
(IRT) sy stem. It must be possible to reconcile delivery  records with those of used and/or 
returned stud y vaccine. Any discrepancies must be accounted for and documented. 
Appropriate forms of deliveries and returns must be sign ed by  the site staff delegated this 
responsibility .
●The site staff must return study vaccine to the sponsor or designee at the end of the study  
or upon expiration unless otherwise approved b y the sponsor.
Blinding
4.4.1 Blinding Method
This is an observer -blind study  since the comparator has a unique s yringe that the sponsor 
cannot duplicate.  Subjects will be randomized at a 3:1 ratio (ASP3772:comparator vaccine 
PCV13) in a blinded fashion such that the investigator, clinical staff, nor the subject will 
know whi ch agent is being administered.  Onl y the pharmacist and designated staff, including 
the person(s) injecting the vaccine will be unblinded to study vaccine.  The syringes will be 
masked prior to dosing to maintain the blind for subjects and all other perso nnel.  The details 
regarding stud y blinding will be described in the pharmacy manual.  The randomization 
number will be assigned based on information obtained from the IRT.  The study  will be 
unblinded to the investigator after the database lock.
The safe ty and tolerability  data for dose escalation by  the DEC will be reviewed under 
blinded conditions.  I f there are AEs that meet the criteria that could prohibit dose escalation, 
(i.e., a SAE, an AE of severe intensit y, or 2 or more subjects experience a rea ctogenicity  
event of grade 3 or higher intensity ), the stud y vaccine assignment for these subjects will be 
revealed to determine if these events are related to ASP3772.  I f 10% or more of the subjects 
within a cohort experience the same or related AE, the study  vaccine assignment for those 
subjects will be revealed to determine if there is an imbalance in unsolicited AEs between 
ASP3772 and PCV13.  The DEC can request the study  vaccine assignment for 1 or more 
subjects.

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 24.4.2 Confirmation of the Indistinguisha bility of the Study Vaccines
Not applicable, as the comparator vaccines (PCV13 and PPSV23) are available in the form of 
pre-filled s yringes and it is not possible to make the study vaccines indistinguishable.  The 
investigational product and comparator will be sent to the site in an unblinded fashion for the 
unblinded staff at the site to handle.
4.4.3
Retention of the Assignment Schedule and Procedures for Study Vaccine 
Assignment Code Breaking 
The randomization list and study  medication blind will be maintained by  the I RT s ystem.  
The study  pharmacist (or investigator’s designee) will be unblinded to prepare vaccine for 
administration according to randomization code.
4.4.4 Breaking the Study Vaccine Assignment Code for Emergency 
The study  vaccine assignment code for each randomized subject will be provided by  the IRT 
in the event of a medical emergency  requiring knowledge of the stud y vaccine assigned to the 
subject.  The IRT will be programmed with blind- breaking instructions that may  only be 
requested b y the investigator or subinvestigators designated to have access to perform 
blind -break.  In case of a medical emergency , the investigator has the sole responsibility  for 
determining if unblinding of subject’s vaccine assignment is warranted.  Subject safet y must 
alway s be the first consideration in making such determination.  If the investigator decides 
that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every  effort to contact the sponsor 
prior to unblinding a subject’s vaccine assignment unless this could delay  emergency  
treatment for the subject. 
The investigator must have confirmed functionality to access code -break through the IRT 
system and must have a designated back up (e.g., redundant processes) to support emergency  
unblinding requirements. 
Prior to randomization, subjects should be provided with information that includes the site 
emergency  contact number and back -up contact number in case of a medical emergency .  
Any unblinding by  the investigational staff must be reported immediately  to the sponsor and 
include an explanation of why  the study  vaccine was unblinded.  If unblinding is associated 
with a SAE the investigator is to follow the instructions in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of SAE]. 
Care should be taken to limit knowledge of the randomization arm, in case this could affect 
the blinding of other subjects or future trial assessment for the subject. 
4.4.5 Breaking the Study Vaccine Assignme ntCode by the Sponsor 
The sponsor and DEC may  break the study  vaccine assignment code for subjects who 
experience a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), in order to 
determine if the individual case or a group of cases requires expedited regulatory  reporting. 
Individual Emergency  Codes will be provided to the limited staff who are responsible to 
break the codes for all SUSAR cases for reporting purposes.

Assignment and Allocation
At the Screening Visit, after the informed consent form (ICF) has been signed, site staff will 
access the IRT s ystem, enter the subject’s required information, and the subject will receive a 
subject number assignment through the IRT for use throughout the study. 
Each cohort will be initiated with randomization of 1 sentinel subject each assigned to either 
ASP3772 or PCV13. Sentinel subjects need to be replaced if discontinued or unable to follow 
up for at least 7 day s. The safet y data from sentinel subjects will be reviewed by the DEC to 
make a decision to proceed with enrollment of the rest of the cohort. Subjects in the full 
cohort who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio 
(ASP3772:PCV13) according to the randomization schedules through IRT.  I n Stage 2, the 
randomization to stud y vaccine assignment will be stratified b y age.  Prior to study  
immunization, the site staff will access the IRT s ystem in order to determine the randoml y 
assigned stud y vaccine.  The site personnel will dispense the stud y vaccine according to the 
IRT s ystem’s assignment.  Specific procedures for randomization through the I RT are 
contained in the study  procedures manual.
Subjects who subsequently  meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly  assigned to 
receive either ASP3772 or PCV13. The randomiz ation to study  vaccine will be stratified by  age.
The I RT vendor will generate the randomization schedule. To obtain the randomized study  
vaccine assignment for a subject, the pharmacist or designee will utilize an IRT s ystem, 
which is available 7 day s a w eek, 24 hours a day . After submitting required information 
about the eligible subject, the vaccine kit number assignment will be provided.
Study  vaccine assignment will remain blinded to all site staff except the pharmacist, 
designated staff and the unblinded administrator .  
If a subject is randomized but does not receive study vaccine, the kit number will not be used 
again. In this instance, the study vaccine assignment should only  be known by  the pharmacist 
and designated staff (i.e., the blind mus t be maintained as it is with all other subjects).

also serve as the final study  visit . 
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Vaccine(s)
Decision P rocess for Dose Escalation:
After both sentinel subjects in a cohort have completed study  procedures on day  7, the 
decision to open enrollment for the full cohort will be determined b y DEC based on review of 
the Day  7 reactogenicity  and safet y data of thos e 2 sentinel subjects. 
After all vaccinated subjects in a cohort have completed study  procedures on day 7, the 
decision to dose escalate to next cohort within both stages will be determined by  DEC based 
on the review of the following:
●Day 7 reactogenicit yand safet y data (AEs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests and vital signs) 
from the current cohort. 
●Day 7 reactogenicit y and safet y data from all subjects of the preceding cohort(s).
To evaluate safet y by DEC, day 7 data is needed from a minimum of 38 subject s in each 
cohort for Stage 1.   
Stage 2 will commence based on DEC review of the following: 
●Day 7 reactogenicit y and safet y data (AEs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests and vital signs) 
from all subjects in Stage 1. 
●Day 30 safety  data (AEs, ECG, clinical l aboratory tests and vital signs) from all subjects 
in Stage 1.
To evaluate safet y by DEC, day 7 data is needed from a minimum of 129 subjects in each 
cohort for Stage 2.  Further details around the dose escalation process are located in the DEC 
charter.

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Dose Escalation Criteria:
Depending on the nature, frequency  and severit y of the safet y profile observed in the study, 
and the study  vaccine received, the DEC will decide whether to:
● Proceed with dose escalation. 
●Proceed from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
●Determine need of sentinel dosing in Stage 2 cohorts.
●Stop dose escalation.
Dose escalation may  proceed unless 1 (or more) of the following appl y in subject(s) receiving 
ASP3772:
●Two or more subjects experience an AE of severe intensity  related to ASP3772 or 2 or 
more subject(s) experience a reactogenicit y event of grade 3 or higher intensity.
●One or more subject(s) experience a SAE related to ASP3772. 
Stopping criteria for study  immunization are described in detail in [Section 5.1.5 Criteria for 
Continuation of I mmunizat ion].
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and NonMedication 
Therapy)
Subjects will not be allowed to take immunization s, blood product, immunosuppressants 
including s ystemic steroids (topical steroids will be allowed) from first study vaccine 
administration until 30 days post immunization . Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) are allowed during the study , but not within 24 hours 
prior to immunization and collection of serum samples for immunogenicity.  Subjects who 
are taking concomitant medications (3 months prior to study  enrollment) to treat pre -existing 
conditions (e.g., h ypertension) must remain on stable doses of these medications throughout 
the study .  The doses of all concomitant medications should remain stable throughout the 
study , but may  be changed for medical reasons as determined b y the clinical investigator.
If during the stud y, a subject’s health condition necessitates the use of an y medication from 
those listed above, the investigator and medical monitor or designee(s), will discuss the case 
and determine if the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  The excluded concomitant 
medicatio n will be recorded as a protocol deviation.  All concomitant medication including 
prescription and nonprescription, vitamins and natural and herbal remedies (e.g., St.John’s 
Wort) will be documented.
Use of systemicall y absorbed antibiotics during the 30 -day period prior to collection of the 
immunogenicit y samples should be restricted unless clinically warranted (e.g., avoid 
prophy laxis) to avoid interference with the immunoassay . If a subject has been treated with 
any systemically  absorbed antibiotics bet
ween day 1 and day  30, the day 30 follow -up visit 
should take place at least 7 day s after the last dose of the antibiotics.
Subjects may  receive other routine immunization at the 30- day follow -up visit after the 
completion of all study  procedures at each site’s discretion; however, routine vaccines should 
not be given in less than 30 days after study  immunization .

visit 2. Study  immunization will take place in the clinical unit . The exact day  and time of 
study  vaccine administration will be documented.
Observation Period: Subjects will remain under observation for 1 hour post immunization , 
(provided no reactions have occurred). If a subject experiences significant clinical sy mpto ms, 
in the opinion of the investigator, then additional direct supervision may  be required as 
needed for management of the sy mptoms. 
5.1.5 Criteria for Continuation of Immunization 
Formal Stopping Rules for Individual Subjects:
Individual subjects will be disc ontinued from the study  if:
●Subject is lost -to-follow -up despite reasonable efforts by  the investigator to locate the 
subject.
●Subject voluntarily  withdraws from the study  at any  time for any  reason. 
Formal Stopping Rules for Cohorts:
No additional subjects will be randomized or dosed in the study  until the events below 
occurring in a subject who received ASP3772 are reviewed b y the DEC and it is acceptable 
to resume cohort immunization . 
●Unexplained death of a subject.
● Serious a cute h ypersensitivity  reaction in a subject.
●One of the sentinel subjects experiences an AE of severe intensit y related to ASP3772 , 
when sentinel subjects are required.

Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1 Demographics
Demographic information will be collected for all subjects (where permitted) at the screening 
visit and will include age, date of birth, sex, race and ethnicity.
5.2.2 Medical History
Medical history will be collected at the screening visit in order to assess Inclusion/Exclusion 
criteria and will be reconfirmed prior to study immunization (if screening was performed > 7 days from study immunization [day 1]). 
Immunogenicity Assessments
The immunogenicity assessments described below are accepted surrogates for efficacy in pneumococcal vaccine studies.
5.3.1 Immunological Response
Considering its mechanism of action, ASP3772 is expected to induce the immune response to 
pneumococcal PS and carrier proteins, the antigens present in ASP3772.  Blood samples to assess immunogenicity will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments [Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3]. Immunogenicity assessments will be performed from blood samples collected at the dosing visit (day 1) prior to study immunization and at the 7-day and30-day follow-up visits.  Immunogenicity data will be provided to the investigative site when available.
Immunogenicity of ASP3772 will be evaluated by measuring serotype-specific anticapsular 
IgG antibody concentrations by multiplex direct Luminex immunoassays and OPA titers against the 24 vaccine serotypes in serum samples. OPA measures the functional killing activity of antibodies against the pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, pneumococcal carrier protein (SP1500+0785)-specific immune response will be assessed by measuring specific IgG in serum and activity against non-vaccine serotypes.  T helper 17 cells (Th17) response to SP1500+0785 will be evaluated by measuring interleukin (IL)-17,  IL-22, 
induction in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as exploratory assessments. 
Details on sampling, processing and storage will be described in the laboratory manual.  
Samples will be shipped on dry ice to a designated contract research organization (CRO) for the analyses.
Safety Assessment
5.4.1 Adverse Events
All observed or spontaneously reported AEs will be documented. TEAEs and MAAEs 
(including PIMMCs and NOCDs) will be assessed throughout the study, from the time of dosing (day 1) up to the last follow-up visit (day 30 for Group 3; day 180 for Groups 1 and CCI CCI

NOCDs) and SAEs are provided in [Section 5.5Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects].
5.4.2 Vital Signs
Vital signs (bod y temperature, blood pressu re and pulse rate) will be measured at screening, 
the dosing visit (day  1) and at each subsequent visit (day  7 and day  30 [all groups]). On day  1, 
vital signs (bod y temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate and respiration rate) will be collected 
pre-dose an d 30 min and 1 hour post -dose. Vital signs will be collected after the subject has 
been in seated position for at least 5 minutes. When vital signs are scheduled for the same 
time as blood sample or study  vaccine administration, then vital signs will be ta ken first. 
Blood pressure should be obtained using the same cuff size and the same arm. Abnormal 
findings will be documented as clinical events through day 7 and AEs post day 7. 
Subjects will be instructed to measure and record in the electronic diary  their body  
temperature daily  through day  7.  Subjects will also be instructed to measure and record their 
body  temperature in case of illness and contact the site if elevated.  
5.4.3 Reactogenicity
Subjects will remain at the study  site 60 minutes after the inject ion for safety  evaluation. 
Subjects may  be discharged after 60 minutes at the discretion of the investigator.  Local and 
systemic reactogenicity  will also be reported for each of 7 consecutive day s following the 
study  injection. 
Reactogenicit y will be ass essed using solicited adverse reactions from the time of 
immunization (day 1) up to 7 day s post immunization.  These include local and sy stemic 
reactions with a protocol -specified predefined grading scale (see [Appendix 12.6 Grading of 
Local Reactogenicity ; Appendix 12.7 Grading of Signs of Sys temic Reactogenicity ; and 
Appendix 12.8 Grading of Laboratory  Abnormalities]).  L ocal reactions are pain, tenderness, 
redness/ery thema and swelling /induration.  Sy stemic reactions are nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, 
headache, fever, fatigue , joint pain or arthralgia and muscle discomfort or pain/my algia.  The 
daily  maximum measurement of local and s ystemic reactogenicit y signs will be recorded b y 
the subj ect during the 7 -day period using an electronic subject electronic diary .  For Stage 1, 
subjects will be questioned at the day  7 visit if they  experienced any  joint pain/arthralgia 
through their day  7 visit postimmunization.  I f their response is yes, they will be asked to 
provide the degree of severity  using a 4 -category  grading scale from 1 (no interference with 
activity ) to 4 (ER visit or hospitalization) as per Appendix 12.7.  For Stage 2, assessments of 
joint pain/arthralgia will be collected daily  through day  7 using the electronic diary . All 
subjects will be questioned if they
 experienced any  other illness through day  7 
postimmunization on their day  7 visit. Reactogenicity  reactions will be reported as Clinical 
Events.  If the reactogenicity  reaction extends beyond 7 -day period or if serious, it will be 
recorded as an AE, and followed until resolution or deemed medicall y stable.  Subjects will 
be instructed to contact the site during the 7 consecutive day s following an injection to report 
any reaction ≥ grade 2.  All local and sy stemic reactions ≥ grade 3 require confirmation b y a 
health care professional.

immunization and at day  30 follow -up visit for Group 1 and Group 2 subjects. Serum anti- biotin 
antibodies will be rep eated on day  180 if tested positive on day  30.  In subjects with positive 
serum anti -biotin antibodies, serum biotin levels will be measured in the same sample. 
5.4.6 Physical Examination
A phy sical examination consisting of an examination of general appearance , eyes, nose 
throat, neck (including thy roid), l ymph nodes, chest, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, 
extremities, musculoskeletal and neurological s ystem including mental status will be 
conducted at the screening visit, prior to study  immunization (day 1) and at the day  30 
follow -up visit. A sy mptom -directed ph ysical exam may  be performed at any  other time, if 
necessary .  The screening ph ysical examination also includes evaluation of significant, 
ongoing medical conditions. Any  changes between screening and randomization will be 
captured in the medical/surgical history.
Any abnormal finding(s) at screening must not be exclusionary  per the eligibility  criteria and 
must be assessed and documented as not clinicall y significant if a subject is to be enrolled in 
the study . After receiving the study  vaccine, new abnormal findings or a worsening of an 
ongoing abnormal condition will be recorded as an SAE or AE ([S]AE).
5.4.7 Electrocardiogram 
Standard 12
-lead ECG recordings will be used for the purposes of safet y assessment and 
subject management b y the Investigator.
A 12 -lead, resting ECG is to be recorded at each timepoint as indicated in Table 1, Table 2
and Table 3(Schedule of Assessments). Subjects s hould remain supine for at least 5 minutes 
prior to all ECGs. Dates and times may  be generated by  the machine’s internal clock and are 
considered source data. The results are to be interpreted b y qualified personnel in real time 
for the management of the s ubjects’ clinical condition. The principal investigator/designee 
will initial and date, and provide his/her clinical interpretation on each report. The results 
(normal, abnormal not clinically  significant, abnormal clinically  significant) are to be 
recorde d in the electronic case report forms (eCRFs).
The ECG recorded during screening will be used to determine eligibility  for study  
participation. Subjects who have a clinically  significant abnormal ECG will not be eligible

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2for the stud y. The interpretation o f the ECG from screening will be the baseline to which 
post-study  vaccine dosing ECGs will be compared.
Unscheduled ECGs will be performed if clinicall y indicated.
If a machine -read corrected QT interval exceeds 500 msec after repeat measurement, this 
should be reported as an AE.
The original print -out and an electronic cop
y of all scheduled and unscheduled ECG tracings 
should be maintained on site as source data.
Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is an y untoward me dical occurrence in a subject administered a study vaccine, and 
which does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship with this immunization.  An AE 
can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead to 
a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received study  product. AE collection begins after the signing of the I CF and will be 
collected until 30 day s after study  vaccine administration or the subject is determine d to be a 
screen failure.
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non
-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be identified as an AE only  if the abnormality meets 1 of the 
following criteria:
●Induces clinical sign or symptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  medication
●The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically significant in the opinion of the 
investigator.
MAAEs are AEs for which the subject has received medical attention by medical personnel, 
or in an emergency  room, or which led to hospitalization. For each reported AE, the 
investigator will ask the subject if such medical attention has been received. I n addition, the 
investigator will assess each MAAE if it constitutes a new -onset chronic disease (NOCD), 
defined as a MA AE which a) was absent at baseline, b) is not resolved at the follow -up 
telephone call, c) requires continuous medical care or attention. The investigator will also 
assess if an y MAAE constitutes a PI MMC. PI MMCs are defined as an y AEs of autoimmune

-CONFIDENTIAL -
02 Dec 2019 Astellas Page 60of 111
Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2or auto inflammatory  nature. The investigator will record MAAEs, NOCDs and PI MMCs in 
the AE eCRF. 
5.5.1.1 Abnormal Laboratory Findings
Any abnormal laboratory test result (e.g., hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinal ysis) or 
other safet y assessment (e.g., ECGs, radio graphic scans, vital signs measurements, phy sical 
examination), including those that worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator and not related to 
underly ing disease, is to be reported as an unsolicited (S)AE.
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal safet y assessment, 
which is associated with the underl ying disease does not require reporting as an (S)AE, 
unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
Repeating an abnormal laboratory  test or other safety assessment, in the absence of any  of the 
above criteria, does not constitute an AE.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.
5.5.1.2 Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Refer to [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment] for detailed instructions 
on drug- induced liver injury . Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or 
alanine transaminase (ALT) concurrent or with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that 
meet the criteria outlined in [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment], in the 
absen ce of other causes of liver injury, are considered potential cases of drug -induced liver 
injury  (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and are alway s to be considered important medical events 
and reported per [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events].
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
●Requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures as allowed per study ) 
or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned 
hospitalization is not caused by  an AE). Hospitalization for 
treatment/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered as serious.) 
●Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol 3772- CL-1001
-CONFIDENTIAL -
02 Dec 2019 Astellas Page 61of 111
Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacity , usuall y are 
considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of dr ug dependency  or drug abuse.
5.5.2.1 Always Serious Adverse Events
The sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an AE is 
reported that is considered by the sponsor to be an SAE per this classification as “alway s 
serious”, additional information on the event (e.g., investigator confirmation of seriousness, 
causality) will be requested.  
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to Study Vaccine
A medicall y qualified investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the stud y 
vaccine and each occurrence of each (S)AE. This medically  qualified investigator will use 
medical judgment as well as the Reference Safet y Information to determine the relationship. 
The causality  assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regu latory  reporting 
requirements.
The medicall y qualified investigator is requested to provide an explanation for the causality 
assessment for each (S)AE and must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the (S)AE and has provided an assessment of causality .
Following a review of the relevant data, the causal relationship between the study  vaccine 
and each (S)AE will be assessed by  answering ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’ to the question “ Do you 
consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the study vaccine ”.
When making an assessment of causalit y, the following factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a ‘reasonable possibility ’ 
that an (S)AE may  have been caused by the study vaccine (rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out) or if there is evidence to reasonably  deny  a causal relationship:
●Plausible temporal relationship between exposure to the study  vaccine and (S)AE onset 
and/or resolution. Has the subjec t actually  received the study  vaccine ? Did the (S)AE 
occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the study  vaccine? 
●Plausibility ; i.e., could the event been caused by  the study  vaccine ? Consider biologic 
and/or pharmacologic mecha nism, half -life, literature evidence, drug/vaccine class, 
preclinical and clinical study  data, etc.
●Laboratory  or other test results; a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of 
the relationship between the (S)AE and the stud y vaccine (e.g., ba sed on values pre -
, 
during and post -immunization).

02 Dec 2019 Astellas Page 62of 111
Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2●Available alternative explanations independent of study  vaccine exposure; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family  history , season, location, etc., and strength of the 
alternative explanation.
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that 
the medically  qualified investigator alway s make an assessment of causalit y for every  event 
before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor. With limited or insufficient 
information about the event to make an informed medical judgment and in absence of an y 
indication or evidence to establish a causal relationship, a causalit y assessment of ‘no’ is to 
be considered. In such instance, the investigator is expected to obtain additional information 
regarding the event as soon as possible and to re -evaluate the causality  upon receipt of 
additional information. The medica lly qualified investigator may  revise his/her assessment of 
causality  in light of new information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE follow -
up 
report and update the eCRF with the new information and updated causality assessment. 
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal daily  activities
●Severe: Inability to perform daily  activities
●Potentially  life threatening: Emergency  room visit or hospitalization 
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
The collection of AEs will continue until 30 day s after study  vaccine administration in all 
groups.  The expedited reporting of SAEs will start f ollowing receipt of the ICF and will 
continue until 180 day s after study  vaccine administration in Groups 1 and 2 and until 30 
days after study  vaccine administration in Group 3, or until the subject is determined to be a 
screen failure or withdraws from t he study .
In the case of an SAE, the investigator must contact the sponsor by  fax or email immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness).
The investigator must complete and submit an SAE worksheet containing all information that 
is required b y local and/or r egional regulations to the sponsor by  email or fax immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness).
The SAE worksheet must be signed by a medically qualified investigator (as identified 
on Delegation of Authority Log). Signature confirms accuracy and complete ness of the 
SAE data as well as the investigator causality assessment including the explanation for 
the causality assessment.
If the SAE is associated with emergency  unblinding as outlined in [Section 4.4.4 Breaking 
the Study  Vaccine Assignment Code for Emergency ], this is to be recorded on the SAE

The following minimum information is required:
●International Study  Number/Study  number, 
●Subject number, sex and age,
●The date of r eport,
●A description of the SAE (event, seriousness criteria), 
●Causal relationship to the study  vaccine (including reason), and
● The drug provided (if any) (blinded regimen is also an option)
The sponsor or sponsor’s designee will medicall y evaluate the SAE and determine if the report 
meets the requirements for expedited reporting based on seriousness, causality  and expectedness 
of the events (e.g., Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction [SUSAR] reporting) 
according to current local/regional regula tory requirements in participating countries. The 
sponsor or sponsor's designee will submit expedited safet y reports (e.g., Investigational New 
Drug [IND] Safety  Reports, SUSAR, Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences [CI OMS -I]) to Comp etent Authorities (CA) and concerned Ethics Committee (cEC) 
per current local regulations, and will inform the investigators of such regulatory  reports as 
required. Investigators must submit safety  reports as required b y their IRB within timelines set 
by regional regulations (e.g., EMA, FDA) where required.  Documentation of the submission to 
and receipt by
 the IRB of expedited safet y reports should be retained b y the site.
The sponsor will notify  all investigators responsible for ongoing clinical studies with the study  
vaccine of all SUSARs, which may  require submission per local requirements to the site I RB.
The investigators or designee should provide written documentation of IRB notification for 
each report to the sponsor.
The investigator may  contact t he sponsor's medical monitor/study  physician for an y other 
problem related to the safety , welfare, or rights of the subject.
5.5.6 Follow -up ofAdverse Events
All AEs occurring during or after the subject has discontinued the study  are to be followed up 
until re solved or judged to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they  become chronic to 
the extent that they  can be fully  characterized by  the investigator. 
If after the protocol defined AE collection period [Section 5.5.1 Definition of Adverse 
Event], an AE progresse sto anSAE, or the investigator learns of an y (S)AE including death,

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2where he/she considers there is reasonable possibility  it is rel ated to the study  vaccine 
treatment or stud y participation, the investigator must promptly  notify  the sponsor.
5.5.7 Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events
For this phase 1/2 clinical study , there is no list of common SAEs for which a single 
occurrence will be excluded from IND safety  reporting.
5.5.8 Special Situations 
Certain Special Situations observed in association with the study  vaccine(s), such as incorrect 
administration (e.g., wrong dose of study  vaccine, comparator, or background therapy ) are 
collected in the eCRF, as Protocol Deviation per [Section 8.3 Major Protocol Deviations] or 
may require special reporting, as described below. These Special Situations are not 
considered AEs, but do require to be communicated to Astellas as per the timelines defined 
below.
If a Special Situation is associated with, or results in, an AE, the AE is to be assessed 
separately  from the Special Situation and captured as an AE in the eCRF. Ifthe AE meets the 
definition of a SAE, the SAE is to be reported as described in [Section 5.5.5 R eporting of 
Serious Adverse Events] and the details of the associated Special Situation are to be included 
in the clinical description on the SAE worksheet .
The Special Situations are:
●Pregnancy  
●Medication error, overdose and “off -label use”
● Misuse/abuse
●Occupational exposure
●(Suspicion of) Transmission of infectious agent 
●Suspected drug -drug interaction
5.5.8.1 P regnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant within 28 day s of immunization, the investigator is to 
report the information to Astellas according to the timelines in [ Section 5.5.5 Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events] using the Pregnancy  Reporting Form and i n the eCRF . 
The investigator will attempt to collect pr egnancy
 information on any  female partner of a 
male subject who becomes pregnant within 28 days of immunization and report the 
information to Astellas according to the timelines in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Event s] using the Pregnancy  Reporting Form. 
The expected date of delivery  or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data, etc., should be included in this 
information.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy  is to be reported for a female 
study subject as an AE in the eCRF or SAE per [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse

reported via the Pregnancy Reporting Form. 
Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  when also categorized as an 
SAE is mentioned below:
● “ Spontaneous abortion ”includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion.
● Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE 
regardless of its relationship with the study  vaccine.
● If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, is to be reported if a relationship 
between the death and int rauterine exposure to the study  vaccine is judged as “ possible ”
by the investigator.
●Congenital anomal y (including anomal y in miscarried fetus)
Unless a congenital anomaly  is identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects b y visual examination. (S)AEs 
experienced b y the newborn/infant should be reported via the Pregnancy Reporting Form. 
Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  
date.
5.5.8.2 M edication Error, Overdose and “Off -Label Use”
If a medication error, overdose or “off -label use” (i.e., use outside of what is stated in the 
protocol) is suspected, refer to [Section 8.3 Major Protocol Deviations]. Any associated 
(S)AEs are to be reported in the eCRF .  Ifthe AE meets the definition of a SAE, the SAE is 
also to be reported as described in [Section 
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events] 
together with the details of the medication error, overdose and/or “off -label use”.
In the event of suspected ASP3772 overdose, the subject should receive supportive care and 
monitoring. The medical monitor/expert should be contacted as applicable. 
5.5.8.3 Misuse
If misuse of the stud y vaccine(s) is suspected, the investigator must forward the Special 
Situation worksheet Astellas Pharma Inc. b y fax or email immediately  (within 24 hours of

An Urgent Safety  Measure (USM) i
s an intervention, which is not defined b y the protocol 
and can be put in place with immediate effect without needing to gain prior approval b y the 
sponsor, relevant CA, IRB/IEC, where applicable, in order to protect stud y participants from 
any immediate hazard to their health and/or safet y. Eith er the investigator or the sponsor can 
initiate an USM. The cause of an USM can be safety , product or procedure related .
5.5.11 Reporting Urgent Safety Measures
In the event of a potential USM, the investigator must contact the Astellas study  physician 
(within 24 hours of awareness).  Full details of the potential USM are to be recorded in the 
subject’s medical records.  The sponsor may  request additional information related to the 
event to support their evaluation. 
If the event is confirmed to be an USM the sponsor will take appropriate action to ensure the 
safet y and welfare of the patients.  These actions may include, but are not limited to, a change 
in study  procedures or study  treatment, halting further enrollment in the trial, or stopping the 
study  in its entirety .  The sponsor or sponsor's designee will notify  CA and cEC within the

Discontinuation of the Study
The sponsor may  terminate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at any stud y site, 
for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination . Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  concerns. If 
the sponsor terminates the study  for safet y reasons, the sponsor will immediately notify the 
investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for stud y termination.  
7 STATI STICAL METHODOL OGY
A statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analy sis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before 
the database soft lock at the latest. An y changes from the anal yses planned in SAP will be 
justified in the clinical study  report.
In general, continuous data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, 
mean, standard deviation, geometric mean and geometric standard deviatio n (GSD) where 
applicable, minimum, median and maximum), and frequency  and percentage for categorical 
data. Percentages b y categories will be based on the number of subjects with no missing data, 
i.e., the percentages will sum to 100%.
Baseline will be defi ned as the last observation prior to first dose, unless otherwise specified.
Sample Size
In Stage 1, approximately 120 evaluable adults 18 to 64 years of age are planned to be enrolled.  
This sample size in is considered sufficient to obtain preliminary estimates in a phase 1 study  of 
safet y and reactogenicit y in the adult population, ages 18 to 64. In Stage 2, approximately 495 
evaluable adult subjects from 65 to 85 y ears of age are planned to be enrolled.  For each PCV13

64years of age administered PCV13 (Source Prevnar13®label) were assumed to be 
representative of the response following immunization with ASP3772.  The width of 95% 
confidence intervals for each sero type with 30, 100 and 150 subjects were calculated. A sample 
size of 100 subjects at each dose level treated with ASP3772 under these assumptions was 
considered sufficient to provide good estimates of OPA titer-
1responses.  The sample size and 
dose level for the phase 3 study  will be determined based on the responses in Stage
2 elderl y 
subjects. 
Analysis Sets
The Safet y Analysis Set (SAF) will consist of all subjects who receive an immunization in 
this study  with either ASP3772, PCV13, or PPSV23.  The Ful l Anal ysis Set (FAS) will 
consist of all subjects who receive an immunization in this study  with either ASP3772, 
PCV13 or PPSV23 and have at least 1 post immunizati on measurement.
For each ASP3772, PCV13 or PPSV23 immunization group, the number and percenta ge of 
subjects in each anal ysis set will be given for all randomized (ASP3772 or PCV13) or 
enrolled (PPSV23) subjects.

(log) of pneumococcal OPA titers and the natural log of the IgG concentrations. 
In addition, for both Stage 1 Group 1 and Stage 2 Group 2, SP1500+0785 levels (ng/mL) will 
be collected for those subjects given either ASP3772 or PCV13. Levels of the following cytokines will be collected for subjects given ASP3772 or PCV13: Th17, IL-17, , IL-22, 
 The units for all are pg/mL. Non-parametric 
methods will be used for these analyses. A Kruskal-Wallis test will be used to test for overall differences between the 3 dose levels and PCV13. All treatment groups in Stage 1 will be compared, followed by paired comparisons between each of the ASP3772 dose levels and PCV13 using a Wilcoxon Test.  The same set of comparisons will be made for subjects in Stage 2, Group 2.
Stage 2; Group 3: 
For the 11 serotypes contained in PPSV23 and not in PCV13, immunological response will 
be evaluated by the following endpoints at 30 days after administration of PPSV23:

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2The investigator or site designee is responsible to ensure that all data in the eCRFs and 
queries are accurate and complete and that all entries are verifiable with source documents. 
These documents should be appropriatel y mainta ined by  the site.
The monitor should verify  the data in the eCRFs with source documents and confirm that 
there are no inconsistencies between them.
Laboratory  tests are performed at a central laboratory . Central Laboratory  data will be 
transferred electron ically to the sponsor or designee at predefined intervals during the study . 
The Central laboratory  will provide the sponsor or designee with a complete and clean cop y 
of the data. 
ECGs are performed at a site ECG reader device. ECG read data will be revie wed b y the 
investigator for the entry  in eCRF.
The investigator or designee must record all protocol- required data in the provided eCRF. In 
the interest of collecting data in the most efficient manner, the investigator or site designee 
should record data ( including laboratory  values, if applicable) onto the eCRF as soon as 
possible after the subject visit. eCRFs and any supporting documents should be available for 
retrieval b y the sponsor/delegated CRO at an y given time. The monitor should verify  the data 
in the eCRFs with source documents to confirm that there are no inconsistencies between 
them. If the monitor finds no inconsistencies, the appropriate eCRFs are collected, ensuring a 
copy  remains at site. The originals should be submitted to the sponsor or designee.
If any inconsistency is detected on the collected eCRFs, the monitor or data manager should 
query  the investigator/subinvestigator. The investigator/subinvestigator should provide an 
answer to the query  and provide the resolved query  to the sponsor.
The monitor should verify  the revised data of the eCRFs with source documents and confirm 
that there are no inconsistencies between them, and also check that appropriate records on the 
correction/addition of data are maintained.
All procedures conducte d under the protocol must be documented. For screen failures, the 
minimum demographic data (sex, birth date, race and informed consent date), outcome of 
eligibility  assessment (inclusion and exclusion criteria), reason for screen failure and AEs 
details mu st be documented.
The investigator or designee will be responsible for eCRF completion and that all data and 
queries are accurate, complete and are verifiable with the source. The source should be 
appropriatel y maintained by the clinical unit.
Electronic d ata sources and any  supporting documents should be available for 
review/retrieval b y the sponsor/designee at an y given time.
Electronic Patient Reported Outcome:

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2review the diaries and questionnaire data throughout the  study  to ensure completion and 
protocol compliance . The diary  and questionnaire data will be transferred electronicall y to 
sponsor or designee at predefined intervals during the stu
dy. The vendor will provide the 
investigator with a complete and clean cop y of the site’s data and will provide the sponsor or 
designee with a complete and clean cop y of the study data.  The ownership of this data is 
with the investigator and subsequently  any changes requested to the non- subject reported data 
will be made using a Data Clarification Form (DCF) to the vendor.  The requested change 
must be supported by  documented evidence at site.  For this stud y, it has been decided that 
there are justifiable scientific reasons (e.g., recall bias) for not allowing changes after the 
original dail y data has been entered or not allowing additional data entered after the daily  
24-hour window has expired as these changes could potentially  impact the data integrity  of 
this study .  Data not collected by  the subject in his/her ePRO diary  will be no ted as missing 
in the dataset .
Screen Failures
For screen failures the demographic data, reason for failing, informed consent, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and AEs will be collected in the eCRF.
Major Protocol Deviations
A major protocol deviation is generally an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented or intended as 
a systematic change. The investigator is responsible for ensuring 
the study  is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this 
protocol and must protect the rights, safet y and welfare of subjects. The investigator should 
not implement any  deviation from, or changes of, the protocol, unless it is necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study  subjects.  
A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an investigator to 
deviate from the protocol. Pr otocol waivers are strictly  prohibited.  The major protocol 
deviation criteria are described in [Section 7.8Major Protocol Deviations and Other 
Analyses].
When a major deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the 
investigator or designee must ensure the sponsor is notified.  The sponsor will follow- up with 
the investigator, as applicable, to assess the deviation and the po ssible impact to the safet y 
and/or efficacy of the subject to determine subject continuation in the study . 
If a major deviation impacts the safet y of a subject, the investigator must contact the sponsor 
immediately .  The investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and 
applicable regulatory  authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriatel y. 
All documentation and communications to the I RB/IEC and applicable regulatory  authorities 
will be provided to the sponsor and maintai ned within the trial master file.

Contraception Requirements
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Schedule of Assessments.
WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND METHODS OF 
CONTRACEPTION DEFINITIONS (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile. 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOC BP
● Premenarchal
●Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
○
Documented h ysterectomy
○Documented bilateral salpingectomy
○Documented bilateral oophorectom y
●Post-menopausal
Documentation of an y of these categories can come from the site personnel’s review of the 
female subject’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
A postmenopausal state is defined as at least 12 months after last regular menstrual bleeding 
without an alternative medical cause. 
●In case the last regular menstrua l bleeding cannot be clearly determined, confirmation 
with repeated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) measurements of at least > 40 IU/L (or 
higher per local institutional guidelines), is required. 
Females on hormone replacement therap y (HRT) and whose m enopausal status is in doubt 
will be required to use 1 of the non -estrogen hormonal highl y effective contraception 
methods if they  wish to continue their HRT during the study . Otherwise, they  must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal sta tus by  repeated FSH 
measurements before study  enrollment.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD 
BEARING POTENTIAL
One of the highl y effective methods of contraception listed below is required at the time of 
informed consent and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 28 days after the 
study  vaccine administration. *

Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation is considered as a highl y effective contrac eption method. 
Vasectomized partner: A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method 
provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of 
sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effecti ve method of contraception 
should be used.
Sexual abstinence: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined 
as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with 
the study vaccine. The reli ability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. It is not 
necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected.
* Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods.
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be 
consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contra
ceptive methods for participants participating 
in clinical studies.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR MALE PARTICIPANTS WITH PARTNER(S) 
OF CHILD BEARING POTENTIAL.
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if 
they agree to the following during the study  and until the end of relevant systemic exposure 
defined as 28 day s after study  vaccine administration. *
●Inform an y and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug stud y and the need to 
comply  with c ontraception instructions as directed by  the investigator.
●Male participants are required to use a condom during the stud y and until end of relevant 
systemic exposure defined 28 day s after study  immunization.
●Female partners of male participants who have n ot undergone a vasectom y with the 
absence of sperm confirmed or a bilateral orchiectomy should consider use of effective 
methods of contraception until the end of relevant sy stemic exposure, defined as 28 day s 
after stud y immunization.

Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment 
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therap y and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin > 2 × ULN 
should undergo detailed testing for liver enz ymes (including at least ALT, AST, alkali ne 
phosphatase and total bilirubin [TBL ]). Testing should be repeated within 72 hours of 
notification of the test results. For studies for which a central laboratory is used, alerts will be 
generated b y the central laboratory regarding moderate and severe liver abnormality  to 
inform the investigator and study team. Subjects should be asked if they  have any  symptoms 
suggestive of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3 × ULN Or > 2 × ULN
Severe > 3 × ULN And > 2 × ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN.
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks.  
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and International Normalized Ratio (I NR) > 1.5 (If INR testing 
is applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history, 
physical examination and laboratory  tests. The site staff is to co mplete the liver abnormality  
case report form (LA -CRF). Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should 
be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal liver function tests should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly 
then weekl y or less if abnormalities stabilize or the study  vaccine has been discontinued and 
the subject is asy mptomatic.  
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology , may  be considered an important medical event and may be reported as a SAE.  The

Version 2.1 Nons ubstantial Amendment 2sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe hepatic liver 
function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  vaccine are observed.
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the i nvestigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptoms 
and new -onset diseases is to be recorded as “AEs” within the eCRF. Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease that may  lead 
to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients, and may be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels.   The investigator should ensure that the medical history  form 
captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational dr ug use and 
special diets.  Medications, is to be entered in the eCRF.  I nformation on alcohol, other 
substance use and diet should be entered on the LA- CRF or an appropriate document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
●Based on the subject’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including: 
oAcute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents), 
oUltrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease,
oOther laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin.
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
*Hy’s Law Definition: Drug -induced jaundice caused by  hepatocellular injury , without a 
significant obstructive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10 to 50% mortality  
(or transplant). 
The 2 “requirements” for Hy ’s Law are: 
1) Evidence that a drug can cause hepatocellular -type injury , generally  shown by  an increase 
in transaminase elevatio ns higher 3 × ULN (“2 × ULN elevations are too common in 
treated and untreated patients to be discriminating”). 
2) Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 2 × ULN) with concurrent transaminase elevations at 
least 3 × ULN and no evidence of intra- or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated 
alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) or Gilbert’s sy ndrome [Temple, 2006].

I.  The purpose of this amendment is:
Non-Substantial Changes
1.Minor Administrative -type Changes
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: 
Include minor administrative -type changes, e.g., ty pos, format, numbering, consistency  
throughout the protocol.  
RATIONALE:
To provide clarifications to the protocol and to ensure complete understanding of study  
procedures.
2.Update Planned Study Period
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
The planned stud y period for this Stage 2 of this trial is moved out a quarter. 
RATIONALE:
This revision is made due to reflect the current study  timelines.
3.Increase in Number of Study Sites
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
The number of stud y sites for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 is increased.
RATIONALE:
The site numbers are increased to support subject recruitment in Stage 2 Group 2.
4. Modification to Exclusion Criterion #11
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Exclusion criterion #11 is revised to remove the requirement to exclude subjects who are 
positive for hepatitis B core antibod y (HBc) during serology testing. 
RATIONALE:
It was determined that hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is sufficient to confi rmevidence 
of chronic hepatitis B virus infection.
5.Extension of Screening Period
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
The screening period for Stage 2, Groups 2 and 3, is extended to 40 day s before dosing.

02 Dec 2019 Astellas Page 100 of 111
Version 2.1 Nonsubstantial Amendment 2RATIONALE:
The screening period is extended for Groups 2 and 3 to minimize the number of subjects who 
may require rescreening procedures due to the timing of cohort data reviews. 
6.Modification to Stopping Rules
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE:
The formal stopping rules for cohorts is updated such that enrollment/dosing will be stopped 
when 1 of the sentinel subjects experiences an ASP3772-related adverse event (AE) of severe intensity only when sentinel subjects are required. 
RATIONALE:
Based on the dose escalation committee review of safety data in previous cohorts, it was decided that sentinel subjects will no longer be required for Cohort 5 onward.

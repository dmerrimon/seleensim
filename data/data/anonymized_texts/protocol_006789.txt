Study Phase Phase II 
Background/Study 
Purpose and Rationale  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents approximately 40% 
of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), with a rate of incidence which 
continues to increase and a median age at diagnosis of 64 years.  
 
The addition of the CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab (RTX)  
to standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone) chemotherapy (R-CHOP) has been shown to improve the 
outcome compared with CHOP alone in untreated patients  with DLBCL. 
Despite advances in first-line treatment, 30–40% of such patients relapse.  
Patients progressing or relapsing after first -line treatment may be offered 
salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with , 
if the disease is still chemosensitive,  autologous stem-cell transplantation 
(ASCT). Several second-line combination therapies are used with variable 
success. However, a substantial percentage of patients will either fail  to 
respond to salvage therapy and subsequently not be eligible for ASCT, or 
will progress after ASCT.  
 
Additionally, the use of HDC with stem cell support in patients with R-R 
DLBCL may not be appropriate for those with comorbidities or advanced 
age, restricting the benefit of this aggressive approach to a relatively small 
fraction of patients.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 7 of 110 R-CHOP -like regimens have become standard first -line treatment in 
patients with DLBCL . Those p atients who have received prior RTX are 
less likely to respond to  RTX -containing sa lvage treatment and therefore 
effective and well -tolerated new treatment modalities with manageable 
toxicities are needed to ameliorate prognosis in R-R DLBCL. Rational 
combinations of effective compounds have been shown to be active and 
often lead to better clinical outcomes in DLBCL than single -agent therapy.  
 
The B -lymphocyte lineage specific surface antigen CD19 is the earliest 
and most broad ly expressed  of the selective B -cell markers, and is highly 
expressed in the tumour cells of most patients with B -cell NHL. Because 
of this expression pattern, a  CD19 antibody may have clinical utility as a 
new therapeutic approach to NHL treatment.  
 
MOR00208  is an Fc -engineered , humani sed, mAb with significantly 
enhanced antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), 
antibody -dependent cell -mediated phagocytosis ( ADCP ) and direct 
cytotoxic effects (apoptosis)  compared with the parental murine antibody . 
 
Monotherapy with MOR00208  has show n preliminary signs of clinical 
efficacy and acceptable toxicity in a phase I  study in  R-R chronic 
lymphocytic leuk aemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma  (CLL/SLL ) and a 
phase IIa study in  R-R NHL . Additionally , MOR00208  is currently being 
studied as single -agent therapy in  a phase IIa study in  R-R B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leuk aemia (B -ALL).  
 
Lenalidomide (LEN) belongs to a class of immunomodulating agents 
(immunomodulatory d rugs [IMiDs®]), which have demonstrated direct 
tumo uricidal and immunomodulatory actions. LEN has both 
antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities , modulat ing the tumour cell 
microenvironment and stimulat ing the activity of effector cells such as 
cytotoxic T -cells and natural killer (NK) cells. LEN demonstrated 
manageable toxicity when administered as monotherapy and in 
combination, as well as  a synergistic effect with RTX , administered  alone 
or as a part of an immunochemotherap eutic  regimen . 
 
Preclinical data suggest that the combination of LEN with MOR00208  
may increase NK cell -mediated ADCC, making this combination of 
interest for further study in patients with R-R DLBCL. This patient 
population is particularly relevant for th e current  study as they can usually 
achieve a rapid and complete lymphoma regression with second -line 
therapy, but invariably experience relapse, which is the principal  
unfavourable prognostic factor.  
 
Combining two agents with probable synergistic mechanisms of action 
and acceptable safety profiles could potentially contribute to significantly 
prolonging ti me to progression, and possibly  overall survival (OS) , in this 
patient population. Therefore, this open label, single -arm, prospective 
phase II study is designed to confirm the activity of MOR00208  combined 
with LEN in patients with R-R DLBCL who have had at  least one , but no

planned to be investigated during the course of the study . 
 
Design and 
Methodology /Patient 
Population  This is a single -arm, multicentre, open -label , phase II study of LEN  
combined with MOR00208  in adult patients with DLBCL who have 
relapsed after or are refractory to at least one, but no more than three prior 
systemic  therapies and who are not candidates for HDC and ASCT,  and 
are thus considered to have exhausted their ther apeutic options for 
demonstr able clinical benefit. One prior therapy line must have include d 
a CD20 -targeted therapy (e.g. , RTX).  
 
Histological confirmation of the diagnosis of DLBCL will be performed 
by a central pathologist , retrospectively after enrolment. Objective disease 
response assessment s will be made by central radiology  and clinical  
reviewers. Details will be provided in a n imaging  charter , outlining 
functions and processes . 
 
This study will consist of two parts, which will be performed sequentially , 
where the first part (safety run -in) will conclude with an evaluation of  the 
safety data after six patients have completed the first  cycle of treatment . 
The second part will commence pending the outcome of th is evaluat ion. 
 
Approximately 80 patients will  be enrolled in the study.

25 mM sodium citrate, 200  mM trehalose and 0.02% (w/v) 
polysorbate  20 at pH  6.0. Each product vial is intended to deliver 200  mg 
of MOR 00208 in 5 ml of reconstituted solution. MOR00208  will be 
diluted into a 250  mL infusion bag containing 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride 
for injection.   
 
LEN will be sourced from commercially available drug supplie rs 
(Revlimid®).  
 
Efficacy Assessments  Disease response assessment s will be made according to the revised 
response criteria for malignant lymphoma based on the guidelines of the 
International Working Group ( IWG , as reported by Cheson et al. (2007)  
and will be  based on a central review (radiological  + clinical)  of the 
disease assessments. Efficacy will be evaluated in terms of ORR, DCR, 
DoR, PFS, OS, TTP and TTNT . Results of local disease response 
assessments will also be available.  
 
Safety Assessments  The safety and tolerability of study drug treatments will be evaluated by 
means of AE reports (number and severity), performance status, physical 
examinations, 12 -lead resting electrocardiograms  (ECGs), and laboratory 
safety evaluations.  
 
Laboratory and AE toxicities will be graded according to National Cancer 
Institute  (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), version 4. 0. 
 
Pharmacokinetics  The PK of MOR00208 will be investigated during the course of the study.  
 
Biomarker Assessments  Blood and tumo ur specimens for the analysis of exploratory biomarkers 
will be collected throughout the study and will be characterised  for 
markers which are important in the mechanism of action of, or could 
predict response to, the s tudy drugs. Exploratory  and diagnostic  
biomarkers  (e.g., CD19, CD20, BCL 2, BCL 6), CD16 expression on NK 
cells, B -, T- and NK  cell counts, ADCC capacity  and gene expression 
profiling for cell of origin  subtyping are planned to  be investigated during  
the cou rse of the study.  
 
Statistical Methods and 
Data Analysis  The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 
oral LEN combined with MOR00208 administered by IV infusion in 
patients with R-R DLBCL. No formal statistical hypothesis testing will be 
performed.  
 
For the sample size determination  it is assumed that the combination 
treatment could improve the ORR from a value of 20% (corresponding to 
monotherapy ) to one of 35% which is achievable under combination 
treatment. Sample size e stimation using a one -sample exact binomial test 
with a two -sided significance level of 5% and a power of 85% delivers a

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 15 of 110 sample size of 73 patients. According to  this scenario an observed ORR 
of 32% w ould lead to a statistically significant study outcome. Allowing 
for a drop -out rate of 10% the total required sample size comes to 
approximately 80  patients.  
 
All data will be summarised using appropriate statistics (counts/ 
percentages for discrete variables, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, maximum , number of valid observations for continuous 
variables) for tabulation purposes. For specific variables, p -values and 
95% confidence limits will be presented.  
 
Overall baseline and d emographic data will be summaris ed using 
appropriate statistics. Patient disposition and status at the end of the study 
will be tabulated presenting the number of patients and frequencies . 
General medical history and history of DLBCL, including prior cancer 
therapies , will be tabulated u sing coding systems (e.g. , MedDRA, WHO -
DDE), where appropriate.  
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : 
 
Primary efficacy endpoint : Objective response rate (ORR)  
The ORR  will be the percentage of patients who have met the ORR 
definition up until progression based on the central (independent) 
radiologic al and clinical evaluations. The denominator for calculating the 
rate will be based upon the total number of patients in the full analysis set 
(FAS) population . As a sensitivity analysis , patients without any post -
baseline assessment of response will be included in the denominator for 
ORR calculation. Number of patients being a responder and the respective 
rates , as well as 95% confidence limits , will be presented.  
 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 
 
Disease control rate (DCR)  
The DCR  will be evaluated like ORR.  
 
Durat ion of response (DoR) and Time to next treatment (TTNT)  
Response duration by the local assessment and by the central radiologic al 
+ clinical assessments will be tabulated with descriptive statistics. Time to 
next treatment will be descriptively analysed.  
 
Progression -free survival (PFS),  overall survival (OS) and time to 
progression (TTP)  
Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to evaluate median survival, 
presentin g corresponding statistical parameters and 95% confidence limits 
and Kaplan -Meier survival curves.  
 
Incidence and severity of adverse events  
MedDRA coded adverse events will be used to show the incidence of all 
AEs by specific organ class ( SOC ), preferred term ( PT), relationship to 
treatment, severity and seriousness. An AE summary table will present the

having treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ), serious AEs , adverse drug 
reactions , and TEAEs t hat led to study discontinuation.  
AE frequency tables will display event and patient counts/frequency by 
MedDRA SOC and PT, distinguishing also by severity/toxicity, 
relationship  to study drug , seriousness and outcome.  
 
Concomitant medications taken , starting on the day of the screening visit 
and through the followup - period , will be coded using appropriate coding 
systems and tabulated by each code system.  
 
Extent of exposure, clinical laboratory assessments, vital sign 
measurements, physical examinat ion and results of ECGs will be 
summarised with appropriate descriptive statistics.  
 
Immunogenicity  
The a bsolute number and percent age of patients  who develop anti -
MOR00208  antibodies, and the results of semi -quantitative anti -
MOR00208  antibody titre determinations of confirmed positive samples 
assessments , will be tabulated.  
 
Pharmacokinetics  
Appropriate PK parameters for MOR00208 will be computed based on 
non-compartmental data analysis and summarised using descriptive 
statistics. Mean concentrations will be visuali sed by figures.  
 
Biomarker s 
Blood and protein biomarkers which are important in the mechanism of 
action of, or could predict response to, the study drugs will be 
descriptively tabulated, presenting absolute and change to baseline values , 
if applicable .

1.1 Overview of Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma s 
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL s) account for approximately 5% of all new cancer cases and 
comprise a heterogen eous group of lymph oproliferative malignancies , which  in 90% of cases 
are derived from  B-cells. 
 
Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ), the most common high -grade NHL , accounts for 
approximately 40%  of NHL s (Armit age and  Weisenbuger, 1998 ; Swerdl ow et al., 2008 ) and 
compris es 60% of all new lymphom as in the elderly  population  (Thieblemont and  Coiffier, 
2007 ). The median age at the diagnosis of DLBCL is 64 years and the majority of patients present 
with advanced disease. There were an estimated 386,000 new cases of NHL worldwide in 2012, 
including 93,500 new cases in Europe and 70,400 in North America ( Ferlay et al., 2014 ). 
 
DLBCL is a heterogeneous disorder with two major molecular subtypes identified by gene 
expression profiling (GEP): germinal centre B-cell type (GCB) and activated B -cell type (ABC). 
The latter group is often included in non -GCB type in immunohistochemistry (IHC) -based 
algorithms. The ABC (non -GCB subtype) has been associated with worse outco me.  
 
Other NHLs include m antle cell lymphoma ( MCL ), follicular lymphoma (FL) and other indolent 
NHLs (iNHL)  such as m arginal zone lymphoma (MZL ), mucosa -associated and lymphoid tissue 
lymphoma (MALT).  
 
1.2 Treatment of DLBCL  
DLBCL is considered to be a chemosensitive neoplasm. Originally, CHOP  (cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy  was the standard first -line treatment. 
However the addition of rituximab ( RTX) into CHOP -like (R-CHOP -like), anthracycline -based 
regimens ha s significantly improved the clinical results in patients with DLBCL, becoming the 
standard of care ( Feugier et al., 2005 ; Habermann et al., 2006 ; Coiffier et al., 2002 ). 
 
Nevertheless, even with the availability of R -CHOP -like treatment regimens, approximately 30 –
40% of patients will ultimately relapse or progress. In patients progressing or relapsing after 
first-line treatment the ultimate therapeutic goal is to be able to offer salvage chemotherapy  such 
as DHAP (cisplatin, cytarabine, dexamethasone), VIM (etoposide, ifosfamide, methotrexate), 
ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), or ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisone, cytarabine, 
cisplatin),  followed by high -dose chemo therapy  (HDC)  with autologous stem  cell transplantation 
(ASCT ) if the disease is still chemo sensitive. HDC with ASCT is a potentially curative treatment, 
significantly improving disease -free survival and overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed  
DLBC L (Philip et al., 1995 ). 
 
However , the use of HDC with stem cell support may not be appropriate , especially for patients 
with comorbid ities or older age, restricting the benefit of this aggressive approach to a relatively 
small percentage  of patients. For the remaining pa tient population , several second -line 
combination therapies are used with variable success, but the median survival for patients who

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 26 of 110 have relapsed after second -line therapy is less than one year, and the  median survival for  those 
not responding to second -line therapy is less than 6  months.  
 
Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy may have the potential to improve objective response rate s 
(ORRs)  and OS without increasing haematologic al toxicity. This is supported by data f rom 
studies investigating other CD19 mAbs , including  MDX -1342, SAR3419  and MEDI -551 
(Ribrag et al., 2014 ; Matlawska -Wasowska et al., 2013 ; Younes et al., 2012 ; Bargou et al., 2008 ; 
Viardot et al., 2011 ). 
 
1.3  Lenalidomide  in Haematological Malignancies  
Lenalidomide  (LEN  [Revlimid®]) belongs to the class of pharmaceutical compounds known as 
immunomodulatory drugs (IM iDs®). Although the mechanism(s) of LEN  activity  remain (s) 
unclear, in vitro  and in vivo  preclinical studies show that IM iDs® demonstrate a varie ty of  
biological effects (Haslett et al., 2003 ; Galustian et al., 200 9; Pan et al., 2012 ; Saloura and Grivas , 
2010 ; Wiernik, 2013 ). Specifically, they:  
 inhibit the proliferation  and increase the proapoptosis  of NHL cells  
 costimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, thereby enhancing Th1 -type cellular immunity. 
IMiDs® may inhibit T -regulatory cells which are known to suppress CD4+ T -cell activity 
in NHL  
o T-cell costimulation leads to interleukin -2 (IL-2) mediated enhanced natural 
killer ( NK) effector function leading to enhanced tumo ur cell recognition and 
killing and increased potential for antibody dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC)  
 inhibit regulatory T -cells that are known to suppress CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell activity in 
NHL 
 exert antiangiogenic effects in the tumour microenvironment, and reduce endothelial cell 
migration.  
 
LEN has been approved by multiple health authorities : 
a. for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent an aemia due to low - or 
intermediate -1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) associated with the cytogenetic 
abnormality,  deletion 5q , with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities  
b. for use in combination with dexamethasone for patients with previously treated multiple 
myeloma (MM) based on  significant antitumo ur activity  
c. for the treatment of patients with MCL whose disease has relapsed or progressed after 
two prio r therapies including bortezomib . 
 
LEN has also shown activity in R-R chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL )/small lymphocytic 
lymphoma  (SLL) ( Chanan -Khan et al., 2006 ). Additionally , LEN is being investigated as a 
treatment for various oncologic al indications , including MM, NHL and solid tumo urs. Studies 
have also been conducted in non -oncologic al indications.

 LEN  as a Single Agent in Relapsed DLBCL  
It has been  demonstrated that LEN has single -agent activity in R-R DLBCL. Wiernik et al. 
(2008) evaluated  the safety and efficacy of 25 mg LEN administered orally , daily, for 52  weeks, 
until disease progression or intolerance as monotherapy in patients with R-R aggressive NHL. 
The primary endpoint was ORR ; secondary endpoints included duration of response ( DoR ), 
progression -free survival ( PFS), and safety. Forty -nine patients with a median age of 65 years 
received LEN in this study. The most common histology was DLBCL , established in 53% of 
patients, and patients had received a median of four p rior treatment regimens for NHL. The  ORR 
was 35% including a 12% complete response ( CR)/unconfirmed CR rate. Of patients with stable 
disease  (SD)  or partial response  (PR)  at first assessment, 25% improved with continued 
treatment. Estimated median DoR  was 6.2 months, and median PFS was 4.0 months. The most 
common grade 4 adverse  events (AEs) were neutropenia (8.2%) and thrombocytopenia (8.2%) . 
 
Similarly , in a phase II study of LEN in patients with R-R DLBCL, MCL, follicular grade  3 
lymphoma (FL -3), or transformed lymphoma (TL) patients received oral LEN 25 mg on days 1 –
21 every 28 days as tolerated or until progression (Witzig et al., 2011 ). Two hundred and 
seventeen patients were enrolled and received LEN . The ORR was 35% (77/217), with 13% 
(29/217)  of patients achieving  CRs, 22% (48/217)  PRs, and 21% (45/217) with SD. The ORR 
for DLBCL was 28% (30/108). Median PFS for all 217 patients was 3.7 months. For 
77 responders, the median DoR was 10.6 months. The most common AE was myelosuppression , 
with grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 17%  and 6%  of patients , respectively.  
 
Zinzani et al. (2014 ) have shown in a retrospective, multicentr e study that LEN monotherapy is 
effective and safe for heavily pretreated patients with R-R NHL. The ORR in 64 evaluable 
patients was 42.2% and was similar among patients receiving 10, 15 or 25 mg/day LEN . ORR  
in patients with MCL , DLBCL  and FL were 45.5%, 42.1% and 20%, respectively. Mean DoR  
in patients receiving any LEN  dose was 10.5 months; 1-year PFS and OS rates were 50.3% and 
82.6%, respectively.  
 
Additionally it has been shown that single agent LEN was active in heavily pretreated patients 
with aggressive, R-R NHL subsequent to  a prior ASCT (Vose et al., 2013 ). 
 
 LEN and DLBCL Subtype 
A retrospective analysis of the outcomes of patients with GCB vs non -GCB DLBCL treated with 
LEN was performed  by Hernandez -Ilizaliturri et al.  (2011 ). Forty patients with R-R DLBCL 
were included (24 men; 16 women; median age, 66 years; median of four prior treatments, 
including RTX -containing  chemotherapy). Patients were classified as having GCB (n=23) or 
non-GCB (n=17) DLBCL. This analysis showed that patients with R-R DLBCL with a non-GCB  
phenotype  had a higher ORR and CR rate and longer PFS when  treated with LEN than those 
with a GCB  phenotype , despite similarities in terms of disease stage, International Prognostic 
Index ( IPI) score, number of prior treatments, and RTX resistance .

 LEN in Combination with RTX in R-R DLBCL  
The combination of LEN with RTX has been shown to be  activ e and well tolerated with a 
manageable toxicity profile in heavily pretreated patients with R-R DLBC L. Zinzani et al . (2011 ) 
conducted a phase II study in heavily pretreated, elderly patients with R-R DLBCL. The 
induction treatment with oral LEN (20 mg/d ay for 21 days of each 28 -day cycle) combined with 
RTX followed by LEN maintenance therapy resulted in a 35% CR rate at a median follow -up of 
16 months. LEN maintenance in responding patients led to continuation of their initial response. 
The most common AE s included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  
 
Wang et al. (2013 ) assessed the clinical activity of oral LEN and RTX in 45 patients with R-R 
DLBCL (n=32), transformed large cell lymphoma (n=9) or FL -3 (n=4) who had received 
1-4 prior lines of treatment. Patient s were given 20 mg oral LEN on D ays 1 –21 of each 28 -day 
cycle, and RTX. The ORR was 33%;  median DoR  was 10.2 months. Median PFS and OS were  
3.7 and 10.7 months, respectively. Grade 3/4 h aematological toxicities included neutropenia 
(53%), lymphopenia (40%), thrombocytopenia (33%), leukopenia (27%)  and an aemia (18%).  
 
Ivanov et al. (2014 ) analy sed clinical outcomes in 17 patients with R-R DLBCL treated with 
LEN at a dose of 25 mg/day for 21/28 days and RTX for a maximum of 12 months. The ORR 
was 41.2% with 35.3% of patients achieving  a CR, while the median DoR  was 26.5 months at a 
median follow -up of 24.9 months. The estimated 24 -month OS and PFS rates were  45% and 
38%, respectively . The most common AEs were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.  
 
 LEN  in Combination wi th R-CHOP  or R -ICE in DLBCL  
A phase I study established the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of LEN  that could be combined 
with R-CHOP chemotherapy for adults  with newly diagnosed aggressive B -cell NHL  
(Nowakowski et al., 2011 ). Eligible patients were those with newly diagnosed, untreated CD20 -
positive DLBCL or FL-3. Patients received oral LEN  on Days 1 –10 with standard dose R -CHOP  
administered  over 21 days . All patients received pegfilgrastim on Day 2 of the cycle and aspi rin 
prophylaxis. The LEN  dose levels tested were 15, 20 and 25 mg. Twenty -four patients were 
enrolled. The median age was 65 ( range 35–82) years and 54% (13/24) were over 60 years. Three 
patients received 15 mg, 3 received 20 mg and 18 received 25 mg of LEN . No dose -limiting 
toxicity (DLT) was found. LEN d ose escalation beyond 25 mg D ays 1 –10 was not performed  
and LEN  25 mg Days 1 –10 was the recommended dose for phase II  studies . The incidence of 
grade 4  neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 67% and 21%, r espectively. The incidence of 
febrile neutropenia requiring hospitali sation was 4% and there were no bleeding or toxic ity 
related deaths. There were no delays in chemotherapy due to cytopenias. The ORR  was 100% 
with a CR rate of 77 %. It was shown that the combination of LEN with  the R-CHOP regimen 
was safe and effective  for the treatment of aggressive lymphomas including DLBCL . In a 
subsequent phase II study , Nowakowski et al. (2015 ) have not only confirmed their initial 
observation  concerning clinical efficacy , but also established that the addition of LEN to R -
CHOP  mitigates the negative impact of the non-GCB phenotype on patient outcome.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 29 of 110 Additionally , studies  conducted by Fondazione Italian Linfomi have shown  that combining 
15 mg oral LEN on Days 1 –14 of 21 -day cycles with standard doses of R -CHOP chemotherapy 
is an effective and safe treatment modality in untreated, elderly patients with DLBCL (Chiapella 
et al., 2013 ; Vitolo et al., 2014 ). 
 
Feldman et al . (2014 ) showed that combining LEN (at  doses up to 25 mg daily ) with RTX in 
combination with ICE ( R-ICE) was associated with promising clinica l activity , with no 
additional toxicologic al burden , in patients with R-R DLBCL.  
 
1.4  Overview of MOR 00208 
MOR00208  (synonym: XmAb®5574)  is an Fc -engineered mAb that binds to the human B -cell 
surface antigen CD19. MOR00208  possesses significantly increased  tumo ur cytotoxicity when 
compared with the parent al, non -engineered, murine 4G7 CD19 antibody. The increase d binding 
of MOR00208  to Fc gamma receptors (Fc γR), due to the engineered mutations , significantly 
enhances in vitro  ADCC, antibody -dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis ( ADCP ), and its direct 
cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on the tumo ur cells compared with the non-engineered  parent al 
murine antibody. MOR00208  has not been shown to mediate complement -dependent 
cytotoxicity  (CDC) . 
 
More specificall y, in preclinical studies, MOR00208  has been shown to significantly enhance in 
vitro  ADCC, ADCP, and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on CD19+ tumo ur cell line s 
spanning a broad range of human lymphomas and leukaemia s (Burkitt  lympho ma, CLL, hairy 
cell leukaemia  [HCL], CD19+ chroni c myeloid leukaemia  [CML], DLBCL  and acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia [ ALL ]), expressing levels of CD19 antigen ranging from 15,000 to 
105,000 molecules/cell. Similar effects were also noted in relation to  freshly isolated patient CLL 
or ALL cells and are also  expected to translate to primary NHL cells since the expression range 
reported for ALL and CLL B-cells covers the range observed for NHL B-cells ( Ginaldi et al., 
1998 ; Olejniczak et al., 2006 ). MOR00208  has also shown  superior efficacy  to its non -
engineered parent al antibody in relation to its ability to  induce a marked reduction in  tumo ur 
growth, inhibit tumour growth rate and increase surviv al in vivo  in xeno graft models of human 
lymphoma  in severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice (Investigator’s Brochure [IB]). 
 
The p harmacodynamic (PD) interactions of MOR00208  in combination with two standard -of-
care drugs fludarabine and bendamustine (BEN ), and one investigational drug, LEN  used in the 
treatment of patients with CLL and NHL, were investigated in a human  intravenous ( IV) 
lymphoma model in SCID mice  (see IB). In this orthotopic model for disseminated B -cell 
malignancies, the median survi val was superior for all of the groups receiving MOR00208 
combination therapy  (with fludarabine, BEN or lenalidomide)  when compared with the groups 
receiving MOR00208  monotherapy. The LEN  xenograft study showed a clear potentiation of 
the efficacy benefit of MOR00208 (3 mg/kg) and LEN  (100/200 mg/kg) combination therapy 
compared with the respective monotherapies (1 .5 x increase in median lifespan).  
 
Tissue cross -reactivity studies have sho wn that the pattern and distribution of MOR00208  
binding to cynomolgus monkey tissues closely parallel s those of human tissues. Flow cytometry 
experiments show MOR00208  binding to human and cynomolgus monkey B -cells, but not to the 
B-cells of other common laboratory species ( such as rat, mouse, rabbit and dog). Therefore,

systems, CD19+ human B -cell tumo ur xenograft models in SCID mice , and cynomolgus 
monkeys in vivo . In in vivo  studies in cynomolgus monkeys, MOR00208  was shown to induce 
B-lymphocyte depletion in peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen and inguinal lymph nodes. 
Cynomolgus monkeys were also judged to be the only relevant common laboratory species for 
toxicity studies.  
 
The results of s tudies evaluating  the pharmacokinetics  (PK) , PD and toxicity of MOR00208  in 
cynomolgus monkeys, are provided in the IB. The findings in four preclinical studies were  
limited to  the expected pharmacologic al effects of MOR0 0208 , with no reports of unanticipated 
toxicity.  
 
The four studies , all conducted  in cynomolgus monkeys  include d: a 26-week single 10 .0 mg/kg 
dose, PK, PD and toxicity study ; a 28-day single IV dose, dose -ranging (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0  mg/kg) 
PK/PD study ; a 29-day, single -dose (3.0 mg/kg)  study comparing MOR00208  with two other 
CD19 antibodies with different Fc regions ; and an  8-week toxicity study  in which MOR00208  
was administered IV every 2 weeks at a dose of 2.0, 10.0 or 50 .0 mg/kg for 8  consecutive weeks  
with a 90 -day recovery period. The aim of the latter Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant,  
multiple -dose toxicology study  was to support the use of MOR00208  in human clinical studies . 
Other than the expected dose -related decreases in B -lymphoc yte leve ls and cellularity in spleen  
tissues, there were no MOR00208 -related changes identified in ‘clinical observations ’, food 
consumption, body weight, electrocardiography, ophthalmology, urinalysis, coagulation, serum 
chemistry, and gross anatomic pathology at  doses up to 50 .0 mg/kg. In addition, GLP -compliant 
tissue cross -reactivity studies were performed on normal tissue panels from human and 
cynomolgus monkey donors. No specific staining of structures other than the expected 
mononuclear leu cocytes, lymphocyt es and h aematopoietic precursor cells was observed.

A Phase  1 Study of  mAb®5574 to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics 
in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  
 
The fir st study in humans was a phase I study  (now completed)  exploring the use of MOR00208  
(also known as XmAb®5574)  in adult patients diagnosed according to I nternational Workshop 
on CLL guidelines ( Hallek et al., 2008 ) with active, treatment -requiring , R-R CLL/SLL . The 
results of the study were reported by Woyach et al. (2014) . 
 
A total of  27 patients were treated with MOR00208  IV in 6 dose cohorts : 0.3 mg/kg  (n=1) , 
1.0 mg/kg (n=1), 3.0 mg/kg (n=3), 6.0  mg/kg  (n=3), 9.0 mg/kg (n=3)  and 12.0 mg/kg  (n=16)  on

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 31 of 110 four monthly doses of MOR00208  after completing the initial two 28-day cycle s of therapy , if 
there was no evidence of disease progression or intolerable drug -related toxicity.  
 
All 27 enrolle d patients received at least one dose of MOR00208 , with 22 patients receiving all 
nine of the planned initial doses.  Of the five patients who did not receive all nine doses, two 
experienced disease progression, one experienced a DLT ( grade 4 neutropenia  lasting at least 
7 days), one was omitted  from the study by the treating physician , and one completed the study 
but missed a dose due to an AE (grade 3 thrombocytopenia ). No patients had dose reductions 
during the study . Five patients had at least one dose delayed due to an  AE. Eighteen  patients had 
their infusion paused at least once  due to  an infusion -related  reaction  (IRR ). Eight patients were 
included in a maintenance cohort. One patient received only three additional infusions and the 
other seven patients received all four planned additional infusions.  
 
All 27 patients treated with MOR00208  experienced treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) and 
24 patients experienced TEAEs that were assessed by the investigator to be possibly or probably 
related to MOR002 08. No patient deaths were reported either on study or during the 12 -week 
follow -up phase of the study. One DLT, grade 4 neutropenia lasting at least 7 days, was observed 
during the study in one of 16 patients treated at the maximum -administered 12.0  mg/kg  dose 
level. Eight  treatment -emergent serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in six patients; one at the 0.3 
mg/kg dose level and seven  at the 12.0 mg/kg dose -level. Only two were considered to be related 
to the study drug: one of grade 3 febrile neutropenia in the same patient who experienced the 
DLT and one  of grade 3 tumour lysis syndrome  (TLS)  in a patient receiving his first dose of 
study drug at 12.0 mg/kg. In the latter case, after resolution of the SAE , the patient continued to 
receive additional doses of  MOR00208  without further complications. The six unrelated SAEs 
were two cases of pneumonia, sinusitis , acute otitis media and bacterial infection , all of them of 
grade 3 in severity  and one grade 1 rash . With a data cut-off date of 28 March 2013 , the most 
common TEAEs were IRR s in 66. 7% of patients, diarrhoea, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia 
(29.6% of patients each), anaemia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), hypoalbuminaemia, 
hypocalcaemia, insomnia and muscle spasms (22.2% of patients each) an d increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), headache, hyperglycaemia, pyrexia, rash and upper respiratory tract 
infection (18.5% of patients each).  
 
Twenty seven patients were evaluable for response . Blood disease cleared in the majority of 
patients, wit h a median reduction in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) from baseline of 90.8% 
and a decrease in CLL cell count. Based upon physical examination and laboratory studies alone, 
18 patients (66.7%) achieved a PR , while the remaining nine (33.3%) achieved stable disease 
(SD). Using computed tomography ( CT) criteria alongside examination and laboratory data, 
eight patients (29.6%) achieved a PR whil e an additional 16 patients (59.3%) achieved SD. Two 
patients had progressive disease according to CT criteria.  
 
Considering only those 16 patients who received the 12 mg/kg dose, 12 (75%) achieved a PR 
according to physical examination criteria while six (37.5%) achieved a PR according to CT 
criteria. Patients who responded according to physical examination criteria t ended to do so 
quickly, with 14 of 18 patients achieving a PR by the first response evaluation (C ycle 2, Day 1).

only, six (37.5%) a nd nine of 16 (56.3%) had best responses of PR and SD, respectively. The 
disease control r ate was 88.9% (8 PR, 16 SD) across  all cohorts , and 93.8% (6 PR, 9  SD) in the 
12 mg/kg cohort.  
 
At evaluation , 12 weeks post -Cycle 2 ( Day 28), five patients (18.5%) h ad progressed according 
to CT criteria and eight  (29.6%) according to physical examination criteria. No patient died 
during the observation period. PFS for all patients, including those in the extended treatment 
cohort, was 199 days (95% CI, 168 –299) and f or patients in the extended treatment cohort alone, 
PFS was 420 days (95% CI, 168 –not reached).  
 
The results of the first clinical study showed MOR00208  to have an acceptable safety profile as 
well as providing preliminary evidence of antitumour activity in patients with high -risk, heavily 
pretreated CLL.  Although IRRs were common , they were limited to grade 1/2. Since the MTD 
for MOR00208  was not establi shed, due to the occurrence of only one DLT in the 12.0  mg/kg 
dose cohort, th is dose of MOR00208  was selected for use in subsequent clinical studies . 
Promising antitumo ur activity of MOR00208 , combined with the absence of safety signal , 
justified movement to phase II.

 Safety of MOR00208   
MOR00208 has a novel mechanism of acti on that may have the potential to add to the care of 
patients with NHL. Based on the available data from the completed clinical study of MOR00208 
(Protocol XmAb®5574 -01), the preliminary data from the ongoing MOR208C201 clinical study, 
nonclinical studies and experiments, and literature data on CD19, the sponsor is of the opinion 
that the potential benefit of MOR00208 outweighs the potential risks. It is expected that the 
potential risks will be adequately controlled by the design of this study (e.g., by th e inclusion 
and exclusion criteria) and by frequent monitoring of potential adverse drug reactions throughout 
the entire study. Based on the results of the phase I clinical study of MOR00208 in patients with 
CLL/SLL (Woyach et al., 2014), and the prelimina ry results of the MOR208C201 and 
MOR208202 studies , the anticipated possible risks associated with administration of MOR00208 
to patients include the following  AEs (incidence > 4%) with a suspected relationship to 
MOR00208 treatment : 
 IRRs  (mostly Grade ½)  
 Febrile neutropenia  
 Neutropenia  
 Thrombocytopenia  
 Tumour lysis syndrome  
 Upper respiratory tract infections  
 Fatigue  
 Chills  
 Pyrexia  
 Nausea  
 Diarrhoea  
 Headache  
 Rash  
 Aspartate aminotransferase  (AST ) and alanine transaminase ( ALT ) increases . 
 
Since a major pharma cologic al effect of MOR00208 is B -cell depletion, the risks associated with 
the use of approved B -cell depleting therapeutics based on the labelling of other agents with 
similar effects should be considered. The anticipated possible risks include: B -cell d epletion, 
ALC  reduction, IRRs, TLS, neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, hepatitis B reactivation, progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy, mucocutaneous reactions and infections.  
 
The possible risks associated with the administration of MOR00208 are described  in detail in the 
MOR00208 IB.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 34 of 110 2 STUDY PURPOSE/RATION ALE 
Despite recent improvements in the management  of DLBCL, approximately 30–40% of patients 
with DLBCL treated with R -CHOP relapse following initial  immunochemotherapy  (Coiffier et 
al., 2002 ; Feugier et al., 2005 ; Sehn et al., 2005 ; Habermann et al., 2006 ; Pfreundschuh et al., 
2006 ). Although a significant number of patients with R-R aggressive NHL can be salvaged with 
HDC  and subsequent ASCT , the majority will succumb to the disease. Thus, the development of 
a more effective initial therapy in aggressive NHL is essential to improve lo ng-term outcomes . 
 
LEN has been  shown to have significant activity in relapse d aggressive B -cell NHL  either alone 
or in combination with immuno chemo thera peutic regimens . The mechanism of action of LEN  is 
complex and involves immune modulation , antiangiogenesis, modulation of the 
microenvironment and direct antitumo ur activity (Hasslet e t al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2005 ). 
 
As state d previously, t he effects of MOR00208 appear to involve ADCC, ADCP , and direct 
cytotoxic activity (apoptosis).  The B -lymphocyte lineage -specific surface antigen CD19 is the 
earliest and most broadly expressed of the selective B -cell markers, and is highly expressed on 
the malignant cells of most patients with B -cell NHL. As a consequence, it can be envisaged that 
a CD19 antibody may have clinical utility as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of 
patien ts with B-cell malignancies . This hypothesis is supported by the preliminary results of 
ongoing clinical studies involving various CD19 -targeting mAbs ( Topp el al., 2012 ; Raufi et al., 
2013 ; Goswami et al., 2012 ) and the approval of blinatumomab for the treatment of patients with 
Philadelphia chromosome -negative, R-R B-cell ALL . 
 
As RTX -based regimens have become standard first -line treatment in DLBCL, the efficacy of 
RTX combined w ith chemotherapy in the second -line setting has decreased and there is a need 
for new therapies in patients progressing or relapsing after first - or second -line RTX -based 
treatment . It is anticipated that by using MOR00208  instead of RTX , it might be possi ble to  
partially overcome the RTX resistance in R-R NHL , improving ORRs  and OS. D ata from a phase 
I study in patients with R-R CLL/SLL (Woyach et al., 2014 ) and an ongoing phase IIa study in 
patients with R-R B-cell NHL previously treated with RTX demonstrate that MOR00208  is well -
tolerated , with a potential clinical benefit in patients with R-R DLBCL (Blum et al., 2014 ). 
 
MOR00208  and LEN, both as single agents  and in combination show ant ileuk aemic and 
antilymphoma activity in vivo  and in vitro . The p attern of AEs is different. Recent data 
demonstrate that t he modulation of immunoeffector cells by LEN enhance s the NK -mediated 
ADCC exerted by MOR00208 , increas ing cancer cell killing compared with that seen with the 
single drugs  (Awan et al ., 2010 ). It seems justified to assume that this effect may be especially 
evident during chronic administration of LEN . 
 
Since the MTD for MOR00208 was not  established during  the course of the previous studies  the 
12.0 mg/kg dose of MOR00208 was selected for use in subsequent clinical studies .

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 35 of 110 The LEN starting dose is primarily based on a review of published data and the recommendation s 
of expert clinicians. The published studies indicate a consistent, manageable and comparable 
(between studies ) toxicity profile for patients with DLBCL beginning treatment with LEN, 25 
mg daily (Wiernik et al., 2008 ; Witzig et al., 2011 ), or a combination of 20 –25 mg LEN with 
RTX (Zinzani et al ., 2011 ; Wang et al., 2013 ; Ivanov et al., 2014 ) or R-CHOP (Nowakowski et 
al., 2011 ; Nowakowski et al., 2015 ; Vitolo et al., 2013 ). In the light of the available evidence , 
expert clinicians who were consulted thought a n efficacious dose  of LEN  to be in the range of 
20–25 mg in patients with R-R DLBCL.  
 
As a result, Morpho Sys de signed MOR208 C203 as an open -label, single -arm prospective phase 
II study investigating  the safety, antitumo ur activity and preliminary efficacy of LEN in 
combination with MOR00208  in adult patients with R-R DLBCL who are not candidates for 
ASCT. The study will consist of two parts, which will be performed sequentially. The first part 
of the study (safety run -in) will conclude with an evaluation of safety data. The ou tcome of this 
evaluation will provide a recommendation for the LEN starting dose to be used in the  following  
part of the study. The starting dose is 25 mg LEN daily on Days 1 –21 of each 28 -day cycle 
followed by a step -wise dose de -escalation if not tolerated.  
 
In this study , several correlative analyses may be conducted ; for example , biomarkers that could 
be predictive of response to this therapeutic combination may be assessed. These markers may 
be genetic in nature , cellular , or protein -based and a range of laboratory methodologies may be 
used for their evaluation and possible quantitation. When relevant, the markers can be evaluated 
in the context of PK and clinical response analyses.

5.1 Study Design  
 Protocol -specific definitions  
For the purposes of this protocol, primary refractory disease  is defined as  a disease progressing 
in the course of the first line treatment as per International Working Group response criteria 
(Cheson et al ., 2007 ), and / or, showing a response of less than a PR to first -line treatment or 
disease recurrence/progression within < 6 months from the completion of first -line therapy.  
 
Disease refractory to last treatment  is def ined as having had less than a partial response to the 
most recently administered systemic therapy.  
 
Relapsed/progressive/recurrent disease  reflects the appearance of any new lesions or increase 
by ≥50% of previously involved sites from nadir according to the International Working Group 
response criteria ( Cheson et al ., 2007 ) after the most recent systemic therapy.  
 
 Description of study design  
This is a single -arm, multicentre, open -label phase II, study of LEN  combined with MOR00208  
in adult patients with DLBCL who have relapsed after or are refractory to at least one, but no 
more than three previous systemic regimens administered for the treatment of their DLBCL  and 
who are not candidates for HDC and subsequent ASCT  and are  thus considered to have  
exhausted their therapeutic options for demonstrable clinical benefit.  One prior therapy line must 
include an anti -CD20 targeted therapy (e.g. , RTX).  
 
Patients with primary refractory DLBCL or, patients with known "double/triple hit" DLBCL 
genetics or those who have undergone previous allogenic stem cell transplantation are not 
eligible for study participation. Additionally patients with a history of ASCT ≤3 months prior to 
the requirement to provide signed informed consent cannot be included in the study.  
 
This study will consist of two parts, which wi ll be performed sequentially. During  the c ourse of 
the first part , six patients will be enrolled in the study and will complete the first cycle of study 
treatment. Once the sixth patient in the cohort has comple ted Cycle 1 Day 22 visit, a Safety 
Review Panel which consists of the sponsor, a representative of the participating investigators 
and two independent expert clinical haematologist  will perform a clinical safety review based on 
the number and type of AEs o ccurring during the first cycle and on laboratory values 
(biochemistry and haematology). A LEN dose will be considered tolerated or in need of 
reduction  after discussion of these data between the sponsor’s Clinical Program Leader  (or 
designee) , the sponsor’s Drug Safety  Officer  (or designee) , a representative of the participating 
investigators  and two expert clinic al haematologists who are not participating in the study . The 
second part of the study will only be open ed for enrolment by the sponsor following the outcome 
of this  discussion .

MOR00208 dose:  12 mg/kg  
For the first 3 cycles  (Cycles  1-3) of the study each cycle will consist of a MOR00208 infusion 
on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Day 22 of the cycle. Additionally a loading dose will be 
administered on Day 4 of Cycle 1. Thereafter MOR00208 will be administere d on a bi -weekly 
(every 14  days) basis with infusions on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28 -day cycle.  
 
MOR00208 can be administered  until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity or 
discontinuation for any other reason, whichever comes first . It is up to the investigator to decide , 
according to the individual risk/benefit ratio , if the patient should continue on MOR00208 in 
spite  of disease progression  (refer to Section  7.2.3 ). 
 
LEN:  
Patients will self -administer a starting dose of 25 mg oral LEN  daily on Days 1 –21 of each cycle. 
Treatment with LEN may be modified in a de -escalating fashion or discontinued based upon 
clinical and laboratory findings. Detailed dose modification guidelines to manage h aematologic 
and/or other toxicities are provided in the respective sections of the protocol . 
 
LEN  can be given  for up to 12 cycles in total . 
 
Treatment with LEN will have to be stopped i n case of disease progression , or unacceptable 
toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason, whichever comes first . 
 
Objective disease response assessments will be made according to the revised response criteria 
based on the guidelines of the International Working Group ( IWG ) reported by Cheson et al. 
(2007) . The data used for the primary statistical analyses will be derived from a central

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 39 of 110 independent review of the radiological + clinical disease assessments . A charter  outlining the 
central imaging plus clinical assessment will be prepared . 
 
Approximately 80 patients with R -R DLBCL who meet the inclusion criteria and have none of 
the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. This study will be conducted under a United 
States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) application.  
 
5.2 Safety Run -in 
As the combination of MOR00208 with LEN has not previously been evaluated in a clinical 
study , an evaluation of safety data will occur after the first 6 patients have been accrued at the 
starting dose level of 25 mg LEN daily and 12 mg/kg MOR00208  Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 with an 
additional loading dose on Day 4 of Cycle 1 . 
 
To enable the assessment o f individual safety parameter s by the investigators these patients will 
be enrolled sequentially with a 48 hours lag period between enro lment (same as start of treatment 
with study drugs , or Cycle 1 Day 1 Visit ) of two consecutive  patients. A ccrual will be  held until 
all patients have been followed for one treatment  cycle. Once the sixth patient in the cohort has 
completed the Cycle 1 Day 22 visit, an evaluation based on the number and type of AEs occurring 
during the first cycle and laboratory values (biochemistry and haematology) will be performed 
by the sponsor’s Clinical Program Leader (or designee), the sponsor’s Drug Safety Officer (or 
designee), a representative of the participating investigators, and two expert clinical 
haematologists who are no t participating in the study. The second part of the study will only be 
opened for enrolment by the sponsor following the outcome of this discussion.  
 
The outcome of this safety run -in evaluation will provide a recommendation on the starting dose 
of LEN to be used in the following part of the study.  Patients involved in the safety run -in will 
continue the study as per protocol.  
 
5.3 Study Duration  
 Study Conduct  
The study duration per patient will be at least 5 years  including periods of screening (up to 28 
days from signature of the Informed Consent Form (ICF), the treatment period ( maximum 12 
cycles for LEN  + MOR00208 followed by MOR00208 monotherapy thereafter ) and the survival 
follow -up phase.  MOR00208 can be administered until disease progression as describe d in 
Section 5.1.2 .  
 
The survival follow -up phase begins with the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit  (Section  7.2.2 ). 
Patients will have an on -site safety evaluation visit 30 -days after last administration of study 
treatment (LEN + MOR208 combination or either LEN or MOR208 if one of these two drugs 
was discontinued earlier) (30 -Day Follow -up Visit). All patients  discontin ued for any reason 
other than withdrawal of consent, or death, will be contacted every 90 days by phone from the 
date of the 30 -Day (Safety) Follow -up Visit  until end of study , or until withdrawal of consent, 
or death, whichever comes first.

 End of Study  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient completing 5 years 
study duration.  If any patient is on treatment at the end of the study and MOR00208 is not yet 
commercially available , patients will be switched to altern ative methods of supply with 
MOR00208, upon assessment of a clinical benefit of continued treatment by the investigator, 
and in accordance with the local regu latory guidance. Upon study closure, MorphoSys will notify 
the applicable regulatory agencies in a ccordance with local requirements.

Product Name: MOR00208   Protocol Number: MOR208C203  
Date: 24 February 2021  IND Number: 114,856  
Protocol Amendment 5, Final Version 8.0  EudraCT Number: 2014 -004688 -19 
 
MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 44 of 110  the patient has already consented and met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria and his or her enrolment was delayed due to an unexpected change in the  patient’s 
personal situation (e.g. , family issues)  
 the patient previously failed to be eligible due to any event (e.g. , planned surgery, 
laboratory test result) that has been resolved  
 the patient previously failed screening but has become eligible for the  study based on a 
change in the inclusion and exclusion criteria as the result of a protocol amendment . 
 the patient failed screening due to non -progressed / non -relapsed disease at the time of 
screening and is later clinically diagnosed as having progresse d / relapsed.  
 
A patient should only be rescreened if there is a clear indication that the patient may be eligible 
according to the currently valid study protocol.  
 
In cases  where previous screening activities were discontinued and enrolment did not occur,  the 
following procedures should be implemented:  
 the patient must sign and date a new informed consent form ( ICF) as part of the 
re-screening procedure  
 the eligible patient will receive a new unique identification number via the interactive 
response technology  
 a new elect ronic case report form ( eCRF ) should  be completed  
 the patient will be documented as rescreened in the source documents  
 all screening procedures must be completed again.  
 
A rescreened patient can be enrolled, if all of the current inclusion criteria are met and none of 
the exclusion criteria are met.  
 
6 STUDY TREATMENTS  AND CONCOMITANT DRU GS 
Each investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study drugs and other study 
materials from the sponsor and other drugs from the appropriate suppliers are correctly received, 
recorded, handled and stored safely and properly in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
guidelines, and used in accordance with this protocol. The investigator can delegate these tasks 
to another person ( according to the local laws and regulations). Drug accountability forms will 
be kept by each site participating in the study and will be checked during monitoring visits.  
 
Study drug must be handled and/or prepared as described in the Drug Preparation Manu al, the 
IB for MOR00208, and other safety -relevant documents (e.g. , Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC ) for the European Medicines Agency [EMA] or the Prescribing Information 
[US FDA] for LEN)  (see Appendix_C ). 
 
6.1 MOR00208  
MOR00208 will be centrally supplied. MOR00208 drug product (DP) must be stored under 
refrigeration at 2° C to 8° C in its original package in an appropriate storage facility accessible 
only to the pharmacist(s), the investigator, or a duly designated perso n. 
 
Product Name: MOR00208   Protocol Number: MOR208C203

Protocol Amendment 5, Final Version 8.0  EudraCT Number: 2014 -004688 -19 
 
MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 45 of 110 MOR00208 DP  is a yellowish lyophilisate supplied in single -use 20 mL glass vials. Each vial 
contains 200  mg of MOR00208 for reconstitution with 5  mL water for injection (WFI). 
Reconstitution yields 40  mg/mL MOR00208 in 25  mM sodium citrate, 200  mM treh alose and 
0.02% (w/v) polysorbate  20 at pH  6.0. Each product vial is intended to deliver 200  mg of 
MOR00208 in 5 ml of reconstituted solution. The solution after reconstitution is colourless to 
slightly yellow and essentially free of foreign particles; it may contain a few white to whitish 
product -related particles.  
 
For administration, MOR00208 will be diluted into a commercially available 250  mL infusion 
container with 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride for injection.  
 
MOR00208  will be administered IV at a dose o f 12.0 mg/kg .  
 
For the first 3 cycles  (Cycles  1-3) of the study , each cycle will consist of a MOR00208 infusion 
on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Day 22 of the cycle. Additionally a loading dose will be 
administered on Day 4 of Cycle 1. Thereafter MOR00208 will  be administere d on a bi -weekly 
(every 14  days) basis with infusions on Day s 1 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle.  
 
 
The individual MOR00208 infusion will be prepared under aseptic conditions and administered 
at the study site, according to the directions of the sponsor, which will be provided in a Drug 
Preparation Manual. In general, a vial of MOR00208 must be used as soon as possibl e after 
reconstitution with WFI. After dilution for infusion, administration of MOR00208 should take 
place as soon as possible. Maximum allowed storage times and conditions will be detailed in the 
Drug Preparation Manual.  
 
The preferred procedure for destruction is for all IMPs (including used, partially used, not 
expired unused and expired unused vials, blisters, boxes or bottles)  to be returned to the Drug 
Depot for destruction.  
 
In case the site is requesting formal approval for destruction of the IMP on site due to local 
requirements, the local destruction requirements for IMPs described in detail in the Drug 
Preparation Manual must be fulfilled.  
 
For the first infusion, the IV infusion rate should be 70 mL/h for the first 30 minutes and 
subsequently increased to a rate of 125 mL/h; the total infusion duration should ideally not 
exceed 2.5 hours. All subsequent MOR00208 infusions  will be administered IV at a constant rate 
of 125 mL/h over a 2 -hour period. MOR00208 should NOT be administered as an IV push or 
bolus.  
 
The infusion rate escalation schedules in this protocol and the Drug Preparation Manual are 
recommendations only. If required, the investigator should use clinical judgement to optimise 
patient safety by administering the infusion more slowly.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 46 of 110 6.2 Lenalidomide  (LEN)  
Patients will self -administer a starting dose of 25 mg oral LEN  daily on Days 1 –21 of each cycle. 
Treatment w ith LEN may be modified in a de -escalating fashion or discontinued based upon 
clinical and laboratory findings. Detailed dose modification guidelines to manage 
haematologic al and/or other toxicities are provided in the respective sections of the protocol.  
 
LEN will be obtained from a commercial sourc e as capsules in various dose strengths for oral 
administration as will be outlined in the Drug Preparation Manual. If applicable , LEN will be 
labelled as per local regulations. Investigators must be registered through the Lenalidomide 
programme, as applicable in their countries (e .g., REVLIMID REMS™ program me in the US, 
T-register in Germany).  Patients must be counselled on  the reproductive risks associated with 
LEN , prior to enrolment and monthly, during therapy.  
 
6.3 Treatment with Study Drugs  
Treatment consisting of LEN  and MOR00208  combination will be  administered  up to twelve  
28-day cycles at specified dose levels as scheduled until disease progression, unacceptable  
toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason, whichever comes first.  
 
LEN  can be given  for up to 12 cycles in total. Treatment with LEN will have to be stopped after 
disease progression.  On days when both study drugs are given together, LEN should be  
administered prior to MOR00208.  
 
MOR00208  can be administered at the dose and schedule described in Section 6.1 above, until 
disease progression , unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason, whichever 
comes first . 
 
It is up to the investigator to decide according to the individual ri sk/benefit ratio if the patient 
should further continue on MOR00208 in case of disease progression , after discussion with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  or designee . For patients who will be administered MOR 00208 
despite progression of disease / relapse, an Unscheduled Visit  including all protocol prescribed 
procedures for the EOT Visit  (except the PK sample and the anti -MOR00208 antibody sample)  
need to be performed in order to capture the event (i.e. disease progression/relapse) for the 
antibody treatment to continue further  (Table 5). In such cases an EOT Visit  will take place after 
these patients have fi nally stopped receiving the antibody. And lastly, a Safety Follow -Up will 
take place 30-Days after last administration of MOR00208.  
 
For patients receiving antibody treatment despite disease recurrence/progression, before the 
administration of MOR00208 , blood parameters (h aematology, serum chemistry) should be 
evaluated in the local lab according to local guidelines/standards of local medical practice for 
the administration of monoclonal antibodies. A urine pregnancy test should be performed for 
women of childbearing potential. Vital signs should be measured according to local practice for 
the administration of monoclonal antibodies . For this patient population only the antineoplastic 
therapy after the end of study drug combination treatment and AEs need to be captured in eCRF.  
Other procedures described in the column “MOR00208 Additional Treatment” in  Table  5 will 
not apply for this patient population.

6.4 Pre-Medication for MOR00208 Infusions  
IRRs have commonly been reported for patients with CLL or NHL treated with MOR00208.  
 
It is suggested that t he pre-medication is administered between 30 minutes and 2 hours prior to 
the MOR00208 infusions . 
 
The pre -medication may include the following:  
 antipyretics (e.g. , acetaminophen [paracetamol] 1000 mg per dose per mouth [p.o.] or IV 
or equivalent)  
 histamine H 1 receptor blockers (e.g. , diphe nhydramine 25 –50 mg per dose IV or 
equivalent)  
 histamine H 2 receptor blockers (e.g., cimetidine 300 mg p.o., ranitidine 150 mg tablet 
p.o. or equivalent)  
 glucocortico steroids (methylprednisolone 80 –120 mg per dose  IV or equivalent - please 
refer to  Appendix_D ) 
 meperidine (25 mg per dose p.o. or IV) may be added as required for rigors or chills.  
 
The investigator may repeat doses of individual agents as required and use other agents, doses 
and/or formulations in accordance with institutional guidelines. Equivalence for premedications 
includes variations to the stated dose due to the formulations av ailable locally. Any 
premedication given should be reported in the eCRF.  
 
Premedication for patients who do not experience any IRRs to MOR00208 during the first 
3 infusions (doses) will be optional for subsequent infusions at the discretion of the investigator. 
Otherwise, the premedication should be continued for subsequent administrations.  
 
6.5 Patient Monitoring During MOR00208 Infusion  
Vital signs should be measured as outlined in  Section  7.2.8 . All supportive measures consistent 
with optimal patient care will be provided throughout the study according to institution 
standards.  
 
Precautions for anaphylaxis should be observed during MOR00208 administration. Emergency 
resuscitation equipment and medications should be readily available. Additional supportive 
measures should also be available and may include, but are not limited to , epinephrine, 
antihistamines, corticosteroids, IV fluids, vasopre ssors, oxygen, bronchodilators, 
diphenhydramine, a nd acetaminophen (paracetamol).  
 
6.6 Criteria for Dose Modifications and Drug Discontinuation

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 49 of 110 6.6.1.1  Grade 2 IRRs  
If a patient presents with a grade  2 infusion reaction:  
 the infusio n should be stopped immediately  
 the patient should receive appropriate further treatment with an antihistamine and/or 
acetaminophen (paracetamol) or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) if clinically 
indicated  
 once the symptoms have been resolved or reduced to “mild” according to investigator 
assessment, the infusion can be continued at an infusion rate of 50%. If, after one hour, 
the patient’s symptoms do not return and vital signs are stable, the infusion rate may be 
increased every 30 minutes, as tolerated , to the baseline rate.  
 
If a patient who developed a grade  1 or 2 IRR receives further infusions, then premedication 
should be given before all subsequent infusions of MOR00208.  
 
6.6.1.2  Grade 3 IRRs  
If a patient presents with a grade  3 IRR:  
 the infusion should b e stopped immediately  
 the patient must  receive appropriate treatment with an antihistamine and/or 
acetaminophen (paracetamol) or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) and, if necessary, 
further medications (i.e. epinephrine, bronchodilator)  
 a blood sample for  cytokine analysis should be obtained during the event and 
approximately 24 hours later  
 only after the complete resolution of all symptoms (to ≤grade 1), and after having 
received appropriate prophylactic medication(s) as described above, the infusion may be 
resumed at an infusion rate of 25%. If, after 1 hour, the patient’s symptoms do not return 
and vital signs are stable, the infusion rate may be increased to a maximum of 50%  
 if, after the resumption of the infusion, symptoms return (irrespective of grad e), the 
infusion must be stopped immediately and the infusion tubing should be disconnected 
from the patient.  
 
Based on the investigator’s decision the patient may receive further MOR00208 provided 
clinically appropriate precautions were undertaken.  The patient  may continue treatment with 
LEN . 
 
6.6.1.3  Grade 4 IRRs  
If a patient presents with a grade  4 IRR:  
 the infusion should be stopped immediately and the infusion tubing should be 
disconnected from the patient  
 the patient should receive appropriate treatment with an antihistamine and/or 
acetaminophen (paracetamol) or methylprednisolone (or equivalent) and, if necessary, 
further medications (i.e. epinephrine, bronchodilator)

The patient must not receive further MOR00208, but may continue trea tment with LEN as per 
protocol.  
 
 Management of Toxicities  
The next cycle of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 if:  
 ANC is ≥1.000/mm3 (unless neutropenia is due  to infiltration of bone marrow)  
 Platelets  ≥50000/mm3 (unless thrombocytopenia is due to infiltration of bone marrow, 
patient may have received transfusion) and absence of active bleeding  
 No serious organ or other toxicity present . 
 
If, based on medical ju dgment, the treating physician considers a change in laboratory parameter 
or AE not to be a study drug -related toxicity, but to represent a natural fluctuation in or 
progression of the underlying disease, then it is at the physician’s discretion and assess ment of 
the individual risk/benefit ratio to determine whether the patient should be dosed. The decision 
and rationale behind the decision should be  documented in the source data.  
 
If the above  conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cycle, the subject will be evaluated once 
every seven days and a new cycle will not initiated until the toxicity has resolved as described 
above. Specific course of action for a given toxicity occurring in the cour se of the tre atment cycle 
is described below.  
 
If treatment needs to be interrupted for ≤28 days for the same study drug s-related toxicity, the 
patient’s treatment should continue, depending on the duration of treatment interruption, at the 
next protocol s cheduled visit. No missed visits or doses of either drug should be made up.  
 
If treatment with one study drug needs to be interrupted for >28 days for the same, persistent, 
drug-related toxicity, the study drug judged by the investigator to have caused the  toxicity should 
be discontinued and the patient should continue to be dosed with the oth er study drug, as per 
protocol.  
 
If treatment with both study drugs needs to be interrupted for >28 days for the same persistent 
study drug -related toxicity, judged by  the investigator to be related to both study drugs (LEN 
and MOR00208), then the End of Treatment Visit will be performed and the patient will enter 
the follow -up phase ( see Secti on 5.3.1 ). 
 
6.6.2.1  Haematological and Other Toxici ties 
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE v4.0 used as  a guide for 
grading  severity. The dose of study drug(s) for each patient will be interrupted and/or modified 
following toxicity as described below. Refer to Table 2 and Table 3 for instructions on dosing 
interruptions/modifications and Table 4 for LEN dose reduction instructions.  
 
Guid ance on managing specific toxicities is summarised in  Table 2 and Table 3.

*If, based on medical judgment, the treating physician considers a laboratory parameter change or AE not to be a study drug -
related toxicity, but to represent a natural fluctuation in or progression of the underlying disease, then it is at the physi cian’s 
discretion and assessment of the individual risk/benefit ratio to determine whether the patient should be dosed. The decision and 
rationale behind the decision should be documented in the source data.

6.6.2.2   LEN Dose Reduction Guidelines  
General rules  
If LEN dosing was halted during the previous cycle and was restarted with a one -level dose 
reduction without requiring an interruption for the remainder of the cycle, then that reduced d ose 
level will be initiated on D ay 1 of the new cycle. There will be no more than one dose reduction 
from one cycle to the next.  Once a patient’s LEN dose has been reduced, no dose re -escalation 
is permitted.  
 
Specific LEN dose reduction guidelines  
The daily oral dose of LEN may be reduced successively by one level from the starting dose of 
25 m g daily on Days 1 –21 every 28 days ( Table 4). 
 
Table 4 LEN Dose Reduction Guidelines  
Starting dose  25 mg da ily on Days 1 –21, every 28 days  
Dose Level - 1 20 mg da ily on Days 1 –21, every 28 days  
Dose Level - 2 15 mg daily on Days 1 –21, every 28 days  
Dose Level - 3 10 mg daily on Days 1 –21, every 28 days  
Dose Level - 4 5 mg daily on Days 1 –21, every 28 days  
 
Patients who cannot tolerate Dose Level - 4 are to be discontinued from LEN treatment in the 
study but should continue therapy with MOR00208 alone.  
 
Additional information  
The most up-to-date information regarding constitution, dosing and most frequent AEs related 
to the administration of LEN and MOR00208  are contained in the SmPC (EMA), Prescribing 
Information (US FDA) and t he current MOR00208 IB, respectively  (see Appendix_C ). Dose 
reductions for MOR00208 are not allowed during  the course of the study.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 54 of 110 6.6.2.3  Tumour Flare with LEN  
Patients in this study should be monitored for tumour flare (TFR). TFR is defined as a sudden 
and tender increase in the size of the disease bearing sites, including the lymph nodes, spleen 
and/or the liver , often accompanied by low -grade fever, non -prurit ic diffuse rash and in some 
cases, an increase in the peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. TFR is an expected toxicity with 
LEN, especially in patients with a high tumour burden and may mimic disease progression. 
Therefore, careful monitoring and evaluation  is important prior to discontinuing a study patient 
for progressive disease in the initial cycles of LEN therapy. There are currently no laboratory or 
radiological tests to help distinguish TFR from progressive disease . The distinction should be 
made on c linical grounds, incorporating observations such as associated physical findings, 
laboratory findings, and pace of disease before and after the initiation of treatment. TFR should 
be recorded as an AE of interest (graded using the NCI -CTCAE 4.0 criteria) a nd not as 
progressive disease . 
 
Treatment of TFR is at the discretion of the investigator and dependent on the severity, clinical 
situation and institutional standards.  
 
6.6.2.4  Tumour Lysis Syndrome  
TLS results from the rapid breakdown of tumour cells and the release of their intracellular 
content in to the circulation resulting  in metabolic derangements that can lead to acute renal 
failure and other life -threatening complications. The onset of TLS is rapid, usually within 24 -48 
hours of receipt of  the first dose of anticancer medication , but can also occur after the first week 
of treatment. Bulky disease, moderate renal insufficiency, a high number of circulating 
lymphoma cells and high uric acid level s (>8 mg/dL) prior to therapy, increase the likelihood of 
TLS. Early identification of patients at risk and the prevention of TLS development with the 
initiation of preventive measures as well as the careful monitoring for early signs of laboratory 
assessm ents consistent with TLS and the prompt initiation of supportive care are critical to the 
prevention of potentially life -threatening metabolic derangements.  
 
Medical prophylaxis and management should be initiated according to the institutional standard 
of care at the investigator’s discretion.  
 
6.6.2.5  Thromboembolism  
LEN increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk of thrombosis. High 
risk is defined, for example, as a history of a thromboembolic event and/or taking a concomitant 
medica tion assoc iated with an increased risk of  a thromboembolic event and/or a known 
hypercoagulable state, regardless of thromboembolic history. It is recommended that patients 
receive adequate anticoagulation therapy according to the institutional standards a nd 
investigator’s discretion. It should be tailored to the patient’s individual risk/benefit profile by 
taking into account the individual thrombotic and bleeding risk, and the quality of compliance 
with venous thromboembolic event ( VTE ) prophylaxis. Antic oagulants may include 
acetylsalicylic acid (e.g. , aspirin) prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin, warfarin or new 
oral anticoagulants ( NOAKs , e.g., dabigatran, rivaroxaban).

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 55 of 110 6.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 
Administration and Recording of Prior and Concomitant Therapy – General I nstructions  
Any prior, concomitant, or procedural medications or therapy given to or taken by the patient 
within 1  month prior to commencement of  the study  (30 days prior to signing the ICF)  and up to 
the End of Treatment Vis it (EOT)  must be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF along 
with the indication , route  and dosage. Such medications (including over -the-counter 
medications) must be listed on the concomitant medications form in the eCRF. Starting from the 
EOT Visit, only anticancer treatments and, in case of an AE, other relevant concomitant 
medications (at the discretion of the investigator) should be entered.  The investigator should 
instruct the patient not to take any additional medications (including over -theco unter --products) 
during the study without prior consultation.  
 
For patients who will be administered MOR208 despite progression of disease / relapse, an 
Unscheduled  Visit  including all procedures described for EOT Visit  need to be performed in 
order to cap ture the event (i.e. disease progression/relapse) for the antibody treatment to continue 
further.  
 
At the EOT visit  (or at the Unscheduled Visit after disease progression / relapse) as described in 
the above paragraph) , any antineoplastic therapy after end  of study drug treatment must be 
recorded as well.  
 
Patients may receive concomitant medications that are medically indicated as standard care for 
the treatment of symptoms, AEs, and intercurrent illnesses. Medications to treat concomitant 
diseases like diabetes, hypertension, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) etc., are allowed. Patients will also receive therapy to mitigate side effects of the study 
medication as clinically indicated, as well as best supportive care (BSC) as per institutional 
guidelines. This may include, but is not limited to, antiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, anticholinergics, 
antispasmodics, antipyretics, antihistamines, analgesics, antibiotics, and other medications 
intended to treat symptoms.  
 
Recording  of Pr ior L ines of Anti-lymphoma Therapy  
Information should be provided on any previous DLBCLspecific - therapies since the time point 
of the first diagnosis of DLBCL. The generic or the trade name may be recorded.  
To be come eligible for the MOR208C203  study the patients must have received at least one, but 
no more than three previous systemic therapy lines for the treatment of DLBCL and at least one 
therapy line must have included a CD20 -targeted therapy (e.g. , RTX).  
 
Planned consol idation of responding patients,  i.e. by radiotherapy or second line regimens with 
or without ASCT is regarded as one therapy line. Changing to a different chemotherapy regimen 
is regarded as a separate line of therapy, unless  the change was caused by toxicity of the 
employed regimen.  
 
Product Name: MOR00208   Protocol Number: MOR208C203

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 56 of 110 Radiotherapy of the involved site (limited field radiotherapy) or radiation pre -planned to occur 
at the conclusion of systemic cytotoxic therapy will not be considered a separate prior line of 
therapy.  
 
The administration of a mAb alone with a curative/ther apeutic intent (e.g. , RTX monotherapy) 
counts as a separate line of therapy. On the other hand the addition of a mAb to chemotherapy 
or mAb maintenance treatment subsequent to chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy regimen is 
considered one treatment therapy line , provided that the mAb was part of the initial treatment 
plan.  
 
As for the ASCT, the induction, consolidation, stem cell collection, preparative regimen 
including transplantation, and maintenance will be considered a single line of therapy.  
 
Growth Factors  
Growth factors may be prescribed during the  treatment and follow -up periods at the 
investigator’s discretion, according to institutional standards. Growth factors or platelet 
transfusions should not be administered during the screening period solel y for the purpose of 
improving a patient’s blood values in order to meet eligibility criteria.  
 
Infection Prophylaxis and Vaccines  
Live vaccines must not be administered to patients in this study. Killed, inactivated vaccines, 
such as an injectable annual influenza vaccine, are permitted. Investigators should follow 
institutional guidelines concerning infection chemoprophylaxis for patients regarded to be at 
high risk for infection . 
 
Anticancer Therapies  
Patients should not have received a CD20 -targeted the rapy,  chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
investigational anticancer therapy or other lymphomaspecific - therapy within 14 days prior to 
Cycle 1 day 1 of the study. In addition, no radiotherapy (including limited field radiotherapy) is 
permitted after the baseline PET/CT scan for initial disease assessment has been performed. 
Other than the study drugs, patients should not receive any other DLBCLspecific - therapy during 
the study treatment period. The patient should not receive any investigational agent other than 
MOR00208 and LEN during the treatment period of the study.  
 
The use of conc urrent antineoplastic therapies  other than study drugs, including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapies, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, biological response modifiers, mAbs 
with or wi thout conjugation, radioisotopic therapies, stem cell transplant and targeted small 
molecules are not permitted during the entire treatment period (i.e., prior to disease progression 
during this study ) of this study. After disease progression has been recorded , additional 
antineoplastic therapies are permitted at the discretion of the investigator and in accordance with 
the local guidelines and should be recorded in the eCRF.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 57 of 110 Systemic Glucocorticosteroids  
The use of systemic glucorticosteroids is gener ally discouraged because their potential 
antilymphoma activity in patients with DLBCL may confound interpretation of antitumor effects 
mediated by study drug treatment (MOR00208 and LEN).  
 
However systemic corticosteroids in doses up to 20 mg/day prednison e or equivalent (i.e. 
equipotent corticosteroid) are permitted, provided the dosing is stable (not increased within the 
last month), but only for the treatment of non -neoplastic comorbid indications (e.g, rheumatoid 
arthritis).  
 
- Screening:  
Patients may potentially receive systemic glucorticosteroids in doses above 20 mg/day 
(prednisone or equivalent) to manage severe DLBCL manifestations (e.g. , compressive disease, 
rapidly progressing symptomatic adenopathy) during Screening as per institutional standards. 
For these patients the glucorticosteroids treatment needs to be tapered to a total daily dosage of 
20 mg or less of prednisone or its equival ent prior to study drug(s) administration on Cycle 1, 
Day 1.  
 
-Cycle 1 through EOT visit : 
Systemic  glucocorticosteroids in doses above 20 mg/day (prednisone or  equivalent) are not 
allowed during Cycle 1 through EOT visit , with the exceptions of premedicati on, cytokine 
release syndrome treatment at any time. Additionally, systemic doses above 20 mg/day 
(prednisone or equivalent;  please refer to  Appendix_D ) will be allowed for antiemetic 
prophylaxis for up to 24 hours.  
 
In the event a patient experiences an exacerbation of a chronic non -neoplastic condition such as 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial asthma or rheumatoid arthritis, peak 
doses above 20 mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) may be allowed for a lim ited period of time; 
the glucocorticosteroid dosage and the allowable treatment period will be determined by the 
investigator on a case -by-case basis following agreement with the medical monitor of the study. 
The specified systemic glucocorticosteroid use at a daily dose above 20 mg, if short in duration, 
is not likely to confound the treatment effect and efficacy analysis.  
 
Similarly, patients who develop severe or life -threatening conditions that may be alleviated by 
systemic glucocorticosteroid (e.g. , adrenal insufficiency) therapy are permitted to receive such 
drugs and are not required to discontinue study participation.  
 
The investigator should aim to discuss the systemic usage of glucocorticosteroids  in doses above 
20 mg/day (prednisone or  equivalent)  with the medical monitor of the study prior to the 
implementation.  
 
Immunosuppressive therapies other than systemic glucocorticosteroids as described are not 
permitted.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 58 of 110 -Other Provisions on Glucocorticosteroids : 
Single dose, topical, intranasal, inhaled eye drops or local injections (e.g. , intra-articular) 
containing corticosteroids are permitted during study participation.  
 
Concomitant Therapies that May Increase the Risk of Thrombosis  
Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as oestrogen 
containing therapies, should be used with caution after making a careful benefit -risk assessment 
in patients receiving lenalidomide.  
 
6.8 Treatment Compliance  
Dosing modifications due to toxicity are described in Section 6.6.2 . 
 
Patients will receive MOR00208 under the direct supervision of study personne l. Each 
administration volume or dose will be checked and the vial/outer package code and volume or 
dose per administration will be recorded in each patient’s eCRF as well as in the source data.  
 
A patient will be considered compliant with the protocol if the MOR00208 dose administered is 
≥80% to ≤120% of the assigned dosage per single infusion.  
 
LEN is to be dispensed in 28 -day cycles. Patients should return all unused or empty LEN 
bottles/blister packs to the site throughout the treatment period of the st udy, as instructed by the 
investigator. A patient will be considered compliant with the protocol if the LEN dose 
administered is ≥80% to ≤120% of the assigned dosage during a particular cycle.  
 
Drug accountability will be checked by the field monitor duri ng site visits and at the completion 
of the study . 
 
6.9 Withdrawal from Study Treatment  or Study/Site Termination  
  Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study or be discontinued  from it at the discretion of  
the investigator at any time . An excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study 
uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  
 
The investigators are encouraged to keep a patient experiencing clinical benefit in the study 
unless significant toxicity puts the patient at risk or repeated cases of routine noncompliance puts 
the study outcomes at risk.  
 
At a minimum, all patients who discontinue study treatment, including those who refuse to return 
for a final visit, will be contacted for safety evaluations at the 30 -Day Follow -up Visit.  
 
If such withdrawal occurs, or if the patient fails to return for visits, the investigator must 
determine the primary reason for a patient´s premature withdrawal from the study and record the 
Product Name: MOR00208   Protocol Number: MOR208C203

Protocol Amendment 5, Final Version 8.0  EudraCT Number: 2014 -004688 -19 
 
MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 59 of 110 information on the eC RF. If the reason for withdrawal is an AE, monitoring should continue 
until the outcome is evident. The specific event or test result(s) must be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
Following events are reasons for discontinuing a patient from the use  of investigational  
product(s) and/or from the study:  
 
 Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason)  
 Significant lack of co -operation or non -compliance on the side of the patient  
 Pregnancy or lack of adequate contraception in FCBPs   
 Any clini cal adverse event  (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which,  
in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is  
not in the best interest of the subject  
 Unacceptable and unmanageable,  in the view of e ither patient or physician , toxicity  
judged to be related to study drugs  
 Occurrence of new diseases that could influence the treatment efficacy, for which the 
study medication s are contraindicated or that are treated with a medication that is not 
permitted  as a concomitant medication.  
 Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily  
incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or somatic disease  (e.g., infectious 
disease)  
 Death  
 Lost to follow up  
 Major protocol violation  (following discussion between the sponsor’s Clinical Program 
Leader, Drug Safety Physician and the Investigators)  
 Administrative reasons  
 Termination of the study by MorphoSys or Regulatory Authorities  
 Reconsideration of the risk/benefit ratio, in consensu s with Ethical Committee  
 
Patients who are withdrawn for any reason may not re -enter this clinical study at any time.

 Study or Site Termination  
The investigator and the sponsor both reserve the right to terminate the study at any time at a 
given clinical  study centre. The sponsor also reserves the right to terminate the entire study or 
temporarily interrupt enrolment and/or dosing of already enrolled pa tients for further evaluation, 
for example , if during the ongoing evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio, the sponsor decides that 
the risks outweigh the benefits of MOR00208 and/or LEN.  
 
Should a termination of a given clinical study centre or the whole study be come  necessary, then 
the procedures will be arranged after review by, and consultation with, all in volved parties. In 
terminating a study centre, or the entire study, the sponsor and the investigators will ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests. Institutional Review 
Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Commi ttees (IECs) and competent authorities will be notified 
of premature termination in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 67 of 110 1 Day 1 dosing.  At all other indicated time points, a urine pregnancy test for FC BP will be performed locally and the result must be negative for dosing.  A β-HCG  pregnancy test 
should also be performed at the End of Study Visit.  
5Sample to be collected and evaluated  in the local laboratory (up to 24 hours prior to study drug administration) and reviewed by study treating physician  before study drug 
administration . 
6MOR00208 PK sample will be taken pre -dose and 1 hour ±  10 min after the end of MOR00208 infusion.  
7Repeat bone marrow biopsy to conf irm a CR only in those patients who had known bone marrow involvement prior to dosing ( see Section 7.2.14.2  for details).  
8For patients receiving antibody treatment despite disease progression  / relapse , an Unscheduled Visit  covering all assessments described under EOT visit should be completed 
(except PK sample) before the continuation of antibody therapy . These procedures, if performed within less than two weeks preceding this visit, need not be repeated. PET/CT 
need not be repeated if it was performed during previous treatment cycle.  
9After 30-Day Follow -up V isit, a call will be made to the patient (or the patient’s family) every 90 days for at least 5 years from Cycle 1 Day 1 to inquire about the patient’s status , 
second primary malignancy ( SPM ) and information on any antineoplastic therapies ut ilised since discontinuation of study treatment.  
10After disease progression has been recorded , only anticancer treatments and, in case of an AE, other relevant concomitant medications (at the discretion of the investig ator) 
should be entered. Before and up to the End of Treatment Visit , the complete concomitant medication needs to be recorded.  
11A limited PE (L) will be performed on Day 1 of each Cycle, every 12 weeks +2 days from the previous PE.  
12Anti-MOR 00208 antibody sample and MOR00208 PK sample  (pre-dose only)  will be taken in odd numbered additional treatment cycles only (i.e. treatment Cycles 13, 15, 17, 
19, 21, 23 ). No samples to be collected after Cycle 23.  
13Disease assessment by CT/MRI of neck, chest, abdomen & pelvis with iv contrast during additional treatment phase ; Cycles 13 -24: approximately  every 3 months  ± 2 days from 
the previous scan . First assessment during this phase can be done directly 3 months after Cycle 12 D28 PET/CT assessment. Thus, this assessment is not needed at Cycle 13 Day 1, 
and an interval longer than ~3 months is acceptable for Cycle 16 Day 1 assessment; Cycle 25 onwar ds: approximately once every year ± 2 weeks from the previous scan.  Images 
will have to be transferred to the central imaging laboratory.  
14In case the patient is withdrawn from treatment before the end of C ycle 12 for reasons other than progression of d isease. PET/CT is only required at the E OT visit if it was not 
performed in the cycle before the end of treatment  visit. 
15Bone marrow assessment during additional treatment phase  (Cycles 13 to 24)  approximately every 3  months  ± 2 weeks from the previous assessment ; to be performed to confirm 
a CR only in those patients who had known bone marrow involvement prior to dosing . Refer to Section 7.2.14.2  for further details.  
16HBV -DNA to be measured and re -measured only if anti -HBc was positive at screening. If HBV -DNA is positive at screening, or during treatment, please see Section  7.2.13.2 . 
17Not applicable for patients who continue receiving MOR208 despite disease progression.  
18Central laboratory tests will be performed only until Cycle 24 for each patient, as app licable. Not to be performed from Cycle 25 onwards.  
19PET/CT Cycle 25 onwards should be performed only if deemed necessary, and not more than once per year.  
20This treatment is planned for a total treatment duration (from Cycle 1 Day 1 onwards) of  at least  5 years , including the safety follow -up visit and survival follow -up duration, as 
applicable.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 69 of 110 7.2 Procedures  
All study -required  procedures should occur as outlined in  Table 5. Excursions from the timing 
of assessments will be considered protocol deviations and should be recorded in the source 
documents along with the reason for the excursion.  
 
For patients receivi ng antibody treatment despite disease progression / relapse , an 
Unscheduled Visit covering all assessments described under EOT visit should be completed 
before the continuation of antibody therapy . Blood parameters (h aematology, serum 
chemistry) should be evaluated in the local lab  according to local guidelines/standards of local 
medical practice for the administration of monoclonal antibodies. A urine pregnancy test should 
be performed for women of childbearing potential , prior to each infusion . Vital sign s should be 
measured according to local practice for the administration of monoclonal antibodies. For this 
patient population only the antineoplastic therapy and AEs  need to be captured in eCRF. Other 
procedures described in the column MOR00208 Additional Treatment will not apply for this 
patient population.  
 
 
 Screening followed by Enrolment (Start of IMP)  
The Screening Period begins on the date the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed and will 
last for up to 28 days. The ICF must be signed prior to beginn ing any assessments solely for the 
purpose of this study. Standard of care assessments done on the day of consent (but prior to 
signing the ICF) do not need to be repeated solely for the purpose of screening and may be used 
as study data, if they meet the protocol requirements.  
 
During screening, it is permitted to repeat on a single occasion  the central laboratory 
assessment  of serum chemistry and h aematology parameters due to the variability of the 
parameters and their dependence on multitude of factors (e.g., hydration, muscle mass). This is, 
provided no safety concerns arise and that such laboratory results might have been caused by a 
transient, medically plausible event, which resolved spontaneously or as result of a medical 
intervention in the meantim e (e.g. , dehydration, vomiting, imaging procedure with a contrast). 
This procedure and the rationale behind it must be explicitly documented in source data. Such 
repeated assessment (once only) of the concerned parameters will not be counted as “re -
screeni ng” for that patient.  
 
On Cycle 1 Day 1, patient eligibility must be confirmed before drug administration. Local 
laboratory parameters should be used for this purpose, as specified in Section 7.2.13  Laboratory 
Assessments.

 End of Treatment (EOT) Visit  
An end of treatment visit will have to be completed for all patients, including, but not limited to 
the following circumstances:  
a. After disease progres sion / relapse, any  time after start of the study treatment , provided 
MOR00208 will not be administered despite progression  
b. After last administration of study drugs . 
c. Withdrawal from study treatment as specified in Section 6.9. 
If the EOT visit is after 24 cycles (i.e., Cycle 25 onwards), only the applicable laboratory tests 
in the local lab oratory  will need to be performed.  
 
 MOR00208 Administ ration  Despite Disease Progression  
It is up to the investigator to decide according to the individual risk/benefit ratio if the patient 
should continue on MOR00208 in case of disease progression, after discussion with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor . For pat ients who will be administered MOR00208 despite 
progression of disease / relapse, an Unscheduled Visit  including all protocol prescribed 
procedures for the EOT Visit  need to be performed in order to capture the event (i.e. disease 
progression/relapse) for the antibody treatment to continue further. These procedures, if 
performed within less than two weeks preceding this visit, need not be repeated . PET/CT  need 
not be repeated if it was performed during previous treatment cycle.  Note: Central laboratory 
tests will need to be performed only until Cycle 24 for each patient, as applicable.  
 
Following procedures will be performed (and documented in source) for these patients during 
the period  of MOR00208 administration  despite disease progression (prior to each infusion) : 
a. Emergency Laboratory (Local Lab) evaluations consisting of haematology, serum 
chemistry according to local guidelines/standards of local medical practice for the 
administration of monoclonal antibodies.  
b. A urine pregnancy test for women of childb earing potential  
c. Vital signs  
 
These patients will follow a visit schedule as mentioned under “MOR00208 Additional 
Treatment Phase”, whereas their treatment cycle and visit numbers will be captured in a 
continuum with their previous applicable treatment visit, prior to disease progression. For this 
patient population only the antineoplastic therapy and AEs are going to be captured in eCRF. 
Other procedures described in the column MOR00208 Additional Treatment will not apply for 
this patient population.  
 
In such cases an EOT Visit  will take place after these patients have finally stopped receiving the 
antibody. At this EOT visit only anticancer therapy and AEs will be recorded. And lastly, a 
Safety Follow -Up will take place 30-Days after last administration  of MOR00208.

 Safety Follow -up Visit  
A Safety Follow -Up will take place 30-Days after last administration of IMP. Following 
assessments will be performed  and recorded in eCRF : 
a. Limited physical examination  
b. Adverse events including second primary malignancies  
c. Antineoplastic therapy  
 
 Survival Follow -up 
After Safety Follow -up Visit, a phone call will be made to the patient (or the patient’s family) 
every 90 days (+ 2 weeks) for to cover a duration of up to 5 years from Cycle 1 Day 1 to inquire 
about the patient’s status, second primary malignancy (SPM) and information on any 
antineoplastic therapies utilised since discontinuation of study treatment.  For patients who are lost 
to follow -up, at least three attempts of contact by the site should be made a nd documented in the 
source data.  
 
 Diagnostic Biopsy  
Patient s must be eligible and willing to undergo a biopsy of a lymph node or other pathologic al 
tissue , providing enough tumo ur tissue for correlative studies , as a part of participation in this 
study. H istological confirmation of the diagnosis of DLBCL will be performed by a central 
pathologist , retrospectively after enrolment . Surgically acquired tissue samples are preferred, but 
core biops ies are permitted.  Bone marrow biops ies are not adequate for thi s purpose and should 
be performed only for disease staging.  
 
Should it not be possible to obtain a fresh tumour tissue sample from the patient, archival paraffin 
embedded tumour tissue acquired < 3 years prior to screening for this protocol must be available 
for this purpose.  
 
The local pathology report indicating DLBCL diagnosis is acceptable for determining a patient’s 
eligibility. Central pathology review is mandatory, but retrospective in natu re. Tissue samples 
(or archival paraffin blocks, as stated above ) should be submitted within 30 days of patient 
enrolment in the study. Patients can be enrolled prior to submission of tissue sample(s).  
 
In case of discrepancies between the assessments of the local and the central pathologists, the 
one of the central pathologist prevails. If the DLBCL diagnosis of the local pathologist cannot 
be confirmed by the central pathologist , and a patient’s treatment has already commenced,  they 
may remain in the stu dy.

 Demographic Data/Relevant Medical History and Current Medical 
Conditions/Baseline Stage and Prognostic Classification  
Demographic variables to be recorded will include age, gender, race, body height, and body 
weight. Weight and height should be measu red while the patient is without shoes, but dressed.  
 
At the time of signing of the ICF , relevant medical history and current medical conditions should 
be recorded. The medical history of DLBCL should be documented in detail , including baseline 
symptoms as  well as a detailed history of prior cancer therapies for DLBCL , with start and stop 
dates, number of therapy line(s), disease progression during or after therapy, as well as 
discontinuations due to intolerability or any other clinically significant illness . Any previous 
therapy (e.g. , chemotherapy, immunothera py, or radiation therapy) for DLBCL  should be 
recorded in the eCRF. Also, examinations leading to the diagnosis of the latest progression of 
DLBCL  should be documented in the patient’s source do cuments. This may include, for 
example, results of laboratory examinations, imaging results, or clinical symptoms related to 
DLBCL . The assessment of the lymphoma should include staging. In order to reflect the  patient ’s 
status at the time of enrolment , the standard staging system used for DLBCL reflecting the 
number of sites of involvement and their relation to the diaphragm, the existence of B -symptoms , 
and the presence of extranodal disease , will be documented ( see Appendix_E  for Ann Arbor 
Staging).  
 
Additionally the disease risk assessment as per IPI (see Appendix_B ) and patient status as per 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) performance status  criteria (see Appendix_F ), 
will be recorded . 
 
Examples of clinical significant systemic diseases, which may exclude patient participation 
include, but are not limited to:  
a) A diagnosis of a myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to enrolment, 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or higher congestive heart failure, 
uncontrolled angina pectoris, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, 
clinically significant p ericardial disease, or electrocardiographic evidence of 
acute ischaemia or significant conduction system abnormalities, in the opinion of 
the investigator. Patients with stable, asymptomatic atrial fibrillation are allowed 
in the study provided they do not  meet the other cardiac exclusion criteria  
b) Systemic diseases ( e.g., cardiovascular, renal, hepatic) that would in the 
investigator’s opinion preclude participation in the study or compromise the 
patient’s ability to give informed consent  
c) History or evidenc e of clinically significant peripheral nervous system, 
cerebrovascular, or CNS diseases, meningeal (e.g. , meningeosis leukaemica), or 
epidural malignancy including brain metastasis or cerebrovascular event(s) with 
clinically significant sequelae. Screening  for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/CNS 
involvement is not required but may be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator.

 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured at the time points described in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Table 5). 
 
These assessments include body temperature, systolic and diasto lic blood pressure readings 
(mmHg), heart rate (b eats per minute [b pm]), and respiratory rate ( respirations per minute 
[rpm ]). Vital signs will be measured immediately prior to  infusion, 15  ± 5, 30  ± 10, and then 
every 60  ±15 minutes during infusion and at end of infusion (±  20 min). The actual time of vital 
sign measurements should be accurately documented. If the infusion is i nterrupted and/or 
subsequently restarted, vital signs should be assessed every 60  ± 15 minutes after the first hour.  
 
The frequency or the length of the monitoring period may be adapted if clinically indicated, for 
example if in the opinion of the investig ator the vital sign results , at the time of event onset , are 
clinically significant. In such a case the patient ’s vital sign measurements should continue to be 
recorded until they have returned to normal or pre -infusion levels and an AE recorded.  If 
possible, before vital signs are measured, the patient should be r esting for at least 5  minutes. T he 
same position should  be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient, and blood 
pressure should  be measured from the arm contralateral to th e site of study drug administration. 
Body temperature should be measured according to  normal hospital practice.  
 
  Physical Examination  (PE)  
7.2.9.1  Full PE 
A full PE will be performed by the Investigator or a qualified designee during the screening and 
at the EOT  Visit. 
 
Full PE must be perfo rmed according to the best standards of local medical practice but should 
include at least vital signs and palpable tumo ur assessment s, general appearance, skin, head, 
eyes, ears, nose, throat including Waldeyer lymphatic struc tures, lungs, breasts and axillae (if 
applicable including bi -dimensional measurement of cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and 
inguinal lymph nodes), cardiovascular system, back and spine, abdomen (if applicable including 
spleen size below the costal mar gin), extremities, infusion site, lymph nodes, and neurological 
examination.  
 
7.2.9.2  Limited PE  
Limited PEs may be focused on tumo ur response assessment ( e.g., lymph nodes, liver, spleen)

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 74 of 110 7.2.9.3  Body Weight and Height M easurements  
Body height will be measured at Cycle 1 Day 1 only.  
 
Body weight can be measured up to 24 hours prior to  MOR00208  administration on Day 1 of 
each cycle. This baseline weight will be used to calculate the MOR00208 dose during the given 
cycle provided the weight does not deviate >±10% from baseline during the course of this cycle. 
In case s where the patient’s  body weig ht changes more than ±  10% from baseline, the current 
weight will be used to calculate the next and subsequent doses of MOR00208.  Using actual body 
weight prior to each MOR00208 infusion is also allowed, if this is preferred by investigators.  
 
Weight measu rement s should be performed at each visit and the values will need to be entered 
into the eCRF on the actual day of measurement.  
 
7.2.9.4  B-Symptoms  
B-symptoms are defined as any one or more of the disease -related symptoms or signs  mentioned 
in Appendix_E . 
 
Assessment of the presence or absence of B -symptoms will be performed at screening and on 
Day 1 for all cycles, as well as the End of Treatment  Visit and at the 30 -Day Follow -up V isit. 
 
 Electrocardiogram  
Standard 12 -lead resting ECG s will be obtained at the various time points described in the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table 5). ECGs will be recorded after the patient  has rested in a supine 
position for at least 5 minutes. Heart rate , PR, QRS , RR  and QT intervals will be determined . 
All ECGs will be performed and interpreted locally.  The investigator will evaluate the clinical 
significance of each value outside the ref erence ranges according to the nature and degree of the 
observed abnormality. Any new abnormal values considered to be clinically significant should 
be reported as AEs.  
 
If clinically significant abnormalities are observed or art efacts are present that res ult in an 
inability to adequately interpret the results, the ECG will be repeated. An average of all intervals 
measured in all ECG tracings recorded at a given time point may be taken if necessary.  
 
 Adverse Event Monitoring  
AEs will be assessed at each vis it and reported as specified in Section 8.2 of the  protocol.  
 
For screening failure patients only SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
 Monitoring of Second Primary Malignancies  
SPMs will be monitored as events of intere st and should be included as part of the assessment of 
AEs throughout the course of the study. Investigators are to report any SPMs as serious AEs, 
regardless of causal relationship to the study drugs, occurring at any time , for the duration of the 
study, from Cycle 1 , Day 1 up to and including  the follow -up period of up to 3  years. Events of

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 75 of 110 SPM are to be reported using the SAE report form and must be considered an important medical 
event even if no other serious criteria ap ply; these events must also be documented in the 
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and the patien t’s source documents.  
 
Documentation on the diagnosis of the SPMs must be provided at the time of reporting as an 
SAE (e .g., any confirmatory histology or cytolo gy results, X -rays, computed tomography [ CT] 
scans).  
 
 Laboratory Assessments  
Detailed instructions and amounts of biologic al samples needed for the respective laboratory 
measurement s will be summarised in the laboratory manual.  All samples will be collecte d as 
non-fasting samples.  
 
7.2.13.1  Safety and H aematol ogy Laboratory Testing  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed according to Table 6. During the course of the study , 
local (“emergency”) and central laboratories will be used.  
 
Central laboratory results are required for determining patient eligibility for study enrolment and 
will be used in the primary statistical analysis of the study results. Note: for eligibility 
confirmation prior to study drug administration at Cycle 1 Day 1, local laboratory results should 
be used. During the course of the study , all scheduled centra l laboratory results should be 
reviewed as soon as possible after Day 1 of each cycle . 
 
During screening, it is permitted to repeat on a single occasion  the central laboratory assessment 
of serum chemistry and h aematology parameters due to the variability of the parameters and their 
dependence on multitude of factors (e.g. , hydration, muscle mass). This is, provided no safety 
concerns arise and that such laboratory results might have been caused by a transient, medically 
plausible event, which resolved spon taneously or as result of a medical intervention in the 
meantime (e.g. , dehydration, vomiting, imaging procedure with a contrast). This procedure and 
the rationale behind it must be explicitly documented in source data.  Such repeated assessment 
(once only) of the concerned parameters will not be counted as “re -screening” for that patient.  
 
Local (“emergency”) laboratory results will be used for treatment or clinical ly related decisions, 
or for the immediate safety needs of a study patient . “Emerg ency laboratory” (local) results 
should be reviewed as soon as possible after their receipt and before dosing so that the 
administration  of the investigational medicinal product (IMP)  may be adjusted or interrupted if 
necessary.  
 
The signed and interpreted  laboratory results (both local and central) will be kept in the patient’s 
source documentation. The laboratory results should be reviewed, dated and signed in a timely 
manner by the investigator. Any clinically significant discrepancies will be evaluated on a case -
by-case basis. All blood samples will be processed and handled according to standard laboratory 
procedures. The time of blood collection should be documented in the source data .

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 76 of 110 If an abnormal laboratory value of grade  4 or an abnormal laborator y value judged to be clinically 
significant that was not present at baseline , is not reported as an AE, then the investigator should 
clearly document the rationale for not doing so in the source documentation.  
 
Any abnormal laboratory findings (identified either through local or central lab oratory analysis ) 
that constitute an AE should be reported as such and should be followed up until the outcome is 
known. Also, additional diagnostic tests may be indicated to determine a more precise diagnosis 
of the pati ent’s condition (e.g. , ordering a white blood cell ( WBC ) differential count to help 
characterise a high or low WBC count, or ordering a determination of red blood cell ( RBC ) 
indices to help characterise a low haematocrit).  
 
Central laboratory tests will be  performed only until Cycle 24 for each patient, as applicable.

7.2.13.2  Hepatitis Virus Serology  
Patients  will be examined according to the schedule in Table 5 for viral hepatitis B and C 
serology. Hepatitis B biomarkers include hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), total anti -hepatitis 
B core antibody (anti -Hbc) and hepatitis B surface antibody (ant i-HBs). Patients with a positive 
test for anti -Hbc can only be included if hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA) is not detected. In 
these patients only , HBV DNA should be assessed at various subsequent visits as outlined in 
Table 5 . Note: Central laboratory tes ts will need to be performed only until Cycle  24 for each 
patient, as applicable.  
 
In the context of exclusion criteria, seropositive for or active viral infection with hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) means:  
a) HBV surface antigen positive  
b) HBV surface antigen negativ e, HBV surface antibody positive and/or HBV core antibody 
positive and detectable viral DNA.  Note: Subjects who are HBV surface antigen negative 
and viral DNA negative are eligible.  
c) Patients who exhibit the classical vaccination profile of HBV surface antibody positive, 
HBV core antibody negative, and HBV surface antigen negative are eligible.  
 
If HBV -DNA becomes detectable during treatment, patients should be prophylactically treated 
and followed -up for potential hepatitis B reactivation as per local m edical practice or institutional 
guidelines for CD20 antibodies such as RTX. If the HBV -DNA assay is positive, then patients 
can only stay in the study if they are assessed by a physician experienced in the treatment of

Hepatitis C serology is to be done at screening only.  Hepatitis C biomarkers include 
anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti -HCV). For patients who are positive for anti -HCV antibody, 
HCV -RNA should be measured  
 
A positive Hepatitis C test is defined as a positive test for Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV) antibodies 
and a positive test for HCV RNA.  
 
7.2.13.3  Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for females of childbearing pot ential (FCBP) at various pre - 
and post -treatment time points either by urine pregnancy test or beta-human chorionic 
gonadotropin ( β-HCG ) test of a serum sample (see Table 5). The pregnancy test assay should 
have a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/mL. At screening and the End of Treatment  Visit, a serum 
β-HCG pregnancy test should be performed for FCBP.  
 
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests prior to starting the study drug . The first 
pregnancy test must be performed within the 10–14 days prior to the start of study drug  and the 
second pregnancy test must be performed within the 24 hours prior to the  start of study drug. 
The patient  must not receive study drug until the study doctor has verified that the results of 
these pregnancy tests are negative.  
 
Subsequent pregnancy tests will be conducted : 
 every week for the first 28 days of the study  
 every 28 days thereafter (or every 14 days if the patient  has irregular periods)  
 if the FCBP patient  misses a period  
 if the FCBP patient has unusual menstrual bleeding  
 at the EOT V isit 
 fourteen (14 ) days and 28 days (if irregular periods) and 28 days  only (with regular 
periods) after stopping LEN.  
 
Note: Central laboratory tests will need to be performed only until Cycle 24 for each patient, as 
applicable.  
 
In addition, pregnancy and risk counsel ling will be conducted at the time  points specified in the  
LEN Pregnancy Risk Minimisation Plan for Clinical Trials . 
 
7.2.13.4  PK Assessments  
Concentration -time pro files and PK parameters will be assessed for MOR00208 according to the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 5). Neither samples nor concentration -time profiles or PK 
parameters will be assessed for LEN.  
 
Serum samples for PK analysis of MOR00208 will be handled and stored as specified in the 
laboratory  manual  at the study site until shipment on dry ice to an external analytical laboratory.

7.2.13.6  Other Laboratory Evaluations  
A mucosal cheek swab will be used for DNA analysis of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa polymorphism s. 
The evaluation will be performed at a specified laboratory.  
 
Genotyping is optional ; it will only be performed if the patient specifically consents to this 
analysis. A patient can participate in the study regardless of whether they consent to undergo 
genotyping.  
 
Biomarker analysis on c ollected tissue samples, for example CD19  and CD 20 expression 
assessm ents will be performed at a central specified laboratory.  
 
For evaluation of the status of the patient’s immune system, B -, T- and NK cells in peripheral 
blood will be measured frequently throughout the study (exploratory assay). The absolute and 
percentag e changes from baseline will be evaluated.  
 
Baseline CD16 expression on NK cells in peripheral blood will be evaluated at baseline 
(exploratory assay). In addition, the ADCC capacity of the patient will be assessed.  
 
 Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy will be e valuated in terms of ORR, DCR, DoR, PFS, OS, TTP and TTNT : For 
definit ions see Section 10.6 . 
 
Disease response assessment s will be made according to the revised response criteria based on 
the guidelines of the IWG  reported by Cheson et al. (2007) (see Appendix_G ). Response 
assessment made by the central radiology  + clinical  review at Cycle 12 Day 28 ( +4 days) (and  / 
or at the EOT visit , as applicable ) will be considered for the main ef ficacy analysis  (primary 
endpoint) .  
 
Local assessment of efficacy / disease response will be recorded in addition to central review at 
the end of Cycle 12 (for decision s concerning the additional Cycle 13 through Cycle 24 
MOR00208 treatment) and at the EOT Visit (to determine whether the disease has progressed) , 
and at additional time points specified in  Table 5. Disease assessment by CT/MRI  during 
additional treatment phase  will be done as follows:

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 81 of 110  Cycle 13 until Cycle 24: First assessment during this phase can be done after 
approximately 3 months + 2 days after Cycle 12 D28 PET/CT assessment. Thus, this 
assessment is not needed at Cycle 13 Day 1, and  an interval longer than 3 months is 
acceptable for Cycle 16 Day 1 assessment. Thereafter, it will be repeated approximately 
every 3 months ± 2 days from the previous scan.  
 Cycle 25 onwards: approximately once every year from the previous scan.  
 
7.2.14.1  Tumo ur Ima ging Assessment  
In the course of the study , disease and response asses sments as well as tumo ur measurements 
will be performed.  
 
Initial disease and disease response assessment s for the primary endpoint will be made by 
positron emission tomography ( PET)/ CT (CT should be done with IV contrast) at screening and 
Day 28 (±4 days) of Cycle 12 and at the EOT Visit, in the cases where a patient is withdrawn 
from treatment before the end of Cycle 12 for reasons other than progressive disease.  PET/CT 
scanning duri ng additional treatment phase (C ycle 13 onwards) with MOR00208 will be 
performed at the decision of the investigator, and should not be performed more than 
approximately once per year.  
 
Tumo ur measurements  and disease assessment  (local) will be perfo rmed as indicated in Table  5 
by CT.  The CT portion of PET/CT will be acceptable in place of CT for tumo ur measurement  
and disease assessment , only when the CT portion is of adequate diagnostic -quality, and using 
adequate intravenous contrast . 
 
Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) may be used in lieu of CT , and PET/MRI in lieu of PET/CT 
for patients with contraindications to the administration of contrast agents , or due to other 
medical reasons , at the same time points as CT, or in addition  to CT , at the discretion of the 
investigator (in this case, MRI may be performed as/when appropriate). The method used at 
baseline should be used throughout the study un less otherwise medically indicated.  
 
If available and of acceptable quality, previously performed PET/CT examinations , in 
accordance with the standard of care , that were done up to four weeks prior to  the date of 
informed consent may be used for a patient’s baseline central radiology assessment. Additional 
PET/CT or CT or MRI examinations may be performed by the investigator in the course of the 
study , if deemed necessary  (e.g., to confirm the occurrence of a CR or to make importan t 
treatmentrelated - decisions ). Whenever feasible, in such cases the investigator should seek prior 
approval of the sponsor for the additional imaging.  
 
If the patient discontinues from treatment, a PET/CT scan is only required at the EOT Visit if it 
was not performed in the cycle prior to  the end of treatment. CT may be performed in lieu of 
PET/CT if the patient discontinues from treatment within Cycle 1.  
 
The same scan modality should be used for all assessments , and a ll patients are requi red to have 
scans of the neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis. All scans conducted during the study will be provided 
to a central imaging laboratory for independent radiolog ical and clinical evaluation.

procedures should be in place to measure and control blood glucose level.  
 
7.2.14.2  Bone Marrow  
At the screening visit, a uni - or bilateral bone marrow aspirate and a biopsy should be obtained 
to assess bone marrow involvement . Results from a bone marrow examination done within the 
4 weeks prior to the date of informed consent will be acceptable if the patient’s disease has been 
stable since then.  
 
The achievement of CR in the course of MOR208C203 study must be confirmed locall y, by 
clinical and radiologic evaluation along with bone marrow confirmation. The latter applies only 
in case the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before study entry . If bone marrow was not 
involved by lymphoma before commencing the study treatment, th en bone marrow confirmation 
biopsy is not required. The repeated bone marrow examination is also not required for patients 
in whom bone marrow has already been cleared of the infiltrate at previous evaluation, i.e. their 
previous response was CR.  
 
Histolog ical examination of the bone marrow should be performed locally at the protocol 
specified time -points (see Table 5). 
 
 
8 SAFETY MONITORING  
The patients will be closely observed and questioned for any kind of AE during the study 
procedures and at follow -up appointments throughout the study period with non -leading 
questioning (e.g. , “How do you feel?”). AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
the patient during or between study visits or through physical examination, laboratory tests, or 
other assessments.  
 
Study personnel must remain vigilant for the occurrence of AEs,  particularly those that may be 
lifethreatening -. Personnel who are trained in the acute management of IRRs, cytokine release 
syndrome, anaphylaxis, and other emergencies , and who have access to appropriate clinical 
supplies , should be readily available.  
 
All AEs should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug 
treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stopping concomitant 
treatments, changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospital isation, or any other 
medically required intervention. Once an AE is detected, it should be followed up, and an 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in its 
severity, its suspected relationship to the stu dy drug(s), any of the interventions required to treat 
it, and its outcome.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 83 of 110 8.1 Definition of Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events, 
Adverse Events of S pecial Interest  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical patient  admin istered 
a medicinal product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship to this treatment.  
 
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with th e use of a study drug, whether or not 
it is considered related to that study drug.  
 
AEs include any clinically significant deterioration of a patient’s medical status after the signing 
of the ICF. Also , an increase in  the frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic event or 
conditions and events resulting from protocol mandated procedure s (e.g., invasive procedures) 
fall under the definition of AE s. In addition, overdoses (defined as exceeding the planned dose 
by more than 20%) should be recorded as A Es.

reporting investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Medi cal judgment 
should be exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious in other situations: important AEs that 
are not immediately lifethreatening - or do not result in death or hospitalisation but may 
jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the previous definitions should also be considered as serious.  
 
AEs of special interest  are TFR, TLS, SP M, IRRs and allergic reactions to study drug ≥grade 3 , 
cytokine release syndrome  and overdoses . 
 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs and AEs of special interest are monitored continuously 
and have special reporting requirements ( see Section 8.2). 
 
The investigator should determine the causality (relation ship to the study drug s) based on his/her 
clinical experience and on the information given in the IB  for M OR00208 and the SmPC  / 
Prescribing Information  for lenalidomide . The causal relationship of all AEs to the study drug 
will be judged as either suspected or not suspected. A suspected causal relationship means at 
least a reasonable possibility t hat the event is caused by the study drug. If no relationship has 
been provided by the investigator, the event will be considered as related to the study drug.  
 
Information about adverse drug reactions already known about the investigational study drug s 
can be found in the IB  for M OR00208 and the SmPC from lenalidomide , or will be 
communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the 
patient ICF and should be discussed with the patient during the study , as needed.  
 
8.2 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording and 
Reporting  
All AEs (except non -serious AEs for screening failures) that occur after the provision  of 
informed consent and up to 30 days after last study drug administration will be recorded in the 
eCRF and in the patient’s medical records, whether or not they are considered by the investigator 
to be related to the study drug. Thereafter , only AEs assessed as related should be recorded. All 
AEs should be recorded using acceptable diagnoses, if possible. F or screening failure patients , 
non-serious AEs will not be recorded in the eCRF but only in the patient’s medical records.  
 
In addition , all SAEs and AEs of special interest will be recorded on the SAE report form. Study 
centres and investigators are instr ucted to report all SAEs and AEs of special interest to the 
contract research organisation ( CRO ) mentioned below within 24  hours using the 
studyspecific - SAE report form.  Preferably , the diagnosis instead of the individual symptoms 
should be reported. For overdoses , the diagnosis and if applicable the accompanying symptoms 
caused by the overdose should be reported.  
 
If an AE has already been reported, it is not necessary to report each individual sign and symptom 
of that AE as a separate AE. For example, if  a myocardial infarction is reported as an AE, there 
is no need to report elevated creatine phosphokinase and abnormal ECG, or other related signs,

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 86 of 110 symptoms, or laboratory values as separate AEs. However, if such events occur in isolation, and 
myocardial infarction is not diagnosed, then each event should be reported as an AE.  
 
All non-serious AEs must be followed up for a final outcome. An outcome of “unknown” is not 
considered to be an acceptable final outcome. An outcome of “not yet resolved” is an acceptable 
final outcome for non -serious AEs at the end of a patient’s participation in a study. All SAEs 
must be followed up for a final outcome until resolution or, if resolution becomes unlikely, until 
stabilisation or death. The follow -up for SAEs that are a progression of DLBCL only until the 
end of a patient’s participation in a study is acceptable. This includes obtaining information on 
recovery and any sequelae and, in the case of a fatal outcome, the cause of death.  
 
Events that are clearly caused by progression of the underlying disease (for example 
transformation to more aggressive histology) should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs. These data 
will be captured as efficacy assessment data only. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an 
event is due to disease progression, it shou ld be recorded as an adverse event.  
 
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period that are being 
attributed to progression of the underlying disea se should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs. All 
other on-study deaths, regardl ess of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor. Death should be considered an outcome 
and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused the fatal outcome should be recorded 
as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should 
be reported. 
 
During survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of the underlying disease should be 
recorded in the eCRF . 
 
Notification of initial or fo llowup- SAE information (by using the standard SAE form provided 
by the sponsor) must be sent by fax to the CRO at the following number s as appropriate:

8.3 Pregnancies 
As detailed in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 5) and Section 7.1, serum pregnancy testing 
will be carried out at the Screening, and End of Treatment Visits (performed centrally). During 
the treatment period of the study, urine pregnancy testing will be performed locally and can be 
repeated if required. Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation should be reported 
using a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy of a study 
patient or a female partner of a study patient must also be reported within 24  hours of learning 
of its occurrence to by fax at the following number:  
 
Female study patients who become pregnant must be withdrawn from the study treatment period  
(IMP is to be discontinued immediately) . 
 
A newly diagnosed pregnancy in a patient or female partner of a study patient who has received 
study medication is not considered a n SAE unless it meets any criteria of seriousness or it is 
suspected that the study medication interacted with a contraceptiv e method and led to pregnancy.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 88 of 110 If the pregnancy results in clinical consequences/complications in mother or child, e.g., if the 
child is born with a birth defect, this should be reported as a n SAE of mother or child as 
applicable.  
 
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital 
abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications. Every infant has to be followed up for 
2 months after delivery.  
 
 
9 DATA HANDLING AND AR CHIVING

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 89 of 110 10 STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSIS  
 
10.1   Populations for Analysis  
The following analy sis populations will be used : 
 Full analysis set (FAS ): 
The FAS includes a ll patients who received at least one dose of MOR00208 and one 
dose of LEN. This means  that both study drugs must have been applied at least once.  
 Per protocol set (PPS) : 
The PPS is the subset of all subjects in the FAS without any major protocol 
non-compliances.  All patients in the FAS, ha d at least one dose of MOR 00208  and one 
dose of LEN  drug. Patients without any post -baseline assessment of DLBCL response 
or having major protocol deviations will be excluded from the PPS.  
 Safety analysis set (SAF):  
All patients who received at least one dose of MOR00208 or LEN study drug . 
 
Primary, secondary and supportive efficacy parameters will be evaluated using the FAS and PPS, 
while safety parameter evaluations will use the safety set (SAF), as well as for evaluations on 
immunogenicity and biomarker s. 
 
The primary analysis of the prima ry efficacy endpoint will be based on the FAS, whereas the 
analysis using the  PPS has a supportive function. Decision s about  whether a protocol deviation 
is relevant for the exclusion of a patient from the PPS will be made  before database closure.  
 
10.2  Primary  Endpoint  
1. The primary efficacy endpoint will be ORR (ORR = CR + PR) 
 
10.3  Secondary E ndpoints  
2. DCR, DoR, PFS, OS, TTP and TTNT  
3. Incidence and severity of AEs  
4. Determination and characterisation of a potential anti -MOR00208 antibody formation  
5. PK analysis of MOR00208  
6. Absolute and percentage change from baseline in measurements of B -, T- and NK cell 
populations  
7. Analysis of exploratory and diagnostic biomarkers (e.g. , CD19, CD20, BCL2, and BCL6 
expression, CD16 expression on NK cells, ADCC capacity, and gene exp ression profiling 
for cell of origin subtyping  and evaluation of AEs and ORR stratified by FcγRIIIa and 
FcγRIIa polymorphism ) are planned to be investigated dur ing the course of the study.  
 
10.4  General Statistical M ethods  
Tabulation of summary statistics, grap hical presentations, and statistical analyses will be 
performed using appropriate statistical software. Continuous, quantitative variable summaries 
Product Name: MOR00208  Protocol Number: MOR208C203  
Date: 24 February 2021  IND Number: 114,856  
Protocol  Amendment 5, Final Version 8 .0 EudraCT Number: 2014 -004688 -19 
 
MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 90 of 110 will include the number of patients (N) (with non -missing values/valid cases), mean, standard 
deviation, min imum, 25th quartile, median, 75th quartile and maximum, except for 
pharmacokinetic metrics, where additional statistics may be used.  
 
Categorical, qualitative variable summaries will include the frequency and percentage of 
patients/entries, who/which are in the particular category.  
 
The assumed overall type I error rate/significance level for the primary and secondary efficacy 
parameters is 5%, two -sided. Two -sided confidence limits will be evaluated at 95%, p -values 
from inferential tests comparing specif ic patient cohorts/patient subgroups will be compared 
to 5%. 
 
Missing values will not be substituted by estimated values . All statistical evaluations will be 
based on valid cases except for procedures described for calculating response rates or in case of 
censoring within the Kaplan -Meier methodology. In the case of incomplete start or stop dates of 
AEs or concomitant medication appropriate conservative imputation methods will be specified 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
 
Baseline values will be def ined as the last pre -administration observation used for calculating 
post-administration changes from baseline.  
 
All data obtained and entered into the database will be provided in separate data listings showing 
individual patient values. A SAP detailing t he statistical analyses and possible deviations from 
the protocol will be prepared before hard lock of database.  
 
10.5  Patient Disposition  
An overview table will be provided for all patients and will include the number of patients 
enrolled , the number of patien ts in each analysis population set, the number of completers  and 
the number of withdrawals and the reasons for withdrawal . Compliance parameters for drug 
administration will be tabulated.  
 
Demographic information will be summarised using descriptive statistics or counts and 
percentages.  
 
General medical histor ies and DLBCLspecific - medical histor ies will be summarised by counts 
and percentages using appropriate classification codes. Concomitant medications will be 
recorded and tabulated with counts/pe rcentages showing the number of medications/percentage 
used in each medication class.  
 
10.6  Analysis of Efficacy Data  
 Primary Efficacy E ndpoint ORR  
Local and independent response evaluations (progressive disease , SD, PR  and CR) will be 
tabulated with counts/per centages for each visit available. Missing response evaluations will be 
taken into account , with  patients with missing responses included in the denominator for 
calculating the rates).

Protocol  Amendment 5, Final Version 8 .0 EudraCT Number: 2014 -004688 -19 
 
MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 91 of 110  
Objective r esponse is  defined  as being  when a patient is classified as having a CR  or PR after 
DLBCL  evaluation using the IWG treatment response criteria for malignant lymphoma ( Cheson  
et al., 2007 ; see Appendix_G ). 
 
The ORR , for the prim ary efficacy endpoint , is defined as the proportion of patients with a CR 
or PR  (ORR = CR + PR)  up until disease progression , based on central radiologic al + clinical 
evaluations.  
 
The denominator for calculating the rate will be based upon the total numbe r of patients in the 
FAS population. As a sensitivity analysis, patients without any post -baseline assessment of 
response will be included in the denominator for ORR calculation. The number of responding 
patients and respective rates as well as the 95% confidence limits will be presented.  
 
The SAP will specify further sensitivity and supportive analyses, as well as possible evaluation 
of further response parameters (e.g. , best response).  
 
 Secondary E ndpoints  
10.6.2.1  Disease Control R ate (DCR)  
The DCR is defined as CR + PR + SD (i.e.  ORR + SD) and will be evaluated as for ORR.  
 
10.6.2.2  Duration of Response (DoR) and Time to Next T reatment (TTNT)  
DoR  is defined as the time  interval between the initial time point of tumo ur response (CR or PR  
whichever status is recorded fir st) and the first date that recu rrence of progressive disease  is 
documented . Response duration by the local and central assessment will be tabulated with 
descriptive statistics.  
 
Disease progression is defined as the first occurrence of progressive disease  according to the 
revised response criteria ( Cheson et al., 2007 ) as assessed by central radiology / clinical readers . 
 
TTNT  is defined as the time from study entry (= first dosing ) to the institution of next therapy 
for any reason including disease progression, treatment toxicity and patient preference.  TTNT  
will be descriptively analysed.  
 
10.6.2.3  Time to Event Variables: Progression -Free S urvival (PFS), Overall S urvival 
(OS), and  Time to Progression (TTP)  
PFS is defined as the tim e elapsed between study entry ( = first dosing ) and  lymphoma 
progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients not experiencing a 
lymphoma progression or death from any cause will be censored at the last available tumo ur 
assessment. The s ame holds tru e for patients who are lost-to-follow -up. 
 
OS is defined as time from study entry (= first dosing ) until the date of death  from any cause . 
Patients who are alive but have dropped out early  will be censored at the time of the last available 
study visit assessment.

Protocol  Amendment 5, Final Version 8 .0 EudraCT Number: 2014 -004688 -19 
 
MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 92 of 110  
TTP is defined as the time from study entry (= first dosing ) until documented lymphoma 
progression or death as a result of lymphoma. The event s of interest are only disease progression 
and death from lymphoma . Death from other caus es will not  be taken into account  (will be 
censored)  in the TTP evaluation.  Patients not experiencing progressive disease  will be censored 
at the last NHL assessment. Deaths from other causes will be censored at the time of death. Early 
drop-outs without a ny documented date of progression will be censored at the time of the last 
NHL assessment.  
 
Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to evaluate median survival, presenting corresponding 
statistical parameters and Kaplan -Meier survival curves. Further analyse s concerning influence 
of IPI and GC/non-GC B-cells will be specified in the SAP.  
 
TTP will be compared to  the TTP of the patients’  most recent therapy by  tabulating descriptive 
statistics (including 95% confidence limits).  
 
For the purposes of the protoco l the day of enrolment is defined as the date of the first treatment  
(study entry) . 
 
The SAP will provide further detail s on how to evaluate the influence of IPI and GC/non-GC B-
cells on ORR, DCR, PFS, OS, DoR , TTP  and TTNT. Analyses will apply Kaplan -Meier methods 
using these parameters as factors, as well as stratifying analyses results by these factors or 
including these factors in appropriate multivariate models (e.g. , analysis of variance [ ANOVA ]). 
 
The analysis of incidence and sever ity of AEs has been described below.  
 
10.6.2.4  Immunogenicity Analysis  
The a bsolute number and percentage of patients, who develop anti -MOR00208  antibodies, and 
the results of semi -quantitative anti -MOR00208  antibody titre determinations of confirmed 
positive sampl e assessments will be tabulated.  Further details will be specified in the SAP.  
 
10.6.2.5  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Appropriate PK parameters for MOR00208 , with a focus on , but not limited to , accumulation 
ratios , will be computed based on non -compartmental data anal ysis and summarised using 
descriptive statistics. Mean concentrations (on original  and on log -linear scale) will be visuali sed 
in figures. Further details of the PK analysis will be specified in the SAP.  
 
10.6.2.6  Biomarkers  
Blood and protein biomarkers which are i mportant in the mechanism of action of, or could 
predict response to, the study drugs will be descriptively tabulated, presenting absolute and 
change to baseline values , if applicable . 
 
For example:  
a. FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa genotyping results will be descriptively tabulated, whereas ORR 
and selective AEs tabulations  will be split by these factors

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 93 of 110 b. Flow cytometry results o f CD16 expression on NK cells will be descriptively tabulated, 
as well as ADCC results.  
 
10.7  Analysis of Safety Data  
 Adverse Events  
MedDR A (version 18.0 or higher) coded AEs will be used to show the incidence of all AEs by 
SOC, PT, relationship to treatment, severity and seriousness.  
An AE summary table will present the number of events, number of patients and the percentage 
of patients hav ing TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs that led to study discontinuation.  
 
AE frequency tables will display event and patient counts by MedDRA , SOC and PT for each 
treatment arm. Such summaries will be displayed for all TEAEs, TEAEs by  maximum 
severity/toxicity, TEAEs by relationship to study drug, SAEs , drug -related TEAEs and TEAEs 
that led to study discontinuation.  
 
 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
The analysis of laboratory parameters for each treatment arm will be presented separated into 
blood parameters ( e.g., haematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, serology for hepatit is B and 
C) urine parameters ( e.g., urinalysis) and serum pregnancy test.  
 
Descriptive summaries of actual (absolute) values and selected change -from -baseline values for 
continuous laboratory  parameters of interest will be presented. Investigator assessment s of the 
clinical relevance of each laboratory parameter will be analysed by frequency tabulations.  
 
The assessment of categorical  urinalysis variables will be tabulated by time point, resul ts for  
example of  hepatitis B and C serology and pregnancy test results will be summarised using 
counts/ percentages. Further details (e.g. , tabulation of shifts, special analyses with respect to NCI 
CTC grading) will be detailed in the SAP.  
 
 Physical Exami nation, Vital Signs and Electrocardiogram (12 -lead 
ECG)  
Complete and limited PE results will be summarised by body system and tabulated as 
counts/percentages. New and worsening abnormal physical examination findings during the 
study will be entered as AEs and analysed within the AE tables in detail. Descriptive summaries 
of vital sign parameters will be calculated. Summary ECG assessment s will be tabulated by time 
point using frequency tabulations. R esults of the 12 -lead ECG (PR, QRS, QT, RR interval 
value s) will be flagged to show whether a value is below or above the normal limit and summary 
statistics will be provided for ECG parameters.  
 
10.8  Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 80 patients with R -R DLBCL who meet the inclusion criteria and have none of 
the exclusion criteria will be randomly enrolled into the study . The study will be performed with 
an interim stop for the evaluation of the safety of the LEN dosage. No adjustment of sample size 
Product Name: MOR00208  Protocol Number: MOR208C203  
Date: 24 February 2021  IND Number: 114,856  
Protocol  Amendment 5, Final Version 8 .0 EudraCT Number: 2014 -004688 -19 
 
MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 94 of 110 or adapt ation of efficacy evaluations will be made at this point. As the primary purpose of this 
study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 25 mg daily oral LEN combined with 12 mg/kg 
MOR00208 administered by IV infusion in patients with R-R DLBCL, no formal stat istical 
hypothesis testing will be performed.  
 
For the determination of a suitable sample size, it is assumed that the combination treatment 
could improve the ORR from a value of 20% (under monotherapy) to 35% (under combination 
therapy). Applying a n exact  binom ial test with a two -sided significance level of 5% and a power 
of 85% the estimat ed sample size is 73 patients (calculation performed by nQuery Advisor® 
7.0). According to  this scenario an observed ORR of 32% w ould lead to a statistically significant  
study outcome. Assuming  a drop -out rate of 10% , a total sample size of about 80 patients  is 
estimated . 
 
The s ample size determination has been conducted using various possible monotherapy and 
combination effect ORR rates and various power assumptions. Lit erature evaluation of study 
results concerning the ORR rates of L EN or comparable products (as mono - or 
combination -therapy) as  well as former study results for  MOR00208 were used to justify 
assumptions on response rates  (Witzig et al., 2011 ; Wang et al., 2013 ). 
 
10.9  Safety  Run-In 
The study will consist of two parts, which will be performed sequentially. The first part of the 
study  (safety  run-in) will conclude with an interim safety review after the first 6 pa tients have 
been accrued  (see Section 5.1). This interim safety  assessment will evaluat e the number and type 
of AEs occurri ng during the first cycle , as well as the laboratory values ( e.g., biochemistry and 
haematology) and other relevant safety data as necessary,  with a view to  providing a 
recommendation on the LEN dose to be used in the study , going forward.  
 
The second part of  the study will o nly be authoris ed to open for enrolment following  the outcome 
of this evaluation . If, during the second part of the study , the safety profile of the combination is 
satisfactory , study patient  accrual will continue until the full goal of  approximately  80 patients  
is achieved .

According to ICH E6 GCP  guidelines , the sponsor or regulatory authorities may audit the 
investigational sites. The sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit and/or  their authorised 
representative(s), independent of the Clinical Operations and Clinical Development Department, 
are responsible for auditing the study. The investigator must accept such audits by the sponsor’s 
Quality Assurance Unit and/or their authorise d representative(s) and ensure access to all source 
data/documents.  
 
The investigator must accept that regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection to verify 
compliance of the study with GCP  guidelines . If informed that a regulatory inspection will tak e 
place, the investigator must inform the sponsor without delay.  
 
11.6  Insurance  
This study is covered under the sponsor’s Liability Insurance Policy covering damage to patients 
according to applicable legal requirements . A copy of the Certificate of Insurance and/or an 
information leaflet containing essential information about the insurance coverage will be 
provided to the investigator as required by Regulatory Authorities, IRBs or IECs.  
 
The investigator must inform the patients accordingly and must also point  out that the patients 
are allowed to undergo other medical treatment (except in an emergency) only with the 
investigator’s prior approval or to receive additional medication only with the investigator’s prior 
approval.  
 
11.7  Publication Policy  
Any presentation  or publication of data from this study will be intended as a joint publication by 
the investigator(s)/appropriate study site personnel and appropriate sponsor personnel. 
Authorship will follow the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)  
Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals and will be defined 
prior to the first publication.  
 
For multicentre studies, it is mandatory that the first publication be based on data from all centres, 
and that the data are analyse d and submitted as stipulated in the protocol by a statistician assigned 
by the sponsor.  
 
Thus, no investigator or institution may publish any results of the study conducted at their site, 
before such a first multicentre publication is made which covers th e data from all sites. The 
authors have the final responsibility for the decision to submit their manuscript and shall be given 
full access to the data resulting from the study.

MorphoSys AG  Confidential  Page 97 of 110 The coordinating investigator and/or authors shall coordinate any intended pu blication of study 
results with the sponsor, to enable the sponsor to ensure that results are presented in a responsible 
and coherent manner.  
 
The sponsor reserves the right to review all manuscripts and abstracts at least 60 days before 
their submission for publication or presentation. This is not intended to restrict or hinder 
publication or presentation, but is to allow the sponsor to protect the confidentiality of 
information and to provide comments that may not yet be available to the investigator.  
 
At the sponsor’s request, any confidential information (other than study results) will be deleted 
and all reasonable comments made by the sponsor will be incorporated prior to the submission 
for publication or presentation. In the rare event that such publi cation would affect the 
patentability of any invention to which the sponsor has rights, the sponsor has the right to request 
an additional delay to the proposed publication of no more than 90  days so as to allow the sponsor 
to protect its intellectual prop erty rights.  
 
The results of the study may be used by MorphoSys AG for the purposes of national and 
international registration, publication, and information for medical professionals. If necessary, 
the authorities will be notified of the investigators’ nam es, addresses, qualifications, and extent 
of involvement.

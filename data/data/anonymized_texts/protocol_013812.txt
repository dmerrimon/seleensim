    1. SYNOPSIS  
Name of Sponsor/Company:  Kurobe, LLC  
Name of Investigational Product:  Vancomycin hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment  1.1%   
Name of Active Ingredient:  Vancomycin hydrochloride  
Title of Study: A Randomized, Multicenter, Double -Masked, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 3 Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Ointment 1.1% in Patients 
with Moderate to Severe Bacterial Conjunctivitis.  
Studied Period (Years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: August 2015  
Estimated date last patient completed: November 2016  Phase of Development:  
3 
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vancomycin 
hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment 1.1%  dosed 4 times daily (QID) in patients with moderate to severe 
Gram -positive bacterial conjunctivitis.  
Meth odology: This will be a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled study. 
Eligible subjects will enter the study with clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis .  
At Screening/Visit 1 (Day 1),  subjects will undergo AdenoPlus® conjunctiva l adenovirus screening 
testing. If the AdenoPlus test result is negative, the subject will undergo microbial culture (including 
susceptibility testing) and ophthalmic evaluations. If the AdenoPlus® test result is positive, the subject 
will be considered a screen failure. Subjects confirmed to have met eligibility criteria will be 
randomized to 1 of 2 treatment  arms and will administer the allocated study medication 4 times daily 
(QID) to the infected eye(s) approximately 4 hours apart for 7 days:  
• Vancomycin  ophthalmic ointment 1.1% QID  
• Vehicle ointment (placebo) QID  
If both eyes are being treated, the eye with more severe signs of infection (based on the sum of the 3 
grading scales [conjunctival discharge, bulbar conjunctival injection, and palpebr al conjunc tival 
injection ]) will be considered the study eye . If the  sum of the  scales for both eyes are equal, the default 
will be the right eye.  If a subject with a unilateral infection develops an infection in the contralateral 
eye, the subject should contact the  clinical site and will be instructed to treat the contralateral eye with 
the study medication if signs of ocular conjunctival discharge and/or injection are present. The eye 
originally treated will continue to be considered the study eye. Only the study e ye will be assessed for 
efficacy; safety assessments will be conducted bilaterally.  
At Visit 2 ( Day 5)  subjects will return to the clinical site, and microbial culture and ophthalmic 
evaluations of safety and efficacy will be conducted.

Methodology (c ontinued):  
At Visit 3 (Day 8) subjects will return to the clinical site for final microbial culture, and ophthalmic 
evaluations of safety and efficacy.  
Randomized study medication (vancomycin or vehicle [placebo] ophthalmic ointment) will be 
provided in identical -appearing tubes. The identity of the study medications will be masked to the 
subject, Investigator, study personnel responsible for ophthalmic evaluations, and sponsor personnel responsible for medical evaluation of the data.  
Number of Patients (P lanned):  Subjects will be enrolled at approximately 20 clinical sites, until the 
number of Gram -positive subjects has reached at least 75 per group.  
Inclusion Criteria:

    Study Procedures (continued):  
Eligible subjects will be randomized into the study, study medication will be dispensed, and subjects 
(or caregivers) will receive instruction and then administer the first dose of allocat ed study medication 
at the site.  
All 4 doses should be administer ed on Day  1 even if the intervals are shorter than  4 hours between 
doses.  On Days 2 -7 subjects will continue to administer the randomized study medication QID 
(approximately 4 hours between doses).  
Subjects should be reminded to bring the study diary to the clinical site at Visit 2 (Day 5). 
Visit 2 (Day 5) : At Visit 2, Day 5 (± 1 day) study site personnel will conduct diary review. Subjects 
will participate in microbial culture and ophthalmic assessments of safety and efficacy.  
Subjects must be reminded not to dose after their fourth dose on Day 7 and to bring all study 
medication materials and the study diary to the clinical site at Visit 3 (Day 8).  
Visit 3 (Day  8): At Visit 3, Day 8 (+ 1 day)  subjects will return all study medication to the clinical site. 
Study site personnel will conduct diary review and study drug accountability procedures. Subjects will participate in final ophthalmic assessments of safety and efficacy.  
If the subject conti nues to show signs of inf ection in either eye at Day 8, the subject will be treated per 
the Investigator’s standard of care. Study treatment will not be administered after the last dose on Day 
7. 
Efficacy Assessments: Efficacy will be assessed by the investigator’s grading of 3 clinical signs on 4 point scales: Conjunctival discharge on a scale of 0 3 (where 0 is absent and 3 is severe), and bulbar 
conjunctival injection and palpebral conjunctival injection each graded separately on a scale of  0 3 
(where 0 is none and 3 is severe),  as well as by microbial culture.  
Safety Assessments: Safety will be assessed by Snellen visual acuity, biomicroscopy, and adverse event assessment.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  The primary endpoints comprise a set of hypotheses t hat will be tested in a 
hierarchical fashion.  
Primary Efficacy  Endpoint : Proportion of subjects at Visit 3 (Day 8) with:  
• Clinical resolution of bacterial conjunctivitis (defined as absence of conjunctival discharge, 
bulbar conjunctival injection and palpebral conjunctival injection)  
• Microbial eradication (absence of all Gram -positive bacterial species present at baseline)  
The difference in proportion in the two treatment groups will be tested by the chi -square test with a 
significance level of 0.05. In orde r to control the Type I error rate these two endpoints will be tested 
sequentially in the order described above. If the null hypothesis for the clinical resolution endpoint can 
be reje cted at P ≤ 0.05, the bacterial eradication endpoint will be tested at P ≤ 0.05

    Statistical Methods:  Primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the modified intent -to-treat 
(mITT ) population, which will consist of randomized subjects with Gram -positiv e bacterial 
conjunctivitis. Efficacy analysis will also be conducted on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, which 
will consist of all randomized subjects . Per protocol (PP) analys is will be conducted on those subjects 
in the mITT population who are compl iant in dosing, meeting study visits, and without significant 
protocol violations . Safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis set (all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of the allocated product).  
The analysis of continuous  and ordinal variables will use the applicable parametric methods (t -test, 
analysis of variance [ANOVA], and analysis of covariance [ ANCOVA] ). Descriptive statistics will be 
used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects [N], mean, standard devi ation or standard 
error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical variables (frequency and 
percentage) at each assessment time point.  
Sample Size: Subjects will be enrolled until the number of subjects with Gram -positive bacterial 
conjunct ivitis has reached at least 75 per group. A two- group chi -square test with a 0.05 two- sided 
significance level will have 90% power to detect  the difference between a Group  1 proportion of 0.75 
and a Group 2 proportion of 0.50 (odds ratio of 3.0) when the s ample size in each group is 77.

   4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  Information  
Vancomycin ointment 1.1% is a topical ophthalmic antibiotic ointment being investigated for  the 
treatment of moderate to severe bacterial conjunctivitis,  including infections caused by 
methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA )/methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus 
epidermidis  (MRSE ). The initial nonclinical and clinical development of th is product was 
conducted by Toa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Toa), of Toyama, Japan and the product was 
approved in Japan by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in 2009. An 
extensive database comprising 100% of the patients treated with the d rug since its approval was  
maintained by Toa as a post -approval commitment.  
4.2. Rationale and Development for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe 
Bacterial Conjunctivitis  
External ocular infections such as those caused by MRSA or MRSE frequently are not serious 
but in rare cases may be severe enough to threaten vision. Sight -threatening eye infections 
caused by MRSA, including bilateral blindness from orbital cellulitis, panophthalmitis, and complete corneal flap melt after l aser-assisted in situ keratomileusis  (LASIK) have been reported 
(Rutar et al, 2005; Rutar et al, 2006; Rubinfeld and Negvesky, 2001). In a case study of 
3 patients with endogenous endophthalmitis caused by MRSA, 2 of the 3 patients experienced blindness in the affected eye and in the third patient, the affected eye had to be enucleated (Ness  and Schneider, 2009).  
When ocular infections due to resistant organisms such as MRSA/MRSE do not respond to empiric treatment with approved antibiotics, there are few treatment options, as methicillin resistance has been shown to be a marker for multidrug resistance (resistance to ≥4 antibiotic 
classes) ( Asbell et al, 2008a ; Haas et al, 2011 ). Both MRSA and methicillin -resistant 
coagulase -negative staphylococci (MR -CoNS, including Staphylococcus epidermidi s) isolates in 
one study showed considerable resistance to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, 
gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin), macrolides (azithromycin), β -lactams (penicillin), polypeptides 
(polymyxin B) and aminoglycosides ( Asbell et al, 2008a ). Trimethoprim was the only agent 
tested that showed activity against MRSA (vancomycin was not tested in this study). These results are consistent with an earlier analysis of surveillance data that showed an increasing 
prevalence of MRSA strains resistan t to multiple antibiotics, including all available 
fluoroquinolones ( Asbell et al, 2008b). In another study among MRSA and MR -CoNS isolates, 
46.5% and 58.3% of isolates, respectively, were resistant to ≥2 antibiotic classes and 11.5% and 6.3%, respectively, were resistant to 5 different drug classes, including the fluoroquinolones. Only vanco mycin, a member of the glycopeptides class of antibiotics, was active against all 
methicillin -resistant isolates ( Haas et al, 2011 ).  
The importance of treatment options for multidrug resistant ocular infections is indicated by the increasing incidence of ocular infections caused by MRSA and MRSE ( Cavuoto et al, 2007; 
Blomquist, 2006; Freidlin et al, 2007; Adebayo et al, 2011; Asbell et al, 2008b; Asbell et al, 2008a ; Haas et al 2011 ), including a significant proportion of cases in the community setting

 17  
   (Klevens et al, 2007; Blomquist,  2006; Miller et al, 2006). In addition to the surveillance study 
demonstrating the activity of vancomycin against all methicillin -resistant isolates ( Haas et al, 
2011), other case reports in the literature report successful tr eatment with vancomycin of several 
types of external ocular infections due to MRSA or MRSE, including conjunctivitis, corneal 
ulcers, keratitis, blepharitis, meibomianitis, dacryocystitis, and blepharoconjunctivitis 
(Brennen  and Muder, 1990; Eiferman et al , 1991; Lee et al, 2010; Rubinfeld and Negvesky, 
2001; Sotozono et al, 2002; Solomon et al, 2007; Ong et al, 2013; Sotozono et al, 2013; Khan et 
al, 1984; Fleischer et al, 1986; Goodman and Gottsch, 1988).  
Nonclinical studies demonstrated that the bactericidal action of vancomycin against S. aureus  
and the vegetative cells of Clostridium difficile  results primarily from inhibition of cell- wall 
biosynthesis. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial -cell-membrane permeability and 
ribonucleic acid ( RNA)  synthe sis (Vancocin package insert, 2011).  
Antibiotic sensitivity profiles suggest that vancomycin is the drug of choice to treat ocular 
infections due to MRSA/MRSE, but there currently is no approved ophthalmic formulation of 
vancomycin in the United States. Current ophthalmic vancomycin treatments must therefore be 
compounded. The inherent risks of compounding in general were well publicized during 2012, when contaminated methylprednisone acetate from the New England Compounding Center 
caused an outbreak of fun gal meningitis that killed 64 people in 20  states. Furthermore, the 
solution used for compounding can affect the tolerability of the treatment. For example, 
Fleischer and colleagues reported treatment of 2 patients with severe MRSE 
blepharoconjunctivitis w ith topical vancomycin hydrochloride prepared with sterile water, which 
they indicated caused significant ocular irritation likely due to the low pH and osmolality values. 
An alternate solution with phosphate -buffered artificial tears was rated more tolerable than sterile 
water or saline- based solutions by 10 healthy volunteers, but it retained antimicrobial activity for 
only 2 weeks ( Fleischer et al, 19 86). 
A more stable vancomycin formulation is particularly desirable for outpatients, who are likely to 
comprise a substantial proportion of patients seeking treatment for MRSA/MRSE infections. 
MRSA/MRSE infections were o nce considered primarily a nosocomial infection . However , 
MRSA has recently (since at least 2005) been found to be more associated with community  onset  
(~70%) than hospital onset (~30%) ( Klevens et al, 2007;  Blomquist,  2006). It is therefore 
anticipated that a substantial number of patients with ocular MRSA/MRSE will be treated in an 
outpatient setting.  
One previous study of the stability of va ncomycin ophthalmic solution compounded in artificial 
tears reported that while the solution was stable for 45 days when stored at - 10°C, at room 
temperature (25°C) it was stable for only 7 days and retained less than 85% of the original 
vancomycin concent ration at 10 days ( Fuhrman and Stroman, 1998). Vancomycin eye drops 
prepared in sodium chloride 0.9% were stable to 21 days at 4°C and 15 days at 25°C (Barbault et 
al, 1999). Another study demonstrated vancomycin ophthalmic solution in 5% glucose was 
stabl e for 3 months when frozen at - 20°C ( Sautou- Miranda et al, 2002).  
The vancomycin ointment 1.1% that is presently being investigated is formulated in a white 
petrolatum and mineral oil base, common in commercially -available ophthalmic ointments. It is 
stabl e for 3 years when stored at 2 -8°C in an aluminum tube.

   Nonclinical studies of vancomycin ointment 1.1% administered four times daily ( QID) suggest a 
good efficacy and safety profile, Studies in pigmented rabbits show rapid transport of 
vancomycin to the c ornea and conjunctiva, with low -to-no concentrations in the aqueous humor. 
A published study in pigmented rabbits suggested that vancomycin concentrations were more 
widely distributed after Bacillus subtilis -induced ocular infection as compared with normal  
rabbits, however, a characteristic which may enhance rapid onset and prolong the duration of the vancomycin antimicrobial effect in infected eyes ( Fukuda et al, 2003). Vancomycin was not 
detected in the serum of either the normal or infected rabbits, howe ver. These results are 
consistent with a Phase  1 clinical study in healthy volunteers, in which the concentration of 
vancomycin was below the limits of quantitation ( BLQ ) in all subjects, after both single -dose 
and repeated -dose administration. These resul ts suggest that systemic exposure to vancomycin is 
likely to be low, with few or no systemic effects.  
In a Phase 3 clinical study in patients with extraocular bacterial infections due to MRSA and MRSE that were refractory to at least a 3 -day course of a to pical fluoroquinolone, overall rates of 
bacterial eradication at end of treatment or discontinuation were 68.8% (11/16) for MRSA and 100% (2/2) for MRSE, in the per protocol set (PPS). In a postmarketing surveillance ( PMS ) 
database analysis , among the subs et of patients who were culture- positive for MRSA/MRSE and 
who had documented treatment failure on previous antibiotics and who received vancomycin as monotherapy, overall rates of bacterial eradication were 65.0% (106/163) for MRSA and 80.0% (16/20) for M RSE. The overall clinical response rate was 66.7% and f or conjunctivitis (the most 
common ocular infection studied), the response rate  was 71.4%. The safety of vancomycin 
ointment 1.1% was judged to be satisfactory and no significant tolerability issues we re observed.  
In the PMS  database, comprising 633 patients evaluable for safety and 519 evaluable for 
efficacy, the clinicians’ overall assessment of the clinical effects of treatment resulted in an 
82.6% efficacy rate overall, across all types of infectio ns. Across the entire safety database, 
serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were uncommon (14/718 patients); with only two SAEs (corneal 
disorder and corneal erosion) judged to be related to study treatment. Adverse events ( AEs) that 
resulted in discontinuation of drug were also uncommon across the entire safety database (21/718 patients): eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, corneal erosion, and application site pain were 
the most common AEs leading to discontinuation of drug (each observed in 4/718 patients). The 
most  common treatment- related AEs in the Phase 3 study (defined as AEs for which a causal 
relationship to the drug could not be ruled out) were eyelid edema and conjunctival hyperemia 
(each observed in 3/25 patients, 12.0%). The most common adverse drug reacti ons ( ADRs ) in 
the PMS study, defined as AEs considered possibly, probably, or remotely related to drug 
administration, were punctate keratitis, corneal erosion, and eyelid  edema (each reported in 5 
patients ; 0.8%), followed by eyelid erythema (4/633 patients; 0.6%), applicati on site pain (3/633 
patients; 0.5%), and corneal disorder , delayed therapeutic response, and application site 
discomfort (each reported in 2/633 patients ; 0.3% ). 
The planned Phase 3 clinical trial in the US will evaluate the safety and efficacy of v ancomycin 
ointment 1.1% in subjects with moderate to severe unilateral or bilateral bacterial conjunctivitis.  
4.3. Justification for Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Period  
The 1% concentration of vancomycin was chosen by Toa Pharmaceuticals to go into Phase 3 
clinical development. In the Phase 1 clinical study , systemic exposure was greater for subjects 
Vancomycin Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Ointment  Kurobe, LLC  
Protocol  KUR -1301- 101 Amendment 2  IND 119356  
 
 19  
   who received repeated administration of 2% versus 1% vancomycin, 9 of 10 subjects in the 
2% group had values above the detection limit in the urine as compared to 2 of 10 subjects in the 
1% group. D ata from nonclinical toxicity studies  also supported the 1% concentration. In 
repeated administration studies  in pigmented rabbits , the 3% concentration result ed in 
conjunctival redness and edema whereas the 1 % concentration did not produce these effects. 
Another  nonclinical study showed that corneal concentrations of  vancomycin  ophthalmic 
ointment were doubled when administered to  Bacillus subtilis -infected eyes as compared to 
normal eyes of Dutch- belted rabbi ts (Fukuda et al, 2003). C omputer simulation s predicted  QID  
administration of  the 2% concentration to rabbits with infected eye s would result in higher  
corneal  concentration s than administration of the  3% concentration to rabbits with  normal eye s. 
This suggest ed that administration of  the 2% concentration to infected eyes  could result in the  
same sort of mild toxicity as the  3% concentration  administered to normal eye s. 
The QID dosing regimen utilized in the  Phase 3 study conducted by Toa  and received by 76 % of 
the patients in the PMS  database was well tolerated and was  efficac ious against bacterial 
conjunctivitis. The treatment period in the Toa  clinical studies was 14 days. This has been 
modified to 7 days in the current study because the study population will not have refractory bacterial infections . Moreover, the disease is viewed to be self -limiting , and a 7 -day study 
duration has been  utilized in previous studies of drugs approved for  this indication.  
4.4. Good Clinical Practices Statement  
This study  will be  conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol, including all 
statements regarding confidentiality, and in compliance with International Conference of 
Harmonis ation  (ICH) guidelines, and all appl icable US  federal r egulations and local legal and 
regulatory requirements.  
4.5. Population to Be Studied  
Study subjects will be male or female subjects , 1 years of age and older , who have clinically 
diagnosed moderate to severe bacterial conjunctivitis, and who have tested negative for 
adenoviral conjunctivitis  according to the AdenoPlus® adenovirus test. See Section 7 for 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment in the 
trial.

   5. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
5.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vancomycin 
hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment 1.1%  dosed QID in patients with moderate to severe 
Gram -positive bacterial  conjunctivitis.

   6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This will be a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo- controlled study. Eligible 
subjects will enter the study with  clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis .  
At Screening/Visit 1 (D ay 1),  subjects will undergo AdenoPlus® conjunctival adenovirus 
screening testing. If the AdenoPlus test result is negative, the subject will undergo microbial 
culture (including susceptibility testing) and ophthalmic evaluations. If the AdenoPlus test res ult 
is positive, the subject will be considered a screen failure. Subjects confirmed to have met 
eligibility criteria will be randomized to 1  of 2 treatment arms . The s ubject (or caregiver) will 
administer  the allocated study medication QID to the infected  eye(s) approximately 4 hours apart 
for 7 days:   
• Vancomycin ophthalmic ointment 1.1% QID  
• Vehicle ointment (placebo) QID  
If both eyes are being treated, the eye with more severe signs of infection ( based on the sum of 
the 3 grading scales [ conjunctival disc harge, bulbar conjunctival injection, and palpebral 
conjunctival injection ]) will be considered the study eye. If the sum of the scales  for both eyes 
are equal, the default will be the right eye.  If a subject with a unilateral infection develops an 
infecti on in the contralateral eye, the subject should contact the clinical site and will be instructed 
to treat the contralateral eye with the study medication if signs of conjunctival discharge and/or 
injection are present. The eye originally treated will conti nue to be considered the study eye. 
Only the study eye will be assessed for efficacy; safety assessments will be conducted bilaterally.  
Randomized study medication (vancomycin or vehicle [placebo] ophthalmic ointment) will be provided in identical -appearin g tubes. The identity of the study medications will be masked to 
the subject, Investigator, study personnel responsible for ophthalmic evaluations, and sponsor 
personnel  responsible for medical evaluation of the data . 
If the subject continues to show signs  of in fection in either eye at Visit 3 ( Day 8 ), the subject will 
be treated per the Investigator’s standard of care. Study treatment will not be administered after the last dose on Day 7.  
6.2. Number of Subjects  
The study will re cruit subjects until the number of subjects with  Gram -positive bacterial 
conjunctivitis has reached at least 75 per group.  
6.3. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated at any time by Kurobe, LLC, following appropriate notification.

    8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
8.1. Description of Study Drug  
Vancomycin ophthalmic ointment is formulated as a white to pale yellow ointment containing a 
1.1% concentration of vancomycin hydrochloride in a white petrolatum and mineral oil base containing liquid paraffin and  white petrolatum, common in commercially available ophthalmic 
ointments. It is contained in an aluminum tube.  
8.2. Randomization and Masking  
Study medication will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (vancomycin ophthalmic ointment 1.1% QID, or vehicle ophthalmic ointment [placebo]). A randomized block design will be used and the 
randomization will be created by the biostatistician.  
If subjects meet eli gibility criteria (see  Section  7) at Screening/Baseline, Visit 1  (Day 1 ), subjects 
will be randomly assigned to masked study medication. Study sites will assign the next subject kit, taken sequentially, from the lowest to the highest numbered kits from within each shipment 
of study medication  as directed by Oculos  Clinical Research (Oculos) . A sufficient supply of 
randomized study medication from the assigned kit to last the duration of the trial will be 
dispensed to the subject after initial dosing at the study site on Day 1. The drug kit randomization 
number will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF . The perforated portion from the 2- part tear -off 
label will be affixed to the Study Drug Accountability Log.  
The study will be double masked. The study medication will be provided in identical- appearing 
boxes with no labeling indicating the identity of the study group or the contents of the tube. The boxes will contain identical appearing tubes (see Section 8.1). Study subjects, investigators and 
staff, and study management personnel will be masked to the identity of treatment until after the 
final database lock.  
8.2.1. Unmasking During the Study Period 
Should it be necessary to unmask a subject’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the 
investigator may obtain the treatment code for a given randomized subject from the 2 -part 
tear-off label from  the subject’s study medication kit. The randomization code is to be obtained 
only if a medical emergency exists and knowledge of the medication being taken will influence the medical management of the subject. In the event of emergency or life-threatening condition, 
the investigator may need to unmask the subject. The following procedure should be followed: 
1. The Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor via phone immediately before 
unmasking a subject, unless it is not possible to do so without risk to the subject. 
2. The Investigator should document the SAE and justification for unmasking in the Study 
Summary and Comments pages of t he eCRF.  
3. The Subject may continue to participate in the study at the Investigator’s discretion. If the subject is to be discontinued from study participation, then ALL procedures described in the Early Discontinuation Visit (Section 10.4) should be comple ted. 
Vancomycin Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Ointment  Kurobe, LLC  
Protocol  KUR -1301- 101 Amendment 2  IND 119356  
 
 25  
    4. The Investigator should contact Oculos  at Kurobe -Safety@pointguardllc.com  within 
24 hours with the randomization number, subject initials, details of the AE or SAE, any 
action taken, and whether the subject is continuing in the study.  
8.3. Concomitant Medications  
8.3.1. Permitted Medications and Treatments  
Therapy considered necessary for the subject’s welfare that will not interfere with the evaluation 
of the study medication may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. If there is any question 
as to whether the medication may interfere, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor 
or Sponsor. Whenever possible, medications should be administered in dosages that remain constant throughout the st udy duration.  
8.3.2. Prohibited Medications  
The Medical Monitor should be notified before prohibited medication or therapy is administered 
unless the safety of the subject requires immediate action. The decision to administer a 
prohibited medication or therapy should be done with the safety of the subject as the primary 
consideration. The Medical Monitor MUST be contacted to determine the permissibility of a 
specific medication or therapy and whether or not the subject should continue with study participation.  
Prohibited medications and therapies include:  
• Immunosuppressive therapies, including chemotherapy  
• Topical ophthalmic medications, including tear substitutes, within 2 hours before 
Screening and throughout the study period.  
• Use of topical ophthalmic antimicro bial therapy within 48 hours prior to Screening. 
(Use of topical ophthalmic antimicrobial therapy other than study medication is 
prohibited throughout the study period.)  
• Use of topical ophthalmic anti -inflammatory agents (eg, NSAIDs or steroids, 
including steroid -antibiotic combinations) within 48 hours prior to Screening and 
throughout the study period in either eye . Topical dermatologic steroids are  
permitted.  
• Use of systemic antimicrobial therapy for active respiratory tract, urinary tract, 
skin/soft tis sue, or otitis media infection within 72 hours prior to Screening and 
throughout the study period. Use of a topical dermatologic antibiotic is permitted. 
• Use of systemic steroids within 14 days of screening and throughout the study period. Inhaled , intrana sal, and topical dermatological  steroids are permitted.  
8.4. Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be monitored by subject diaries . At Visit 2  (Day 5) , site personnel 
will review diaries to assess  subject  compliance. At Visit 3  (Day 8) , the diaries wil l be collected .

Protocol  KUR -1301- 101 Amendment 2  IND 119356  
 
 26  
    Data entry into the clinical database will be performed by a designee of Oculos , the clinical 
research organization (CRO) responsible for managing the study.  
8.5. Discontinuation of Study Medication  
Subjects may be discontinued from study medica tion for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject has a clinically significant or serious AE that would not be consistent 
with continuation in the study, as  determined by the Investigator  or Medical Monitor  
• Pregnancy  
If a subject is discontinued from stud y medication, every effort should be made to encourage the 
subject to continue to attend study visits to be followed for safety, rather than withdrawing the subject from the study. Reasons for considering subject withdrawal from the study are discussed 
in Section 7.3. 
8.6. Study Medication Materials and Management  
8.6.1. Packaging and Labeling 
Study medication will be packaged and labeled at a central packaging facility. One kit per subject will be packed. The kit will contai n 2 boxes, and each box will contain 1 tube  of 
ointment . Clinical sites are to dispense study medication  kits, as directed by Oculos .  
8.6.2. Storage   
All study medication kits should be stored under refrigeration, 2- 8°C (36- 46°F), on initial receipt 
at the clinical site. Once the study medication is dispensed at the Baseline /Screening  visit 
(Day  1), it may be stored at room temperature, 20- 25°C ( 68-77°F), in the original packaging, and 
should be protected from light. Subjects will retain all opened and unopened s tudy medication 
materials ( tubes and boxes ) to return to the site on Day 8 . 
8.6.3. Administration  
Following randomization, site personnel will dispense study medication and instruct the subject (or caregiver, if the subject is not able to self -administer the medication) on administration 
procedures.

    Steps will include:  
• Washing the hands.  
• Tilting  the head back and, pressing the index  finger gently on the skin just beneath the 
lower eyelid, pull ing the lower eyelid awa y from the eye to make a space.  
• Squeez ing a thin strip of ointment into this space. It should be approximately 1 cm 
(approximately 1/3 inch).  
• Letting go of the eyelid and gently clos ing the eyes , keep ing them closed for 
approximately 1 minute .  
• Avoid touching  the applicator tip to any surface (incl uding the eye). After using the 
study medication , wipe the tip of the tube with a clean tissue and keep the tube tightly 
closed.  
• If both eyes are to be dosed, repeat the process for the second eye, beginning with 
washing the hands.  
Study medication will be  applied QID, with approximately 4 hours between each dose.  
8.6.4. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designee (eg, study coordinator or pharmacist) will maintain a full 
accountability record  for the study medication and will be responsible for recordi ng the receipt, 
dispensing, and return of all supplies of the study drug using the inventories supplied by the 
Sponsor. Each subject’s kit will contain sufficient study medication for the duration of the trial .

9.4.1. AdenoPlus® Test 
RPS AdenoPlus® conjunctival adenovirus  test will be performed at the beginning of Visit 1 
(Screening/Baseline ). A positive result on the AdenoPlus® test will automatically render the 
subject a screen failure.  
9.5. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
9.5.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
9.5.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject administered a 
study medication (pharmaceutical/biological product) that does not necessarily have a causal relationship to this medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable an d unintended sign 
(including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Study medication includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator product or vehicle placebo 
that is given during any phase of the study.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results 
constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by open -ended questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study . At each clinic visit, study personnel should ask the following question: "Have 
you had any problems since your last visit?” AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through study assessments. 
9.5.1.2. Serious A dverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death, 
• Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer  to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (excluding 
progression/outcome of the disease under study);  
Vancomycin Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Ointment  Kurobe, LLC  
Protocol  KUR -1301- 101 Amendment 2  IND 119356  
 
 31  
    • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• Requires inpatien t hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or  
• Is medically significant; ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the health of the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospital admission, or a 
hospitalization that is elective or is a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not 
considered an SAE.  
All SAEs that are ongoing at the time of completion or discontinuation from the study will be followed until stabilization or resolution of the event. 
9.6. Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of AEs to the  study medication should be assessed by the Investigator using the 
definitions below. 
Not suspected: The temporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlyi ng conditions provide 
a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Suspected: The temporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal relationship possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered  “suspected.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by the Sponsor to be “suspected” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting  (see Section 9.8) . 
9.7. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question from the study personnel or revealed by observation, regardless of severity  or potential 
association with the study medication or study procedures, will be recorded in the eCRF . 
Clinically significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate should be reported as AEs. All AEs that occur after a subject has signed the informed consent form  until the final study visit, 
Visit 3 ( Day 8 ), should be collected and recorded on the AE eCRF  page. Serious adverse events 
will be followed until the event is resolved or stabilized.  
Medical conditions/diseases occurring before the first dose of study medication during Visit 1 (Day  1) should be collected on the medical/ocular history pages of the eCRF . 
The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the following:  
Vancomycin Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Ointment  Kurobe, LLC  
Protocol  KUR -1301- 101 Amendment 2  IND 119356  
 
 32  
    • Onset (date and time);  
• Resolution (date and time);  
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe);  
• Relationship to study medication (not suspected, suspected);  
• Action taken (none, study medication temporarily interrupted, study medication 
permanently discontinue d; concomitant medication taken; hospitalization/prolonged 
hospitalization; other); 
• Serious outcome (yes/no). 
The severity grade should be determined by the Investigator using the definitions below. 
• Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal dail y activity  
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activity  
• Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intens ity 
(as defined directly above) whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section 9.5.1.2 . 
An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and re corded on the pregnancy form. Pregnancy in 
itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational product may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous mis carriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study.  
9.8. Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from signing of infor med consent  until the 
final study visit, Visit 3 (Day 8),  following the end of treatment exposure. Any SAEs 
“suspected” to be related to the investigational product and discovered by the Investigator at any time after  the study should be reported to Oculos .  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported to Oculos within 24 hours of its occurrence or within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported to Oculos as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of 
the Investigator receiving the information. Information about all SAEs will be collected and recorded on the SAE form. All pertinent medical records and information collected during the treatment and follow -up of the subject s hould be maintained at the site with a copy emailed to 
Kurobe -Safety @pointguardllc.com . The Investigator must assess the SAE relationship and 
complete the SAE form. Oculos may request additional information. Follow -up information (eg, 
discharge summary) wi ll be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be emailed to Kurobe -
Safety @pointguardllc.com . 
In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF  page with the serious 
question marked “Yes”.  
Vancomycin Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Ointment  Kurobe, LLC  
Protocol  KUR -1301 - 101 Amendment 2  IND 119356  
 
 33  
    It is the investigator’s responsibility to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a  timely basis 
as instructed by the Spons or following the Spons or’s determination of  causality.  
All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and und ergo the appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations unti l stabilization or  resolution of  the event.  
Kurobe will report all SAEs to the US Food a nd D rug Administration (FDA) on the appropriate 
schedule depending if the event is drug related or not drug related, expected, une xpected (based 
on the available inform ation in the Investigator’s Brochure ). 
Any death occurring during the study and follow up pe riod should be reported as an SAE. For 
any death occurring through the end of  the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to study 
drug, the SAE resulting i n the death must be reported to Oculos. A death occurring after 
 completion of  the study  at Visit 3  (Day 8 ) that is not reasonably associated with study drug 
 administration, doe s not require completion of  the SAE form.

    11. STATIST ICS 
11.1. General Considerations  
This will be a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, active - and placebo -controlled study. 
Eligible subjects will enter the study with unilateral or bilateral moderate to severe bacterial 
conjunctivitis. At Screening/ Baseline, Visit 1 (Day 1),  subjects will undergo AdenoPlus® 
conjunctival adenovirus screening testing. If the AdenoPlus test result is negative, the subject will undergo microbial culture (including susceptibility testing) and ophthalmic evaluations. If the AdenoPlus test result is positive, the subject will be considered a screen failure. Subjects 
confirmed to have met eligibility criteria will be randomized to 1  of 2 treatment  arms and will 
administer the allocated study medication QID to the infected eye(s) approx imately 4 hours apart 
for 7 days:  
• Vancomycin ophthalmic ointment 1.1% QID  
• Vehicle ointment (placebo) QID  
A biostatistician will perform statistical analyses as agreed with the Sponsor  according to the 
Statistical Analysis Plan. Any additional or supplemental data analysis performed independently 
by an investigator shall be submitted to the Sponsor  for review.  
The analysis of continuous and ordinal variables will use the a pplicable parametric methods 
(t-test, analysis of variance [ANOVA], analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]).  Descriptive 
statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects [N], mean, standard deviation or standard error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and 
categorical variables (frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point.  (The time points 
at which data are collected are specified in the schedule of observations —see Table 2 ) 
Within -group changes for continuous and categorical outcomes will be assessed using 
95% confidence intervals (CIs).  
All subjects with clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis will be treated and followed, but 
only those eyes with Gram -positive bacterial conjunctivitis will be included in the primary 
analysis of efficacy.  
11.2. Determination of  Sample Size  
A two group chi -square test with a 0.05 two- sided significance level will have 90% power to 
detect the difference between a Group 1 proportion of 0.75 and a Group 2 proportion of 0.50 
(odds ratio of 3.0) when the sample size in each group is 77. The  mITT population of the active 
treatment group will be compared to the mITT population of the vehicle group.

Protocol  KUR -1301- 101 Amendment 2  IND 119356  
 
 38  
    11.3. Analysis Populations  
11.3.1. Populations for Efficacy Analysis  
11.3.1.1. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as  all randomized subjects. A n ITT analysis with 
LOCF for missing data will be conducted as a secondary  efficacy analysis for all efficacy 
endpoints. 
11.3.1.2. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT ) population consists of those subjects in the ITT population 
who have Gram -positive  bacterial conjunctivitis . 
11.3.2. Per Protocol Analyses  
The per protocol population will consist of those subjects in the mITT who are compliant in 
dosing, meeting study visits and without significant protocol vio lations.  
11.3.3. Population for Safety Analysis  
The safety analys is population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose of the allocated study medication . Both eyes will be analyzed.  
11.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject de mographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT analysis 
population; however, should there be a reasonable difference in the size of the ITT and safety analysis populations, demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for both. The 
comparability of groups used in comparison analyses will be characterized in tables of 
demographic data. Summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
11.5. Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on Visit 3 ( Day 8 ).  
Efficacy data will be presented in tables of descriptive statistics and frequency distribution. All summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
For the primary efficacy analysis, those who require rescue interventions or who are lost to 
follow up will be considered treatment failures.  
11.5.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoints comprise a set of hypotheses that will be tested in a hierarchical fashion. 
The primary efficacy endpoints are: proportion of subjects at Visit 3 (Da y 8) with: 
• Clinical resolution of bacterial conjunctivitis (defined as absence of conjunctival 
discharge, bulbar conjunctival injection and palpebral conjunctival injection)  
Vancomycin Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Ointment  Kurobe, LLC  
Protocol  KUR -1301- 101 Amendment 2  IND 119356  
 
 39  
    • Microbial eradication (absence of all Gram -positive bacterial species present at 
baseline)  
The difference in proportion in the two treatment groups will be tested by the chi -square test with 
a significance level of 0.05. In order to control the Type I error rate these two endpoints will be 
tested sequentially in the order described above. If the null hypothesis for the clinical resolution endpoint can be rejected at P ≤ 0.05, the bacterial eradication endpoint will be tested at P ≤ 0.05 
11.6. Safety Analyses 
Safety assessments will include  VA using current corrective lenses and/or pinhole , if applicable, 
slit lamp examination  (both conducted bilaterally ), urine pregnancy test (for women of 
childbearing potential only), and collection of adverse events.  
Safety data will be presented in tables of descriptive statistics and frequency distribution . All 
summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.

subject’s welfare. No information that can be related to a specific individual subject will be 
released or used in any fashion without the signed written consent of that subject. All reports and communications relating to study subjects will identify subjects only by initials and subject 
identification number. Complete subject identification will be kept by the Investigator for 
purposes of long -term follow -up, if needed. This information will be treated with strict 
adherence to professional st andards of confidentiality.  
13.5. Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by Oculos to assure compliance with the study protocol and the quality of the data collected. Monitoring visits may occur as required and could include a study initiation visit, a mon itoring visit, and a study close -out visit. Training will be provided for key 
investigative personnel in all aspects of study conduct. 
During visits to the study site, the monitor may review the source documents including but not 
limited to signed informed consent forms, patient diaries, study medication accountability and 
storage, and the reporting procedures for AEs and SAEs . All data generated during this study and 
the medical records/documents from which they originated are subject to inspection by Ocul os, 
the study Sponsor , the FDA, and other regulatory agencies. The investigator must notify Oculos 
promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory authorities. 
Upon completion of the study, the clinical monitor will conduct a final visit (closeout) to the site. 
The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all regulatory records and reports are complete, 
verify that the study drug and other supplies have been accounted for, and ensure that the 
investigators are aware of their responsibilities once the study ends.  
The Investigator is responsible for permitting the Sponsor direct access to any study documents 
for monitoring and auditing purposes, for providing adequate space for monitoring, and for 
addressing any questions or issues that might be rai sed by the monitor or auditor on a timely 
basis.  
13.6. Case Report Forms and Study Records  
All data relating to study procedures will be entered by site personnel directly onto eCRFs 
provided by Oculos . The eCRF is the first place the majority of the study data  will be recorded; 
therefore, the electronic data captured will be the source. In general, paper source documents will 
not be created, but when generated , source documents (eg, original patient diaries, discharge 
summaries, etc.) will be retained at the study site.  
13.7. Protocol Violations/Deviations  
The Investigator should not deviate from the requirements of this protocol without prior written 
approval of the Medical Monitor at Oculos , with the exception of a medical emergency.  
A significant protocol violation  must be reported to Oculos upon discovery . Protocol deviations 
should be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB guidelines.

    All changes to the protocol will be made by Kurobe, LLC, or designee as an approved 
amendment to  the protocol, submitted to the  FDA,  and approved by  the IRB prior to 
implementation.   
13.8. Access to Source Documentation  
A trial- related monitoring audit, review by the IRB, and/or regulatory inspection may be 
conducted at any time during or after completion of a study. The Investigator wi ll be given 
adequate notice if he/she is selected for an audit and must provide direct access to study 
documentation. The audit may include, but is not limited to, a review of all informed consent forms; a review of medical records; a review of regulatory documentation; an assessment of 
study conduct and protocol compliance; and a review of the investigational drug product receipt, 
storage, and administration. 
13.9. Data Generation and Analysis  
Management of data and the production of the clinical study report wi ll be the responsibility of 
Kurobe.  
During the course of the trial, data queries will be generated for data items that are potentially erroneous and require appropriate clarification or correction. Such clarifications and corrections will be discussed with  and approved by study site personnel and appropriately documented. Prior 
to database lock, data listings will be generated and anomalous values investigated.  
13.9.1. Retention of Data  
All study -related records must be maintained  for at least 2 years after a marketing application is 
approved for the drug. If an application is not approved for the drug, all study -related records 
must be maintained until at least 2 years after shipment and delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA or regula tory agencies have been so notified. The 
investigator will not discard any records without notifying Kurobe . If the principal investigator 
moves from the current study  site, Kurobe  should be notified of the name of the person who will 
assume responsibility  for maintenance of the records at the study  site or the new address at which 
the records will be stored. The investigator will notify Kurobe  as soon as possible in the event of 
accidental loss or destruction of any study documentation. 
If it becomes neces sary for Oculos/Kurobe  or the FDA or relevant regulatory authority to review 
any documentation relating to the study, the Investigator must permit access to such records.

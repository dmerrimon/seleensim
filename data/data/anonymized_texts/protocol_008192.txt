SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209139
Protocol Title :  A Single -Arm , Open -Label, Phase 2 Study of Nivolumab (BMS -9365 58) in Subjects with 
Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) After Failure of Autologous Stem Cell 
Transplant (ASCT) or After Failure of At Least Two Prior Multi -Agent Chemotherapy Regimens in Subjects Who 
Are Not Candidates for ASCT
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Nivolumab (BMS -936558) administered IV over 60 minutes at 3 mg/kg every  2 weeks until 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment beyon d progression is allowed as specified in protocol section 4.3.8.
Study Phase:   2b
 
 
.
Prim ary Objective
To assess the clinical benefit of nivolumab, as measured by independent radiologic review committee (IRRC) 
assessed objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with DLBCL who are refractory or have relapsed following 
ASCT or after failure of at least twoprior m ulti-agent chemotherapy regimens in ASCT ineligible patients.
Secondary Objectives(s)
To assess the duration of response (DOR) based on IR RC assessments
To assess the complete r emission rate (CR R) and the duration of CR based on IR RC assessment
To assess the PR rate and the duration of PR based on IRRC assessment
To assess the progression free survival (PFS) based on IR RC assessment
To assess the ORR, based on investigator assess ments
Study Design:  This is a single -arm Phase 2 study in subjects 18 years old with relapsed or refractory DLBCL or 
transformed lymphoma (TL) after failure of ASCT or after failure of at least twoprior multi -agent chem otherapy 
regimens in subjects who are not ASCT candidates . Approximately 120 subjects will be treated with nivolumab 
3mg/kg IV every  2 weeks. Subjects w ill undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 day s prior 
to first dose. Each 14 -day dosing period w ill constitute a cycle. Tumor assessments will begin 8 weeks after the start 
of therapy  and follow the schedule shown in Table 5.4.1 -1. An independent radiology review  committee (IRRC) will 
also be utilized. The primary endpoint of this study is IRRC -assessed ORR, using the 2007 revised International 
Working Group Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma criteria. Secondary endpoints include IRRC -assessed DOR, as 
well as CRR, duration of CR, PR rate, duration of PR, and PFS as determined by IRRC and ORR based on 
investigator assessment. Collection of fresh tumor tissue (FFPE tumor tissue block or 10 unstained slides from a 
biopsy performed during the screening phase or collected as a standard of care procedure within 90 days prior to

7)Chest radiation 24 w eeks prior to the first dose of study drug
8)Carmustine (BCNU) 1000 mg received as part of pre- transplant conditioning regimen
Study Assessments: The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR), as determined by an independent 
radiologic review  committee (IRRC) according to the 2007 revised International Working Group Criteria for 
Mali gnant Lymphoma. Subjects will be assessed for response by imaging (spiral CT/MRI) beginning at week 8 and 
follow  the schedule shown in Table 5.4.1 -1. A PET scan is required to confirm CR.
Subjects that discontinue study treatment to receive an allogeneic SCT or ASCT will have tumor assessment and 
GVHD evaluations performed as described in sections 5.3 and 5.4.
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size:  The planned sample size for this study will be approximately 120 treated subjects ,placed into two 
groups of subjects based on prior ASCT failure [n = 90] or ASCT ineligibility [n = 30] .
For the ASCT -failed cohort, a modified Simon's two-stage design will be used to test the null hypothesis that the 
true ORR is 20% (not considered clinically compelling). In the first stage, 37 subjects will be accrued. If there are 
8 or few er responses in these 37 subjects, the study will be stopped. Otherw ise, approximately 53 additional patients 
will be accrued to target a total of 90 treated subjects. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 25 or more responses 
are observed in 90 treated subjects. This design yields a one-sided type I error rate of 5% and power of 90% when 
the true response rate is 35%. 
For the ASCT ineligib le cohort, the sample size of 30 treated subjects is determined to achieve a confidence interval 
(CI) width around the ORR estimate with a sufficient level of precision. If the observed number of subjects with 
ORR is 10 (33%), the w idth of the exact 2 -sided 95% CI is 36% w ith a low er bound of 17.3%. 
Endpoints:
The primary endpoint is IR RC-assessed ORR. The secondary endpoints are duration of ORR (DOR) based on IRRC 
assessments, IRRC-assessed complete remission rateand duration of CR, IRRC -assessed PR rate and duration of 
PR,IRRC-assessed progression free survival (PFS), and investigator -assessed ORR.
Analyses:   
The IRRC-assessed ORR will be summarized for each cohort by binom ial response rates and their corresponding 
two-sided 90% and 95% exact CIs. The method proposed by Atkinson and Brown will be used to estimate the CI for 
the ASCT failed cohort. This confidence interval takes into account the group sequential nature of the two-stage 
design. The Clopper -Pearson method w ill be used to estimate the CI for the ASCT ineligible cohort. 
The IR RC-assessed DOR will be summarized by cohort for subjects who achieve PR or CR using the Kaplan -Meier 
(KM) product -limit method. Median values of DOR, along w iththetwo-sided 95% CI susing amethod based on the 
log-log transformation , will also be calculated.
IRRC-assessed CRR, PRR and investigator -assessed ORR will be summarized similarly to the primary endpoint. 
Duration of CR and PR will be summarized similarly to DOR . IRRC-assessed PFS will be sum marized descriptively 
by cohort using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method. Median values of PFS, along with thetwo-sided 
95% CIsusing amethod based on the log -log transformation , will also be calculated.

3.Obtain an informed consent signed and personally  dated by the subject or the subject's 
legally  acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion. 
4.Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent 
form and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the 
study, and after any  revisions are completed for new information.
5.If informed consent is initially  given by a subject’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently  becomes capable of making and communicating his 
or herinformed consent during the study , consent must additionally  be obtained from the 
subject.
6.Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertine nt aspects of the study  and of any new information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study . This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality  of records that could identify  subjects must be protected, respe cting the 
privacy  and confidentiality  rules applicable to regulatory  requirements, the subjects' signed ICF 
and, in the US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory  authorities have direct 
access to subject records. 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects with or severe dementia) may  
only be enrolled in the study  with the consent of a legally  acceptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study  to the extent compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or she should personall y sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a subject who is unable to give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing information to 
refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study  at any time should be 
considered b y the investigator.
The rights, safet y, and well -being of the study  subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
3 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a single -arm Phase 2 study  in subjects 18 years old with relapsed or refractory  DLBC L, 
or transformed lymphoma (TL), after failure of ASCT or after failure of at least two prior 
multi- agent chemotherapy  regimens in subjects who are not ASCT candidates. Approximately  
120 subjects will be treated with nivolumab 3mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Subjects will be placed 
into treatment groups based on prior ASCT failure [n =90] or ASCT ineligibility  [n=30].

For the ASCT -failed cohort, a two-stage design will be used to test whether nivolumab yields a 
clinically  compelling objective response rate. In the first stage, responses will be evaluated by 
the IRRC on the first 37 subjects treated . If there are 8 or fewer responses in these 37 subjects, 
the study  will be stopped. In this case, the study  will be terminated in both the ASCT -failed 
cohort aswell as the ASCT ineligible cohort. Otherwise, approximately  53 additional subjects 
will be accrued into the ASCT -failed cohort to target a total of 90 treated subjects. The 
tolerability  of the regimen will continue to be evaluated by the sponsor with theinvestigators to 
ensure that it is acceptable for continued enrollment. For the ASCT ineligible cohort a 
single -stage design will be used to estimate the objective response rate using approximately 
30treated subjects.
NOTE: During the evaluation of respo nse in the first 37 ASCT -failed subjects treated, 
recruitment and treatment of subjects will continue for both the ASCT -failed and ASCT 
ineligible cohorts.
Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility  within 28days prior to first 
dose. Each 14-day dosing period will constitute a cycle. Tumor assessments will begin 8 weeks 
after the start of therapy  and will continue every  8 weeks through the first 8months of treatment , 
every  12 weeks from months 9 to year 2, and then every  6 months until disease progression
(Table 5.4.1-1). An independent radiology  review committee (IRRC) will also be utilized. The 
primary  endpoint of this study  is IRRC-assessed objective response rate(ORR) , using the 2007
revised International Working Group Criter ia for Malignant Lymphoma criteria (Appendix 2).
Secondary  endpoints include IRRC-assessed duration of objective response (DOR) , as well as 
complete remission rate(CRR), duration of CR, PR rate, duration of PR,and progression free 
survival ( PFS)as determined by  IRRC assessment and ORR based on investigator assessment.

Additional survival analysis will be conducted for up to 5 years beyond analysis of the primary  
endpoint.
This study  will consist of three phases: screening, treatment, and follow -up.
Screening (see Table 5.1 -1)
Begins by establishing the subject ’s initial eligibility  and signing of the informed consent
form (ICF).
Subject is enrolled using the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to obtain a subject 
ID.
Confirm that documentation ofrelapsed or refractory  DLBCL, or TL is present in the 
subject’s medical record;
Submission of tumor tissue (FFPE tumor tissue block or 10 unstained slides) from a 
biopsy  performed within 90 days prior toobtaining informed consent is mandatory  for 
determination of PD-L1 expression status. If tissue taken as part of a standard of care 
procedure within 90 days prior to obtaining informed consent is not available, then a 
biopsy  must be perform ed during the screening period and submitted accordingl y.
Biopsy  samples should be excisional, incisional or core needle
Subjects may initiate study  drug therap y prior to the determination of PD-L1 expression 
status.
NOTE: In rare cases where tumor tissue, obtained during screening or within 90 day s prior to
obtaining informed consent, cannot be provided, the reason must be clearly  documented in 
the medical record AND the BMS Medical Monitor must be contacted. Archival tissue, if 
available, should be subm itted for these subjects. Submission of archival tissue is also 
encouraged for all subjects, irrespective of whether tumor biopsy  tissue is available as 
specified .
Confirm that a bone marrow biopsy /aspirate wasperformed within 90 day s prior toobtaining  
informed consent in the subject’s medical record;
If a bone marrow biopsy /aspirate was not performed within 90 days prior toobtaining 
informed consent , a bone marrow biops y/aspirate must be performed during the screening 
period.
If a bone marrow biops y/aspirate needs to be performed during the screening period,
submission of an aspirate sample for biomarker analy ses is optional as per Table 5.1-
1
Subjects may begin study  drugtreatment before bone marrow biops y results become 
available; results ne ed to be documented in the subject’s medical record later
The Revised International Prognostic Index (IPI) as determined at the time of initial disease 
diagnosis must be reported in the eCRF (See Appendix 3)
Baseline disease or tumor assessments should be performed within 28 days of first dose of 
study  drug, according to Table 5.1-1

Subject is assessed for study  eligibility  within the required timeframe found in Table 5.1-1.
The screening phase either ends with confirmation of full eligibility  and treatment of the
subject or with the confirmation that the subject is a screen failure.
Treatment : (see Table 5.1 -2)
Treatment begins with the call to the IVRS to obtain vial assignments. A negative pregnancy  
test should be documented within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product.
Subsequently , women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a pregnancy  test every 
4 weeks (7 day s) regardless of dosing schedule.
The subject should receive the dose of study  medication within 1 day  of vial assignment.
Subjects may  be dosed no less than 12 day s between doses and no more than 3 day s after the 
scheduled dosing date. Dose given after the 3-day window is considered a dose delay. A 
maximum delay  of 42 day s between doses is allowed.
On-study  laboratory  assessments should be drawn within 72 hours prior to dosing.
Adverse event assessments should be documented at each clinic visit.
  
Study  drug is administered as an IV infusion over 60 minutes on Treatment Day 1 of each 
cycle until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity , withdrawal of study  
consent, or the study  ends. Treatment beyond progression is allowed in certain instances as 
described in Section 4.3.8 .
Study  drug dosing may  be delay ed for toxicity . See Section s 4.3.2 and 4.3.4 .
Subjects will be evaluated for tumor response according to the 2007 revised International 
Working Group Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Appendix 2) by spiral CT/MRI 
beginning at week 9 and continuing every  8 weeks (+/- 1 week) through the first 8 months, 
every  12 weeks (+/- 2weeks) months 9-24, and then every  6 m onths (+/-3 weeks) thereafter
until disease progression is documented or until the subject initiates a preparative regimen for 
allogeneic SCT or ASCT, whichever occurs earlier. If the subject discontinues treatment 
prior to disease progression, tumor assessment w ill continue in the follow -up phase.
Screening/Baseline and all subsequent scans will be submitted to an IRRC, once the subject 
has been enrolled and throughout the stud y period.
Quality of Life (QoL) tools must be completed at Treatment Day 1 prior to thefirst dose of 
study  drug. Following that, QoL tools will be completed according to the schedule in Table 
5.1-2.
This phase ends when the subject is discontinued from study  therap y. For a complete list of
reasons for treatment discontinuation, see Section 3.5and 4.3.5.
Follow -Up Phase (See Table 5.1 -3):
Begins when the decision to discontinue a subject from study  therap y is made (no further
treatment with study  therapy ).

Subjects will have two follow -up visits for safety. Follow -up visit 1 (X01), 35days from the 
last dose (+/-7d) and follow -up visit 2 (X02) 80 days (+/- 7d) later. After X02, subjects will 
be followed every  3 months for ongoing drug-related adverse events until resolved, return to 
baseline or deemed irreversible, or until lost to follow -up, or withdrawal of study  consent .

Subjects who discontinue study  therap y for reasons other than disease progression or to 
receive an allogeneic or autologous stem cell transp lant, will continue to have radiographic 
assessments at the intervals described in the Treatment Phase until disease progression, lost

For subjects who discontinue study  therap y by proceeding to allogeneic SCT or ASCT, 
tumor assessment by the investigator will be required after allogeneic SCT or ASCT (see 
Section 3.6). For the subjects who discontinue study  therap y by proceeding to allogeneic 
SCT, acute and chronic GVHD documentation will also be simultaneously  collected (see 
Section 5.3).
After completion of the two follow -up visits for safet y, subjects will be followed every 
3months for survival , until death, lost to follow -up or withdrawal of study  consent .
QoL tools will be completed accord ing to the schedule in Table 5.1-3

eligibility  criteria.
3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical steriliza tion (hysterectomy  or bilateral 
oophorectom y) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In 
addition, women under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Women treated with hormone replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely  to have artificiall y 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/ml at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products, (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other pare nteral products may  require washout periods as long as 6 months.

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-investigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for an y of the following reas ons:
Disease progression as determined by investigator assessment following the guidelines given 
in section 5.4 except as outlined in section 4.3.8 Treatment Bey ond Disease Progression.
Subject’s request to stop study  treatment
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study  is not in the 
best interest of the subject
Termination of the study  by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)
Loss of abilit y to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psy chiatric or ph ysical (eg, infectious disease) illness
Additional protocol -specified reasons for discontinuation (see Section 4.3.5 )
In the case of pregnancy , the investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study  drug will be permanently  discontinued in 
an appropriate manner. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/r isk ratio that 
warrants continuation of study  drug, a discussion between the investigator and the BMS Medic al 
Monitor/designee must occur.
All subjects who discontinue investigational product should compl y with protocol specified 
follow -up procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only exception to this requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treatment study  follow -up or 
loses the ability  to consent freel y (ie,is imprisoned or involuntaril y incarcerated for th e treatment 
of either a ps ychiatric or phy sical illness ).
If study  treatment is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropria te case report form (CRF) page.

3.6 Post Treatment Study Follow  up
In this study , ORR and DOR are key endpoint sof the study . Post treatment study  follow -up is of 
critical importance and is essential to preserving subject safet y and the integrit y of the study .
Subjects who discontinue study  treatment must continue to be followed for collection of outcome 
and/or survival follow -up data as required and in line with Section 5until death or the conclusion 
of the study .
In addition, subjects who discontinue study  therapy  by proceeding to allogeneic SCT or ASCT 
will require tumor assessment (CR or non-CR) by the investigators according to the 2007 IWG 
criteria on Day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every  year thereafter from the date of stem cell 
infusion until the first non-CR after SCT is documented (see Section 5.4). For the subjects who 
discontinue study  therapy  by proceeding to allogeneic SCT, documentation of acute and chronic 
GVHD will be simultaneously  collected (see Section 5.3).
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study  treatment will remain in the study  and must continue 
to be followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
subject specifically  withdraws consent for any  further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this informati on. Subjects should notify  the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in d etail in the medical records by the i nvestigator, as 
to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study  
procedures and/or post treatment study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In 
the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  
available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the subjec t as noted above. Lost to 
follow -up is defined by the inability  to reach the subject after a minimum of three documented 
phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. 
All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obt ain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third- party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study  
has been included in the subjec t’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor -retained third- party  represent ative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact 
information or other public vital status data necessary  to complete the follow -up portion of the 
study .The site staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public 
health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If after all

4.1.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study , including products alread y with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently  than the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
In this protocol, investigation al product(s) is/are: BMS -936558 (nivolumab).
BMS -936558 100 mg (10 mg/mL) will be packaged in an open- label fashion.
Ten BMS -936558, 10 mL vials will be packaged within a carton (see Table 4.1-1), and are not 
subject or treatment arm specific. Vial assign ments by  subjects will be made through the IVRS to 
track usage and resupply . 
4.1.2 Non- investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be 
considered as non -invest igational products. 
In this protocol, non -investigatio nal product(s) is/are: Not Applicable
4.1.3 Handling and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study  drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity ) as determined by BMS. If concerns

Nivolumab is to be administered as a 60-minute IV infusion, using a volumetric pump with a 
0.2/0.22 micron in-line filter at the protocol -specified dose. The drug can be diluted with 0.9% 
normal saline for delivery  but the total drug concentration of the solution cannot be below 
0.35 mg/mL . It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. At the end of the 
infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.
4.2 Method of Assigning Subject Identific ation
After the subject’s initial eligibility  is established and informed consent has been obtained, the 
subject must be enrolled into the study  by calling an interactive voice response system (IVRS) to 
obtain the subject number. Every  subject that signs the informed consent form must be assigned 
a subject number in IVRS. Specific instructions for using IVRS will be provided to the 
investigational site in a separate document.
The investigator (or designee) will register the subject for enrollment by following the 
enrollment procedures established by BMS. The following information is required for 
enrollment:
Date that informed consent was obtained
Date of birth
Gender at birth
4.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Eligible subjects will receiv e treatment with nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg as a 60-minute IV 
infusion, on Day 1 of a treatment cycle every  2 weeks. Dosing calculations should be based on 
the body  weight assessed as per Table 5.1-2. If the subject’s weight on the day of dosing differ s 
by >10% from the weight used to calculate the dose, the dose must be recalculated. All doses 
should be rounded to the nearest milligram. There will be no dose escalations or reductions of 
nivolumab allowed. Subjects may  be dosed no less than 12 days between doses and no more than 
3 day s after the scheduled dosing date . There are no premedications recommended for nivolumab 
on the first cy cle. If an acute infusion reaction is noted, subjects should be managed according to 
Section 4.3.6.
Treatment may bedelay ed for up to a maximum of 6 weeks from the previous dose 
(See Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.4 ).
Tumor assessments by spiral CT/MRI  for allsubjects should continue as per protocol even if 
dosing is delay ed.
Subjects will be monitored continuously  for AEs while on study . Treatment modifications 
(eg,dose delay  or discontinuation) will be based on specific laboratory  and adverse event 
criteria.
4.3.1 Antiemetic Premedications
Antiemetic premedications should not be routinely administered prior to dosing of study  drug.

4.3.6 Treatment of BMS- 936558 -Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely  to be 
immunogenic and induce infusion or hy persensitivity  reactions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthalgias, 
hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like reactions. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusion reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the study  medical monitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
(Version 4.0) guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated) .
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptoms. The following 
prophy lactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhy dramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/parace tamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (Moderate reaction requires therapy  or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly  to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophy lactic 
medications indicated for 24 hours).
Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhy dramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen); 
remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or 
bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, 
restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further 
complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion 
rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab will be administered 
at that visit. Administer diphenhy dramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the 
subject until resolution of symptoms. The amount of study  drug infused must be recorded on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophy lactic premedications are 
recommended for future infusions: diphenhy dramine 50 mg (orequivalent) and/or paracetamol 
325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional

nivolumab administrations. If necessary , corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV 
hydrocortisone or equivalent) may  be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly  responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms 
following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal 
impairment, pulmonary  infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life-threatening; pressor or ventilatory  support 
indicated).
Immediately  discontinue infusion ofnivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly  for IV admi nistration, and/or diphenhy dramine 50mg IV with 
methy lprednisolone 100mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until 
the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be 
permanentl y discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaph ylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  of the 
symptoms. In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity  symptoms (eg, appearance of a 
localized or generaliz ed pruritis within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may 
be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).
4.3.7 Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome
The possibility  of tumor lysis syndrome cannot be ruled out for the subjects with lymphoma. 
Therefore, adequate management such as hydration and/or the use of allopurinol is 
recommended in the subjects who have risk factor of potential tumor lysis syndrome, for 
example the subjects with high tumor burden, reflected by high serum LDH levels, or bulky 
disease, or those with preexisting renal failure.
4.3.8 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
4.3.8.1 Circumstances in which post -progression treatment is permitted
Subjects meeting progression defined by relapsed disease (after CR) or progr essive disease 
(after PR, SD) per 2007 IWG criteria may continue receiving study medication beyond 
investigator -assessed progression as long as they  meet the following criteria:
Continue to meet all other study  protocol eligibility  criteria
Investigator -assessed clinical benefit, and do not have rapid disease progression 
Stable performance status 
Treatment beyond progression will not delay  an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression 
Patients will be re-consented with an informed consent document describing any reasonabl y 
foreseeable risks or discomfort and other alternative treatment options 
Tolerance of stud y drug

The decision to continue treatment bey ond investigator -assessed progression should be discussed 
with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the study  records. The assessment of clinical 
benefit should take into account whether the subject is clinically  deteriorating and unlikely  to 
receive further benefit from continued treatment.
4.3.8.2 Assessm ent schedule for the subjects with post- progression treatment
The subject should continue to receive monitoring according to the On-Treatment Assessments 
on Table 5.1-2 except for FDG -PET scans. Radiographic assessment by CT (preferred) or MRI 
described inthe section 5.4.1 and Table 5.4.1 -1are required when subjects continue 
post-progression treatment. FDG -PET scans are not mandated after investigator -assessed 
progression.
4.3.8.3 Discontinuation due to further progression
Subjects should discontinue study  therap y upon evidence of further progression, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions). 
Further progression is evaluated by a  subsequent CT or MRI which is performed at least 
8weeks from previous CT or MRI .  
The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression should be used as the reference 
baseline for comparison with the post -progression assessment.
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the long axis is 
more than 15 mm regardless of the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 11 to 
15mm, it should only  be considered measurable if its short axis is more than 10 mm.
Any new lesion considered non-measurable at the time of or after initial progression may 
become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden determination.
4.3.8.4 Radiographic assessment for subjects who discontinue study drug 
during post -progression treatment
Forsubjects that discontinue post-progression treatment, no additional radiographic assessment s
will be required . Upon treatment discontinuation, these subjects will continue in the follow -up 
phase of the study  (see section 5.1). Subjects who proceed to allogeneic SCT or ASCT will be 
followed as described in Section 5.4.
4.4 Blinding/Unblinding
Not applicable.

5.3 Safety  Assessments
At baseline, a medical history  will be obtained to capture relevant underl ying conditions. The 
baseline examinations should include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status, BP, HR, 
temperature, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry  at rest and after exertion should be 
performed within 28 days prior to first dose. Baseline signs and symptoms are those that are 
assessed within 14 days prior to first dose. Concomitant medications will be collected from 
within 14 day s prior to the first dose through the study  treatment period (see Table 5.1-1).
Baseline local laboratory  assessments should be done within 14 days prior to first dose to 
include: CBC w/differential, LFTs (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), uric acid,
BUN or serum urea level, creatinine, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, P, LDH, amylase, lipase glucose, 
urinaly sis, TSH, and Hep B and C testing (HBV sAg, HCV Ab, or HCV RNA) (see Table 5.1 -1). 
Pregnancy  testing for WOCBP (done locally ) must be performed at baseline (within 28days 
prior to first dose) and repeated within 24hours prior to the initial administration of study drug, 
then every  4 weeks (7 day s) regardless of dosing schedule.
Subjects will be evaluated for safety  if they have received any study  drug. Toxicity  assessments 
will be continuous during the treatment phase. During the safet y follow -up phase (Follow -up
visits X01 and X02, Table 5.1-3) toxicity  assessments should be done in person. Once subjects 
reach the survival follow -up phase, either in-person visits or documented telephone calls/email 
correspondence to assess the subject’s status are acceptable.
Adverse events and laboratory  values will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE version 4.0.
On-study  weight, ECOG performance status, and vital signs should be assessed at each on-study  
visit prior to nivolumab dosing and ay Cycle 1 Day 8. Vital signs should also be taken as per 
institutional standard of care prior to, during and after dosing. Oxygen saturation by pulse 
oximetry  at rest and after exertion should be assessed at each on-study  visit prior to nivolumab

dosing. The start and stop time of the nivolu mab infusion should be documented. Physical 
examinations are to be performed as clinicall y indicated. If there are any new or worsening 
clinically  significant changes since the last exam, report changes on the appropriate non-serious 
or serious adverse eve nt page.
On treatment local laboratory  assessments should be done within 72 hours prior to dosing;
Extended on-treatment local laboratory assessments :Cycle 1 (including day 1 and day8) 
through C ycle 5and every  alternate dose thereafter (C ycle 7, 9, 11, 13 etc) and include: CBC 
with differential, uric acid, serum urea level, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphate, chloride, amylase, lipase ,glucose ,AST, ALT, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, LDH .
Limited on-treatment laboratory assessment s: beginning at Cycle 6 (week 11) and every 
alternate dose thereafter (Cycle 8, 10, 12, 14 etc) and include: CBC, LFTs (ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and creatinine.
In addition, TSH (with reflexive testing to free T3, free T4 for abnormal TSH result ) should be 
performed every  6 weeks (7days) regardless of dosing schedule .
Additional measures, including non-study  required laboratory  tests, should be performed as 
clinically  indicated or to comply  with local regulations . Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme elevations) will be monitored during the follow -up phase via on site/local 
labs until all study  drug related toxicities resolve, return to baseline or are deemed irreversible.
Oxygen saturati on by pulse oximetry  should be obtained prior to each dose of nivolumab and at 
any time a subject has any new or worsening respiratory  symptoms. A reading at rest and on 
exertion should be obtained at each time point. The extent of the exertion should be b ased on the 
judgment of the investigator, but should remain consistent for each individual subject throughout 
the study . If the patient’s subject’s status changes, the investigator can alter the extent of exertion 
based on their medical judgment. If a subject shows changes on pulse oximetry  or other 
pulmonary -related signs (eg, hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough) consistent with 
possible pulmonary  adverse events, the patient subject should be immediately  evaluated to rule 
out pulmonary  toxicity . An algorithm for the management of suspected pulmonary  toxicity  can 
be found in Appendix 1 and the BMS -936558 (nivolumab) Investigator Brochure.
Some of the previously  referred to assessments may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They  
are intended to be used as safet y monitoring by the treating physician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically  necessary  or where require d by institutional or local 
regulations.

For subjects who discontinue study  therap y by proceeding to allogeneic SCT, documentation of 
acute and chronic GVHD will be captured on Day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every year 
thereafter from the date of stem cell infusion until the first non-CR after SCT is documented 
[Appendix 5]. Investigators will make telephone contact with the subject’s hematologist 
/oncologist /transplant physician to obtain this information if the subject is being followed by 
another ph ysician.
5.3.1 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Images will be submitted to an imaging corelab for central review. Sites will be trained prior to 
scanning the first study  subject. Image acquisition guidelines and submission process will be 
outlined in the CA209139 Imaging Manual to be provided by  the corelab.
Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that are not directly  associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by the Study  Investigator as per 
standard medical/cl inical judgment.
5.4 Efficacy  Assessments
The primary  efficacy  assessment is objective response rate (ORR), defined as a subject achieving 
either a partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) according to the 2007 revised 
International Working Group Criteria for Malignant Lym phoma (Appendix 2)The primary  
efficacy  assessment, along with the secondary  endpoints of DOR, CRR, CR duration, PRR, PRR 
duration, and PFS will be performed by an independent radiologic review committee (IRRC). 
Assessment of ORR, based on investigator assessments, will be examined as a secondary  
endpoint. Sites are required to send all on -study  disease assessments to the IRRC for review.
Once subjects discontinue study  therapy  by proceeding to allogeneic SCT or ASCT, they  will not 
undergo IRRC- radiographic assessments as described in Table 5.4.1-1. Instead, they will be 
evaluated using the following schedule. Tumor assessment (CR or non-CR) will be assessed by 
the investigator according to the 2007 IWG criteria and will be required on Day 100, at 
6months, 1 year and every  year thereafter from the date of stem cell infusion until the first 
non-CR after SCT is documented. Investigators will make telephone contacts with the subject’s 
referring hematologist/oncologist/transplant physician to obtain CR or non-CR status and 
document the status if subject is being followed by another ph ysician.
5.4.1 Radiographic Assessments
Radiographic study  evaluations will take place in accordance with the flow charts in Section 5.1
and Table 5.4.1-1. Baseline assessments should be performed within 28 days prior to the first 
dose, utilizing spiral CT or MRI . In addition to chest, abdomen, pelvis, all known sites of disease 
(including CNS) should be assessed at baseline. A PET scan is requi red at baseline for all 
subjects, and to confirm a complete response (CR).
On-study  assessments should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and all known sites of disease 
(including CNS) and should use the same imaging method as was used at baseline.

5.4.2 Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Meas urable Disease
To serially  evaluate tumor response to therapy, it is necessary  to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable 
disease is defined by  the presence of at least one measurab le tumor lesion. When spiral CT scans 
have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/ly mph nodes will be categorized as measurable or nonmeasurable as 
follows in Sections 5.4.2.1 and 5.4.2.2.
5.4.2.1 Measurable Lesions
Measurable lesions must be accuratel y measured in at least two perpendicular dimensions based 
on Cheson 2007 criteria48. In order to meet eligibility criteria, subjects must have at least 
one lymph node or extra- nodal node with long axis measurement > 15 mm, regardless of 
the short axis measurement . Additional lymph nodes are considered to be measurable for 
purposes of efficacy  assessments if the longest axis is 11 to 15 mm AND the short axis is 
> 10 mm. Ly mph nodes 10 mm x 10 mm will not be considered as measurable.
If possible, nodes or masses should be from disparate regions of the body  and they should 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.

5.4.2.2 Non- Measurable Lesions
All other lesions, including small lymph nodes (longest diameter <10 mm) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.
Lesions considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegal y identified by physical exam that is not 
measurable b y reproducible imaging techniques.
5.4.3 Specifications by Method of Assessment
5.4.3.1 Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in the eCRF in metric notation (mm). All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 
28days before th e beginning of treatment.
5.4.3.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging based evaluation should 
alway s be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by  clinical exam.
5.4.3.3 Spiral CT/MRI Scan
Spiral CT/MRI  is the best currentl y available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. Measurability  of lesions on spiral CT/MRI  scan is based on the 
assumption that spiral CT/MRI  slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When spiral CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. 
PET/CT hy brid scanners may be used for the acquisition of required CT images only  if the CT is 
of diagnostic quality  and adheres to protocol -specified scan parameters. Also, the CT images 
must be separated from the PET data prior to submitting the data, and cannot be transmitted as 
fused CT/PET images.
Note on PET/CT scans: Combined modality  scanning such as with PET/CT is increasingl y used 
in clinical care. Low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined PET/CT are of 
limited use in anatomically  based efficacy  assessments and it is therefore suggested that they 
should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomicall y 
based measurements. However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality  to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the 
CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for measurements.
5.4.3.4 Clinical Lesions
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 1cm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. As previously  noted, when lesions can be evaluated both by

clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective 
and may  also be reviewed by  the IRRC
5.4.3.5 PET scan
A baseline PET scan is required for each treated subject. An additional PET scan is required to 
confirm a CR.
5.4.4 Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non- Target Lesions
5.4.4.1 Target Lesions
At baseline, up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses meeting the criteria for 
measurable lesions given in Section 5.4.2.1 should be identified as target lesions and their 
measurements recorded. Other measurable lesions will be designated as non -target lesions.
A sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) will be calculated for all target lesions and recorded 
as the baseline SPD. The baseline SPD will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
5.4.4.2 Non- Target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of diseas e) including non -measurable l ymph nodes should be identified 
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
multiple liver nodules’).
 
 
 
 
 
5.4.6 Disease Response Evaluation
The determination of disease response to study treatment will be made using 2007 revised 
International Working Group Response Criteria for Malignant Ly mphoma (Appendix 2).
Note: 2007 IWG criteria define relapsed disease or progressive disease based largel y on the 
evaluation of nodal masses, spleen/liver, and bone marrow (Appendix 2). The criteria also 
stipulate that disease that is only assessable but not measureable (eg,pleural effusion or bone 
lesion) will be recorded as “present” or “absent”, unless such an assessable abnormalit y, noted

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does notnecessaril y have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding th e specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(seeNOTE below)
results in persistent or significa nt disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threate ning or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical,

result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,andpotential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by regulatory  definition, these events must be handled asSAE s. 
(See Section
6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study  endpoint that is considered related to study  therap y (eg, death is an 
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphy laxis, anaphy laxis must be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details ).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations arenot considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life- threatening event)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a plan ned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine colonoscop y)
medical/surgical admission other than to remedy  ill health and planned prior to entry  into 
the study . Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , caregiver respite, family  circumstances, administrative reason ).
admission for administration of anti- cancer therapy  in the absence of any  other SAEs
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 100 daysof discontinuation of dosing. If applicable, SAEs must be collected that 
relate to an y later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be related to stud y drug or protocol -specified procedure.
An SAE report should be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.

BMS -936558 nivolumab
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not relate d to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on 
a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). When using paper forms, the reports 
are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number : Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted immediately , only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reportin g): Refer to Contact 
Information list.
If onl y limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drugor if new inform ation 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS 
(ordesignee) u sing th e same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non serious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Non serious 
AEinformation should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug andfor those present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic).
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be 
collected continuously  during the treatment period and for a minimum of 100 day s following the 
last dose of study  treatment.
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.

6.3 Laboratory  Test Result A bnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therap y.
It isexpected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by 
the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently  discovere d that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study  exposure, including during at 
least 5 half lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS 
(or designee) Medical Monitor of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours and in accordance with the SAE reporting 
procedures described in Section 6.1.1.
In most cases, the study  drug will be permanently  discontinued in an appropriate manner 
(eg,dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study  drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study  drug, after a thorough 
discussion of benefits and risk with the subject.
Protocol -required procedures for study  discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy  that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
BMS . Information on this pregnancy  will be collected on the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined asthe accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically  important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND 
2)Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkal ine phosphatase),
AND 
3)No other immediatel y apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, 
or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hep atotoxic. 
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment required or not required 
by protocol should also be recorded as anonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingl y. 
7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE A ND OTHER EXTE RNA L 
COMMITTEES
7.1 Independent Radiology  Rev iew Committee (IRRC)
An IRRC will be utilized in this study  for determination of IRRC-assessed primary  (ORR) and 
secondary  (DOR, CRR, PFS) endpoints. The IRRC will review all available tumor assessment 
scans for all treated subjects. Details of IRRC responsibilities and procedures will be specified in 
the IRRC charter.
8 STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The planned sample size for this study  will be approximately  120 treated subjects , separat ed into 
two treatment groups based on prior ASCT failure [n=9 0] or ASCT ineligibility  [n=30] .
For the ASCT -failed cohort, a modified Simon's two-stage design will be used to test the null 
hypothesis that the true ORR is 20% (not considered clinically  compelling). In the first stage, 
37subjects will be accrued. If there are 8 or fewer responses in these 37 subjects, the study  will 
be stopped. In this case, the study  will be terminated in both the ASCT -failed cohort as well as 
the ASCT ineligible cohort. Otherwise, approximately  53 additional subject s will be accrued into 
the ASCT -failed cohort to target a total of 90 treated subjects. The null hypothesis will be 
rejected if 25 or more responses are observed in 90 treated subjects. This design yields a

one-sided type I error rate of 5% and power of 90% when the true response rate is 35%. The 
interim stopping rule for this design is identical to Simon’s ‘op timal’ 2 -stage design50. However, 
the sample size at the final analy sis is larger than required by Simon’s optimal design in order to 
provide additional subjects for safet y evaluation. Table 8.1-1 provides the probabilities of 
stopping at different ORR usin g this rule.
Table 8.1-1: Operating Characteristics of Stopping Rule
True ORR P(early stop)
15% 0.91
20% 0.69
25% 0.40
30% 0.18
35% 0.06
40% 0.01
For the ASCT ineligible cohort, the sample size of 30 treated subjects is determined to achieve a 
confidence interval (CI) width around the ORR estimate with a sufficient level of precision. If 
the observed number of subjects with ORR is 10 (33%), the width of the exact 2 -sided 95% CI is 
36% with a lower bound of 17.3%. Such an observation would provide evidence in support that 
the true ORR is greater than or equal to 17.3% with a Type I error rate of 5%.
8.2 Populations for A nalyses
All Enrolled Subjects: All subjects who signed an informed consent form and were registered
into the I VRS.
All Treated Subjects: All subjects who received at least one dose of nivolumab. This is the 
primary  population for safety  and efficacy  analy ses.
All response evaluable subjects: All treated subjects who have baseline and at least one 
on-study  evaluable tumor measureme nt.

8.3 Endpoint s
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary  objective will be measured by the primary  endpoint of IRRC-assessed objective 
response rate (ORR). It is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) 
of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), according to the 2007 revised International 
Working Group Criteria for Malignant Lym phoma, divided by the number of treated subjects. 
The final analysis of the primary  endpoint will occur at least 6 months after the last enrolled 
subject’s first dose of study  therap y. The BOR is defined as the best response designation 
recorded between the date of first dose and the date of initial objectivel y documented progression 
per the 2007 revised International Working group Criteria for Malignant Lym phoma or the date 
of subsequent therapy , whichever occurs first. Stem Cell Transplant will be consider ed as 
subsequent therap y.For subjects without documented progression or subsequent therap y, all 
available response designations will contribute to the BOR determination. For purposes of 
analysis, if a subject receives one dose and discontinues the study  without assessment or receives 
subsequent therap y prior to assessment, this subject will be counted in the denominator 
(asnon-responder).
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The first secondary  objective will be measured by the duration of ORR (DOR) based on IRRC 
assess ment. DOR is defined as the time from first response (CR or PR) to the date of initial 
objectively  documented progression as determined using the 2007 revised International Working 
Group Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For 
subjects who neither progress nor die, the DOR will be censored on the date of their last 
evaluable tumor assessment. Subjects who start subsequent therap y without a prior reported 
progression will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessments prior to initiation of the 
subsequent anticancer therap yThis endpoint will only be evaluated in subjects with objective 
response of CR or PR. 
The second secondary  objective will be measured by the complete remission rate (CRR) based 
on IRRC assessment. The CRR is defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of CR 
according to the 2007 revised International Working Group Criteria for Malignant Lym phoma, 
divided by the number of treated subjects. The BOR is defined similarly  as above. The durati on 
of CR will only be evaluated in subjects with BOR of CR and is defined as the time from first 
documentation of CR (the date of first negative FDG -PET scan or the date of first documentation 
of no disease involvement in the bone marrow (if required), whichever occurs later) to the date 
of initial objectively  documented progression as determined using the revised 2007 IWG 
response criteria for malignant lymphoma or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Censoring will be applied as per DOR definition.
The third secondary  objective will be measured by PR rate based on IRRC assessment. It is 
defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of PR according to the 2007 revised IWG 
response criteria, based on IRRC assessment, divided by the number of treate d subjects. The 
duration of PR will only be evaluated in subjects with BOR of PR and is defined as the time

from first documentation of PR to the date of initial objectively  documented progression as 
determined using the 2007 revised IWG response criteria or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first. Censoring will be applied as per DOR definition.
The fourth secondary  objective will be measured by IRRC- assessed progression free survival 
(PFS). It is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented 
progression, as determined by an IRRC, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Subjects who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the 
date of their death. Subjects who did not pr ogress or die will be censored on the date of their last 
evaluable assessment. Subjects who did not have any  on study  assessments and did not die will 
be censored on the first dosing date. Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer therap y 
without a prior reported progression will be censored at the last evaluable assessment prior to 
initiation of the subsequent anti- cancer therap y.
The fifth secondary objective will be measured by investigator- assessed ORR. 
Investigator -assessed ORR is defined similar ly as described for the primary endpoint above.

two-sided 95% CIs (based on the log- log transformation) and range, will also be calculated.
IRRC -assessed CRR, PRR, and investigator -assessed ORR will be summarized by binomial 
response rates and their corresponding two-sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method.
Duration of CR and PR will be summarized similarly  to DOR. IRRC -assessed PFS will be

8.5 Interim A nalyses
One interim analy sis of IRRC -assessed ORR in the ASCT failure group will be performed when 
37 ASCT -failed subjects have been treated and those subjects still on treatment have completed 
the first tumor assessment (week 9) . In case the last assessment of some subjects show CR that 
has not yet been confirmed by PET, the interim analy sis will take place after availability  of the 
confirmation. If there are 8 or fewer responses in these 37 subjects, the study  will be stopped. 
Otherwise, approximately  53additional subject s will be accrued to target a total of 90 treated 
subjects in the ASCT failure group. Accrual and treatment will continue during the time period 
that the interim analy sis is being conducted. This may result in more than 37 treated subjects in 
the event that the study  is terminated for lack of efficacy . The tolerability  of the regimen will 
continue to be evaluated by the sponsor with the investigators to ensure that it is acceptable for 
continued enrollment. Additional specifications of analyses produced at interim analysis (eg, on 
biomarkers, safet y) will be addressed in the statistical anal ysis plan.

consistent with the applicable product information 
(eg,Investigator Brochure for an unapproved investigational 
product)
Serious Adverse Event Serious adverse event defined as an y untoward medical 
occurrence that at an y dose: results in death; is life 
threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event wh ich h ypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe), requires inpatient hospitalization or 
causes prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in 
persistent or significant disability /incapacit y, is a congenital 
anomaly /birth defect; is an important medical event (defined 
as a medical event(s) that may  not be immediatel y life 
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based 
upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may  
jeopardize the subject or may  require intervention
[eg,medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.). For reporting purposes only , BMS also 
considers the occurrence of pregnancy , overdose (regardless 
of association with an AE), and cancer as important medical 
events.

CR (Complete Remission)
The designation of CR requires th e following:
1.Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease -related 
symptoms, if present before therapy .
a)Typically  [18F] fluorodeox yglucose (FDG) -avid lymphoma: in patients with no 
pretreatment positron emission tomograph y (PET) scan or when the PET scan was 
positive before therap y, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as 
it is PET negative.
b)Variabl y FDG -avid l ymphomas/FDG avidity  unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pret reatment PET scan was negative, all ly mph nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on computed tomograph y (CT) scan to normal size ( 1.5 cm in their 
greatest transverse diameter for nodes >1.5 cm before therapy ). Previously  involved 
nodes that were 1.1to 1.5 cm in their long axis and > 1.0 cm in their short axis before 
treatment must have decreased to 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
2.The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy  on the basis of a physical 
examination or CTscan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma should 
disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not alway s reliable because a 
spleen considere d normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen 
may reflect variations in anatomy , blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or 
causes other than ly mphoma.
3.If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy . The biopsy  sample on which this determination is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is 
indeterminate b y morphology , it should be negative by  immunohist ochemistry . A sample that 
is negative by immunohistochemistry  but demonstrates a small population of clonal 
lymphocy tes by flow cytometry  will be considered a CR until data become available 
demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.
PR (Partial Remission)
The designation of PR requires all of the following:
1. At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according 
to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 2perpendicular 
dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body ; and they should 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involv ed.
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.
3.Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by  50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the 
greatest transverse diameter.
4.With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually  
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.

5.Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR, if the sample was positive 
before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specif ied (eg, large -cell 
lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria but 
have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial responders. 
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy  and a clinical CR was achieved but with 
no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial responders.
6.No new sites of disease should be observed.
7.FDG:
a)Typically  FDG -avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if t he PET 
scan was positive before therap y, the post-treatment PET should be positive in at least 
1previously involved site.
b)Variabl y FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidit y unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be 
used. In patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle -cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only 
indicated with 1 or at most 2 residual masses that have regressed by > 50% on CT; those 
with more than 2 residual lesions are unlikel y to be PET negative and should be 
considered partial responders.
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the following:
8.A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR 
or PR but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease 
[after CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
9.Typically  FGD-avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with no 
new areas of involvement on the post- treatment CT or PET scan.
10.Variabl y FDG -avid lymphom as/FDG- avidity  unknown: for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the 
previous lesions on the post -treatment CT scan.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (a fter PR, SD)
Lym ph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm regardless of the short 
axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if 
its short axis is > 1.0. Lymph nodes 1.0 x 1.0 cm will not be considered abnormal for relapse 
or progressive disease.
11.Appearance of any new lesion > 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therap y, even if 
other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a previously  unaffected site 
should only be considered relapsed or PD after confirmation with other modalities. In 
patients with no prior history  of pulmonary  lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT 
are mostly  benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely  on the basi s of the 
PET without histologic confirmation.

12. At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously  involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered PD, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of < 1.0 cm must increase by 
50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or > 1.5 cm in the long axis.
13. At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously  identified node 
> 1cm in its short axis.
14.Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG -avid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therap y unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET sy stems (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by  CT).
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease. 
For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. Disease that is only 
assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only , unless, 
while an abnormality  is still noted by imaging studies or physical examinat ion, it is found to be 
histologically  negative.
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majority  of participants, or where PET is 
not deemed necessary  or appropriate for use (eg, a trial in patients with MAL T lymphoma), 
response should be a ssessed as above, but onl y using CT scans. However, residual masses should 
not be assigned CRu status, but should be considered partial responses.

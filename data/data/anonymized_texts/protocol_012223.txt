 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 Synopsis  
 Study overview  
This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages of a novel peroxide -inactivated 
whole -virus yellow fever vaccine , HydroVax -002 YFV, in healthy adults.  The c urrently available yellow fever 
vaccine is the live, attenuated YFV -17D vaccine. This live attenuated vaccine is contraindicated in multiple 
vulnerable populations including infants <9 months of age and immunosuppressed individuals such as those with 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, thymic disease, or persons with hype rsensitivity to eggs. Special 
precautions are  also noted for pregnant women, nursing mothers and adults over the age of 60 [1]. These 
contraindications and precautions stem from known serious adverse events associated with the vaccine including 
a serious nervous system/neurotropic condition ter med yellow fever associated neurotropic disease (YEL -AND).  
In addition to YEL -AND, vaccination with live YFV -17D can cause severe multiple organ system failure, 
described as yellow fever vaccine -associated viscerotropic disease (YEL -AVD), a syndrome close ly resembling 
wild-type yellow fever  virus (YFV) .  Because HydroVax -002 YFV is based on inactivated virus that is unable to 
replicate or spread to the brain or nervous system, we anticipate that these vaccine complications will be 
eliminated.  
 
 Enrollment Period  
It is anticipated that enrollment may be completed in 3.5 -4 months.  
 
 General  
This trial will be a randomized, placebo controlled, double -blind (within dosing group), dose escalation Phase 1 
trial evaluating dosages of 1 mcg and 5 mcg of HydroVax -002 YFV vaccine given intramuscularly on Day 1 (the 
day of first vaccination is defined as Day 1) and Day 29 in healthy adults ≥18 and <50 years of age. The study 
will consist of two dosing groups of HydroVax -002 YFV vaccine to be enrolled sequentially. Each dose group 
will consist of 10 individuals who receive HydroVax -002 YFV and 2 or 3 who receive placebo. The initial dose 
of HydroVax -002 YFV to be evaluated in Group 1 will be 1 mcg and the next dose to be evaluated in Group 2 
will be 5 mcg. Following asses sment of safety and reactogenicity data of Group 1 by the Safety Monitoring 
Committee (SMC), the vaccine dose will be increased to 5 mcg for Group 2.  All participants will be monitored 
for local and system ic solicited adverse events for 7 days following e ach vaccination, unsolicited adverse events 
for 28 days following each vaccination, and for the occurrence of new onset chronic medical conditions and 
serious adverse events from the time of first vaccination until 6 months following the second vaccination .  Safety 
laboratory tests will be performed prior to vaccination and at days 4 and 15 following vaccination.  YFV 
neutralizing assays will be performed on blood samples collected prior to each vaccine, 15 days follow ing each 
vaccine, and at days 29 , 57, and 180 following the second dose of vaccine.  
 
For each dosing group, the first four subjects enrolled (the sentinel subgroup) will include three HydroVax -002 
YFV  recipients and one placebo recipient .  After the four subjects in the Group 1 sentinel subgro up are enrolled 
and given their first vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a review of the clinical laboratory, 
reactogenicity, and safety data collected through the post vaccination Day 8 visit for the last of those subjects.

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 10 of 84 This review m ay be conducted by an internal safety review committee (ISRC), consisting of the Blinded medical 
monitor , clinical program manager , and the PI, or by the SMC, as indicated and detailed in Section 10.1.6 . 
Approval by the reviewing group will allow administration of the second vaccination to the sentinel subgroup 
and continued enrollment of the remaining 9 Group 1 subjects (expanded group) to r esume to complete enrollment 
of 13 participants (10 vaccine and 3 placebo).  
 
After Group 1 enrollment is completed enrollment will be stopped pending an SMC review of the clinical 
laboratory, reactogenicity, and adverse event information through the post 2nd vaccination Day 15 visit for all 
Group 1 subjects. Approval by the SMC will allow escalation to Group 2, and initiation of enrollment of the 
Group 2 sentinel subgroup.  After the four subjects in the Group 2 sentinel subgroup are enrolled and given the ir 
first vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a safety review of the sentinel subgroup as specified 
for the low dose cohort. Approval will allow administration of vaccination 2 to the sentinel subgroup and 
continued enrollment of Group 2 su bjects (expanded group) to complete study enrollment.  
 
This study will accrue 25 participants: (10 receiving 1 mcg  of HydroVax -002 YFV; 10 receiving 5  mcg of 
HydroVax -002 YFV; and 5 receiving placebo).

 Study Intervention  
Investigational Vaccine: HydroVax -002 YFV Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), inactivated vaccine, alum -adsorbed, 
administered intramuscularly in a two -dose series on Day 1 and Day 29 at a dose of 1 mcg and at a dose of 5 mcg.   
Controls will receive sterile 0.9% Na Cl placebo intramuscularly at days 1 and 29.   
 
 Staged Enrollment  
For each dosing group, the first four subjects enrolled (the sentinel subgroup) will include three HydroVax -002 
YFV  recipients and one placebo recipient  (Table 1).  After the four subjects in the Group 1 sentinel subgroup are 
enrolled and given their first vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a review of the clinical 
laborator y, reactogenicity, and safety data collected through the post vaccination Day 8 visit for the last of those 
subjects. This review may be conducted by an internal safety review committee (ISRC), consisting of the Blinded 
medical monitor, clinical program ma nager,  and the PI, or by the SMC, as indicated and detailed in Section 10.1.6 . 
Approval by the reviewing group will allow administration of the second vaccination to the sentinel subgroup 
and continued enrollment of the remaining 9 Group 1 subjects (expanded group) to r esume to complete enrollment 
of 13 participants (10 vaccine and 3 placebo).  
 
After Group 1 enrollment is completed enrollment will be stopped pending an SMC review of the clinical 
laboratory, reactogenicity, and adverse event information through the post 2nd vaccination Day 8 visit for all 
Group 1 subjects. Approval by the SMC will allow escalation to Group 2, and initiation of enrollment of the 
Group 2 sentinel subgroup.  After the four subjects in the Group 2 sentinel subgroup are enrolled and given thei r 
first vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a safety review of the sentinel subgroup as specified 
for the low dose cohort. Approval will allow administration of vaccination 2 to the sentinel subgroup and 
continued enrollment of Group 2 sub jects (expanded group) to complete study enrollment.

 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Study Rationale  
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a mosquito -borne pathogen that is endemic in over 40 countries [2] and c linical 
presentation often involves severe acute onset with fever, nausea, vomiting, hepatitis, hemorrhage and renal 
failure.  The case fatality rate for severe cases of yellow fever ranges from 20 -60% [3, 4].  Prevention or reduction 
of disease burden is mainly accomplished through immunization with a live -attenuated yellow fever virus (e.g., 
YFV -17D or YFV -17DD)  but these live vaccines are specifically contraindicated in young infants, pregnant or 
nursing mothers  of young infants , people with egg allergies  or people with a number of pre -existing medical 
conditions .  In addition, specific warnings ar e in place for individuals >60 years of age due to the risk of rare, but 
potentially life -threatening, complications.   This means that there is currently no safe vaccine available to protect 
these vulnerable populations.   To address this unmet clinical nee d, we have developed an advanced yellow fever 
vaccine formulation in which the virus is inactivated using the proprietary  hydrogen peroxide -based  HydroVax ™ 
technology.  
 
2.2 Background  
 Purpose of Study  
The Sponsor  propose s a Phase 1 double -blind placebo -control led clinical trial for a first -in-person evaluation  of 
the safety and immunogenicity of a novel peroxide -inactivated whole -virus yellow fever vaccine . 
 
2.2.1.1  Yellow Fever Virus  
Yellow fever virus (YFV) represents an important mosquito -borne human pathogen that is endemic in more than 
40 countries in sub -Saharan Africa and South America [2].  Although disease may be mild in some instances, 
clinical presentation often involves severe acute onset with fever, nausea, vomiti ng, hepatitis, hemorrhage and 
renal failure.  The case fatality rate for severe cases of yellow fever ranges from 20 -60% [3, 4].  There are no 
licensed antiviral drugs t o treat yellow fever and prevention or reduction of disease burden is mainly accomplished 
through vaccination as well as through vector control measures.  Though the requirements for protective vaccine -
mediated immunity are unknown for many viruses, a corr elate of immunity exists for YFV.  Protective immunity  
against YFV  was originally defined as a log neutralizing index (LNI) of ≥0.7 [5, 6] based on NHP challenge 
studies but more  recent yellow fever vaccine clinical trials have been updated to use more reliable serum -dilution, 
constant -virus plaque -reduction neutralization tests (PRNT)  [7, 8]. 
 
The live, attenuated YFV -17D vaccine was developed in 1936 and although there are two main substrains that 
are used in commercial manufacturing  (17D and 17DD), there appear to be no major differences in safety or 
immunogenicity between YFV -17D vaccines [3, 9-11].  Yellow fever vaccination is recommended for people 
living in endemic areas and for travelers who may visit endemic areas, and for many years, YFV -17D has been 
considered “ one of the safest vaccines in the world ” [12].  However, this live attenuated vaccine is contraindicated 
in persons with hypersensitivity to e ggs as well as  several  vulnerable populations including infants <9 months of 
age and immunosuppressed individuals such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, leukemia, 
lymphoma, thymic disease, generalized malignancy, and patients who are underg oing drug therapy (e.g., systemic 
corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites or other immunomodulatory drugs) or radiation therapy. Thymic

 Known Potential Risks  
This is the first human trial of HydroVax -002 YFV .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Common p otential side effects resulting from intramuscular injections include stinging, discomfort, redness of 
skin, or mild bruising at vaccine injection site.  
 
Uncommon side effects include  general signs and symptoms associated with administration of the vaccine 
injection, including fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, dizziness and fatigue. These side effects will be 
monitored, but are generally short term, mild to moderate severity and usually do not require treatment.  
 
Rare risks with any i njection procedure  include  infection at the site of injection. Signs of infection at the injection 
site include: severe pain, erythema , induration , warmth or drainage. There may be side effects from the study 
products, which may be serious or life threaten ing that we do not know about yet.

 Known Potential B enefits  
Participation in this study provides no known direct benefit to the individual subjects.  
 
 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
This study may not benefit participants  directly. As this is a first -in-person trial, it is unknown  whether the study 
product, HydroVax -002 YFV,  will help to protect subjects from yellow fever disease  or, if it does, how long that 
protection may last.   The study placebo, saline solution, would offer no known bene fit to study participants.   As 
detailed in Section 2.3.1 , there are potential risks for any intramuscular injection.  
 
Study risk is minimized by usin g a dose escalation structure, as well as a sentinel group approach within each 
dose level.  Group safety reviews occur between sentinel and expanded groups, and between dose groups.  In 
addition, each individual study subject is followed closely during ac ute time periods following test article 
administration.  
 
While individual subjects may not benefit from involvement  in this study, their participation is crucial to the 
larger societal benefit of improved medical interventions.  As noted in Section 2.1, the current  live attenuated  
YFV  vaccine is contraindicated in multiple vulnerable populations including infants <9 months of age and 
immunosuppressed individuals such as those with acquired i mmunodeficiency syndrome, thymic disease, or 
persons with hypersensitivity to eggs .  By participating in this study, subjects are enabling the development of a 
potential advancement to address this current unmet medical need.

 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Design  
This trial will be a randomized, placebo controlled, double -blind (within dosing group), dose escalation Phase 1  
trial evaluating dosages of 1 mcg  and 5 mcg  of HydroVax -002 YFV  vaccine given intramuscularly on Day 1 (the 
day of first vaccination is defined as Day 1) and Day 29 in healthy adults ≥18 and < 50 years of age. The study 
will consist of two dosing groups of HydroVax -002 YFV  vaccine to be enrolled sequentially. Each dose group 
will consist of 10 individuals who receive HydroVax -002 YFV , as well as  5 total subjects who  receive placebo . 
Each dose -group  will include a sentinel subgroup consisting of 3 vaccine and 1 placebo recipient. In each of the 
two ( 1 mcg  and 5 mcg ) dose phases, enrollment is halted after the dose 1 vaccination of the sentinel subgroup . 
Following assessment of safety and reactogenici ty data of Group 1 by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), 
the vaccine dose will be increased to 5 mcg  for Group 2.  
 
For each dosing group, the first 4 subjects enrolled (the sentinel subgroup) will include 3 HydroVax -002 YFV  
recipients and 1 placebo re cipient.  After the 4 subjects in the Group 1 sentinel subgroup are enrolled and given 
their first vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a review of  the clinical laboratory, reactogenicity, 
and safety data collected through the post vaccinat ion one Day 8 visit for the last of those subjects. This review 
will be conducted by an internal safety review committee (ISRC), consisting of the Blinded medical monitor, 
clinical program manager  and the PI .  If deemed necessary by the ISRC, a further rev iew will be conducted by 
the SMC, as detailed in Section 10.1.6 .  Approval by the reviewing group will allow administration of the second 
vaccination to the sentinel subgroup and continu ed enrollment of the remaining 9 Group 1 subjects (expanded 
group) to resume to complete enrollment of 13 participants ( 10 vaccine and 3 placebo).  
 
After Group 1 enrollment is completed enrollment will be stopped pending an SMC review of the clinical 
laboratory, reactogenicity, and adverse event information through the post 2nd  vaccination Day 15 visit for all 
Group 1 subjects. Approval by the SMC will allow escalation to Group 2, and initiation of enrollment of the 
Group 2 sentinel subgroup.  After the 4 subjects in the Group 2 sentinel subgroup are enrolled and given their 
first vaccination, enrollment will then be stopped pending a safety review of the sentinel subgroup as specified 
for the low dose cohort. Approval will allow administration of vaccination 2 to the sentinel subgroup and 
continued enrollment of Group 2  subjects (expanded group) to complete study enrollment.  
 
All subjects will complete a subject memory aid  for 7 days after each study vaccination. Unsolicited, non -serious 
adverse events and serious adverse events will be collected through 29 days after t he second vaccination. Serious 
adverse events and new onset of chronic medical conditions will be collected from the time of vaccination 
throu ghout the study period. Subject s’ participation will be approximately 8 months. Table 2 provides a detailed 
outline of the study schedule.  
 
Blood samples will be obtained at specified time points  following  each vaccination for safet y laboratory 
assessments and assessment of humoral immune responses.  
 
 
Table 3 provides the estimated blood volume of collection at each visit and cumu latively throughout the study.

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 29 of 84 formulated with 0.1% aluminum hydroxide (Al (OH) 3)]. The 3-dose vaccination schedule represents n+1 for the 
proposed 2 -dose schedule to be administered during this Phase 1 clinical trial. This dose of vaccine was well -
tolerated in the study animals. These results indicate that the vaccine test article demon strates an acceptable pre -
clinical safety profile at the planned maximum  dose level  of 5 mcg . 
 
This route and vaccination schedule is commonly used for other inactivated whole -virus vaccines formulated with 
alum.   Analysis of antigen dose used in other ina ctivated alum -adsorbed, whole -virus vaccines consisting of 
closely related flaviviruses produced in Vero cells provides information of potential relevance for this dose 
ranging study of HydroVax -002 YFV.  The commercial tick -borne encephalitis virus vaccin e, TicoVac, contains 
5 mcg/dose, and the commercial Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine, IXIARO, contains 6 mcg/dose.  The 
experimental yellow fever virus vaccine, XRX -001, was tested in Phase I trials at 4.8 mcg/dose and at 0.48 
mcg/dose. [8]  Antiviral immunity following a single dose of inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine is 
low after a single 6 mcg dose, [35] whereas two or three intramuscular injections of a 12 mcg/dose vaccine were 
tested and found to be safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic [36]. 
 
Based on prior results with a closely related inactivated flavivirus vaccine (HydroVax -001 WNV , [37]) we do not 
anticipate significant safety signals.  Based on the animal model evaluations of HydroVax -002 YFV  and studies 
of other inactivated alum -absorbed flavivirus vaccines, the antigen doses to be evaluated in this Phase 1 trial of 
HydroVax are 1 mcg and 5 mcg.

interventional agent  
• Refrain from donating blood during the study period  
• Refrain from a major change in exercise routine  or strenuous exercise  from 72 hours before any dose of study 
vaccine/placebo  and for 72 hours before each blood collection for clinical laboratory tests (Vaccination Days 
and Days 4 and 15 following each dose)  
• Abstain from travel to areas known to be endemic with Yellow Fever  virus  until 6 months after vaccination  
 
5.6 Screen Failures  
Following consent, a fter the screening evaluations have been completed, the investigator or designee is to review 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria and determine the subject’s eligibility for the stud y.  If there is any uncertainty , 
the PI should make the decision on whether a potential subject is eligible for enrollment.  
 
Only the following information will be collected on screen failures: demographics (age, screen number, sex, 
ethnicity, and race) an d reason for ineligibility. Subjects who are found to be ineligible will be told the reason for 
ineligibility.  
 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) because of a laboratory 
value  that is outside the rang e of eligibility , but is thought to be due to an acute condition or due to laboratory 
error , may be repeated once   
 
5.7 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
 Recruitment  
Potential participants will be selected from existing participant registries, through a dvertising or by word of mouth 
in the Duke University, Durham, NC area and surrounding communities. Recruitment staff will contact interested 
individuals to assess their eligibility for this study. It is anticipated that the demographic composition of subj ects 
for this study will be representative of the respective region.

HydroVax -002 YFV Phase 1 Study           24 January 2023 
 
  
Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 35 of 84 The IRB will approve the recruitment process and all materials provided prior to any recruitment to prospective 
subjects directly.  
 
Screening will begin with a brief discussion with stud y staff. Some people will be excluded based on demographic 
data and medical history (i.e., pregnant, prior travel, prior vaccination, etc.). Information about the study will be 
presented to potential subjects and questions will be asked to determine potent ial eligibility. Screening procedures 
can begin only after informed consent is obtained.  
 
 Retention  
Retention of subjects in this trial is especially important  for determining the primary and secondary endpoints. As 
such, after  vaccination , participating s ubjects will be reminded of subsequent study visits and every effort will be 
made to accommodate the subject’s schedule to facilitate follow -up within the specified visit window. 
Additionally, there are many circumstances that influence the ability to obta in outcome information after 
vaccination .  Follow -up visits may be conducted by phone if in person visits are not feasible. Lastly, compensation 
strategies will be implemented to encourage subjects to return for follow -up assessments and sample collections .  
 
 Compensation Plan for Subjects  
Compensation will be determined locally at the study site and in accordance  with local IRB regulations an d 
approval.  
 
 Costs  
There is no cost to subjects for the research tests, procedures /evaluations , and study product while taking part in 
this trial.  Procedures and treatment for clinical care may be billed to the subject, subject’s insurance or third 
party.

 STUDY PRODUCT  
6.1 Study Product and Administration  
In this dose escalation study,  the first 13 subjects will be randomized (10:3) to receive two doses of either 1 mcg 
HydroVax -002 YFV  IM injection or placebo IM injection 28 days apart .  The second 12 subjects will be  
randomized (5:1) to receive two doses of 5 mcg HydroVax -002 YFV  IM injection or placebo IM injection  28 
days apart . 
 
 Study Product Description  
6.1.1.1  Vaccine  
The HydroVax -002 YFV  vaccine is a yellow fever virus , Vero cell tissue culture -derived  vaccine inactivated with 
hydrogen peroxide, formulated with 0.1% aluminum hydroxide. HydroVax -002 YFV  drug product contains 5 
mcg purified whole virus  YFV  formulated in a volume of 0.5 mL/dose with 0.1% aluminum hydroxide and 10% 
sorbitol , 0.001% polysorba te 80 in phosphate -buffer  [pH = 7.5]  with 350 mM sodium chloride . A single 0.5 mL 
dose of HydroVax -002 YFV  may also contain residual amounts of Vero host cell DNA (<1 ng/0.5 mL) or Vero 
host cell protein (< 300 ng/0.5).  HydroVax -002 YFV  does not contain an tibiotics or preservatives.  The stoppers 
used for single -dose vials do not contain latex.  
 
6.1.1.2  Placebo  and Diluent  
Sodium Chloride Injection USP, 0.9% (NaCl 0.9%, Normal Saline)  will be used as the placebo  and diluent . 
 
 Dosing and  Administration  
Based on dosi ng group assignment, subjects will receive either 1 mcg, 5 mcg, or placebo per vaccination dose 
administered in the non -dominant arm as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection on days 1 and 29.  Following 
vaccination, subjects will be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes.  
 
 Dose Escalation  
For this Phase 1 first -in-human trial, a conservative dose escalation design will be used, in which each dose group 
of 10 vaccine  recipients,  and a total of 5 placebo recipients , is split into two subgroups. The first subgroup, termed 
the sentinel subgroup, includes 3 vaccine and 1 placebo recipient . In each of the two (1 mcg and 5 mcg) dose 
phases, enrollment is halted after vaccination of the  sentinel subgroup. This allows the opportunity to identify 
potential early vaccine related adverse events in this subgroup prior to exposure of additional subjects, a design 
which decreases the risk of multiple serious vaccine related adverse events compa red to sequential vaccination of 
the entire dose group without halting [34]. After enrol lment of the expanded subgroups, escalation to the next 
dose group will be delayed until 14 days of safety data following the second vaccination  (corresponding to study 
Day 15)  is available from all subjects in the preceding dose group.

 Acquisition  and Accountability  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Sodium Chloride Injection USP 0.9% for placebo and diluent will be sourced by the Duke Investigational Drug 
Service . 
 
After receipt of the study product, the principal investigator is responsible for distribution and disposition of these 
study products and  has ultimate responsibility for drug accountability. The principal investigator may delega te to 
the research pharmacist responsibility for study vaccine accountability.  The research pharmacist must maintain 
and document logs of receipt, accountability, vaccine dilution and dispensation, storage conditions, and disposal.  
These study product ac countability and dispensing logs must be maintained in the study file.  
 
Upon completion of the study and the final monitoring visit, used and unused vials of HydroVax -002 YFV  and 
Placebo/diluent (sterile 0.9% NaCl) will be retained until monitored and released for disposition. For detailed 
information regarding final disposition of study vaccine and placebo/diluent see the protocol -specific MOP.  
 
 Formulation,  Appearance,  Packa ging, and Labeling  
HydroVax -002 YFV  vaccine  will be supplied to the investigative site in crystal zenith  2 mL vials containing 5 
mcg of purified , inactivated  whole YFV virus  formulated with alum per 0.5 mL with stopper, crimp seals, and 
flip-off cap. Each vial will contain a fill volume of 0.6 mL. The study vaccine is a white, opaque, non -uniform 
suspension that becomes homogeneous upon shaking .  
 
Sodium Chloride Injection USP 0.9% is a sterile, nonpyrogenic , isotonic solution of sodium chloride and WFI.  
It will be used to dilute the vaccine and will be used as the placebo.  
 
Further details regarding formulation, packaging and labeling are included in the protocol -specific  Manual of 
Procedures ( MOP ) and the  Investigator’s Brochure for the HydroVax -002 YFV  vaccine .

 Product Storage and Stability  
Study vaccine and the n ormal saline placebo /diluent  will be shipped and stored refrigerated at 2 ℃ to 8℃. Study 
vaccine and the placebo/diluent should not be frozen.  
 
During storage, HydroVax -002 YFV  vials should be  kept in a lightproof container . During storage, a clear liquid 
with a white precipitate will be observed; this is the alum adjuvant and this appearance is to be expected following 
refrigerated storage.  
 
 Preparation  
Study vaccine preparation, including vaccine dilutions for the various dosing groups, will be performed by the 
site research pharmacist on the same day of study vaccine administration.  Detailed information regarding the 
handling of vaccine, incl uding preparation of the dilutions, labeling, storage, and administration of study vaccine 
will be provided in the protocol -specific MOP.  
 
Aseptic technique will be used for the administration of each dose of study product using a sterile needle 
appropriat e in length for each participant, as described in the protocol -specific MOP.  
 
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E6: Good Clinical Practice (GC P), screening 
records will be kept at the clinical site to document the reason why an individual was screened, but failed trial 
entry criteria. The reasons why individuals failed screening will be recorded in the Coordinating Center’s (CC) 
Advantage eClini cal®  (Electronic Data Capture System).  
 
Once consented and upon entry of demographic data and confirmation of eligibility for the trial , the subject will 
be assigned to a treatment arm within each dose group (low dose and high dose) subjects will be random ly 
assigned to receive the study test product or placebo. Subjects will be block randomized so that 1 of the first 4 
sentinel subjects will receive placebo and the other 3 active vaccine. In the expanded groups, 7 of the 8 or 9 
subjects will be randomized to vaccine and 1 or 2 to placebo. Subjects will receive the same treatment for both 
vaccinations.  
 
 Randomizatio n 
Enrollment of subjects will be done online using the enrollment module of Advantage eClinical® . The 
randomization code will be prepared by statisticians at the CC and included in the enrollment module for the trial. 
Advantage eClinical®  will generate a tre atment assignment for each subject after the demographic and eligibility 
data have been entered into the system. A designated individual at each site will be provided with a code list for 
emergency unblinding purposes, which will be kept in a secure place.

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 39 of 84 Instructions for use of the enrollment module are included in the Advantage eClinical®  User’s  Guide. Manual 
back -up procedures and instructions are provided for use in the event that the site temporarily loses access to the 
Internet or the online enrollm ent system is unavailable.  
 
 Blinding and Masking Procedures  
This is a partially -blinded clinical trial.  
 
Study staff and investigators will not be blinded to dose group but, within dose groups, subjects, investigators, 
and study staff other than unblinded site research pharmacist (or other designated unblinded personnel 
administering study product) will be blinded as to the subject's treatment assignment (vaccine vs. placebo). 
Laboratory personnel performing antibody assays will be blinded to dose group and  treatment assignment.  
 
The randomization scheme will be generated by the CC and provided to unblinded study personnel (i.e., research 
pharmacists performing study vaccination preparations and unblinded study vaccine administrators) at the clinical 
site. 
 
An unblinded site research pharmacist will prepare the study product and an unblinded research nurse will inject 
the study product per the randomization assignment. The pharmacist will conceal the contents of the syringe by 
wrapping the syringe barrel with  an overlay, opaque tape, or other equivalent material. In addition, the subject 
will be asked to look away when the vaccine is being administered.  
 
The unblinded site research pharmacist and unblinded research nurse will not be involved in study -related 
assessments or have subject contact for data collection following study vaccine administration.  
 
6.3.3.1  Unblinding  
A copy of subject treatment assignments will be retained at the site in a secure file by the unblinded staff. In the 
event of a medical emergency whe n knowledge of the treatment assignment will influence subject’s care, the 
Principal Investigator may be provided with the treatment assignment. The Principal Investigator must contact 
NTI and document the event with information regarding the reasons for u nblinding. After discussion with NTI, 
the Principal Investigator may receive the treatment assignment from the data coordinating center or if necessary, 
from the on -site secure file by the unblinded staff.  
 
6.4 Study Intervention  Compliance  
Each dose of study product will be administered by a member of the clinical research team who is qualified and 
licensed to administer study product. Administration  site, date, and time will be document ed on the case report 
form (CRF)  and entered into the eCRF.  
 
6.5 Concomi tant Therapy  
All concomitant medications taken within 60 days p rior to signing the ICF will be reviewed with subjects to 
determine stability of chronic diseases and eligibility.  Medications reported in the eCRF are limited to those taken

 Study Halting Criteria  
Additional enrollment and study interventions/administration of study products in this trial will be halted for SMC 
review/recommendation if any of the following are reported:  
• Any subject experience s ulceration, abscess, or necrosis at the injection site related to study product 
administration . 
• Any subject presents with laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypotension or anaphylaxis occurring within 24 
hours following product administration that is considered related to study product . 
• Two or more subjects experience generalized urticaria (defined as occur ring at more than two body parts) 
within 72 hours  after administration of study product that is considered related to study product.  
• Any subject experiences an SAE after administration of study product and prior to the subject’s last visit that 
is consider ed related to study product.  
• Two or more subjects who received at least one dose of study vaccine to date, cumulative to all study vaccine 
administrations, across all treatment arms, experience the same  Grade 3 (unsolicited AE or safety laboratory) , 
in the  same HL T by MedDRA coding,  considered related to study product.  
 
This trial will also be halted for SMC  review/recommendation if, within 7 days after administration of either study 
vaccination, any of the following occurs:  
• Three  or more subjects who recei ved at least one dose of study vaccine to date, cumulative to all study vaccine 
administrations, across all treatment arms, experience the same severe (Grade 3) study vaccine -related 
injection site reaction. Erythema and induration (hardness)/edema (swelli ng) will also be measured in mm but 
size will not be used as halting criteria.  
• Three  or more subjects who received at least one dose of study vaccine to date, cumulative to all study vaccine 
administrations, across all treatment arms, experience the same s evere (Grade 3) study vaccine -related 
subjective systemic reaction, for which the severity (grade) is corroborated by study personnel.  
• Three  or more subjects who received at least one dose of study vaccine to date, cumulative to all study vaccine 
administr ations, across all treatment arms, experience the same severe (Grade 3) study vaccine -related

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 42 of 84 If any of the halting rules are met following any subject receipt of any study vaccination, then this trial will not 
continue with the remaining enrollments or study vaccinations without a r eview by and recommendation from 
the SMC to proceed.  
 
NTI retain s the authority to suspend additional enrollment and study interventions/administration of study 
products during this trial, as applicable.  
 
NTI is empowered to stop enrollment and study vacci nations if AEs that meet the halting criteria are reported.  
 
 Individual Halting Criteria  
Individual Halting Criteria must be reviewed by the site PI prior to administration of the second study vaccination 
for each subject. It is the responsibility of the s ite to ensure that any subject meeting the below criteria are 
discontinued from receiving study product; however, the Emmes BMM or safety monitor may be consulted as 
needed.  
The second study vaccination will not be administered to a subject if any of the f ollowing  criteria are met , as 
determined by the site PI : 
• Serious adverse event associated with study vaccination . 
• Pregnancy in a female subject . 
• Type 1 hypersensitivity associated with study product . 
• Grade 3 systemic reaction associated with study product . 
• Grade 3 local reaction (with the exception of erythema/induration) associated with study  product (e.g., pain) . 
• Grade 2 or higher fever within the first 24 hours following the initial vaccination . 
• Medical condition for which continued participation, in the opinion of the site principal  investigator or 
appropriate sub -investigator, would pose a risk to the subject or would be  likely to confound interpretation of 
the results.  
• Presence of signs or symptoms that could confound or confuse as sessment of study  vaccine reactogenicity. 
For subjects with injection site or systemic signs or symptoms, or  with an acute illness, including but not 
limited to an oral temperature greater than or  equal to 100.4 ℉, the second study vaccination should be 
postponed/deferred until  signs, symptoms, or acute illness have resolved and still within the acceptable 
protocol -specified  window for that visit. If outside this window, the Blinded Medical Monitor  must first  
approve the second study vaccination and the docu mentation of approval should be filed  in the subject’s chart.  
• Any unresolved or continuing solicited or unsolicited Grade 3 adverse event after first  vaccination. An 
unresolved or continuing Grade 1 or Grade 2 adverse event is  permissible unless, in the op inion of the site 
principal investigator or appropriate subinvestigator,  it would render study vaccination unsafe or interfere 
with the evaluation of  responses.  
• Grade 2 or higher clinical safety laboratory result that does not decrease to Grade 1 or  below prior to the 
second study vaccination. For a subject to receive the second study  vaccination, the most recently evaluated 
clinical safety laboratory values obtained prior  to the second study vaccination must be Grade 1 or less. The

HydroVax -002 YFV Phase 1 Study           24 January 2023 
 
  
Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 43 of 84 second study vaccination  should be scheduled to occur  within the acceptable protocol -specified window for 
that visit. If outside this window, the  Blinded Medical Monitor  must first approve the second study vaccination 
and the  documentation of approval should be filed in the subje ct’s chart.  
• Grade 3 adverse event that occurs without alternative etiology in the 7 days following the  first s tudy 
vaccination.  
• Severe or sustained reaction or disability related to the first study vaccination.  
• New information becomes available that makes further participation unsafe.  
 
7.2 Participant Withdrawal from the Study  and Replacement  
 Participant Withdrawal  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw their consent for trial participation at any time and for any reason, without 
penalty or loss of benefits to which  they are otherwise entitled.  
 
The site PI or appropriate sub -investigator may also withdraw a subject from receiving the study vaccine for any 
reason.  
 
A subject may withdraw or be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
• Medical disease or co ndition, or any new clinical finding for which continued participation, in the opinion of 
the site PI or appropriate sub -investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject, or would interfere 
with the subject’s successful completion of this trial, or  would interfere with the evaluation of responses (for 
example, has baseline significant laboratory abnormalities).  
• The subject withdraws consent.  
• Subject no longer meets eligibility criteria (see Section s 5.1 and 5.2). Note: Medication changes in the 60 days 
prior to enrollment, as specif ied in Subject Inclusion Criterion  (See Section 5.1, Point Number  5), are 
exclusionary for receipt of the first study vaccination only.  
• As deemed necessary by the site PI or appropriate sub -investigator for noncompliance or other reasons . 
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
• The study is terminated . 
• Any reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes the subject's participation in the study . 
• New information becomes available that makes further participation unsafe.  
 
 Subject Replacement  
Subjects who withdraw, or are withdrawn or terminated from the study, or are lost to follow -up after signing the 
informed consent form, randomization, and receipt of study vaccine will not be replaced. Subjects who withdraw, 
or are withdrawn or terminated from the study, or are lost to  follow -up after signing the informed consent form 
and randomization but before receipt of study vaccine may be replaced .

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 44 of 84 7.3 Lost to Follow -Up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to 
be contacted by the study site staff.  
 
7.4 Follow up for subjects that discontinued study intervention  
The primary reason for withdrawal from this trial will be recorded on the Study Status data collection form (DCF). 
Subjects will be encouraged to complete  the Early Termination Visit. The Early Termination Visit procedures are 
listed in Sectio n 1.2. 
 
Although subjects are free to withdraw at any time o r may be withdrawn by the site PI or appropriate sub -
investigator at any time (see Section  7.2.1 ), those subjects who receive only one dose of study vaccine will be 
encouraged to remain in this trial for follow -up safety assessments (may be conducted by phone call rather than 
in person) c ontinuing through approximately 6 months after their last study vaccination. These subjects will also 
be encouraged to provide a venous blood sample for serological assays after their last study vaccination. See the 
protocol -specific Manual of Procedures ( MOP) for alternate follow -up requirements.  
 
Every attempt will be made to follow all AEs, including solicited injection site and systemic reactions, unsolicited 
non-serious AEs,  SAEs , and NOCMCs  ongoing at the time of early withdrawal through resolution as  per 
applicable collection times defined for the specific type of AE.  
 
In the case of subjects who fail to appear for a follow -up safety assessment, extensive effort (i.e., three 
documented contact attempts via phone calls made on separate occasions and fo llowed by a certified letter) will 
be made to locate or recall them, or at least to determine their health status. These efforts will be documented in 
the subject’s study records.  
 
The site PI or appropriate sub -investigator will inform the subject that al ready collected data will be retained and 
analyzed even if the subject withdraws or is withdrawn from this study.

 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  AND PROCEDURES  
8.1 Screening and Immunogen icity Assessments  
 Screening  Procedures  
Screening procedures may be done up to 28 days prior to enrollment (Day -28 to Day -1). After informed consent 
the following assessments are performed to determine eligibility and obtain baseline data:  
1. Take a focused medical history, including the following information:  
• History of any chronic medical conditions related to inclusion and exclusion criteria . 
• History of any medication allergies including history of hypersensitivity to any components of the study 
product.  
• Concomitant medications taken within 60 days prior to signing the ICF will be reviewed with subjects to 
determine stability of chronic diseases and eligibility . 
• Ask if they are participating in another clinical trial or plan to enroll in another clinical trial during the study 
period . 
2. Women of childbearing potentials should be co unseled to either practice abstinence or use at least one 
primary form of contraception from 30 days prior to receipt of study product until 30 days after receipt of 
the last dose of study vaccine.  
3. Sexually active men should be counseled to use contracepti on from the date of receipt of the first dose of 
study vaccine until one month after receipt of the second dose of study vaccine . 
4. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum HCG pregnancy test at screening and a 
negative urine HCG pregnancy test prior to each dose of study product . 
5. Physical exam (standard exam at screening and targeted exam at enrollment) . 
6. Height and weight measurement (Calculation of Body Mass Index) . 
7. Vital signs measurement (including HR, BP, oral temperature) . 
8. Blood for la boratory evaluations . 
• Serology at screening: HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody . 
• Chemistry at screening: sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium , creatinine, glucose [non -fasting], ALT, 
AST, and total bilirubin . 
• Hematology at screening:  white blood cells (WBCs) , hemoglobin, and platelet  count . 
• Urine for glucose and protein . 
 
Clinical screening laboratory evaluations will be performed locally by the Duke University Health System

HydroVax -002 YFV Phase 1 Study           24 January 2023 
 
  
Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 46 of 84 The overall eligibility of the subject to participate in the study will be assessed once all screening values are 
available.  Study subjects who qualify will be randomized into the Advantage eClinical syste m and all others will 
be registered as screen failures.  Results of screening testing will be  discussed with the subject. If a positive result 
for HIV, hepatitis C or hepatitis B occurs  or there is a laboratory result deemed to be clinically significant by the 
PI, the subject will be referred for appropriate follow -up.   Laboratory values that are  outside the range of 
eligibility but are thought to be due to an acute condition or due to laboratory error may be repeated once.  
 
 Immunogenicity Assessments  
8.1.2.1  Humoral Immunogenicity Tests  
Neutralizing YFV -specific antibody responses following vaccination w ill be assessed by PRNT 50 assays 
performed on blood samples obtained at Baseline (Day 1) and Days 15 and 29 after the first vaccination and at 
Days 15, 29, 57, and 180 following the second vaccination.  
 
8.1.2.2  Specimen Preparation, Handling, and Shipping  
Blood specimens for YFV neutralizing assays will be processed as specified in the MOP and shipped monthly to 
Fisher BioServices. They will then be sent to OHSU (Beaverton, OR) for testing.  
 
8.2 Safety and Other Assessments  
Study procedures are specified in th e SoA.  A study physician licensed to make medical diagn oses and listed on 
Form  1572 will be responsible for all trial -related medical decisions.  
 
 Physical examination  
A targeted physical exam will be performed at baseline and at subsequent in -person visit s as indicated by changes  
in medical history.   
 
 Safety Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Safety labs will be conducted on blood samples obtained on  Days 4 and 15 after each vaccination and on the day 
of, but prior to , administration of the first and second vaccination  (day 29 after first vaccination) .  Safety labs  
include hematology tests (hemoglobin, WBC, and platelet count) and blood chemistry tests ( sodium, potassium, 
bicarbonate, calcium , creatinine , glucose [ non-fasting] , ALT, AST, and total bilirubin).   
 
Urine will be tested by dipstick to evaluate glucose, protein, blood , and leukocyte esterase on  days 1, 15  and  29 
after first vaccination and day 15 after second vaccination.  
 
Safety labs will be tested locally by Duke University Health System Clinical Laboratories.    
For laboratory values outside the site’s reference ranges, the site PI will document clinical significance in the 
eCRF.  Any result that is deemed clinically significant but does not meet the protocol’s grading criteria ( Appendix 
A) should either be repeated by the study site, or the subject referred for appropriate clinical follow -up.

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 47 of 84 For any result that meets the protocol’s grad ing criteria (whether or not it is deemed clinically significant), the PI 
will also assess relationship to study product, action taken with product, and whether the subject was discontinued 
due to the event.  Graded laboratory abnormalities should be follo wed until either a return to normal or are judged 
to be stable, as determined by the PI.  
 
In the absence of a diagnosis, any clinical safety laboratory test result that meets the definition of an SAE as 
determined by the investigator (e.g., life -threatenin g) must be reported as an SAE using the AE/SAE form set.

Blood samples will be obtained on Day 4 after each vaccination for YFV  viremia testing. Viremia testing will 
include plaque assay and/or RT -PCR.  Positive results may be foll owed by additional testing (e.g., blind 
passage/amplification).   Frozen serum specimens for viremia testing will be shipped to Fisher BioServices. They 
will then be sent to OHSU (Beaverton, OR) for testing as needed.  
 
 Additional Sera Samples  
Additional sera samples may be shipped to Fisher BioServices for storage.  
 
8.3 Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values or Abnormal 
Clinical Findings  
If a physiologic parameter, (e.g., vital signs, or laboratory value) is outsi de of the protocol -specified range, then 
the measurement may be repeated once if, in the judgment of the investigator, the abnormality is the result of an 
acute, short -term, rapidly  reversible condition (e.g., stress, anxiety, or “white coat syndrome”). A physiologic 
parameter may also be repeated if there is a technical problem with the measurement caused by malfunctioning, 
or an inappropriate measuring device (i.e., inappropriate -sized blood pressure cuff).  
 
8.4 Unscheduled Visit  
If the investigator deems the  reaction warrants further evaluation or intervention, the investigator will give further 
instructions on the proper course of action, including a return to the clinic for immediate evaluation at an 
unscheduled visit if appropriate.  
 
8.5 Adverse Events and Ser ious Adverse Events  
 Definition  of Adverse Events (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, 
whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). An AE can therefore be any u nfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will b e considered as baseline and 
not reported as an AE.  However, if the severity of any pre -existing medical condition increases, it should be 
recorded as an AE.

HydroVax -002 YFV Phase 1 Study           24 January 2023 
 
  
Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 48 of 84  
Adverse events can be further divided into solicited adverse events and unsolicited adverse even ts. Solicited 
adverse events are those for which the study team will specifically query the participant whether they occurred. 
Unsolicited adverse events are those events that the subject report occurring without being queried about the 
specific event.  
 
All AEs will be assessed for severity and relationship to study intervention (see Section  8.5.3.2 ). 
 
All AEs, solicited and unsolicited, will be captu red on the appropriate data collection form.  Information to be 
collected for AEs includes event description, date of onset, assessment of severity,  relationship to study product 
and alternate etiology (assessed only by those with the training and authorit y to make a diagnosis and listed on 
the FDA Form 1572 as an investigator), date of resolution, seriousness and outcome.  AEs occurring during the 
trial collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. In addition, a ll 
medically -attended adverse events  (MAAEs)  (i.e., events for which medical care from a healthcare provider is 
sought) will be collected through Study Visit 09.  
 
8.5.1.1  Solicited Adverse Events /Reactogenicity  
Solicited adverse events are anticipated l ocal and systemic adverse events for which consistent collection of 
information is desired. This may include:  
• Common and expected events according to the available knowledge about the product, or  
• Specific events of concern that should be ascertained on eve ry participant.  
 
All subjects will be observed for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination to detect and treat any immediate 
adverse reactions. Subjects will be provided with a memory aid, digital, oral thermometer, and ruler for recording 
daily maximum oral temperature and systemic and local AEs beginning with the day of vaccination and 
continuing for the next 7 days. Subjects will be encouraged to take their temperature around the same time each 
day and also if they feel feverish, beginning with  the day of vaccination. Subjects will be instructed on how to 
use the memory aid and how to rate any adverse events.   The subject will record temperature and the presence 
and intensity of post vaccination local reactogenicity events, including signs of re dness and swelling and 
symptoms of pain and tenderness. The subjects will measure redness and swelling at the vaccination site with the 
measuring device provided. Systemic solicited symptoms will include feverishness, fatigue, headache, chills, 
nausea, new  muscle pain (exclusive of the injection sites), aggravated muscle pain (increase of existing pain, 
exclusive of the injection site), new joint pain, and aggravated joint pain (increase of existing pain). The subjects 
will measure temperature with the ther mometer provided.   Subjects will be instructed to notify the study center if 
they develop any severe reactions and/or fever equal to or exceeding 101. 3°F. 
 
Subjects will also  be asked to record any medications taken and any emergency room or physician visi ts (other 
than routine check -ups). The subject memory aid will be reviewed with the subject at subsequent clinic visits.  
 
After vaccination, antipyretics or analgesics should not be given routinely. Administration of an antipyretic or 
analgesic is to be re corded in the memory aid and entered into the CRF.

 Definition of Serious Adverse Event s (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32 (a)):  
• Death. 
• A life-threatening adverse event . 
• Inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, 
or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death , be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be 
considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, etc.  
 
SAEs will be:  
• Assessed for severity and relati onship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product) 
by a licensed study physician listed on the FDA Form 1572 or by the Institution as the site Principal 
Investigator or Sub -Investigator.  
• Recorded on the appropriate SAE data c ollection form and eCRF.  
• Followed through resolution by a licensed study physician (for investigational new drug application [IND] 
studies, a physician listed on the FDA Form 1572 as the site Principal Investigator or Sub -Investigator).  
 
Reviewed and eval uated by the sponsor , the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) (periodic review unless 
related), and the IRB/IEC . 
 
8.5.2.1  Suspected Unexpected  Serious  Adverse  Reactions  (SUSAR)  
A SUSAR  is any SAE  where  a causal  relationship  with the study product  is at least reasonabl y possibl e but is 
not listed  in the Investigator  Brochure , Package Insert,  and/or  Summary  of Product  Characteristics.  
 
 Classification of an  Adverse Events  
The determination of seriousness, severity, and causality will be made by an on -site investigator who is qualified 
(licensed) to diagnose, provide a medical evaluation of adverse events, and classify adverse events based upon 
medical judgment. This includes but is not limited to physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 52 of 84 8.5.3.1  Seriousness  and Severity of Event  
Event seriousness will be determined according to the protocol definition of an SAE ( Section 8.5.1 ).    All AEs 
or SAEs  will be assessed for severity, according to the toxicity grading scales in  Appendix A.  
 
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be 
used to describe severity.  
• Mild (Grade 1):  Events that are usually transient and may require only minimal or no treatment or therapeutic 
intervention and generally do not interfere with the subject’s usual activities of daily living.  
• Moderate (Grade 2):  Events that are usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily livin g, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent 
risk of harm to the research participant.  
• Severe (Grade 3):  Events interrupt usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or 
may require intensive therapeutic inter vention.  Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
 
8.5.3.2  Relationship to Study Intervention  
The licensed study physician’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study product is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is o r is not reported in this study. If there is any doubt as to 
whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. The relationship to study product must be 
assessed for AEs using the terms: related or not related. In general , the study product must always be suspect. To 
help assess, the following guidelines are used:    
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal r elationship between the study intervention and event. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administratio n of the study intervention caused the 
event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology 
has been established.  
 
 Time Period  and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
For this study all solicited AEs will be documented for the 8 days following study product administration.  
 
For this study,  all unsolicited, non -serious AEs will be documented from Study Visit 01 (Day 1) through Study 
Visit 0 7 (Day 29 post second vaccination).  
 
All MAAEs, SAEs and new onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMC ) will be documented from Study Visit 
01 (Day 1) through Study Visit 09 (final visit).  
 
Resolution of an AE is defined as the return to pre -treatment status or as stabilization of the condition, with the 
expectation that it will remain chronic.   Site PIs are required to follow all reported AEs until either resolution of 
the AE or until the event is stable, as determined by the site PI; all SAEs will be followed until either resolution

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 53 of 84 of the SAE or until t he SAE is stable, as determined by the PI.   Subjects who have an unresolved SAE at either 
the final study  visit or at discontinuation of study participation will continue to be followed, with the subject’s 
permission, until the SAE is stable/deemed chronic , as determined by the site PI.  
 
 Adverse Event Reporting  
8.5.5.1  Investigators Reporting of AEs  
Adverse Events, including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events,” will 
be captured on the appropriate case report form. Inf ormation to be collected for unsolicited adverse events 
includes event description, date of onset, investigator assessment of severity, relationship to study product, date 
of resolution of the event, seriousness, and outcome.  
 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporti ng 
8.5.6.1  Investigators Reporting of AEs  
Serious adverse events will be collected throughout the study until the final visit is completed.  
 
The following procedures will apply to all serious adverse events:  
• Assessed for severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product) 
by a licensed physician listed on the FDA Form 1572 as the principal investigator or subinvestigator . 
• Recorded on the appropriate serious adver se event report form and electronic case report form (eCRF) . 
• Reviewed and evaluated by an Independent Safety Monitor, the SMC (periodic review unless related), NTI 
and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) (as indicated) . 
• Reviewed and followed to resolution  or stabilization by a licensed physician listed on the FDA Form 1572 as 
the principal investigator or subinvestigator . 
 
The Blinded Medical Monitor will review and assess the SAE for regulatory reporting and potential impact on 
study subject safety and protocol conduct.  
 
8.5.6.2  Regulatory  Reporting of AEs  
Following notification from the site Principal Investigator or appropriate sub -investigator, NTI, as the IND 
sponsor, will review the suspected unexpected serious adverse event (SUSAR) and ensure it  is reporte d as an IND 
safety report to the FDA. Submissions of IND safety reports will be performed by Emmes on behalf of NTI.  
Emmes  will notify all participating site Principal Investigators (i.e., all Principal Investigators to whom the 
sponsor is providing drug u nder its IND(s) ) of potential serious risks from clinical studies or any other source, as 
soon as possible.  Emmes, on behalf of NTI, will report to the FDA any unexpected fatal or life -threatening 
suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial 
receipt of the information.  If the event is not fatal or life -threatening the IND safety report will be submitted 
within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifi es for reporting as specified in 
21 CFR Part 312.32.  Relevant follow up information to an IND safety report will be submitted as soon as the 
information is available.  Upon request from FDA, NTI (or Emmes, on NTI’s behalf)  will submit to the FDA any

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 54 of 84 addit ional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 
calendar days after receiving the request.   
 
SAEs that are not SUSARs will be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format which incl udes all 
SAEs.   
 
 Adverse  Events of Special Interest  
This study will also assess New -Onset Chronic Medical Conditions (NOCMCs) from the day of receipt of the 
first dose of study product until study completion . NOCMCs are defined as any new ICD -10 diagnosis  (10th 
revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) that is applied to 
the subject during the course of the study, after receipt of the study agent, that is expected to continue for at least 
3 months and  requires continued health care intervention.  NOCMCs will  be assessed and recorded as unsolicited 
AEs.   
 
 Reporting of Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is not an adverse event. Pregnancies occurring in study subjects will be reported via Advantage 
eClinical® on the Pr egnancy Report form. No further study vaccinations will be administered to pregnant 
subjects, but if the subject has received a study vaccination and with the subject’s permission all study mandated 
blood samples will be obtained and the subject will conti nue in follow -up for safety events. Efforts will be made 
to follow all pregnancies reported during the course of the study to pregnancy outcome pending the subject’s 
permission.  
 
8.6 Unanticipated Problems  
 Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
The Department of Health and Human Services  Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers 
unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, 
or outcome that meets all of the following cri teria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in 
the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the 
research); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
 Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and 
to the Coordinating Center (CC ). The UP report will include the following information:  
NTI Protocol 20 -001           Version 6.0 
HydroVax -002 YFV Phase 1 Study           24 January 2023 
 
  
Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 55 of 84 • Protocol identifying info rmation: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number . 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome . 
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP . 
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed 
in response to the UP . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
• UPs that are seriou s adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the CC/study sponsor within 24 
hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the CC/study sponsor within 5 days of the investigator 
becomin g aware of the problem.

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 58 of 84 Unsolicited AEs will be coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  for preferred term 
and system organ class.  The rate and exact 95% confidence intervals of AEs in aggregate, and by MedDRA 
categories, will be computed.  SAEs will be reported by a detailed listing showing the type, MedDRA coding, 
relevant dates (vaccinat ion and adverse event), severity, relatedness, and outcome for each event.   Primary 
outcome measures include:  
• Occurrence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) at any time during the study . 
• Occurrence of all Grade 3 unsolicited adverse events (AEs) from firs t vaccination through day 29 after the 
second vaccination . 
• Occurrence of all Grade 3 laboratory toxicities from first vaccination through day 15 after the second 
vaccination . 
• Occurrence of solicited local AE and reactogenicity signs and symptoms in the 7 days after each vaccination . 
• Occurrence of solicited systemic AE and reactogenicity signs and symptoms in the 7 days after each 
vaccination . 
• Occurrence of any AE through day 29 after the second vaccination . 
 
 Analysis of Secondary  and Exploratory  Outcome Measures ( Immunogenicity ) 
Basic descriptive statistics, such as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals, and graphical summaries, such 
as the reverse cumulative distribution, of seroconversion rates and geometric mean titer (G MT) will be computed 
by intervention at baseline, 15 and 29 days after the first vaccination, and 15, 29, 57, and 180 days after the second 
vaccination.  YFV -specific neutralizing antibody titers may be measured through a standard plaque reduction 
neutraliz ing titer  [PRNT 50] assay, or utilizing a Log 10 Neutralizing Index  (LNI) assay [5, 38].  For the purposes 
of this study,  and in line with recent yellow fever vaccine c linical trials [7, 8], antibody titers will be assessed 
using the PRNT 50 assay, and s eroconversion will be  defined as a PRNT 50 neutralizing antibody titer of ≥1:10. The 
limit of detection in the neutralizi ng assay will be a titer of <10.  For the purposes of determining seroconversion 
rates and GMT, antibody titers of <10 will be assumed to be 5 (one dilution step below th e assay limit value).  
 
Rates of seroconversion will be summarized by tabulating the fr equency of positive responses by treatment group 
at Day 29 after first vaccination and Day 57 after second vaccination.  Response rates for each treatment group 
will be presented with their corresponding 95% confidence interval estimates at each time point . The relationship 
between the proportion of responders and dosage will be examined using logistic regression.  The distribution of 
antibody titers will also be graphically summarized using the reverse cumulative frequency distribution of titers 
for each t reatment group.   
 
The PRNT 50 titers at days 15 and 29 after first vaccination and at days 15, 29, and 57 following second vaccination 
will be summarized graphically for each treatment group .  The geometric mean titer (GMT) and pair -wise 
differences of eac h treatment group will also be presented with 95% confidence intervals.  The relationship 
between GMT and dosage will be examined using standard linear regression methods.   Secondary outcome 
measures include:  
• Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion ( 1:10 in plaque reduction neutralizing titer [PRNT 50] titer ) 
at day 29 after first vaccination and at day 29 after second vaccination .

days 15, 29,  and 57 after the second vaccination for each dose group and for all dose groups combined . 
 
Exploratory outcome measures include:  
• Geometric mean neutralizing titers at Day 180 following second vaccination . 
• Reverse cumulative distribution curve of neutraliz ing titers on Day 180  after the second vaccination for each 
dose group and for all dose groups combined . 
• Additional exploratory immunogenicity analyses utilizing the LNI assay may be conducted for comparison to 
historical datasets  
 
 Timing of Analyses  
9.4.4.1  Inter im Safety Analyses  
The blinded medical monitor, clinical program manager , unblinded medical monitor  and PI of the clinical 
laboratory will review data through the Day 15 visit after vaccination 1 for the 4 subjects in the sentinel groups.  
After the comple tion of Group 1 enrollment, the SMC will then review the data on all Group 1 subjects through 
the post 2nd vaccination Day 15 visit.  These reviews, however, may not involve any hypothesis testing and will 
not be considered in estimating the precision of a ny estimates made at the conclusion of the study.  
9.4.4.2   Final Analyses  
Clinical, safety, and reactogenicity data through approximately Day 57  after last study vaccination  will represent 
the primary clinical database for the trial. Once all subjects have completed the Day 57 post dose 2 visit and the 
data are entered in the database, validated and monitored according to the clinical monitoring plan , the primary 
clinical dat abase will be locked . Unblinded a nalyses  of the primary and secondary  safety, reactogenicity, and 
immunogenicity  outcomes  (Neutralization and viremia)  and any supporting analyses  of these outcomes described 
in the SAP  will be performed by the SDCC  and prov ided to the sponsor and PI .  Individual subject listings will 
not be generated at this point. The laboratory staff that run the assays for the Day 180 post dose 2  visit will remain 
blinded, and the assessment of relationship to study product of any SAEs th at may be reported at the Day 180 
post dose 2  visit will be delegated to blinded sub -investigators at the clinical site.  While the results will not be 
used to make any decisions concerning the conduct of this trial, they may be used to make decisions on a ctivities 
external to this trial such as the design of future trials of this vaccine.  Since this early analysis of the data is not 
intended to impact the conduct of the trial, it has no impact on Type I error and adjustments are not planned .  
 
The remaini ng analyses , including generation of all individual subject listings,  will be completed and the CSR 
generated after the last subject’s last visit is completed, and the final  clinical database, including all long -term 
safety follow -up data, is cleaned, monitored and  locked.  
 
A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to unblinding for  any analysis, 
which defines the analyses to be included in the CSR.

 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Regulatory, Ethical and Study Oversight Considerations  
Each site principal investigator will obtain IRB approval for this protocol and any amendments to be conducted 
at his/her research site(s).   
 
NTI must receive the documentation that verifies IRB/IEC -approval for this protocol, informed consent, and 
associated documents prior to the recruitment, screening, and enrollment of subjects.  
 
 Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual agreeing to participate in a trial and co ntinuing 
throughout the individual’s trial participation. Before any study procedures are performed, informed consent will 
be obtained and documented. Subjects will receive a concise and focused presentation of key information about 
the trial, verbally and  with a written ICF. The explanation will be organized and  presented in lay terminology and 
language that facilitates understanding why one might or might not want to participate. The ICF must not include 
any exculpatory statements.  
 
The site PI or their d esignee will describe the protocol to potential subjects face -to-face. The key information 
about the purpose of the trial, the procedures and experimental aspects of the trial, risks and discomforts, any 
expected benefits to the subject, and alternative tr eatment will be presented first to the subject.  
 
Subjects will also receive an explanation that the trial involves research and a detailed summary of the proposed 
study procedures and study interventions/study products. This will include aspects of the tri al that are 
experimental, the probability for random assignment to treatment arms, any expected benefits, all possible risks 
(including a statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject or to the embryo 
or fetus, if th e subject is or may become pregnant, that are currently unforeseeable), the expected duration of the 
subject’s participation in the trial, alternative treatment/procedures that may be available, and the important 
potential benefits and risks of these avail able alternative treatment/procedures.  
 
Subjects will be informed that they will be notified in a timely manner if information becomes available that may 
be relevant to their willingness to continue participation in the trial. Subjects will receive an expl anation as to 
whether any compensation and any medical treatments are available if injury occurs, and, if so, what they consist 
of or where further information may be obtained. Subjects will be informed of the anticipated financial expenses, 
if any, to the  subject for participating in the trial, as well as any anticipated prorated payments, if any, to the 
subject for participating in the trial. They will be informed of whom to contact (e.g., the site PI) for answers to 
any questions relating to the research  project.  
 
Information will also include the foreseeable circumstances and/or reasons under which the subject’s participation 
in the trial may be terminated. The subjects will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they are free 
to withdraw f rom the study for any reason at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled.

The extent of the confidentiality of the subjects’ records will be defined, and subjects will be informed that 
applicable data protect ion legislation will be followed. Subjects will be informed that the monitors, auditors, IRB, 
NTI, and regulatory authorities will be granted direct access to the subject’s original medical records for 
verification of trial procedures and/or data without v iolating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent 
permitted by the applicable laws and regulations, and that, by signing a written ICF, the subject is authorizing 
such access.  
 
Subjects will be informed that records identifying the subject will be  kept confidential and, to the extent permitted 
by the applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made publicly available and, if the results of the trial are 
published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential. Subjects will be informed whethe r private information 
collected from this research and/or samples/specimens will be used for additional research, even if identifiers are 
removed.  
 
Subjects will be allowed sufficient time to consider participation in the trial and  have the opportunity to discuss 
the trial with their family, friends or legally authorized representative, or think about it prior to agreeing to 
participate.  
 
ICFs will be IRB -approved and subjects will be asked to read and review the ICF. Subjects must sign the ICF 
prior to sta rting any study procedures being done specifically for the trial.  
 
Once signed, a copy of the ICF will be given to the subjects for their records. The subject(s) may withdraw consent 
at any time throughout the course of the trial. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by 
emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to 
participate in or withdraw from the trial.  
 
New information that significantly impacts the subject’s r isk of receiving the study interventions/study products 
will be communicated by the site PIs or their designees to the subjects who consent to participate in the trial in 
accordance with IRB requirements. The ICF will be updated and subjects will be re -consented in accordance with 
IRB requirements, if necessary. Subjects will be given a copy of all ICFs that they sign.  
 
Study personnel may employ IRB -approved recruitment efforts prior to obtaining study consent if a patient -
specific screening consent is on record or if the IRB has agreed that chart review is allowed without a fully 
executed screening consent. In cases where there is not a patient -specific screening consent on record, Clinical 
Staff  may pre -screen via chart review and refer potential subjects  to the Research staff. Research staff would 
obtain written consent per the standard informed consent process before conducting protocol -specific screening 
activities.

 Confidentiality  and Privacy  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the site PIs, other study personnel, the sponsor, and their agents. 
This confidentiality includes documentation, investigation data, subject’s clinical information, and all other 
information generated during participation in this trial. No information concerning this trial , or the data generated 
from this trial , will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the subject and 
NTI.  
 
Subject confidentiality will be maintained when trial results are published or discussed in conferences and  is 
extended  to cover testing of samples/specimens. The study monitor or other authorized representatives  of NTI as 
well as governmental regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, may inspect all documents and records required to 
be maintained by the site PI. This includes , but is not limited to, medical records (office, clinic or hospital) and 
pharmacy records for the subjects in this trial. The participating site will permit access to such records.  
 
All records will be kept locked and all computer entry and networking pro grams will be carried out with coded 
numbers only and with password -protected systems. All non -clinical samples/specimens, evaluation forms, 
reports, and other records that leave the site will be identified only by a coded number and will not be identified  
by the subject’s name.  
 
As this research is funded by the NIH, it is covered by NIH policy which effectively issues the research a 
Certificate of Confidentiality.  By this policy, researchers cannot be forced to disclose or provide, in any Federal, 
State,  or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, the name of such individual or any 
such information, document, or biospecimen that contains identifiable, sensitive information about the individual 
and that was created or compil ed for purposes of the research, unless such disclosure or use is made with the 
consent of the individual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen pertains.  
 
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the U nited States Government 
that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects, like this study, or for information that must be 
released in order to meet the requirements of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
A Certificate of C onfidentiality does not prevent the subject from voluntarily releasing information about 
themselves or their involvement in this research.  If any person or agency obtains a written consent to receive 
research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.  
 
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from reporting without the subject’s consent, 
information that would identify the subject as a participant in the research project regarding matters that must be 
legally reported including: child and elder abuse, sexual abuse, or wanting to harm themselves or others.  
 
The release of individual private information or specimens for other research will only occur if c onsent was 
obtained from the i ndividual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen pertains, or for the purposes of other

subjects in research.  
 
 Future Use of Stored Specimens for Secondary Research  
Subjects will be asked to consent to use of any remaining specimens for possible use in future secondary research 
studies as a condition of their study participation. A subject’s decision can be changed at any time p rior to the end 
of the study by notifying the study doctors or nurses in writing. However, if a subject consents to future use and 
some of their blood has already been used for research purposes, the information from that research may still be 
used.  
 
Some  samples may be stored at the local site and some at a central clinical storage facility. Samples may be shared 
with other investigators at other institutions. The samples will not be sold or used directly for production of any 
commercial product. No genet ic testing will be performed on stored specimens.  
 
Each sample will be encoded (labeled) only with a barcode and a unique tracking number to protect subject’s 
confidentiality. There are no benefits to subjects in the collection, storage and subsequent research use of 
specimens. Reports  about  future  research  done  with subject’s  samples  will not be kept in their health  records.

 Safety Oversight  
10.1.6.1  Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC ) 
The study oversight will be conducted by a SMC which is an independent group of experts that will be  established 
by NTI to monitor subject safety and advise  NTI.  SMC members will be separate and independent of study 
personnel participating in this study a nd should not have scientific, financial or other conflict s of interest related 
to the study.  The SMC will consist of members with appropriate expertise to contribute to the interpretation of 
the data from this trial.   
 
The primary responsibilities of th e SMC are to:  
 
• Review and evaluate the accumulated study safety data in a blinded fashion for participant safety after the 
low dose cohort prior to proceeding to the high dose cohort, study conduct and progress, and  
• Make recommendations to the sponsors co ncerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial.  
 
The operating rules of the SMC will be established in conjunction with NTI guidelines.  
 

NTI Protocol 20 -001           Version 6.0 
HydroVax -002 YFV Phase 1 Study           24 January 2023 
 
  
Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 67 of 84 The SMC will review the safety laboratory results , reactogenicity data , and adverse event information  collected 
through day 15 following Dose 2 for the Low Dose Cohort. SMC approval is required prior to initiation of 
enrollment in the High Dose Cohort.  
 
The SMC may also be asked to  review safety information on the low dose or high dose sentinel groups as 
documented in  Section  10.1.6.2 . 
 
NTI or the SMC may convene the SMC on an ad hoc basis acco rding to protocol criteria or if there are immediate 
concerns regarding observations during the course of the study.  Any AE/SAE that triggers a study halting rule 
will be reviewed by the Emmes BMM within 24 hours of its being reported, and, after confirmi ng that a study 
halting rule was met, Emmes will alert the SMC chair to the situation and will provide a written narrative of the 
safety event. In addition, Emmes will notify the site PI that a halting rule has been triggered, and, upon approval 
by the SMC  chair, will instruct the study site to suspend both study enrollment and study interventions (i.e., 
administering vaccine to subjects) until NTI provides explicit directions for resuming the suspended study 
activities. Concurrent with notification to the study site, Emmes will inform NTI that a halting rule has been 
triggered and that study activities, excepting follow -up with subjects for safety monitoring, have been paused 
pending the SMC’s review of the inciting event. The SMC will conduct an expeditiou s review of all relevant 
information, and a written summary of the committee’s discussion, to include any abiding concerns for subject 
safety, as well as any recommendations by the SMC regarding study continuation, will be submitted by Emmes 
to NTI. Any de cision to suspend study enrollment and/or study interventions, either temporarily or permanently, 
is exclusively NTI’s.  
 
The SMC will review SAEs on a regular basis and ad hoc during the study.  
 
10.1.6.2  Internal Safety Review Committee  (ISRC)  
An internal safety re view committee (ISRC), consisting of the blinded medical monitor, clinical program manager  
and the PI may be convened to provide an option for a rapid review of safety data collected through the day 8 
visit following dose one administered to the sentinel c ohort of the low dose group and the sentinel cohort of the 
high dose group.   If within the sentinel group during the period from first vaccination through the day 8 visit, no 
individual halting rule was met, and no more than one unique Grade 3 adverse eve nt (i.e., no same adverse event 
in more than one subject) was observed then the study will continue with administration of the second vaccination 
to the sentinel group and initiation of enrollment in the expanded dose cohort. The ISRC may be convened to 
assist with this objective determination.  If the criteria above will not be met, or at the request of the PI and/or 
NTI, the SMC will be convened to review the sentinel safety data.  If the SMC is convened for any reason for 
review of the sentinel data, the ISRC will not be convened for the cohort and the SMC will determine whether 
administration of the second vaccination to the sentinel cohort and initiation of enrollment in the expanded dose 
cohort in order for additional study vaccinations is to be given.  
 
 Clinical Monitoring/Site Monitoring Plan  
Site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the human subjects’ protection s, study and laboratory procedures, 
study interventions/administration of study products, and data collection processes are of high quality and meet 
sponsor and ICH E6 GCP guidelines and applicable federal regulations, and that this trial is conducted in

conduct site -monitoring visits as detailed in the clinical monitoring plan. NTI -designated clinical monitors will 
verify that this trial is conducted,  and data are generated, documented (recorded) and reported in compliance with 
the protocol, ICH E6 GCP guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements. Clinical monitoring reports will be 
submitted to NTI.  
 
Site visits will be made at standard intervals as defined by NTI and may be made more frequently as directed by 
NTI. Monitoring visits will include, but are not limited to, review of regulatory files, accountability records, 
eCRFs, ICFs, medical and laboratory reports, and protocol and GCP compliance. Site monitors will have access 
to each participating clinical  site, study personnel and all study documentation  according to the NTI -approved 
site monitoring plan. Study monitors will meet with site PIs to discuss any problems and actions to be taken and 
document visit findings and discussions.  
 
 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Following a written NTI -accepted site quality management plan, the site is responsible for conducting routine 
quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) activities to inter nally monitor study progress and protocol 
compliance. The site PI will provide direct access to all study -related sites, source data/DCFs and reports for the 
purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and regulatory authorit ies. The site PI 
will ensure all study personnel are appropriately trained and applicable documentation is current and maintained 
on site.  
 
The CC will implement quality control procedures beginning with the data entry system and generate data quality 
control checks that will be run on the database.  Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the 
site(s) for clarification and resolution.  
 
 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
The site principal investigator is responsible to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of 
the data reported.  
 
Data collection forms will be derived from the electronic case report form and provided by the CC to record and 
maintain data for each subject enrolled in the study.  All data collection forms should be completed in a neat, 
legible manner to ensure accurat e interpretation of data.  Black or blue ink is required to ensure clarity of 
reproduced copies.  When making a change or correction, cross out the original entry with a single line and initial 
and date the change.  Do not erase, overwrite, or use correcti on fluid or tape on the original.   
 
Data reported in the eCRF should be consistent with all source documents or the discrepancies should be 
explained.  
 
The sponsor will provide guidance to investigators on making corrections to the data collection forms a nd eCRFs.

Data for this study will include safety, laboratory (safety and immunologic) and outcome measures (e.g., 
reactogenicity and immunogenicity).  
 
Clinical data (including AE/SAEs, concomitant medicatio ns, physical assessments, and reactogenicity data) will 
be entered into the CC’s Advantage eClinical® web-based 21 CFR Part 11 -compliant Internet Data Entry System 
(IDES). The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as au tomatic range checks 
to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.  Clinical data will primarily be entered directly 
from the data collection forms.  
 
All data collection forms must be reviewed by the clinical team and data entry sta ff, who will ensure that they are 
accurate and complete.  Adverse events must be graded, assessed for severity and causality, and reviewed by the 
site principal investigator or designee.  Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at  the site 
under the supervision of the site principal investigator.  During the study, the investigator must maintain complete 
and accurate documentation for the study.  
 
The CC will be responsible for data management, quality review, analysis, and reportin g of the study data.

• Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria, Point 10 – 
Updated urine screening to specify that trace 
protein is not exclusionary at screening. 
• Appendix A, Table 14. Urine dipstick toxicity 
table. Updated table to indicate that trace urine 
protein is not exclusionary at screening 
 Trace protein on urine 
screening may be 
commonly found and 
not be indicative of any 
underlying pathology.  
Exclusion modified to 
exclude only those with 
1+ or greater amounts of 
protein on urine 
screening. 
6.0 12Jan2023 • Immunogenicity analysis of the day 180 serum 
sample (Visit 09) was converted to exploratory 
analysis.  Changes were made in Sections 1.2, 
3.0, 9.4.3, 9.4.4 and 9.4.6. This change streamlined 
the analysis and 
reporting timeline for 
the clinical study 
without impacting any 
planned safety 
assessments.

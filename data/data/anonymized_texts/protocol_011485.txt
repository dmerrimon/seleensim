Name of Sponsor/Company: Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences , a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North 
America, LLC  
Name of Investigational Product:  IDP-126 Gel 
Name of Active Ingredients:  Fixed combination of clindamycin phosphate 1.2% , benzoyl peroxide 
(BPO)   3.1%, and adapalene 0.15%  
Title of Study:  A Phase 2, Multic enter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel -Group 
Clinical Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of IDP-126 Gel in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris  
Number of Clinical Centers : Multicenter, approximately 35 study  center s in North America  
Objective:  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IDP-126 Gel in 
subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris . The safety and efficacy of once daily application of 
IDP-126 Gel will be compared to IDP-126 Component A , IDP -126 Component B , IDP -126 Component C 
and IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel. 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, 12- week study designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IDP-126 Gel in comparison with IDP-126 Component A, IDP-126 
Component B,  IDP-126 Component C and IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. To be eligible 
for the study , subjects must be at least 9 years of age and have a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe 
acne (defined as an Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [ EGSS] of 3 or 4), presenting with 30-100 
inflammatory facial lesions  (papules, pus tules, and nodules),  35-150 non-inflammatory facial lesions 
(open and closed comedones), and ≤ 2 facial nodules .      
All subjects will receive once daily, topically  applied  treatment to the face for 12 weeks.  Subject visits 
include Screening, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12, at which safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted  (Screening and Baseline may occur on the same day if no washout is 
required) . One pump of study drug will be dispensed to the s ubjects at the Baseline, Week 4 , and Week 8  
study visits . Subjects will be evaluated for dru g usage compliance at each post  baseline study visit (Weeks 
2, 4, 8, and 12). Subjects will apply their treatments at home, once daily  (in the evening) , as instructed by 
the study coordinator or designee at each study center .  
The investigator will assess the subject’s face at each study visit. Information on report ed and observed 
AEs will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination and vital sign  measurement s will 
be performed at Baseline and Week 12 (end of study ) for all subjects. Blood samples wil l be collected  
from subjects at Baseline  and Week 12, for CBC/Diff and serum  chemistry. For all female subjects of 
childbearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, Baseline (prior 
to randomization ), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Additionally , serum pregnanc y testing will be performed 
at Baseline and Week 12.  
In addition, at selected study center s, standardized photography of the face will be performed at Baseline, 
and Weeks  4, 8 and 12.  
Number of subjects planned:  
Approximately 750 subjects will be randomized in a1:1:1: 1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups:  
• 150 Subjects to IDP -126 Gel ( clindamycin phosphate 1.2% /BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% ) 
• 150 Subjects to IDP -126 Component A (BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15%)  
• 150 Subjects to IDP -126 Component B ( clindamy cin phosphate 1.2%/BPO 3.1%)  
• 150 Subjects to IDP -126 Component C (clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/ adapalene 0.15% ) 
• 150 Subjects to IDP -126 Vehicle  Gel

weeks.  
• IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel applied once daily for 12 weeks.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary efficacy:  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are intended to compare the numerical superiority of once daily 
application of IDP-126 Gel with IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel and each of  the gel components (Components A , B 
and C). Specifically, the endpoints to be  summarized using descriptive and inferential statistics are:  
(1) Absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in mean inflammatory lesion counts . 
(2) Absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in mean non-inflammatory  lesion counts.  
(3) Percent of subjects who achieve at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline and are “c lear” or 
“almost c lear” at Week 12 based on  the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS). 
Secondary efficacy:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are intended to compare the numerical superiority of once daily 
application of IDP-126 Gel with IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel and each of the gel components (Components A , B 
and C). Specifically, the secondary endpoints to be summarized using descriptive statistics are:  
(1) Absolute change in i nflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion counts from baseline at Weeks 2, 
4, and 8.  
(2) Percent of subjects who achieve at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline and are “c lear” or 
“almost c lear” at Week 2, 4, and 8 based on  the EGSS. 
(3) Mean percent  change in inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion counts fr om baseline at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
Efficacy Measurements : 
Lesion Counts  
At each visit , the e valuator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and 
nodules) on the subject’s face. Nodules will be counted separately , but will be included in the total 
inflammatory lesion count. At bas eline, eligible subjects may have no more than 2 nodules. Nodules will 
be included in the statistical analysis of inflammatory lesion counts. All inflammatory lesions will be counted at the same time rather than counting papules and pustules separately. The evaluator will als o 
count the total number of non-inflammatory  lesion s (open and closed comedones). The same blinded 
evaluator should perform the lesion counts and EGSS evaluations at all visits from baseline to week 12 for the same subject.   
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Papule – a small, solid elevation less than 5 mm in diameter. Most of the lesion is above the surface of the 
skin.  
Pustule – a small, circumscribed elevation less than 5 mm in diameter that contains yellow -white exudate.  
Nodule – a subcutaneous lesion greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter.  
Non-inflammatory  lesions  are defined as follows:  
Open comedones (black head)  – a lesion in which the follicle opening is widely dilated with the contents 
protruding out onto the surface of the skin.  
Closed comedones (white head)  – a lesion in which  the follicle opening is closed, but the sebaceous gland 
is enlarged by the pressure o f the sebum build up, which in turn causes the skin around the follicle to thin 
and become elevated with a white appearance.

 Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS)  
At each visit , the severity will be determined based on evaluator -blinded evaluations of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator assess the same 
subject at each visit. If this is not possible, the same evaluator should assess the subject at both the Baseline and Week 12 visits. Evaluation s will be scored on a scale of 0 -4, with 0 being clear and 4 being 
severe. Please see the table below for complete definitions.  The EGSS should always be completed prior 
to the lesion counts . 
Score  Grade  Description  
0 Clear  Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris  
1 Almost clear  Rare non-inflammatory  lesions present, with rare non -inflamed papules (papules must 
be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink -red) 
2 Mild  Some non-inflammatory  lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules only; no nodulo cystic lesions)  
3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory  lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 
1 nodulocystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there  
may or may not be up to 2 nodulo cystic lesions  
 
Safety Measurements:  
Safety evaluations will include the following:  
- The percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous reaction (erythema, scaling,  
hypo/hyper -pigmentation,  itching, burning, or stinging) graded at a level of 3 at any point in the 
study following the first application of study drug.  
- The percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous adverse event ( AE) irrespective of severity 
grade at any point in the study f ollowing the first application of study drug . 
- Changes from b aseline in all safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements as summarized 
using descriptive statistics by treatment group and study visit.  
- Subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of n ew and ongoing AEs.  
Cutaneous safety and tolerability will be evaluated by tabulations of AEs and Cutaneous Safety and 
Tolerability Evaluation scores (scaling, erythema, hypo/hyper -pigmentation, itching, burning, and 
stinging) to be assessed at each study  visit.  Itching, burning and stinging (c utaneous tolerability) will be 
reviewed with the subject at each study visit as an average over the period since the previous visit. 
Scaling , erythema , and hypo/hyper -pigmentation  (cutaneous s afety) will be assessed  by the evaluator at 
each visit. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject requiring a concomitant 
therapy, interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE.  
Statistical Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise stated . 
Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of 0.05 
or less. P -values for selected variables will be presented to assist the reviewer in evaluating the outcome of 
the study. Failure to achieve a statistically significant result at an alpha level of 0.05 does not imply a failed study.  
The absolute change in mean inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts f rom b aseline to Week 12 
will be analyzed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with factors of treatment group  and analysis 
center  and a covariate of their respective baseline lesion count. A non- parametric analysis may be used. 
Additionally, 4 pairwise tests will be conducted comparing the IDP-126 Gel to IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel and 
IDP-126 Gel to each of the dual component gels.  
The percent of subjects with treatment success, defined as at least a 2-grade improvement f rom b aseline in 
the EGSS and an EGSS equating to “clear” or “almost clear” , will be analyzed with a logistic regression 
test with factors of treatment group and analysis center and a covariate of baseline severity at Week  12. 
Four  pairwise tests will be conducted comparing the IDP-126 Gel to IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel and IDP-126

 Gel to each of the dual component gels.  
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation . Other 
methods, as well as the MCMC  imputation, will be specified in the statistical analysis pla n which will be 
finalized prior to data base lock.  
Populations Analyzed and Treatment Groups:  
Inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion co unts will be recorded for each s ubjec t at baseline and at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The ab solute and percent change from baseline in inflammatory and non-
inflammatory  lesions will be derived for each subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each s ubject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” 
with a s ubject considered a success if the EGSS at Week s 2, 4, 8, and 12 is at least 2 grades less than 
baseline and achieving “clear” or “almost c lear.”  
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted on all study subjects. The ITT population will consist 
of all randomized subjects who received study drug. 
The safety population will consist  of all randomized subjects who are presumed to have used the study 
drug at least once and who provide at least 1 post -baseline evaluation. A per -protocol (PP) analysis will 
also be conducted. Subjects will be eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation 
without notewort hy study protocol violations ( i.e., any s ubject or investigator activity that could have 
possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include subjects in the ITT population who do not meet any of 
the following criteria:  
• Failed any of t he inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Have taken any inte rfering concomitant medications.  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit, with the exception of a discontinuation from the study due to an AE 
related to study treatment or docu mented lack of treatment effect.  
• Missed more than 1 post baseline study visit prior t o Week 12  
• Have  not been compl iant with the dosing regimen ( i.e., subjects may not miss more than 5 
consecutive days of dosing and must take 80%- 120% of expected doses ). The number of expected 
doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of  their participation in the study.  
• Out of visit window at the Week 12  visit.  
Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protoc ol 
violations. Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics for the ITT, PP, and safety analysis sets.  
Efficacy Evaluation:  
Primary:  
Co-primary efficacy analyses of the absolute change in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory  lesions, 
from baseline, will be conducted on the ITT population. The pre -specified time point will be Week 12. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment gr oup for inflammatory and for non-inflammatory  
lesions as well as the absolute change in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory  lesions. All of the testing 
relating to the analysis of inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesions will use the methods introduced in 
Section 12 of the protocol . 
The co -primary analysis of the dichotomized EGSS (success being at least a 2 -grade improvement and 
achieving “clear” or “almost c lear”) for the ITT population will be based on the logistic regression  test 
with factors of treatment group and analysis center and a covariate of baseline severity . 
Secondary:  
Mean percent change in inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion counts from baseline, as well as 
proportion of subjects with at least a 2 -grade improvement in the EGSS from baseline, will be evaluated at

11 
 Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
Safety Evaluation:  
All subjects who receive medication and provide at least 1 post -baseline evaluation will constitute the 
safety population. Safety will be evaluated by tabulations of AEs, Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability Evaluations, vital signs/abbreviated physical examinations, and safety laboratory results.  
Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability  Evaluation scores (erythema, scaling, hypo/hyper -pigmentation, 
itching, burning, and stinging) will be presented with descriptive statistics at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 for each treatment group. Frequencies and percentages for each outcome category will be included in these statistics. Mean values will be presented graphically by week and treatment group.  
Vital sign measurements, an abbreviated physical examination, and safety laboratory results will be conducted on all subjects at s pecified visits. For pre-menses females and FOCBP, urine pregnancy  and 
serum pregnancy  testing will occur at specified visits. Changes from baseline in safety laboratory values 
and vital sign measurements will be summarized with descriptive statistics for each treatment group at all 
applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values to summarize 
laboratory test results collected at Baseline  and Week 12. Normal ranges established by the central 
laboratory will be used to determine the shifts. A listing of all out- of-range laboratory test results at any 
assessment time point will also be provided.  
Determination of clinical significance for all out -of-range laboratory values will be made by each 
investigator and inc luded in the listing. In addition, a listing of all clinically significant laboratory test 
results will be provided.  
All previous concomitant medications will be classified based on terminology from the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary. Previous therapies and concomitant medications data will be presented in 
the data listings.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Descriptions of AEs will incl ude the date of onset, the date 
the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study drug, the action taken regarding study drug  
usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and s everity. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term 
by using the AEs with the highest severity within each category.  
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and relationship to study drug. Each subject will 
be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the AEs with the greatest relationship within each category.

 5 Introduction  
Acne is a very common disorder of sebaceous follicles that is most prevalent among 
teenagers, usually triggered by the increase in androgen production occurring at puberty (Krakowski 2008). Although acne generally resolves by the age of 25, approximately 3% to 
8% of adults 25 to 44 years of age present with acne ( Goodman 2006, White 1998). The 
pathogenesis is complex and appears to involve 4 primary features: stimulation of sebum gland activity, bacterial proliferation (especially Propionibacterium acnes), abnormal follicular hyperkeratinization an d resultant obstruction of the sebaceous follicles, and the 
release of inflammatory mediators (Thiboutot 2009) . These changes in acne patients result in 
the formation of clinical inflammatory lesions including superficial pustules such as comedones (popularly know n as “blackheads” or “whiteheads”) and more deeply located 
papules, nodules, and cysts ( Krakowski 2008) . The areas most affected by the disease include 
the pilosebaceous follicles of the head and upper trunk, where the sebaceous glands are particularly active (Webster 2002). 
Given the complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to acne, for maximum efficacy,  consensus guidelines recommend the use of combination therapy consisting of 
medications with different, but complementary, mechanisms of action ( Thiboutot 2009) . In 
particular, the guidelines advocate the use of a retinoid and an antibiotic (eg, clindamycin phosphate) or antibacterial (eg,  benzoyl peroxide [ BPO ]) as first -line and maintenance 
therapy in patients with both inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesions ( Ghali 2009, 
Thiboutot 2009).  
Although antibiotics like clindamycin were among the first effective treatments for acne, 
recent acne management guidelines discourage the use of antibiotics as monotherapy due to the development of bacterial resistance (Nast 2012 , Thiboutot 2009). The guidelines also 
recom mend limiting both the frequency and duration of antibiotic use for acne, and to use 
antibiotics in conjunction with BPO to minimize the development of resistance at sites of application ( Thiboutot 2009). Topically applied BPO is keratolytic, comedolytic, and 
anti-inflammatory, and  has bactericidal activity against Propionibacterium acnes  (Gollnick 
2003, Harper 2010, Tanghetti 2009). To date, there is no evidence of P acnes  resistance to 
BPO (Harper 2010 ). Further, the combination of BPO with chemical structures that contain a 
tertiary amine within their structure, such as clindamycin, increases the generation of BPO radicals and thereby creates a r eal biologic synergism (Burkhart 2008) that contributes to 
their complementary effects on acne pathogenesis.  
Retinoids (eg, adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene) are anticomedogenic, anti -inflammatory, and 
inhibit microcomedone formation ( Ghali 2009, Zaenglein 2008). Topical, daily retinoid 
monotherapy is used to inhibit the formation of comedones and usually clear even severe comedonal acne within a few months ( Shalita 2001). Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a

 naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid -like properties. In the cell, adapalene can bind 
specifically to retinoic acid nuclear (and not cytosolic) receptors to exert its effects 
(Zaenglein 2008) . Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that 
adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes (Piskin 2007). Topical formul ations of adapalene have been used to treat acne in 
the United States (US) for more than 20 years. 
Retinoids have also been paired with antibiotic/BPO fixed-dose combination products 
(Bowman 2005, Del Rosso 2007, Kircik 2007, Tanghetti 2006) and, consistently across 
studies of these products, regimens that included a topical retinoid were more effective than regimens that did not ( Thiboutot 2009). Adapalene (0.1% gel and cream formulations) has a 
lower  irritation potential relative to other retinoids  (Dosik 2005a , Dosik 2005b) and is 
theref ore well suited for use in combination topical regimens, particularly those containing 
BPO, which is also potentially irritating (Del Rosso 2007).  
Thus, treatment with a combination of topical clindamycin phosphate, BPO, and adapalene can be expected to provide optimal overlapping benefits for maximal efficacy: each of these agents has some degree of anti -inflammatory activity; both the antibiotic an d BPO decrease 
P acnes  proliferation ( Weiss 2004) ; BPO is also keratolytic (Harper 2010) ; and adapalene 
additionally regulates keratinization (Zaenglein 2008 ).  
A fixed -dose combination treatment is optimal to enhance patient adherence due to 
simplified application re gimens (eg, once daily versus sequential morning/evening 
administration  of each active agent ) and also to preclude substance incompatibilities due to 
application errors (eg, oxidation by using incompatible single agents) ( Thielitz 2013) . Of 
note, when an adapalene 0.1% gel and a clindamycin 1.2%/BPO 5% fixed-dose combination gel were combined in equal amounts by weight, there was no resultant instability of any of the active components for up to 24 hours ( Bikowski 2006).  
The current study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IDP-126 Gel , a novel 
fixed -dose combination of clindamycin phosphate, BPO, and adapalene (1.2 %/3.1%/0.15%), 
relative to its vehicle and dual component combinations ( BPO /Adapalene, clindamycin/BPO  
and clindamycin/adapalene) for the treatment of acne vulgaris in subjects 9 years of age and 
older.

 6 Study Objectives and Purpose   
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once daily  
application of IDP-126 Gel  compared with each of its dual components ( IDP-126 Component 
A Gel , IDP -126 Component B Gel and IDP-126 Component C Gel) and vehicle ( IDP-126 
Vehicle Gel) in subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris.  
7 Investigational Plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel -group study 
designed to assess the safety , efficacy and tolerability of IDP-126 Gel in comparison with its 
gel components and vehicle gel. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at least  9 years 
of age or older , and have a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe acne vulgaris (a score of  
3 or 4 [moderate to severe] on the Evaluator’s Global Severity Scale [ EGSS ]), presenting 
with 30-100 inflammatory  facial lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), 35 -150 non-
inflammatory  facial lesions (open and closed comedones), and ≤ 2 facial nodules.  
Approximately 750 subjects will be enrolled into this study and randomized into 1 of 
5 treatment groups  in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio:  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Gel , once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Component A Gel, once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Component B Gel, once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP -126 Component C Gel, once daily application 
• 150 subjects  to receive IDP-126 Vehicle Gel , once daily application  
Subjects will be enrolled at approximately  35 independent study centers. The duration of 
treatment will be 12 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at Screening, Baseline , and at 
subsequent follow-up visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12). 
An interactive web based response system (IWRS) will be employed to facilitate 
randomization of study subjects . Treatment assignments and study drug kit numbers will be 
generated centrally by the IWR S. At each study center , subject numbers will be assigned 
consecutively at the S creening visit, starting with 001. 
The assigned study drug will be applied topically to the face once daily  at home, in the 
evening,  for 12 weeks  (up to the evening prior to the Week 12 visit), with the exception of 
study visit days (Baseline, Week 2, 4 and 8) where study drug will be appl ied (also by the 
subject) after the study visit is completed, at the investigational center . The initial application 
will be done at the investigational center  as per instruction from the study coordinator or 
Protocol V01- 126A -201, IDP -126           Valeant Research & Development

 designee. The subjects will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight in order to 
prevent sunburn. Use of sunscreens with at least a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 and 
protective clothing ( eg, a hat) is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Subjects 
will apply their daily treatments at home as explained by the study coordinator or designee at each study center. During post baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12), the subjects will 
be asked to return the ir used pumps of study drug and will be dispensed new pumps of study 
drug ( new pumps dispensed on Weeks 4 and 8 only ; Week 2 will have no new study drug 
dispensed; and Week 12 will be final visit) . During the study, each subject will only be 
permitted to use approved, non- medicated  cleans ers, moisturizers , and sunscreens . 
During the study, s ubjects will be asked to complete the  Acne -Specific Quality of Life 
questionna ire (Acne-QoL, Appendix 17.3). The Investigator assessments (EGSS, lesion 
counts) will be conducted independently of this  subject self -assessment . The EGSS should be 
completed prior to the lesion counts.  The Acne -QoL questionnaire will be completed at 
Baseline and Week 12 . Inferential statistical analyse s will not be performed on the 
questionnaire; the subjective responses will be compared between treatment groups for trends. Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination, along with vital sign measurements , will be 
performed at Baseline and Week 12 (end of study , final visit) for all subjects.  
Blood samples will be collected from subjects at Baseline and Week 12 for CBC/Diff and 
serum chemistry.  For all female subjects of childbearing potential (FOCBP) , urine 
pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, confirmed at prior to randomization at 
Baseline, and then repeated at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Serum pregnancy test will also be 
conducted at Baseline and Week 12. 
Subjects who terminate their study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 12 
assessments, as appropriate. Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatm ent 
period will not be replaced.

Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
26 • When a concomitant therapy likely to interfere with the results of the study is 
reported  or required by the subject (the investigat ors will report all such information 
on the source documents/e CRFs  and decide, in accordance with the Sponsor, whether 
the subject is to be withdrawn). 
• When a subject is lost to follow-up. The investigators will try twice to reach the subject by telephone, email and/or text message,  and will send a follow- up letter by 
certified mail before considering that the subject is lost to follow -up. These actions 
will be reported on the End of Study source documents and the final e CRF and a copy 
of the follow-up lett er will be maintained in the investigator’s file.  
All premature discontinuations and their associated reasons must be carefully documented by the 
investigator on source documents and the final eCRF, and, if need be, on the AE form. In any 
case, no subject who has been included and has a n assigned  study number can be replaced by 
another if the subject discontinues pr ematurely for whatever reason.  All data gathered on the 
subject prior to termination will be made available to the Sponsor. 
Reasons for study completion/discontinuation as listed on the f inal report form are defined as 
follows: 
Normal Study Completion  – Subject completes the study as planned in the protocol. 
Adverse Event  – Complete an AE form.  
Death – Complete a serious adverse event (SAE)  form.  
Subject Request  – Consent withdrawal, subject moved, schedule conflicts. 
Protocol Violation  – Contact the Sponsor or designee before making decision.

certified letter.  
Pregnancy  – Subject will discontinue study drug immediately, but will be followed to term. 
Complete a pregnancy form.  
Worsening Condition  – Subject requires alternate treatment for acne before the end of the 
study and the investigator determines it is not due to lack of efficacy.  
Lack of Efficacy  – Subject requires alternate treatment for acne after at least 2 weeks of 
study drug treatment and the risk of continuing the subject in the study outweighs the benefit 
as determined by the investigator.  
Withdrawal by Parent/Guardian – An indication that the study participant has been 
removed from the study by the parent or legal guardian; includes consent withdrawal, subject moves, schedule conflicts, etc.  
Study Terminated by Sponsor – An indication that a clinical study was stopped by its 
Sponsor.

27 Subjects who terminate study drug early will be asked to complete all Week 12 assessments and 
procedures prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for acne (if p ossible). Subjects 
who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced. 
All subjects are free to withdraw from participating in this study at any time and for whatever 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. No constraints will be placed on ordinary subject management, and subjects, when appropriate, will be placed on other conventional 
therapy upon request or whenever clinically necessary as determined by their physician. 
9 Treatment  Plan  
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subj ects to Treatment Groups  
This is a double-blind study in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to the 
investigator/evaluator and all subjects, as well as all individuals closely associated with the study.  
Eligible s ubjects will be randomized to 1 of the 5 study drug groups in a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 
(IDP-126 Gel  : IDP-126 Component A Gel : IDP-126 Component B Gel : IDP-126 Component 
C Gel : IDP-126 Vehicle Gel).  
The study center will assign e ach screened subject a unique 6 -digit study subject number. The 
number will consist of the 3 -digit study center number (pre-assigned by S pons or/designee) and 
the 3 -digit chronological screening number, starting with 001 (eg, 101001, 101002). The IWRS 
will assign the study drug kit to  subjects based on a randomization code ; the kit will be dispen sed 
to the subjects at Baseline  and Weeks 4 and 8 by the study center staff . A study drug log will 
document the inventory, dispensing , and collecting  of study drug at each study center.  
9.2 Randomization and Blinding  
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly to the subjects entering the study within each study center . Study drug supplies will be distr ibuted to the study center s to maintain the 
randomization ratio within each study center .  
As a double-blind study, the investigators /evaluators , the study center  staff, the Sponsor, and the 
clinical monitors will not be aware of the treatment assigned to the individual study subjects. 
Delegated staff members at each study center  will dispense the study drugs and will collect all 
used and unused study drug pumps as scheduled.  
9.3 Unblinding  
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are verified, entered into the 
database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and entered into the 
database; and the database is locked. 
Protocol V01- 126A -201, IDP -126           Valeant Research & Development  
 
 
Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
28 In the case of a medical emergency, the investigator can break the blind for the subject involved, 
preferably by first discussing the situation with the medical monitor and the Sponsor (or 
designee) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contacted with unblinding 
information by a Sponsor representative or via IWRS. The i nvestigator will record the code 
break in the subject’s source documents. 
9.4 Prior and Prohibited Concomitant Medication or Therapy  
Any concomitant medication or therapy stopped for washout as indicated below is to be 
recorded. As noted in the exclusion criteria, there are mandatory washout periods and restrictions during the study for the following topical treatments  or physical treatments  on the face that have 
a known beneficial ef fect for acne vulgaris:  
Topical astringents and abrasives (including 
comedone removal strips) on the face  1 week  
Non-allowed moisturizers or sunscreens on the face  1 week  
Antibiotics on the fac e 2 weeks  
Other topical anti -acne drugs on the face  2 weeks  
Soaps containing antimicrobials on the face  2 weeks  
Anti-inflammatory agents and corticosteroids on 
the fac e 4 weeks  
Retinoids, including retinol on the face  4 weeks  
Facial procedures, including chemical peel, 
microdermabrasion, light (PDT, LED) and l aser 
therapy, and acne surgery  4 weeks  
 
If the subject requires topical treatment for acne on areas other than the face,  the investigator 
may prescribe a product that does not contain adapalene, clindamycin phosphate,  or BPO. Any 
such medications must be noted in source documents and the eCRF.  
In addition, there is a mandatory washout period and restriction on use during the study for the 
following systemic drugs: 
Corticosteroids (including intramuscular injections ; 
inhaled corticosteroids are allowed)  4 weeks  
Antibiotics  4 weeks  
Other systemic acne treatments  4 weeks  
Systemic retinoids  6 months  
 Subjects using concomitant therapies during the course of the study that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results (including, but not limited to , those listed above) should not be 
withdrawn, but the use of the concomitant product should be discontinued. With the exception of the study drug and the products/ treatments listed  above, no other topical and/or physical  
treatment for acne will be permitted.

Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
29 Information on concomitant medications or therapies will be recorded in the Prior and 
Concomitant Medication or Therapy source document and eCRF . Any therapy used by the 
subject will be considered concomitant therapy (e.g., facial procedures, surgical procedures, 
investigations, and operations), and any medication, both over-the- counter (OTC) or 
prescription, used by the subject will be considered concomitant medication  (eg,  aspirin, 
Tylenol, birth control pills, vitamins). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant 
medication / therapy dosing constant during the study. Any change to concomitant medication / 
therapy should be noted on the Concomitant T herapy or Medication source document and e CRF.  
All cleansers , moisturizers , sunscreens and other topical products used on the treatment area that 
are not medicated  will be captured on the Prior and Concomitant Therapy source document and 
eCRF. Subjects must use investigator-approved, non- medicated  cleansers , moistur izers , and 
sunscreens . 
Subjects should avoid excessive ultraviolet ( UV) exposure by such activities as sun bathing or 
tanning booths. Use of  sunscreens with at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during the day 
(eg, a  hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided.  
9.5 Treatment Compliance  
Each subject will be instructed on the importance of returning his or her study drug at each applicable study visit. If a subject does not return his or her study drug at a particular study visit, he or she will be instructed to return it as soon as possible. The subjects will bring the pump(s) dispensed at each specified study visit to the next subsequent study visit. Each pump will be 
weighed on a calibrated scale (with the cap on, and to the ne arest tenth  of a gram ) by a study 
coordinator or designee prior to dispensing and after collecting . The subject will also be asked to 
complete a diary calendar and will be questioned regarding study drug use since the previous 
visit in order to judge the subject’s compliance with applying the study drug. A subject who 
deviates meaningfully  from the prescribed application amount will be counseled. Any missed 
applications of study drug will be noted by the subject on the diary, which will be collected and placed in the appropriate source document. Missed applications will be documented in the e CRF.   
9.6 Protocol Deviations and Violations 
The investigators must read the protocol thoroughly and must follow the instructions exactly. 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures an d/or processes approved by the Sponsor and the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  and agreed to by the investigator. Deviations usually 
have an impact on individual subjects  or a small group of subjects  and do not involve 
inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria. 
A protocol violation occurs when there is non- adherence to the protocol that results in a 
substantial, additional risk to the subject, when the subject or investigator has failed to adhere to 
Protocol V01- 126A -201, IDP -126           Valeant Research & Development  
 
 
Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
30 critical  protocol requirements ( eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the subjec t was enrolled 
without prior Sponsor approval, or when there is non-adherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH 
GCP  guid eline s. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the subject’s  source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation or protocol change to eliminate an immediate hazard to a study subject  without prior IRB/IEC 
approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) to prevent future occurrences,  should be 
submitted to the IRB/IEC f or review and approval, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the 
regulatory authorities, if required. 
10 Study D rug Materials and Management 
The study drug will be dispensed by an appropriately qualified member of the study staff

10.1.1 Packaging and Labeling 
IDP-126 Gel, IDP-126 Component A Gel, IDP-126 Component B Gel, IDP-126 Component C 
Gel and IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel will be supplied in subject kits. Instructions will be provided to the 
designated study drug technician at each study center . When a subject is rand omized into the 
study, the IWRS- specified  kit number will be assigned to be used for that randomized subject. 
Each subject kit will contain one pump, containing 50 g of study material. One pump will be 
dispensed to the subject at each dispensing visit: Baseline, Week 4 , and Week 8. Each pump will 
be weighed on a calibrated scale, prior to dispensing (with the cap on, and to the nearest tenth of 
a gram ). After weighing the pump and prior to first use of the study drug pump, the pump will 
need to be actuated approximately  10 times until the gel begins to dispense.  The pump is 
actuated by depressing the pump head using one or two fingers. This is to remove the air from 
the p ump prior to product dispensing and is known as “priming the pump”. Priming the pump 
must occur at each dispensing visit (or if/when a replacement pump is issued).  
The s ubject will bring the pump to the next study visit (Week 2) , where it will be collected and  
weighed  (with the cap on, and to the nearest tenth of a gram ) – a new pump will not be dispensed 
at this visit, and the original pump will be returned to the subject. The subject will then bring the 
same pump to the subsequent study visit (Week 4), where it will be collected and weighed (with 
the cap on) to the nearest 0.1 gram ; one new pump will be dispensed again by the IWRS at Week 
4, weighed (with the cap on) to the nearest 0.1 gram and provided to the subject . The same will

Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
32 occur at the Week 8 visit . If the subject loses a pump (lost or damaged pump), another kit will be 
dispensed via IWRS . All used and unused study drug pumps will be collected and weighed at the 
final study visit (Week 12).  All dispensing and collecting of study drug  pumps will be 
documented on the study drug accountability log.  
Each subject kit (and pump) label  will have a double panel. Labels will contain , at a minimum,  
the following information: 
• Protocol Number 
• Kit Number  
• Contents 
• Space fo r entry of the subject initials  and subject number 
• Space for entry of date dispensed  
• The sponsor name, Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences , a division of Valeant 
Pharmaceuticals N A, LLC  
• The quantity of product (50 g) 
• A statement reading, “For external use only; a void contact with eyes and lips” 
• A statement reading,   “Store  at 2-8 °C (36-46 °F) prior to dispensing. Once 
dispensed, the product should be stored at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) and 
assigned a 5-week use by date. Do not freeze. ” 
• A statement reading, “Caution: New Drug Limited by Federal Law to Investigational 
Use”  
10.1.2 Storage, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
At the investigational center, the study drug should be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F), and should not be frozen . Once opened  and dispensed to the subject, the study drug should be stored 
at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F). All empty, partially used and unused study drug will be 
returned  to the Sponsor or designee upon study completion of the study for documented disposal. 
10.1.3 Adminis tration  
The study drug  will be applied topically to the face once daily  at home in the evening , at least 30 
minutes before bedtime , for a period of 12 weeks, with the exception of study visit days 
(Baseline, Week  2, 4, and 8) where study drug will be applied by the subject after the study visit 
is completed at the investigational center . The study drug will be applied as a thin coating that is 
gently rubbed into the skin. Study drug use will be limited to the face.  
The investigator and/or trained study center  staff member will instruct the subject on the proper 
study drug application procedure during  the Baseline visit (see Appendix 17.1). All subjects will 
be instructed to apply the study drug at approximately the same time every day for 12 weeks , 
after cleansing  with an investigator -approved cleanser. On study visit days (Baseline, Weeks 2, 
Protocol V01- 126A -201, IDP -126           Valeant Research & Development  
 
 
Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
33 4, and 8) subjects should be instructed to wait until the end of their study visit to apply study 
medication at the investigational site (note, this will affect evening application times on study visit days, which is acceptable. Subjects should not apply another dose of study drug in the evening on the study visit days). No time interval between dosing and meals or any other activity is specified. Study center  personnel oversight of a subject’s  on-site application of study drug is 
required at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8, to ensure training /reinforcement  of proper application 
technique.  
During daily application, s ubjects will be instructed to gently wash their face s with a n 
investigator-approved, non- medicated  cleanser and warm (not hot) water. After washing, the 
subjects will be asked to thoroughly rinse and gently pat their faces dry. The subjects should use 
the pump to dispense one pea size amount of the study drug onto the fingertip.  The study drug 
gel should be dotted onto 6 areas  of the face: the chin, left cheek, right cheek, nose, left forehead, 
and right forehead. After distributing the gel in this manner, the subject should gently rub the gel 
into the skin. This amount of drug should be sufficient to cover the entire face excluding the mouth, eyes, inside the nose, and lips. It is important for the subject to treat their entire face (excluding the mouth, eyes and lips) and they should be instructed NOT to treat only specific lesions. The subjects  should gently smooth the study drug over the face evenly. The study drug 
should become invisible almost immediately following application with gentle rubbing. If this does not happen, the investigator should instruct the subject on the use of a smaller dosage. The subject should wash his/her hands after applying the study drug to the face.  Subjects should also 
be instructed to place the cap back onto the pump after every use. 
At each study visit, study staff will review the subject instructions for application of study drug 
to ensure proper use and compliance with application. The subjects will be instructed to continue 
using the same investigator -approved, non- medicated  facial cleanser , moisturizer , and sunscreen, 
and not to change products during the study. At each visit, subjects are to be asked if they have changed their cleansing routine. Facial makeup may be applied according to the subject’s normal daily routine; however, subjects should be instructed not to wear makeup during study visits as it 
may interfere with the evaluator’s assessments. Subjects must also agree to use non -
comedogenic makeup during the study if they use makeup. No other products should be used on 
the face.  Subjects should be instructed to minimize sun exposure and to use investigator-
approved, non- medicated  sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and to wear protective clothing during 
the day ( eg, a hat)  if exposure cannot be avoided.  
Subjects should be instructed to store the study drug at room temperature.  If a subject loses or 
misplaces the pump cap at any point during the study, the subject should contact the study center  
to return the exposed pump and receive a replace ment  pump.  
10.2 Study Drug Accountability  
Upon receipt of the study drug, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the designated study center  staff member will conduct a complete inventory of the study drugs and assume 
Protocol V01- 126A -201, IDP -126           Valeant Research & Development  
 
 
Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
34 responsibility for their appropriate storage and dispensing. In accordance with federal 
regulations, the investigators must agree to keep all study drugs  in a secure location with 
restricted access. The investigator will keep a record of the inventory, dispensing, and collecting 
of all study drugs . This record will be made available to the Sponsor’s monitor for the purpose of 
accounting for all study drugs . Any significant discrepancy and/or deficiency must be recorded 
with an explanation. 
All supplies sent to the investigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Pumps will be weighed on a calibrated scale (with the cap on, and to the 
nearest tenth  of a gram ) before dispensing to and upon return by the subjects, and weights will be 
recorded on the pharmacy log and appropriate eCRF. All used and unused supplies will be 
returned to Sponsor/designee for destruction at the conclusion of the study. If a subject 
loses/misplaces a cap, the pump should still be weighed using a cap from another pump/kit.  
11 Study Procedures and Evaluations  
All subject information and data obtained during the study visits will be recorded in the source documents, applicable study logs, and e CRFs . 
Evaluators must have appropriate, documented experience and training, or obtain approval from the S ponsor based on experience (or through additional training organized by the S ponsor). 
At each study visit, every attempt should be made to ensure that the same investigator/evaluator assesses the same subject.

11.2 Evaluation of Efficacy 
The determination of efficacy will be based on evaluator -blinded assessments of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Evaluators must be a board- certified/board -eligible dermatologist or 
have appropriate documented experience and training, and be present for formal study training 
and validation at the Investigator Meeting (and/or Site Initiation Visit), or obtain a waiver from 
the Sponsor based on experience (or through additional training organized by the Sponsor).  
The EGSS assessments and lesion counts will be performed at each study visit. The EGSS 
assessments will be collected before  the lesion counts. All s ubject assessments will be performed 
by a trained and validated evaluator. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator 
assess the same s ubject at each visit. If this is not possible, the same evaluator should assess the 
subject at both the Baseline and Week 12 visits.  
11.2.1 Evaluator’s Global Severity Score 
The EGSS will be a static assessment that is independent of the baseline score. The investigator 
will make the asses sment without referring to the baseline value. Every eff ort should be made for 
the same evaluator to perform each study assessment for the same study subject, for consistency 
in evaluations.  
Subjects are eligible if they have acne vulgaris with a global severity of 3 (moderate) or 
4 (severe) on the EGSS at the Baseline visit. The following scores will be used to describe the 
sever ity grade and subsequent score: 
Table 4. Evaluator’s Global Severity Score 
Score  Grade  Description  
0 Clear  Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris  
1 Almost 
Clear  Rare non-inflammatory  lesions present, with rare non inflamed  papules (papules must be 
resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink- red) 
2 Mild  Some non-inflammatory  lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules 
only; no nodulocystic lesions)  
3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory  lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: several 
to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 1 nodulocystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there  may or

41 may not be up to 2 nodulocystic lesions  
 
11.2.2 Lesion Counts  
The facial area lesion counts will be taken from the subject’s face (including the nose). The 
lesion count groups will be inflammatory and non- inflammatory. Facial inflammatory lesions 
(pustules, papules, and nodules) will be counted as follows: pustules and papules will be counted and recorded together, not separately; nodular lesions will be counted and recorded separately. Non-inflammatory  lesions (open and closed comedones) will be counted and recorded together. 
The lesion  counts will be collected at each visit and/or upon discontinuation.  The following are 
definitions of each lesion type counted: 
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
 
Papule  – a solid, elevated lesion less than 5 mm 
Pustule – an elevated lesion containing pus less than 5 mm 
Nodule – palpable subcutaneous lesion greater than 5 mm; has depth, not necessarily elevated  
 Non-inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
 Open comedones  (blackhead) – plugged hair follicle w ith dilated/open orifice; black in color  
Closed comedones  (whitehead) – plugged hair follicle: small opening at skin surface 
11.2.3 Other Assessments  
Photography 
At select study center s, photographs of the face will be taken at Baseline and at Weeks 4, 8 , and 
12. Only subjects who provide written photographic consent for facial photographs will be 
included in photography. 
11.3 Evaluation of Safety  
Safety assessments will be conducted at baseline and each subsequent study visit.  
11.3.1 Cutaneous Safety Evaluations 
Cutaneous safety  will b e evaluated through an assessment, conducted at the time of the study 
visit, o f selected local signs (i.e., si gns present at the study drug application site ) that include the 
following : scaling, erythema, hypo pigmentation , and hyper pigmentation . The evaluator will 
assess all cutaneous safety signs.  
Cutaneous safety  signs that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy, interruption 
of treatment, or discontinuation from the study, will be reported as an AE.  
Scaling: 
0 – None  No scaling  
1 – Mild   Barely perceptible, fine scales present on limited areas  of the face

11.3.2 Tolerability Evaluations 
Tolerability will be evaluated through an assessment, at the time of the study visit, of selected 
local symptoms ( i.e., symptoms present at the study drug application site) that include itching , 
burning, and stinging . The subject will self -assess all tolerability symptoms; the assessment will 
be based on an average over the period since the previous study visit. 
Tolerability symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy, interruption of 
treatment, or discontinuation from the study, will be reported as an AE. 
Itching: 
0 – None   No itching  1-   Mild   Slight itching, not really bothersome

43 3 – Severe  Stinging sensation that causes definite discomfort and may interrupt daily 
activities and/or sleep  
11.3.3 Medical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination 
A med ical history will be taken at Screening , and confirmed and revised if needed, at Baseline. 
Medical histories having resolved 2 or more years before Baseline need not be collected unless 
considered relevant by the investigator.  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of weight and vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and oral temperature) wil l be performed at Screening , 
Baseline and Week 12 ( end of treatment/study ); height will also be measured , but only at the 
Screening visit. Any abnormal physical exam ination  findings will be recorded. 
11.3.4 Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory analyses ( CBC/Diff and serum chemistry ) will be conducted on blood 
samples collected from subjects at Baseline and Week 12. All results will be reported, including results that are abnormal. Clinically significant results, in the opinion of the investigator, should be reported as AEs. If an AE should require laboratory testing, the results of the test must be obtained by the study center  and filed in the subject’s documentation.  
For pre- menses females and FOCBP , a serum pregnancy test will be conducted at Baseline and 
Week 12.  
11.3.5 Pregnancy Tests  
All females who are pre- menses and FOCBP  will undergo serum pregnancy testing at the 
Baseline and W eek 12  study visits, and urine pregnancy testing at Screening, prior to 
randomization at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. The urine pregnancy tests will be 
supplied by the CRO/designee. 
11.4 Adverse Events  
11.4.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessar ily have a causal relationship with 
the study drug. AEs include any unfavorable and unintended illness, sign, symptom, clinically 
significant laboratory test abnormality, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless 
of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. AEs  include any illness, sign, symptom, 
or out-of-range and clinically significant laboratory finding that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study. The collection of nonserious AEs and SAEs  will begin following the subject's completion of the consent process to 
participate in the study.

Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
44 11.4.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the 
study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by the investigator or reported by the subject at each study visit. Each AE which appears to be independent of any prior event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered study drug-related. All AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by the study center  personnel, or reported 
spontaneously by the subject, will be recorded. Any AEs deemed related to treatment reported or observed at the final study/treatment visit will be followed until stabilization or resolution (or up to 30 days after final study visit). 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing 
AEs. Cutaneous safety and tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a 
concomitant therapy , interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported 
as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate e CRF:  
• Event description (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset date and end date 
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Corrective treatment, if give n 
• Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded. 
Vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically significant (for 
example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or fulfilling a seriousness criterion). 
11.4.3 Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or nonserious. An SAE  is defined as any untoward 
medical occurrence that , at any dose:  
• results in death . 
• is immediate ly life threatening, (the term “life thr eatening” in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the

were more severe) . 
• requires i n patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective surgery for a baseline condition is not considered an AE). 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed outcomes ; examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization . 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE and must be reported per Reporting of SAEs under Section 11.4.6. 
11.4.4 Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by the maximum severity of the AE. The 
categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs:  
• Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no  medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
• Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required . 
• Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospitalization or prolongation of current 
hospitalization possible; may be incapacitating or life threatening . 
11.4.5 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as e ither 
“Related” or “Not Related .” The following should be taken into account when assessing AE/SAE 
causality:  
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the 
study drug. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship  between the drug and the AE. 
• Not Related: There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to 
the study drug. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal

Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
46 relationship to  the study drug and/or a more likely or certai n alternative etiology 
exists.  
11.4.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours of study center  notif ication to comply with regulatory requirements.  
All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to study drug, must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO contact within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. 
All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile  or email  transmission and must be submitted 
on a written SAE report form signed by the investigator within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
The contact(s)  for reporting an SAE are: 
 
 
 
Inves
tigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully docum ent the event 
before notifying medical monitor and Sponsor of an SAE. If only limited information is initiall y 
available, follow-up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospital 
records and autopsy reports should be provided to the Sponsor as soon as they are available. 
Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to study drug ) 
that occurs within 30 days after stopping the study drug, the SAE must be reported in accordance 
with procedures specified in this protocol. 
All deaths of subjects, regardless of cause, and which are known to the Investigator will be 
reported on the appropriate eCRF for up to 30 days after the administration of study drug, regardless of the Investigator's opinion regarding drug relationship. Documentation of the subject’s cause of death and a copy of the autopsy or hospital report will also be provided. The Medical Monitor and CRO contact  must be notified within 24 hours of knowledge of the event 
by telephone (and/or facsimile/email) of all subject deaths. Written follow -up must be received 
by the medical monitor and the IRB/IEC  within five ( 5) calendar days of initial notification.

Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
47 The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, notably 
he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, and 
that additional investigations may be requested by the Sponsor. When a SAE persist s at the end 
of the study, the investigator will conduct follow-up conta cts with the subject until the 
investigator/Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized. If at any time 
after 30 days after administration of study drug, the investigator becomes aware of an SAE which he/she feels is related to study drug or procedure, this must also be reported immediately (within 24 hours of knowledge of occurrence) by telephone and confirmed facsi mile 
transmission/email to the medical monitor and Sponsor and/or Sponsor designee. 
11.4.7 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports  
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not reported 
in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if it is of greater frequency, specificity , or severity  than what is reported in the clinical safety  section of the Investigator 
Brochure . 
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document (Investigator Brochure) and are related (i.e.,  the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study 
drug. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory reporting agency(ies). The Sponsor will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs 
and all p articipating study center s in writing for submission by the investigator to the IRB/IEC. 
This notification will be in the form of a safety u pdate to the Investigator Brochure ( i.e., a “15 -
day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information. 
11.4.8 Pregnancy  
All pre-menses females and FOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the 
course of the study, in a manner such that risk of contraceptive failure is minimized. Abstinence 
is allowed as a birth control method. 
Before enrolling a pre-menses female or FOCBP  in this clinical study , the investigator must 
review the following information about study participation: 
• Informed consent requirements 
• Contraceptives in current use 
Protocol V01- 126A -201, IDP -126           Valeant Research & Development  
 
 
Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
48 Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or 
designee and the subject must sign the informed consent /assent  before study enrollment. 
During the study, all pre-menses f emales and FOCBP  should be instructed to contact the 
investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual period). 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study enrollment, 
the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receivin g study drug, the study drug must 
immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report F orm will be submitted to the sponsor, 
initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery. If any SAEs are associated with 
the pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, an SAE form must be filled out in addition to the Pregnancy Report Form and submitted as per section  11.4.6.  
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO 
contact within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed 
pregnancies are to be reported on a pregnancy form using the same reporting procedure for an 
SAE under Section 11.4.6.  
12 Statistics  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise 
stated. Statistical significance will be based on 2-tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in 
p-values of 0.05 or less . 
A statistical analysis plan, describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
All efficacy assessments will be conducted using both the intent- to-treat (ITT) (primary) and 
per-protocol (PP)  (supportive) analysis sets. All safety assessments will be conducted using the 
safety analysis set.  
12.1 Assessment of Efficacy  
Inflammatory lesions and non-inflammatory  lesions will be recorded for each subject at Baseline 
and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from baseline of inflammatory 
lesions and non- inflammatory  lesions will be derived for each subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

Version 3.0, 22 August 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
49 The EGSS will be recorded for each subject throughout the study. T reatment success will be 
defined as at least a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline in the EGSS assessment, and an EGSS 
equating to “clear” or “almost clear.”  
12.1.1 Primary Efficacy  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are intended to compare the numerical superiority of once 
daily  application of IDP-126 Gel with IDP-126 Vehicle Gel  and each of the dual gel 
components. Specifically, the co -primary efficacy endpoints include: 
• Absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline to Week 12, as 
summarized using descriptive and inferential statistics  
• Absolute change in non- inflammatory  lesion count from baseline to Week 12, as 
summarized using descriptive and inferential statistics  
• Proportion of subjects who have a least a 2 -grade reduction a t Week 12 from baseline 
in the EGSS  and are “c lear” or “almost c lear”, as summarized using descriptive and 
inferential statistics  
12.1.2 Secondary Efficacy  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are intended to compare the numerical superiority of once 
daily  applicatio n of IDP-126 Gel with IDP-126 Vehicle Gel and each of the dual gel 
components. Specifically, the secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
• Absolute change in inflammatory and non- inflammatory  lesion counts from baseline 
at Weeks 2, 4, and 8, as summarized us ing descriptive statistics  
• Proportion of subjects who achieve at least a 2- grade reduction from baseline and are 
“clear” or “almost c lear” at Week 2, 4, and 8 in the EGSS , as summarized using 
descriptive statistics  
• Mean percent change in inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion counts from 
baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, as summarize d using descriptive statistics  
12.1.3 Test of Superiority for Lesion Count Variables  Evaluator's Global Severity Score 
P-values for selected  variables will be presented to assist the reviewer in evaluating the outcome 
of the study. Failure to achieve a statistically significant result at an alpha level of 0.05 does not imply a failed study.  
The absolute change in mean inflammatory and non-inf lammatory  lesion counts from Baseline to 
Week 12 will be analyzed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with factors of treatment group and analysis center  and a covariate of their respective baseline lesion count. Additionally, 
4 pairwise tests will be conducted comparing the IDP-126 Gel to IDP-126 Vehicle Gel and IDP-
126 Gel to each of the component gels  (A, B, and C) . 
A skewness test, based on the methods presented by Zar (1984) will be applied to the residuals 
resulting from an ANCOVA. A 2-sided p- value for the skewness test significant at 0.01 will

50 imply the use of the nonparametric method. If a parametric analysis is indicated, the results of 
the parametric analysis will be considered the primary analysis. Should a nonparametric analysis be indicated , the absolute of percent changes in inflammatory and non- inflammatory  lesions will 
be rank transformed prior to submitting them to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank transformed analyses then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the nonrank transformed analyses will also be presented.  
The percent of subjects with treatment success, defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from 
Baseline in the EGSS and an EGSS equating to “clear” or “almost clear” will be analyzed with  a 
logistic regression test with factors of treatment group and analysis center and a covariate of 
baseline severity at Week12. Four pairwise tests will be conducted comparing the IDP-126 Gel 
to IDP-126 Vehicle Gel and IDP-126 Gel to each of the component gels (A, B, and C).  
12.1.4 Statistical Hypothesis Testing and Control of Multiplicity  
Not Applicable. 
12.1.5 Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the following parameters by treatment group  for both 
the ITT and PP analysis sets : 
• Frequency and percent distributions of the EGSS  at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 
12. 
• Frequency and percent distributions of the dichotomized EGSS  at Baseline and 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum will be used to summarize inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion 
counts at B aseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be used to summarize the absolute and percent change in 
inflammatory and non-inflammatory  lesion counts at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
12.1.6 Missing Efficacy Data Imputations 
Lesion Count Variable Missing Data Imputation 
Missing 12 -week data will be estimated by multiple imputation and subsequently analyzed. 
Missing lesion count data will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. The pattern of missing observations in each 
treatment group will not influence the missing value estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group. 
Multiple imputation and subsequent analys is will involve 4 distinct phases with these principal 
tasks:

51 1. Calculate the number of missing values to be e stimated by MCMC (nmiss) for 12 -week 
value.  
2. Create a data set of subjects, one for each treatment group, with observed values and 
those needing est imation by MCMC.  The missing lesion count values in each data set 
will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets.  The resulting data sets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set for each imputation. 
Syntax:

where trtpn=(1, 2 , 3, 4, 5); 
mcmc chain=multiple; var baseline week2 week4 week8 week12; 
run; 
3. For each complete data set, the absolute change in lesion counts for baseline minus the 
12-week value will be computed. Each complete data set will be analyzed as specified for 
the particular analysis.  
4. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC MIANALYZE.  
A total of 410 random seeds will be needed to impute inflammatory lesion counts and non-
inflammatory lesion counts for the five treatment groups. Those 410 random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: 
• Inflammatory Lesion Counts; IDP -126 Gel: Seed= 1754456209 
• Inflammatory Lesion Counts; IDP -126 Component A Gel: Seed= 122264983

• Non-Inflammatory Lesion Counts; IDP -126 Vehicle  Gel: Seed= 970145727  
EGSS Missing Data Imputation 
A similar procedure will be used for the analyses based on proportion of EGSS successes wherein the ANCOVA analysis is replaced with a logistic regression analysis.  Specifically, missing 12 week EGSS values from which the dichotomized EGSS is derived will be estimated

52 by (MCMC). The pattern of missing observations in each treatment group will not  influence the 
missing value estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently 
for each treatment group. 
The missing 12 week EGSS values will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis will involve 4 principal tasks: 
1. Calculate the number of missing values to be estimated by MCMC (nmiss) for 12 -week 
value.  
2. Create a data set, one for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estimation by MCMC.  The missing EGSS values in each data set will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to genera te ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets. The 
resulting data sets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set by imputation.  
Syntax:

  where trtpn=(1, 2 , 3, 4, 5); 
  mcmc chain=multiple; 
  var baseline week2 week4 week8 week12; 
run; 
3. For each complete data set, the dichotomous success rate (clear or almost clear with a 2 -
point change from baseline) will be computed. The 12- week estimated global values will 
be rounded to the near est integer value prior to evaluating the success rate. Each 
complete data set will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment 
group and analysis center. 
4. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference usin g SAS 
PROC MIANALYZE.  
A total of 5  random seeds will be needed to impute EGSS for the five treatment groups. Those 5 
random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: 
• EGSS; IDP -126 Gel: Seed= 1648890376 
• EGSS; IDP -126 Component A Gel: Seed= 643914697

Dictionary for Regulatory A ctivities  terminology. Descriptions of AEs will include the date of 
onset, the date the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study drug , the action 
taken regarding study drug usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are those events with an onset on or after the date 
of the first study drug application. All reported TEAEs will be summarized by the number of 
subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity , seriousness, and 
relationship to study drug.  
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and severity. Each subject will be 
counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the AEs with the 
highest severity within each category . 
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and relationship to study drug . Each 
subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the AEs with the greatest relationship within each category.  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing the 
verbatim term given by the investigator, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, 
severity, action taken, and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial dose of the randomized study drug . 
Serious adverse events  will be tabulated by subject within treatment groups.  
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of  subjects who 
experienced SAEs will also be provided. 
12.2.2 Safety Laboratory Tests

55 12.8 Additional Statistical Considerations  
12.8.1 Analysis Sets  
Approximately 750 subjects at least  9 years of age and older with moderate or severe acne ( a 
score of 3 or 4 [mode rate to severe] using the EGSS ) will be enrolled and randomized in the 
study. With a1:1:1:1:1  randomization ratio, it is anticipated that: 
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Gel , once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Component A Gel, once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Component B Gel, once daily  application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP -126 Component C Gel, once daily application  
• 150 subjects to receive IDP-126 Vehicle Gel , once daily application  
The ITT analysis set  will consist of all randomized subjects who received study drug . The safety 
analysis set  will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are presumed to have used the 
study drug at least once and who provide at least 1 post baseline evaluation. 
An ITT analysis will be conducted on all study subjects. A PP analysis will also be conducted. 
Subjects will be eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without 
noteworthy study protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have 
possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the study drug or the precise evaluation of study drug efficacy). The PP analysis set  will include subjects in the safety analysis set  who 
do not meet any of the following c riteria:  
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications . 
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit, with the exception of a discontinuation from the study 
due to an AE  related to study treatment or docu mented lack  of treatment effect . 
• Missed more than 1 post baseline study visit prior to Week 12. 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., s ubjects may not miss more 
than 5 consecutive days of dosing and must take 80%-120% of expected doses; t he 
number of expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of 
their participation in the study) . 
• Out of visit window at the 12-week visit. 
Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the study that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
The safety population will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are presumed to have 
used the study medication at least once and who provide at least one post- baseline safety 
evaluation.

56 12.8.2 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this study is based on clinical considerations only. No formal sample size 
calculation was performed. A total of approximately 750 randomized subjects are planned for 
this study, including 150 subjects each in the IDP-126 Gel , IDP-126 Component A Gel, IDP-126 
Component B Gel, IDP-126 Component C Gel, and in the IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel groups. The 
numbers of subjects in each study drug group are considered adequate to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IDP-126 Gel  in the treatment of acne vulgaris. 
12.8.3 Handling of Missing Data 
Missing 12 week data will be estimated by MCMC multiple imputation conducted independently for each treatment group. The details of this method as well as other methods will be specified in the statistical analysis plan, which will be finalized prior to database lock. (see Section 12.1.6).  
12.8.4 Multicenter Issues  
The study will be conducted at multiple study center s in North America with the intention of 
pooling the results for analysis. Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each investigational site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner such that a minimum of 5 subjects will be enrolled in each treatment arm for any investigator. In the event  that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm for an investigator, then this investigator's 
data will be combined to achieve the desired sample size minimum per arm. The combining of investigator's data will be accomplished by taking the investigator  with the smallest enrollment 
and combining it with the investigator with the largest. If there is a further need to combine data, then the data of the investigator with the second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrollment, and so on. This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a minimum of 5 subjects per active treatment arm. The process of combining investigator data that have insufficient subjects per treatment arm will result in redefining the groups of investigators for the purposes of statistical analyses. These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses based on ANCOVA and stratified logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment effect within the analysis centers, the magnitude of the 
investigational site effect will be investigated to determine if the site -to-site variability is such 
that it could mask the analysis center effects. Change from baseline in inflammator y lesions and 
non-inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an ANCOVA (unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, investigational site, and treatment by investigational site interaction and the respective baseline lesion count variable as a covariate.  For the purpose of testing consistency of 
treatment response, the dichotomized EGSS will be analyzed with a logistic regression procedure with factors of treatment, investigational site, and treatment by investigational site interaction. Investigational sites with low enrollment that interfere with the logistic regression will be removed.

57 The consistency of treatment response will be investigated across the analysis centers subsequent 
to combining the data as described above. Statistical tests will be conducted to identify if there are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of common statistical and clinical conclusions. An analysis center by treatment interaction will be included in the primary and secondary variable analyses to test  for parallel treatment effect at an alpha level of 0.10. Change 
from baseline in inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an 
ANCOVA (unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by analysis center interaction and the respective baseline lesion count variable as a covariate. For the purpose of testing consistency of treatment response, the dichotomized EGSS will be analyzed with a logistic regression procedure. Further examination will follow f or any variables 
that have a significant ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction term. In the event that the ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction (referred to henceforth as the "appropriate test") p-value is less than or equal to 0.10, a sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the 
extreme efficacy result will be performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect. On the other hand, if the outcome of the appropriate test has a p-value greater than 0.10, then the conclusions from the pooled data will be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis centers.  
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or centers that contribute to the statistical significance of the appropriate test. The process involves 
submitting subsets of analysis centers to the appropriate test and observing the appropriate test p-value for the subset. Subsets with p-values greater than 0.10 for the appropriate test are considered homogeneous. 
The search for an extreme analysis center begins by analyzing all subsets that can be created by 
excluding one analysis center. If one or more of the subsets result in an appropriate test p- value 
greater than or equal to 0.10, then the analysis center excluded from the subset with the largest p -
value for the appropriate test is deemed to be the extreme analysis center.  
If all appropriate test subset p -values are less than or equal to 0.10, then the process will analyze 
the appropriate test for all subsets tha t can be created by excluding two analysis centers. If one or 
more of these subsets generate appropriate test p -values larger than 0.10, then the analysis 
centers excluded from the subset with the largest appropriate test p -value are deemed the extreme 
analysis centers.  
Thus, the process of identifying the extreme analysis centers will continue in a stepwise manner 
by first excluding one, then two, then three, etc., analysis centers until the appropriate test p-value exceeds 0.10. Once the extreme analysis center or centers have been identified, then the treatment p -values of the remaining analysis centers will be computed. Inferences will be drawn 
from the treatment p -value, as well as any pertinent observations regarding the extreme analysis 
center or centers.

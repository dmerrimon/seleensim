2. Synopsis –amended
Title Real Life Multimarker Monitoring in Patients with Heart Failure
Short title REALIsM -HF pilot study
Clinical study phase Exploratory study evaluating the clinical utility and feasibility of activity 
tracking in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF.
All medicinal products are used in accordance with the terms of the 
marketing authorization. Additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures 
do not pose more than minimal additional risk or burden to the safety of 
the subjects compared to normal clinical practice.
Study objective(s) The study aims to explore two marketed devices pro viding a multi -marker 
monitoring including physical activity under real -life conditions in patients 
with HFpEF and HFrEF. It aims to identify potential novel endpoints for 
future HFpEF trials by exploring clinically relevant changes over time and 
correlati ons/associations with conventional endpoints such as the six -
minute -walking- distance ( 6MWD ), biomarkers and clinical events. 
Furthermore, it aims to address the challenges and feasibility of implementing device -based measurements under real -life conditions .
In addition, it is hypothesized that “subjective” items generated from patient experiences (PRO, QoL) in combination with an (objective) 
activity monitor would capture all relevant dimensions of exercise capacity 
in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF and thus can be used as patient centric 
approach in clinical studies.
Primary objective:
Measurement and quantification of daily physical activity (PA) in 
patients with HFpEF and HFrEF under real life conditions by activity tracker/belt and patch 
Secondary objectives:
Association between VitalPatch biosensor
2and DynaPort Move 
Monitor data (e .g. different levels of activity) to adverse 
events/clinical outcome data occurring during the study period
Assess the baseline level and longitudinal changes over time of 
heart rate, respiratory rate and ECG -derived parameters and the 
average of person -to-person physiological variability and the 
within- patient standard deviation between the baseline and 3 -
month measurements.3

Assess the feasibility of activity tracking w ith two devices 
(VitalPatch biosensor4and DynaPort Move Monitor) in patients 
with heart failure
Correlation of activity data between VitalPatch biosensor4data on 
activity and DynaPort Move Monitor 
Evaluate the relationship between physical activity levels, heart 
rate, respiratory rate and ECG -derived parameters and important
measures in HFpEF; such as quality of life (QoL), patient reported 
outcome (PRO), biomarkers, outcomes (e.g. clinical endpoints 
such as hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, 
emergency visits)5
Support the development of HFpEF specific q uestio ns (PRO) for 
testing/validating cross -sectional and longitudinally 
Determine the variability of device derived biomarkers between 
subjects and within subjects over time in order to validate such biomarkers for clinical use in the context of heart fa ilure.
Evaluate hs -copeptin as potential biomarker 
6,7
Correlation between patch monitor collected data and patient clinical data from the start of the study (e.g. echocardiography, 
weight gain/loss, NYHA, heart rate)
Explore the relationship between physical activity ( PA), 6MWD, 
PRO, biomarkers, adverse events/clinical outcomes
Investigate the accuracy of patients’ self- reports (PRO, e.g. 
KCCQ) of time spent on PA in real life vs. objective assessment 
by the DynaPort Move Monitor and VitalPatch biosensor

Indication Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and Heart failure 
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
Diagnosis and main 
criteria for inclusion /exclusionFemale and male subjects with a diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; EF ≥ 45%) or reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; 
EF ≤ 35% ) will be enrolled.

Study design Multi -center, non-blinded, non- randomized, observatory prospective 
patient study
Methodology9 This study will comprise a screening phase of up to 9days including an 
optional hospitalization period , an outpatient phase of approximately 12
week sand a follow up telephone call after 6 month s
Patients will be selected on the basis of their established diagnosis of HFrEF and HFpEF.
The patients will have site visits at week 0 (screening visit and visit 1 
within 9 days, during hospitalization phase or in am bulatory patients ), 
week 1 after visit 1 /hospital disch arge (visit 2; observational
phase), week 
11 post visit 1 / discharge (visit 3, observational phase) and week 12 post 
visit 1 / discharge (visit 4, o bservational phase). 
In addition, one follow up phone call at 6 month post discharge will be made to assess patient safety, well -being and clinical status.
The VitalPatch
10heart failure patch will be applied atvisit 1 / hospital 
discharge (first VitalPatch biosensor patch)10, at visit 2 ( 2ndpatch, 3rd
patch will be subsequently applied by the patient at home), and at visit 3
(4thpatch , 5thpatch will be subsequently applied by the patient at home ). 
The Dyn aport MoveMonitor belt will be applied at visit 2 and visit 3. T he 
6MWD test will be done at visit 1 / hospital discharge as well as visit 4 (12 
week spost visit 1 / discharge). 
Transthoracic echocardiography will be performed at visit 1 (within ±72 
hours) .
The KCCQ questionnaire will be performed at visit 1 / prior to discharge , 
at week 3after visit 1 / discharge ,and at visit 4.
Daily and weekly PRO will be perfo rmed in parallel with the DynaPort 
MoveMonitor monitoring periods (visit 2, week 2-3) and visit 3 (week 11 -
12).
Biomarkers reflecting cardiac structure and function will be examined as 
well as candidate biomarkers tha tmay predict outcomes .
Daily physical acti vity (duration and intensity) will be recorded during 
repeated respective 5- day (Vital Patch) and 7-day (DynaPort 
MoveMonitor) time periods until 3 months after visit 1 / discharge from 
hospital.

Type of control not applicable
Number of subjects Due to theexploratory nature of this study , and to the multiplicity and the 
type of the observed parameters, the number of target subject was chosen 
to be comparable with other studies where a significant difference in PA was observed. T he study will enroll enou gh subjects to have 80 subjects 
(HFpEF n=60, HFrEFn=20) who completed the main study, i.e .visit 4.
Primary variable(s) Daily physical activity (amount ,intensity , duration ) obtained from the 
VitalPatch biosensor11 / DynaPort Move Monitor device
Time point/frame of 
measurement for 
primary variable(s)Baseline level and longitudinal changes over time of physical activity and 
the average of person -to-person physiological variability and the within -
subject standard deviation between the baseline and 3 -month post baseline
measurements .12
Plan for statistical 
analysisStatistical analyses will be of explorative and descriptive nature. The study is not aimed to confirm or reject pre -defined hypotheses.
All variables will be analyzed descriptively with appropriate statistical methods: categorical variables by frequency tables (absolute and relative 
frequencies) and continuous variables by sample statistics (i.e. mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median, quartiles and maximum). Continuous variables will be desc ribed by absolute value and as change 
from baseline per analysis time point, if applicable.
The variability of biomarkers assumed to be normal distributed will be 
analyzed using a linear mixed effect model with subject as random factor, 
and time as fixed factor, possibly including additional covariates as may 
result from the assessment at baselin e for subjec t stratification or as 
required for clinical interpretation. Based on this model, point estimates (LS-Means) and exploratory 90% confidence intervals will be calculated 
for comparing baseline and 3 months data. For biomarkers assumed to be log-normal distributed, the logarithms of the biomarker concentration will 
be analyzed, and results will be reported as ratio for comparing baseline 
and 3 months data.
All analyses will be performed for the total study population (overall 
analysis) .Subjects wearing at least once the VitalPatch biosensor
11system
and for which data was successfully collected over 5 days 13will be 
included in the analysis.
Sample size and disposition information by analysis time point will be 
displayed in a frequency table.

3. Introduction - amended
Rationale and Background
Heart failure (HF) is known to be a major public health problem and a major cause of 
mortality  and morbidity . It has a prevalence of up to 22% in elderly, and aging of population 
worldwide will result in a further rise in the HF prevalence by 50% over the next 10 -15 years 
[1, 2]. 
Acute decompensated heart failure is constantly  increasing in prevalence and is strongl y 
associated with mortality and morbidity , including frequent hospitalizations [ 3,4]. The high 
percentage (30 – 60%) of readmissions within 6 months is particularly  noteworthy  [5].
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) currentl y accounts for more than 50% 
of all HF cases and shows rising incidence [ 6], and outcomes among these patients are as poor 
as those with HF and reduce d ejection fraction (HFrEF). Previous HF trials have focused 
primarily  on reduction of CV mortality  and/or readmission risk, whereas studies among 
hospitalized patients have largel y focused on acute sy mptoms. Given the fact that patients 
with HFpEF are muc h older and have significant comorbidity  burden compared to their peers 
with HFrEF, it is difficult to conceive that one drug or device can reduce mortality  or 
hospitalization risk in these patients.[ 7] Though intensively  managed, these patients remain 
symptomatic and have substantially  reduced functional capacity  and quality of life (QoL).
Improvement in mortality remains the gold standard outcome for HF clinical trials, and 
indeed man y therapies in patients with HFrEF were able to reduce the risk of death. However, 
inHFpEF patients, the competing risk for death by complex comorbidities is substantial 
among these patients. Effectivel y targeting mechanisms related toHFpEF may  improve 
underly ing pathophy siology  and subsequentl y patient status; however ,this may  be 
insufficient to alter overall mortality  amon gHFpEF patients. Thus, in an olde rHFpEF 
population due to the competing risk for death, it may  be prohibitively  difficult to improve 
mortality  as a singular goal of therap y. Reducing the risk of hospitalization s is an important 
consideration as they  are associated with poor outcomes ,high costs and impaired QoL . 
However, one of the major issues is that it may  reflect regional practices [ 8]. 
Thus, alternate patient centric outcomes reflecting “patient journey ” should be pursued as 
reasonable basis for drug approval i nHFpEF. QoL/patient reported outcome (PRO) and 
exercise capacit y is an increasingl y recognized patient and caregiver concern and may present 
more pragmatic outcomes, but are currentl y not typically considered as primary endpoints for 
clinical trials in HF patients. 
The traditional approach for vital signs and biometric aldata monitoring is based on in-
hospital spot-check measurements, which do not effectivel y characterize human phy siology  in 
real life environment. Current trends in the assessment of phy sical activity  focus on the 
measures of amount and frequency  of activities using activity  monitors in real life 
environment. Biometric aldata monitored from arrival to the hospital, throughout the hospital 
stay, and continued at home ,based on new device technology  offers a unique opportunity  to 
explore these new endpoints in HF patients. In patients wit h HFpEF, small changes in 
physical activity  are likely  to be important effects of interventions aimed at enhancing 
physical activity and improvement of QoL . There fore, in order for investigators to interpret 
the effect of interventions on phy sical activity , activity  monitors that have been properl y 
validated in these patient groups are needed.

As these new digital technologies are technicall y validated but not y et fully clinically
validated, it is not clear whether clinical studies should harness the power of mobile health 
data to improve therapeutic outcomes and trial efficiency . These anal ytic devices need to be 
further evaluated for their clinical feasibility  and the ability  to identify  clinically  relevant 
changes. Furthermore, it is unlikely  that an activity  monitor can fully  capture patients' 
experience of ph ysical activity . For example, in chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease 
patients, qualitative research has shown that patients experience s ymptoms while being active, 
or have to adapt their lifesty le, features that will unlikely  be captured using activity  monitors 
alone. Such a patient- centered concept should therefore include a PRO questionnaire in 
addition t o tracking of phy sical activity . Conversely , a PRO questionnaire alone will also not 
allow assessment of ph ysical activity patterns or detection of small changes in phy sical 
activity  on a day -to-day basis. Unfortunatel y, the currentl y available PROs that a im to 
measure ph ysical activity in HFpEF patients do not follow best practice as set out in the 
guidelines published b y the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [9]Thus, in addition to 
testingthe feasibility  of activity  tracking with two different devices, the present study  aims to 
identify  a set of non- redundant items for a potential PRO questionnaire i nHFpEF. The data in
HFrEF will help generate hypotheses and aid in determining the feasibility  of phy sical 
activity  tracking with different devices in patients wit hHFrEF as well a sHFpEF.
This study  aims to explore two devices providing a multi -marker biometric almonitoring 
including dail y activity  under real -lifeconditions in patients wit hHFpEF and HFrEF. It aims 
to identify  potential new endpoints for future HFpEF trials b y exploring clinically relevant 
changes over time and correlations/associations with conventional endpoints and biomarkers. Furthermore, it a ims to define the challenges and test the feasibility  of this approach under 
real-life conditions.
It is h ypothesized that “subjective” items generated from patient experiences (PRO) in 
combination with an (objective) activity  monitor would capture all relevant dimensions of 
physical activity  in patients wit hHFpEF.
The VitalPatch biosensor
14is a wearable, wireless phy siological monitoring and arrh ythmia 
detection sy stem that is used by  patients to aid clinicians in the identification, diagnosis and 
mana gement of various clinical conditions, events and/or trends. It consists primarily  of the 
wearable sensor (monitoring device) and a portable secured data transmitter ( mobile phone 
with bluetooth and wireless connection ). VitalPatch is manufactured b y Vital Connect (USA) , 
and is fully  approved b y the USA FDA , CE marked in the European Union, CMDR registered 
and I SO 13485 certified.14
The VitalPatch biosensor14will be used to monitor patients’ cardiovascular status. The 
cardiac monitoring device will be worn as specified in Section 9.7.1.
The sy stem is intended to continuously  measure, record and store ECG data. The s ystem can 
detect (but is not limited to) higher degree AV- blocks > I°, SVTs (e.g. atrial fibrillation [AF], 
atrial flutter, parox ysmal SVTs), ventricular ectopy , brady arrhy thmias, conduction disorders 
and heart rate variability . Apart from safet y assessments, also the patient’s everyday ph ysical 
activity  (frequency , duration, intensity ) will be tracked.

Details of the cardiac monitoring and the device to be worn b y the patient will be outlined in a 
manual that will be provided to all participating centers.
The Dy naPort Move Monitor – the second activity  tracker used in the present study  -is a 
wearable device worn in an elastic strap on the lower back for ambulatory  monitoring of 
physical activity  for up to 7 day s.DynaPort Move Monitor is manufactured by McRoberts 
BV (Netherlands). This device is US FDA approved, CE marked in the European Union and 
ISO 13485 certified.15The DynaPort Move Monitor consists of three orthogonall y mounted 
accelerometers, a tri -axial magnetometer, a temperature sensor and a barometer. 
Accelerometer data were collected at 100 Hz and stored on an internal flash memory  drive.  
The DynaPort Move Monitor is attached centrally over the lower back with an elastic belt 
around the waist. The MoveMonitor distinguishes movement patterns (walking, shuffling, 
cycling, stair climbing) and body  positions (standing, sitting, l ying) during long -term 
measurements, and it measures the intensit y (acceleration) at which movements such as 
walking are performed. The data collected will be uploaded to a secured cloud server, and the 
positions and accelerations of the 3 sensors will be anal yzed with the MoveMonitor software. 
The software translates the recorded acceleration signals into basic activities (walking, shuffling, cy cling, stair climbing) and postures (standing, sitt ing, l ying) and quantifies the 
time spent in each of these activities or postures.
Benefit -risk assessment
The patients will not benefit from this study  as they  are treated according to standard of care 
and will receive no investigational drug. The devices , the questionnaires and the blood 
biomarkers will not have an influence on the treatment of the patients as these are onl y 
observational assessments which will have no effect on the well -being or disease progression 
of the patients.
Both devices have a CE mark and an FDA approval and are safe and well tolerated. All 
medicinal products are used in accordance with the terms of the marketing authori zation .
The patients will have no direct individual therapeutic advantage from the participation in this 
clinic al investigation, but their participation in the investigation is likely  to contribute to 
benefits for specific patient groups.
All potential risks arising from the patients’ participation in the clinical investigation have 
been carefully  assessed and foun d acceptable; they  are outweighed by  the foreseeable benefits 
for specific patient groups, especiall y for the population included in this study – patients with
HFpEF - in the development of an effective treatment for HFpEF.
Additional diagnostic or monitor ing procedures do not pose more than minimal additional risk 
or burden to the safety of the subjects compared to normal clinical practice .
Therefore, the overall risk/benefit ratio is considered favorable for study  participants.
Details of the cardiac monitoring and the devices to be worn by  the patient will be outlined in 
a manual .

5. Study design - amended
This is a non-randomized, multi- center ,observatory prospective patient study .The stud y will 
be conducted in several centers in EU and non- EU.
Patients hospitalized due to heart failure as well as ambulatory  patients with heart failure will 
be included in this study . Overall approx. 80 subjects have to complete at least all device 
monitoring periods:
Approx. 60 subjects with established diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF; EF ≥ 45% ) and 
Approx. 20 subjects with established diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction (HFrEF; EF ≤ 35% ).
All patients will receive the VitalPatch biosensor17at 5 monitoring periods (5 patches each 
subject in total, monitoring period 5days each period) and the Dy naPort Move Monitor (belt) 
at 2monitoring periods (7 day  monitoring each period) .Results from both devices ar e not 
visible to investigator and subjects to avoid bias on treatment decisions .
Biomarkers will be investigated during the hospital stay (only in case patient is hospitalized) , 
atvisit 1 , and at visit 4. A 6 -minute walking test will be performed at visit 1 / discharge and 
after 11 -12 weeks.

Justification of the d esign
The open stud y design is considered acceptable and justified, because the variables of the 
study  are objectivel y measured results that are unlikely to be subject to investigator or study  
patient induced bias.
Male and female patients will be enrolled into this study . There are no reasons to date (i.e.
safet y reasons) to exclude women from these investigations.
The chosen stud y design is considered to be appropriate to establish a baseline for potential 
further objectives for the evaluation of efficacy of treatment responses in patients with heart 
failure, particularl yHFpEF . The statistical analy sis of this trial is performed in an exploratory  
manner.Thispilot study  serves as a preparatory  study designed to test the performance characteristics 
and capabilities of new measures, procedures, recruitment criteria, and operational strategies 
that are under consideration for use in a subsequent, larger, interventional study ;cohort study  
is the appropr iate stud y design for this pilot study . The aims and methods of this pilot study  
arealigned with the goals of potentially  subsequent stud iesin BAYER ’s target indications. 
The study  will contribute to the development and design of future studies by  clarif ying and 
sharpening the research hypotheses to be studied, assessing the clinical utility  of emerging 
readouts, identify ing relevant factors that could create barriers to subsequent study  
completion, evaluating the acceptability  of methods and instruments to participants, 
measuring the time required for stud y participation, and providing concrete estimates of the 
expected rates of missing data and participant attrition.

In addition, the study  aims to estimate baseline values and standard deviation of potential
pharmacod ynamic outcome measures related to the phy sical activit y (e.g. movement intensity, 
daily  steps) to give inform ation for sample size ca lculations in subsequent trials. Furthermore, 
the study  will improve the understanding of stud y questionnaire s or data collection tools
However, results from these kinds ofstudies can be influence dby unpredictable confounding 
factors.
End of study
The end of the stud y as a whole will be reached as soon as the last visit of the last subject has 
been reached in all centers in all participating countries (EU and non -EU).

Justification of selection criteria 6.3
Bayer develops several investigational medicinal product s for the indication HFpEF for which 
until now no successf ul treatment is available. Until now all endpoints failed and were not 
predictive for the outcome of the patient’ s disease progression. Bay er intends to develop new 
endpoints and variables , which later might be useful to monitor pharmacody namics effects 
and for the prediction of disease progression in interventional studies with new drugs . 
Digital device -derived biomarkers are of high interest regarding the identification of new 
potential endpoints, especially  for patient populations where no predictable biomarkers are 
available. 
The new European guidelines (2016) for heart failure (HF) include the concept of HF with 
intermediate left ventricular ejecti on fraction ( heart failure with mid -range ejection fraction ,
HFm rEF), i.e. an LVEF between 40 and 49% .[1]However, a substantial heterogeneity  may  
exist within pati ents wit hHFm rEF. In particular, this group may include both patients with de 
novo HF and patients with HF with previousl y reduced LVEF who have recovered their 
systolic function. Furthermore, considering the technical variability  of echocardiographic 
assessment of ejection fraction as well as the biological variability , patients within the mid -
range ejection fraction may  represent patients wit hHFpEF as well a sHFrEF. For the purpose 
of this study , it is critical to study  well defined patient groups with e itherHFpEF o rHFrEF to 
avoid a relevant overlap between both groups.  Therefore, the inclusion criteria with respect to ejection fraction differ from current guidelines slightl y. However, cut -off values used in the 
present stud y have also been used in sev eral previous studies in patients with heart failure.
This study  serves as a pilot study  to identify  a baseline for several digital biomarkers i n
HFpEF patients. In parallel som e HFrEF patients are included for which a baseline for some 
of the device reado uts is alread y available derived from studies with i mplantable cardioverter -
defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices . They  serve as internal plausibility  
control.
Therefore ,it is essential to includ eHFpEF an d HFrEF patients in this study.

Withdraw al of subjects from study 6.4
6.4.1 Withdrawal
Withdrawal criteria
An excessive rate of withdrawals (either patients discontinuing study  medication or study  
withdrawal) can render the study  non- interpretable. Therefore, un -necessary  withdrawal of 
patients should be avoided, and all efforts should be taken to motivate patients to comply  with 
all the study  specific procedures and to be followed until the end of the trial to complete all 
study  procedures and to detect the occurrenc e of cardiovascular events/assess the vital status. 
A patient has the right to withdraw from the stud y at any time and for an y reason without 
prejudice to his or her future medical care b y the physician or the institution. Patients who 
withdraw consent aft er enrolling will be evaluated to the time of withdrawal. If possible, the 
final assessment should be performed on all patients at the time of withdrawal. Patients 
should not be withdrawn from follow- up unless the patient explicitly  withdraws consent to be
contacted. All efforts should therefore be made to minimize the number of patients who 
withdraw such consent as, in general, no further information on cardiovascular events and survival status may  be collected after that point.
Patient will be withdrawn f rom the study  for the following reasons:
At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative . At an y 
time during the study and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate further.  The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.
If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study  would be harmful to the 
patient's well- being,
At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator (e.g. obvious 
non-compliance, safet y concer ns).
Occurrence of adverse events or intercurrent diseases which the investigator judges unacceptable for continuation of participation in the study, or have from the 
investigator’s point of view, a negative impact on the patient’s individual risk -benefit 
ratio. (Investigators are obliged to reassess the patient’s individual risk -benefit ratio on 
a continuous basis. Factors like anticipated treatment effect, progression of underlying disease, occurrence of side effects and alternative treatment options have to be 
considered).
In case a patient is diagnosed while on study  with any  disease condition listed within 
the exclusion criteria,
Pertinent non- compliance with the conditions for the trial or instructions by  the 
investigator .
Although not preferred, patie nt may  interrupt their monitoring program of study  due to 
reasonable circumstances/reasons at an y time (e.g. hospitalization, safety  reasons, and 
side effects). If an interruption lasts longer than 14 day s in a row, it is at the discretion 
of the investiga tor to discontinue the study  participation, and the Case Report Form 
(CRF) of the termination visit must be completed. In case program has to be interrupted for less than 14 day s, activity  monitoring has to be restarted.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria ar e being violated.

The reason of discontinuation and the specific details must be recorded in the CRF. The 
investigator should determine one primary  reason for discontinuation (only  one choice is 
permitted).
All safet y relevant data until removal will be co llected and reported.
Any patient removed from the study  due to an AE must be monitored until sy mptoms 
subside/stabilize or until there is a satisfactory  explanation of the changes observed.
Data collected until the time a patient discontinues participation in the study will be handled 
in the same manner as data for patients completing the stud y.
Any decision for withdrawal of individual patients will be made after mutual agreement 
between the investigator and the sponsor.Depending on the time point of withdrawal, a withdrawn subject is referred to as either 
“screening failure” or “dropout” as specified below:
Screening failure
A subject who, for an y reason (e.g. failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates the 
study  before the time po int used for the definition of “dropout” (see below) is regarded a 
“screening failure”.  
The participation of an initial “screening failure” subject at a later time point is acceptable if 
he/she meets all selection criteria. 
In an y case, the investigator has to ensure that the repeated screening procedures do not 
expose the subject to an unjustifiable health risk.  Also, for re -screening, the subject has to re-
sign the informed consent form, even if it was not changed after the subject’s previous 
screenin g.
Dropout
A subject who discontinues study  participation prematurely  for any  reason is defined as a 
“dropout” if the subject has alread y been started one device monitoring period. 
General proceduresIn all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the subject's 
medical records. 
The subject may  object to the generation and processing of post -withdrawal data as specified 
in Section 13.4.
Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or 
transfer is medically  acceptable.
Details for the premature termination of the study as a whol e (or components thereof) are 
provided in Section 12(Premature termination of the study ).
6.4.2 Replacement
As far as possible patients who are considered as dropouts will be replaced until a number of 
at least 60 evaluable datasets for HFpEF patients and 20 fo r HFrEF patients has been reached.

listed below will be collected as available to the investigator:
Start before signing of the informed consent 
Considered relevant for the subject’s stud y eligibility .
Detailed instructions on the differentiation between (i) medical history  and (ii )adverse events 
can be found in Section 9.6.1.1.

9.6.1 Adverse events
Definitions 9.6.1.1
Adverse Event (AE):
Any untoward medical occurrence (i.e. an y unfavorable and unintended sign [including 
abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom or disease) in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study . Therefore, an 
AE may  or may  not be tempor ally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal product.
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study  by any physician treating
the subject should not be recorded as an AE (however, the condition for which the surger y is 
required may be an AE).
In the following differentiation between medical history  andAEs, the term “condition” may 
include abnormal e.g. physical examination find ings, s ymptoms, diseases, laboratory , ECG.
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no sy mptoms 
or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical 
history (e.g. seasonal allergy  without acute complaints).
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
19167
21 Feb 2020 Version. 4.0 Page:  34of 108
Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history (e.g.allergic pollinosis) .
Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events . This includes intercurrent illnesses.
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)
An SAE is classified as any  untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose, meets any of the 
following criteria ( a –f):
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetica lly might have caused death if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as an SAE if at least one of the following excepti ons is met:
-The admission results in a hospital stay  of less than 12 hours
- The admission is pre- planned
(e.g. elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to the start of the study ; 
admission is part of the study procedures as described in Section 9.2)
-The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g. social hospitalization for purposes of respite care).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospitalization may 
fulfill the criterion of ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory  authorities 
specificall y require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacity
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life’s 
functions.
e.Is a congenital anomal y / birth defect
f.Is another serious or important medical event as judged b ythe investigator
Classifications for adverse event assessment 9.6.1.2
AllAEs will be assessed and documented b y the investigator according to the categories 
detailed below.
9.6.1.2.1 Seriousness
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria giv en in 
Section 9.6.1.1.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
19167
21 Feb 2020 Version. 4.0 Page:  35of 108
9.6.1.2.2 Intensity
The intensity  of an AE is classified according to the following categories:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually tr ansient and may  require only  minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual activities of daily  
living.
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually  alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. T he event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.Severe: A type of AE that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event interrupts 
usual activities of daily  living, or significantl y affects clinical status. The event possesses a 
significant risk of harm to the research participant and hospitalization may  be required.
9.6.1.2.3 Causal relationship 
The relationship of an AEto the device must be assessed by the investigator based on all 
information available at the time of the completion of the CRF. The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship”
to the device in question.
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”
An assessment of “no” would include:
1.The existence of a highl y likely  alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.
or
2.Non-plausibility , e.g. the subject is struck by  an automobile when there is no 
indication that wearing the device caused disorientation that may  have caused the 
event.
An assessment of “y es” indicates that that the AE is reasonabl y associated with the use of the
device . 
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to t he device
include:
The temporal se quence from wearing the device : The event should occur after the 
device is applied . The length of time from wearing the device to event should be 
evaluated in the clinical context of the event.
Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: 
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history  and course of the 
disease being treated and any  other disease the patient may  have.
Concomitant medication or treatment: 
The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might have caused the event in question.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
19167
21 Feb 2020 Version. 4.0 Page:  36of 108
Exposure to phy sical and / or mental stresses: The exposure to stress might induce 
adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the 
event .
The assessment is not possible.
Causal relationship to protocol-required procedure(s)
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedures is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to 
protocol -required procedures.
Possible answers are “y es” or “no”
9.6.1.2.4 Action taken with study treatment 
Not applicable.
9.6.1.2.5 Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events
-None
-Remedial drug therap y
-Other
9.6.1.2.6 Outcome
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows: 
-Recovered/resolved
-Recovering/resolving
-Recovered/resolved with sequelae
-Not recovered/not resolved
-Fatal
-Unknown
Assessments and documentation of adverse events 9.6.1.3
The investigator has to record on the respective AECRF page ,all adverse events occurring in 
the period between the signing of the informed consent and the end of the follow -up phase; 
after the end of the follow-up phase there is no requirement to activel y collectAEs including 
deaths.  The t ype of information that should be assessed and recorded b y the investigator for 
each AE is listed in Section 9.6.1.2. 
“Death” should not be recorded as an AE on the AE page. Instead, “death” is the outcome of 
underly ing AE(s).
For all serious adverse events (SAEs) Bayer has to carry  out a separate assessment for 
expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship regar ding study  procedures and Bayer 
drugs/devices.

Reporting of serious adverse events -amended 9.6.1.4
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in the Section 9.6.1.1. Each SAE 
must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by  submission of updated reports to the 
designated recipient.
Any serious adverse events will be reported b y the i nvestigator t o Bay er. Bay er will process 
these cases according to Bay er standard procedures and report as described below. In 
addition, all adverse events related to the VitalPatch biosensor33or the Dy naPort Move 
Monitor, which are both non-investigational devices in the Post -Marketing phase, will be 
reported b y the i nvestigator to the respective legal manufacturers, which would fulfill their 
reporting obligations to competent a uthorities and Notified bodies. 
In addition, for any adverse events related to any non-Bayerdrugs/devices, investigators are 
recommended to use the national applicable s ystem for reporting of spontaneous AEs.
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor
All investigators will be thoroughl y instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs . This information, including all relevant contact 
details, is summarized in the investigator site file. This information will be updated as needed.
The investigator must report immediately  (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) all 
SAEs occurring during the period defined in Section 9.6.1.3 to the recipient detailed in the 
instructions for SAE rep orting included in the Investigator File. For this, an AE page and the 
complementary  SAE pages in the CRF must be completed for each SAE. 
SAEs occurring after the protocol -defined study period will be processed by the sponsor 
according to all applicable regulations.

Vital signs
Blood pressure , hear t rate and bod y weight will be measured at time points given in the study  
flow charts in Table 9–1as standard at the investigational site. 
Electrocardiogram /echocardiography
The standard 12 -lead ECG will be evaluated b y the investigator and the following parameters 
will be recorded in the eCRF: HR, PR interval, QRSD interval, QT interval (uncorrected). 
QTcB (QT interval frequency -corrected according to Bazett’s formula) will also be calculated 
but will not be valid for evaluation. The frequen cy-corrected QT interval will be calculated b y 
data management according to the formulas of both Bazett and Fridericia.
All ECGs recorded during the stud y will be evaluated b y a ph ysician. He / she will document 
the diagnosis(es) including an overall asses sment of the findings and their clinical relevance.
Any clinically  relevant abnormality  will be documented as an AE or SAE. Judgement 
normal/abnormal, including specification of abnormal findingsAn echocardiograph y will be performed at Visit 1 / discharge from the hospital (within ± 72
hours ).

Laboratory evaluations
In the event of implausible results, the laboratory  may  measure additional parameters to 
asses s the quality  of the sample (e.g. clotted or hemoly zed) and to verify  the results.  The 
results from such additional anal yses may neither be included in the clinical database of this 
study  nor evaluated further. I f the results are relevant, the investigato r will be informed to 
determine follow -up activities outside of this protocol.
Healthcare Resource Utilization 34
The use of Healthcare Resources in conjunction with AEs, in particular due to HF, needs to be 
documented, for example with regard to the time points or periods affected (e.g. 
hospitalization sfor HF, urgent visits for HF to an emergency department or outpatient 
facility ).

KCCQ
The KCCQ is the leading health- related quality -of-life measure for patients with HF. It was 
developed in the late 1990s to earl y 2000s b y Dr. John Spertus at the Mid- America Heart 
Institute, Kansas City , MO, USA. I t is a 23 -item questionnaire that independently  measures 
the impact of patients’ HF, or its treatment, on 7 distinct domains: 
1.Symptom Frequency  –the KCCQ Sy mptom scale quantifies the frequency  of clinical 
symptoms in HF, including fatigue, shortness of breath, paroxy smal nocturnal 
dyspnea, and edema / swelling.
2.Symptom Burden – the KCCQ Sy mptom burden scale quantifies the severity  of 
clinical sy mptoms in HF, including fatigue, shortness of breath and edema / swelling.
3.Physical Limitation –the KCCQ Phy sical limitation scale measures the limitati ons 
patients experience, due to their HF, in performing routine activities.
4.Quality  of Life –the KCCQ Quality  of life scale is designed to reflect patients’ 
assessment of their quality of life, given the current status of their HF.
5.Social L imitations –the KCCQ Social limitation scale quantifies the extent to which 
HF s ymptoms impair patients’ abilities to interact in social roles.
6.Self-efficacy  –numerous studies have underscored the importance of patients being 
engaged in the management of their disease. The KCCQ Self -efficacy  scale quantifies 
patients’ perception of how to prevent HF exacerbations and manage complications 
when they  arise.
7.Symptoms Stability –unlike the other 5 domains that provide cross -sectional 
quantification of patients’ current statu s, the KCCQ Sy mptom stability  domain 
measures recent changes in patients’ sy mptoms. As a measure of change, it is most 
interpretable as a baseline assessment of the stability  of patients’ s ymptoms at the start 
of the study  and thereafter.
In addition, ther e are 3 summary  scores, a Total Symptom Score that combines the Sy mptom 
Frequency  and the Sy mptom Burden scores, a Clinical Summary  Score that combines the 
Total Sy mptom and Phy sical L imitation scores to replicate the NYHA classification; and an 
Overall Summary  Score that includes the Total Symptom, Phy sical Limitation, Social 
Limitations, and Quality  of L ife scores ( Figure 9-1).

The e xploratory  daily  QoL-Questionnaire is provided in Appendix 16.1.
KCCQ and PRO will be collected using electronic versions of the questionnaires on a tablet 
computer, which will be hand out to the patient for the duration of the study .
9.7.3 Six-minute w alking distance
The walking distance after 6 minutes walking will be determined and documented.
The 6MWD test must be performed in accordance with the American Thoracic Societ y 
Guideline [11].
According to the guideline, the 6MWD test should be carried out indoors, along a long, flat, 
straight, enclosed corridor with hard surface that is seldom traveled. The walking course should be preferabl y 30 m in length, but not less than 25 m (longer walking courses should be 
shortened to 30 m). The length of the corridor and turnaround points should be marked. Patients will be instructed to walk alone, not run, from one end to the other end of the walking course, at their own pace, while attempting to cover as much ground as possible in 6 minutes. During the walk, patients are allowed to stop, lean against the wall and rest, but should resume walking as soon as they  feel able to do so. The resting time will be included in the 6 
minute s. A “warm -up” period before the test should not be performed. The patients should sit 
at rest in a chair, located near the starting position, for at least 10 minutes before the test starts. I nvestigators should not walk with the patients. Moreover, onl y standardized phrases 
for encouragement must be used during the test. To allow reproducibility , standardized 
phrases should be used every  minute according to the following pattern: After the first minute, 
tell the patient the following (in even tones): “You are doing well. You have 5 minutes to go.” 
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “Keep up the good work. You have 4 minutes to go.”

When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “You are doing
well. You are halfway  done.” When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the 
following: “Keep up the good work. You have only 2 minutes left.”
When the timer shows only  1 minute remaining, tell the patient: “You are doing well. You 
have onl y 1 minute to go.” To reduce the variability of the 6MWD tests, it is of utmost 
importance that all 6MWD tests are performed under the same conditions, which must be the 
same as baseline conditions. Wheelchair or scooter dependent / supplemental oxy gen pat ients 
or those on continuous ox ygen for severe pulmonary disease are excluded from the study. The 
use of a cane is allowed in cane dependent patients, but then these patients need to use the same cane at every  6MWD test throughout the study . If a supplemental oxygen therap y 
should be implemented during the trial, if it is implemented alread y at baseline, the 
subsequent 6MWD test at Visit 4 / premature discontinuation visit has to be performed under 
the same “baseline” conditions (same flow of oxygen, same a pplication route, and same way  
of carry ing the oxy gen bottle). The same applies if the need for walking aids should arise 
during the trial alread y at baseline. In that case the same walking aids should also be used at 
the Visit 4 / premature discontinuatio n test.
However, this should be avoided, and ifnot possible, at least the same conditions should be 
met in both 6MWD tests. For qualit y reasons, the inhalation of supplemental ox ygen and the 
use of walking aids during the 6MWD tests must be documented in the eCRF.
9.7.4 Laboratory parameters
Blood samples will be collected as given in Table 9–1and the following biomarkers will be 
determined in plasma/serum by  a central laboratory using validated assay s platforms 
including appropriate quality  controls :
NTpro BNP
hs-C opeptin
hs-TNT
Further biomarkers may  be tested:
GDF15
IGFBP7
sST2
Gal3
Details on the collection, processing, storage and shipment of biomarker samples will be provided in separate documents (e.g. sample handling sheets or lab manual). In addition to the 
biomarkers listed a bove, other biomarkers deemed relevant to gain further knowledge about 
the pathomechanisms of the disease may  be measured, based on newl y em erging data from 
other ongoing studies and / or literature data.
Appropriateness of procedures / measurements 9.8
All laboratory and safet y parameters as well as the methods to measure them, are standard 
variables/ methods in clinical studies and/ or clinical practice. They are widely  used and 
generall y recognized as reliable, accurate and relevant.

10. Statistical methods and determination of sample size
General considerations -amended 10.1
All statistical details including calculated variables and proposed format and content of tables 
will be detailed in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized before study  
database lock. Statistical anal ysis will be performed using SAS or R; the version sused for 
both types of software will be specified in the SAP .
Statistical anal yses will be of expl orative and descriptive nature. The stu dyis not aimed to 
confirm or reject pre-define d hypotheses; however, particular attention will be given to the 
ejection fraction (preserved v ersus reduced) as stratification factor .
All variables will be summarized with appropriate statistical methods: categorical variables 
by frequency tables (absolute and relative frequencies) and continuous variables by sample 
statistics (i.e. mean, stan dard deviation, minimum, median, quartiles and maximum). 
Continuous variables will be described b yabsolute value and as change from baseline per 
analysis time point, asapplicable.
Data from VitalPatch38and DynaPort devices is expected to include missing values, as result 
of compliance in wearing the device. The amount of missing data within a day cannot be 
predicted and will be an outcome of the study .Missing data within day will be assessed by  
vendors according their validated algorithms of data pre- processing and quality  check. No 
imputation will be performed in case day mon itoring did not pass qualit y checks. The amount 
of missing monitoring will be assessed prior each statistical analy sis and in presence of 
outliers the exclusion of subjects’ data may  occur. 
All anal yses will be performed for the FAS population (overall an alysis) and separate lyfor 
each participating country if subject numbers are sufficient and if required for local reasons. 
Sample size and disposition information by analysis time point will be displa yedina
frequency  table.
All therapies documented will be coded using the World Health Organization –Drug 
Dictionary .Medical histor y, any diseases and AEs will be coded using the latest Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version.
No interim ana lysesare planned . The final ana lysis will be performed after end of the study
which is the date the ana lyticaldataset is completely available.
Analysis sets -amended 10.2
In absence of intervention and randomization t he statistical analy sis sets are defined on the 
base of a successful monitoring under the VitalPatch biosensor38patch.  
Full analysis set (FAS)
The FAS population consists of a ll subjects that are included into the stud y and that are 
wearing at least one VitalPatch biosensor38patch and for which data was successfull y 
collected over the whole week. The FAS will be used to display  baseline characteristics, 
assess parameter variability , correlative anal yses.

Safety analysis set (SAF)
The SAF population consists of all patients with a planned study  procedure after signing the 
informed consent that are wearing at least one VitalPatch biosensor38patch and for which 
data was successfull y collected over the whole week will be included in the SAF. The SAF 
will be used to display  safety  anal yses. 
Variables and planned statistical analyses 10.3
Given the descriptive nature of the study  and the multivariate nature of the statistical approach 
used, all of the variables mentioned in section 9are suitable to be anal yzed.
In addition, variable s including patient heart failure information (preserved vs reduced 
ejection fraction) or other clinical endpoints (e.g. re-hospitalization fo r heart failure, 
cardiovascular death, emergency  visits) will be considered as well in the statistical anal ysis, 
possibly  in interaction with other relevant parameters. 
10.3.1 Analysis of demography, disease details, prior and concomitant 
medication and other baseline data
Summary  statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for 
quantitative variables) will be presented for total andstudy  part. Frequency  tables for 
qualitative data will be provided. 
Unsupervised patient stratific ation at baseline will be carried out b y means of the following 
multivariate techniques which allow the simultaneous anal ysis of man y variables such as from 
demographics, disease history  (MedDRA terms), co- morbidities, prior and concomitant 
medication ,AEs, NYHA classification, ECG judgement, vital signs, KCCQ/PRO scores, and 
biomarkers (laboratory data). Continuous variables will be arbitrary  discretized in tertiles or 
quartiles according their density  distribution or according existing clinical ranges of 
normality . Multiple correspondence anal yses will be used, subjec ts will be display ed in bi -
dimensional maps and the homogeneit y of the population towards all the variables under 
assessment will be observed. If groups of subjec ts with specific co -occurrence s for one or 
more parameters could be separated by the others in the bi- dimensional map (at 95% 
confidence ellipse) those will be flagged and eventually  considered as separate population for 
the anal ysis. In the latter case , the parameter (s)responsible for the separation will be 
identified using the map of contribution of variable categories to the dimensions , and could be 
used as covariate in modeling. No additional investigations for comparative purposes will be 
performed.
10.3.2 Analysis of data within the hospitalization phase -amended
Data collected in the hospitalization phase for which records will be available until visit 1 
(from hospitalization and at hospital discharge, respectivel y) will be analyzed by means of 
multivariate techniques in order to describe changes and quantify  the variability  of changes in 
this early  phase, and eventually  identify  subjec ts with extreme behavior in one or more of the
parameters under measurement. Changes in the parameters from 12 -lead ECG , vital signs, 
KCCQ/PRO scores, and biomarkers will be described using multilevel Partial L east Square 
analysis.Such model allows conducting a paired analy sis of subjects before and after 
hospitalization, hence to observe a potential effect of hospitalization on the observed 
parameters. If aneffect will be observed, the parameters sensitive to hospitalization will be

assessed using linear mixed model as described in Section 10.3.3.1 but within the 
hospitalization time frame.
For VitalPatch39data collected in this frame onl y the day  to day  variability  will be of interest.
10.3.3 Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes
Assessment of varia bility 10.3.3.1
The variabilit y between subjects and within subjects across time for each of the parameters of 
interest  will be described using a linear mixed model (L MM) with subject as random factor, 
and time as fixed factor, possibly including additional covariates as may result from the 
assessment at baseline for patient stratification or as required for clinical interpretation. 
In addition to effects and interactions of fixed effects parameters LMMs will be used to 
estimate simultaneously  parameters of the variance and covariance components of random 
effects due to subjects. 
The LMM for the parameter of interest ( Y) as selected among the molecular and digital 
biomarkers available (i.e. laboratory  parameters and device generated digital data) will have 
the following base annotation:
Yst= β0+  β 1 · TIME t+ S 0s+ st
Where S is subject (random) and TIME repre sentsvisit, with base line as reference .
The HF t ype (preserved/reduced) will be included in the model (here denoted as C), as 
random factor, and the effect on intercept or slope will be assessed:
Yst= β0+  (β1 + C 1s) · TIME t + S 0s+ C 0s+ st
Where C 1swill be the effect of HF t ype on the slope (e.g., if changes in phy sical activity  are 
different between the two sub -populations) and C 0swill be the effect on the intercept (e.g., if 
the two sub- populations have different baseline values).
Given the high number of parameters involved and the exploratory  nature of the study , all of 
the possible models will not be addressed here, andthe base model will be extended as 
appropriate depending on the specific question to address and the given subs et of parameters 
involved.  Testing of random effects and visualization of residuals will be performed in order to 
highlight single subjects (or sub -group) showing outstanding or peculiar characteristics.   
Estimates from the model will be used to quantify  the ability  of a parameter to measure 
clinically  relevant changes over time .The intraclass correlation coefficient (I CC) will be used 
as key  statistic when considering the relative proportion of within- and between- individual 
variation is the expected correlation among measurements from the same individual, it can 
indicate the degree of difference between individuals and will also be used as measure 
reliability  (abilit y to reflect true between -individual differences) . For any  sample, the I CC will 
becalculated with estimates from LMMs of both between- individual variance and within-
individual variance , according the following: 
ICC = τ
2/ (τ2+σ2)

19167
21 Feb 2020 Version. 4.0 Page:  47of 108
where τ2is a commonl y used sy mbol for between -individual variance (variance of S 0sterm in 
in the base model above) and σ2for within- individual variance (variance of stin the base 
model) . Then, ICC will be the proportion of total variance (τ2+σ2) attributable to between -
individual differences (τ2). 
In addition, point estimates (LS- Means) and exploratory  90% c onfidence intervals will be 
calculated for compa ring baseline and 3 months data by HF t ype (preserved/reduced) , and 
may include intermediate time points if available. 
Analysis of correlations -amended 10.3.3.2
Given the high degree of collinearity  expected within each set of data, multivariate 
approaches will be considered in order to take in account the covariance structure and 
properl y assess simultaneously the correlation of variables within and between datasets 
consisting of multiple variables, such as digital or biomarker datasets. 
The relationship between variables as obtained from a given source or technology  will be 
assessed b y means of Canonical Correlation. T his analy sis allows investigating the 
relationship between two multivariate sets of variables, such as the one obtained using the 
VitalPatch biosensor40or DynaPort Move Monitor device, and another one as obtained from 
other contexts, such as contexts defined by  the following data sets: i) echocardiograph y 
parameters set, ii) 12-lead ECG parameters set, and iii) a composite set including biomarkers, 
6MWD score, KCCQ total score, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate). Such model will 
possibly  indicate which combination of the many  parameters observed using the device will 
better reflect a clin ical context as given by  ECG, KCCQ, or other data. 
The correlation of digital biomarkers an d AEs or concomitant medication (CM) will be tested 
by means of partial least square anal ysis (PL S-DA). The Y-matrix to use for PLS-DA 
regression can be –depending on the resulting complexity  –i) a joint matrix o fAEs and 
CMs ; ii)grouping variable identifying subjec ts with similar AE and CMs (the latter obtained
by multiple correspondence analy sis and kernel based clustering ).Such model will possibly  
indicate whi ch combination of the many  parameters observed using the device will better 
reflect a clinical profile as obtained from observed frequencies i nAEs and CMs.
10.3.4 Analysis of safety data
The SAF population will be used to display  safet y analyses.
Summary  statist ics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for 
quantitative variables) or frequency  tables will be provided as applicable.
Determination of sample size 10.4
Due to the e xploratory  nature of this study , the number and the diversity  of parameters used to 
measure ph ysical activity, or which could a ffect this outcome in “real -life” conditions , no 
modeling for power estimation was performed. The number of subjects was set to be 
comparable to other studies which involved the assessment of phy sical activity  on dail y life 
(activity  monitoring) and where a significant difference in PA was observed (60 subject in

average). Also considering the expected variability  due to measurement under unstandardized 
conditions [ 12] a number of 80 subjects (HFpEF n=60, HFrEF n=20) who completed the main 
study (i.e. visit 4 ) was defined as target. 
11. Data handling and quality assurance
Data recording 11.1
The data collection tool for this study  will be e CRF; a validated electronic data capture s ystem 
called RAVE.  Subject data necessary  for analy sis and reporting will be entered/transmitted 
into a validated database or data s ystem (CIE/TOSCA; SAS).  
Data req uired according to this protocol will be recorded by  investigational site personnel via 
data entry  into the internet based EDC software sy stem RAVE, which Bayer has licensed 
from Medidata Solutions Worldwide.  RAVE has been validated b y Medidata Solutions 
Worldwide and Bay er for use in it s clinical studies.  RAVE allows for the application of 
software logic to set- up data entry  screens and data checks to ensure the completeness and 
accuracy  of the data entered by  the site personnel.  Bay er extensively  appli es the logic to 
ensure data are complete and reflect the clinical data requirements of the study .  Data queries 
resulting from the application of the software logic are resolved b y the site personnel.  The 
data are stored at a secure host facility  maintain ed by  Medidata Solutions Worldwide and 
transferred on a periodic basis to Bay er's internal computer sy stem via a secure Virtual Private 
Network.
All access to the RAVE system is through a password- protected security  system that is part of 
the RAVE software .  All internal Bay er and external investigator site personnel seeking 
access must go through a thorough RAVE training process before they  are granted access to 
RAVE for use in Bay er's clinical studies. Training records are maintained.
All personnel with a ccess to the RAVE sy stem are supported by  a Service Desk staffed with 
trained personnel to answer questions and ensure access is maintained such that data entry  can 
proceed in a timely  manner.
The RAVE Sy stem contains a sy stem -generated audit trail that ca ptures any  changes made to 
a data field, including who made the change, wh y the change was made and the date and time 
it was made. This information is available both at the investigator’s site and at Bay er. Data 
entries made in the RAVE EDC screens are sup ported by  source documents maintained for all 
subjects enrolled in this study .
Source documentation
The site must implement processes to ensure availability  of all required source 
documentation.  A source document checklist (not part of this protocol) will be used at the 
site to identify  the source data for key  data points collected and the monitor will work with the 
site to complete this.
It is the expectation of the sponsor that all data entered into the CRF has source 
documentation available at the site.   
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

will contact the site prior to the start of the study  to review with the site staff the protocol, 
study  requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy  regulatory , ethical, and sponsor’s 
requirements.  When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussi on will also include 
identification and documentation of source data items.
Thesponsor /designee will monitor the site activity  to verify  that the:
Data are authentic, accurate and complete.  
Supporting data may  be requested (example: blood glucose readings to support a 
diagnosis of diabetes). 
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol 
Any other study  agreements, GCP , and all applicable regulatory requirements are met.
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct access to all relevant documents.
Data processing 11.3
Data will be collected as described in Se ction 11.1. Clinical data management will be 
performed in accordance with applicable sponsor’s standards and data cleaning procedures.  This is appl icable for data recorded on CRF as well as for data from other sources (e.g. IVRS, 
laboratory , ECG, PRO, adjudication committees).
For data coding (e.g.AEs, medication), internationally  recognized and accepted dictionaries 
will be used.

Missing data 11.4
Missing data will not be replaced.
Audit and inspection 11.5
To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory  requirements, a member of the sponsor’s (or a 
designated CRO’s) quality  assurance unit may  arrange to conduct an audit to assess the 
performance of the study a t the study  site and of the study  documents originating there.  The 
investigator/institution will be informed of the audit outcome.
In addition, inspections by regulatory  health authority  representatives and IEC(s)/I RB(s) are 
possible.  The investigator sh ould notify  the sponsor immediately  of any  such inspection.
The investigator/institution agrees to allow the auditor or inspector direct access to all relevant 
documents and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and an y issues.  Audits and inspections may  occur at any  time during or after 
completion of the study .
Archiving 11.6
Essential documents shall be archived safel y and securel y in such a way that ensures that they  
are readil y available upon author ities’ request.
Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by  the hospital, institution or private practice.  Where 
the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum t imelines required b y the sponsor, 
alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the availability  of the source documents for 
the required period.
The investigator/institution notifies the sponsor if the archival arrangements change 
(e.g. relocation or tr ansfer of ownership).
The investigator site file is not to be destroyed without the sponsor’s approval.
The contract with the investigator/institution will contain all regulations relevant for the stud y 
center.
12. Premature termination of the study
The sponsor has the right to close this study  (or, if applicable, individual segments thereof 
[e.g. centers]) at any time, which may be due but not limited to the following reasons: 
If risk- benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,
-Safety findings from this study  (e.g. SAEs)
If the stud y conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data qualit y; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time 
frame.
The investigator has the right to close h is/her center at any  time.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

For an y of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only  after consultation between involved parties.  Final decision 
on the closure must be in writing.
All affected institutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); stud ycenter; head of stud y center) must 
be informed as applicable according to local law.
All study  materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be 
returned to the sponsor.  The investigator will retain all other documents until 
notification is given b y the sponsor for destruction.
In the event of a partial study  closure, ongoing subjects, including those in post study  
follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.
Details for individual subject's withdrawal can be found in Section 6.4.1.
13. Ethical and legal aspects
Investigator(s) and other study personnel 13.1
All other study  personnel not included in this section are identif ied in a separate personnel list 
(not part of this clinical study  protocol) as appropriate.  This list will be updated as needed; an 
abbreviated version with personnel relevant for the centers will be available in each center’s investigator site file.
When ever the term ‘investigator’ is noted in the protocol text, it may  refer to either the 
principal investigator at the site, or an appropriately  qualified, trained and delegated 
individual of the investigational site.The principal investigator of each cente r must sign the protocol signature page and must 
receive all required external approvals (e.g. ethics committee, sponsor) before subject 
recruitment may  start at the respective center.  Likewise, all amendments to the protocol must 
be signed b y the princip al investigator and must have received all required external approvals 
before coming into effect at the respective center.
Acomplete list of all participating centers and their investigators, as well as all required 
signature documents, will be maintained in the sponsor’s study  file.
The global sponsor of this study is identified on the title page of this protocol.  I f required by

centers/countries before start of the study, according to GCP, local laws, regulations and 
organizations.  When necessary , an extension, amendment or renewal of the I EC/IRB 
approval must be obtained and also forwarded to the sponsor.  The respo nsible unit (e.g. 
IEC/IRB, head of the study center/medical institution) must supply  to the sponsor, upon 
request, a list of the IEC/IRB members involved in the vote and a statement to confirm that 
the IEC/I RB is organized and operates according to GCP and applicable laws and regulations.
Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects of study  conduct; the investigator may  not modify  or alter the procedures described in this 
protocol.  
Modifications to the study protocol will not be implemented by  either the sponsor or the 
investigator without agreement by  both parties.  However, the investigator or the sponsor may  
implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) 
to the trial subjects without prior IEC/IRB/sponsor approval/favorable opinion.  As soon as 
possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the proposed protocol amendment should be submitted to the IEC/IRB/head of medical institution/sponsor.  Any  deviations from the protocol must be explained and documented by  
the investigator.
Details on discontinuation of the entire stud y or parts thereof can be found in Section 12.
Subject information and consent 13.4
All relevant information on the study  will be summarized in an integrated subject information 
sheet and informed consent form provided b y the sponsor or the study center.  A sample 
subject information and informed consent form is provided as a document separate to this 
protocol.
Based on this subject information sheet, the investigator or designee will explain all relevant 
aspects of the stud y to each subject, prior to his/he r entry  into the study  (i.e. before an y 
examinations and procedures associated with the selection for the stud y are performed or an y 
study -specific data is recorded on study -specific forms).
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the I RB/IEC has been obtained.

Each subject will be informed about the following aspects of premature withdrawal:
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study  at any  time without any  
disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision.  
The subject’s data that have been collected until the time of withdrawal will be retained 
and statisticall y analyzed in accordance with the statistical anal ysis plan. 
Subject -specific data on the basis of material obtained before withdrawal may  be 
generated after withdrawal (e.g. image reading, analy sis of biological specimen such as 
blood, urine or tissues); these data would also be retained and statisticall y analyzed in 
accordance with the statistical anal ysis plan.  The subject has the right to object to the 
generation and processing of this post- withdrawal data. The subject’s oral objection may  
be document ed in the subject’s source data.
Each subject will have ample time and opportunity  to ask questions.
Only  if the subject voluntarily  agrees to sign the informed consent form and has done s o, may  
he/she enter the study . Additionally , the investigator will p ersonally  sign and date the form.  
The subject will receive a cop y of the signed and dated form.
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator site file or, if locall y 
required, in the patient’s note/file of the medical institution.
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are 
performed, the study  record or subject´s clinical record must clearl y show that informed 
consent was obtained prior to these procedures.
1.If the subject is not c apable of providing a signature, a verbal statement of consent can 
also be given in the presence of an impartial witness (independent of the sponsor and the investigator).  This is to be documented b y a signature from the informing 
physician as well as by  a signature from the witness.
The informed consent form and any other written information provided to subjects will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may  be relevant to the 
subject’s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the 
content of the subject information and / or the written informed consent form.  The investigator will inform the subject / legal representative or proxy  consenter of changes in a 
timely  manner and will ask the subject to confirm his/her participation in the study  by signing 
the revised informed consent form.  An y revised written informed consent form and written 
information must receive the IEC/I RB`s approval / favorable opinion in advance of use.
Publication p olicy and use of data 13.5
All data and results and all intellectual propert y rights in the data and results derived from the 
study  will be the property  of the sponsor who may  utilize them in various way s, such as for 
submission to government regulatory  authori ties or disclosure to other investigators.
Regarding public disclosure of study results, the sponsor will fulfill its obligations according to all applicable laws and regulations.  The sponsor is interested in the publication of the results of every  study  it performs.  
The sponsor recognizes the right of the investigator to publish the results upon completion of the study .  However, the investigator, whilst free to utilize study  data derived from his/her 
center for scientific purposes, must obtain written consent of the sponsor on the intended

publication manuscript before its submission.  To this end, the investigator must send a draft 
of the publication manuscript to the sponsor within a time period specified in the contract.  The sponsor will review the manuscript promptly  and will discuss its content with the 
investigator to reach a mutually  agreeable final manuscript.
Compensation for health damage of subjects / insurance 13.6
The sponsor maintains clinical trial insurance coverage for this study  in accordance with the 
laws and regulations of the country  in which the study  is performed.
Confidentiality 13.7
All records identify ing the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by  the 
applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made publicly available.
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor.  Only  the subject number will be recorded 
in the CRF, and if the subject name appears on any other document (e.g. pathologist report), it must be obliterated before a copy of the document is supplied to the sponsor.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws.  As part of the informed consent process, the subjects will be informed in writing that representatives of the sponsor, IEC/I RB, or re gulatory  authorities may  inspect their medical records to verify  the 
information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws.
If the re sults of the study  are published, the subject’s identity  will remain confidential.

Modification 1: Replacement of AVIVO MPM with VitalPatch Biosensor
Description of modification to the study plan: 
Medtronic A VIVO Mobile Patient Monitoring s ystemswill be replaced b y VitalConnect 
VitalPatch biosensor s for use in this study .
Rationale for introducing the modification: Effec tive on 20-Sep- 2018, AVIVO MPM devices utilized in the study  will be discontinued by  
the manufa cturer Medtronic. T he VitalPatch biosensor manufactured b y VitalConnect will 
serve as a replacement monitoring device. As a result of this change, the monitoring period
for each device will decrease from 7 to 5 day s. Step count and skin temperature are the onl y 
additional parameters that will be collected with the VitalPatch biosensor as this data was not 
available with the AVIVO MPM patches. With the exception of these two additional 
parameters, all data collected , anal yzed and reported in the context of this study  will remain 
unaffected b y this change . The VitalPatch biosensor is USA FDA approved, CE Marked in 
EU, I SO 13485 certified and Canada CMDR registered.

Amendment 3 15.3
Amendment 3is dated 21 Feb 2020 .
15.3.1 Overview of changes to the study protocol
This amendment was issued to open the recruitment of the study  to additional patients, 
especiall y patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) who show up in an unplanned outpatient 
visit but need no hospitalization ,and to generally facilitate the conduct of the study  at the 
sites.
Modi fication 1: Extension of the study population
Description of modification to the study plan: 
In-and e xclusion criteria were modified to allow participation of a wider range of patients 
with heart failure . 
Rationale for introducing the modification: Ambulatory , stable patients were added to the study  population to also gain further insights 
into this group, in comparison to the hospitalized patients with worsening heart failure. The 
data generated is meant to be used as reference for future clinical d evelopment projects across 
various different heart failure subpopulations, to cover the complete clinical spectrum and 
various characteristics of the patient journey .
In addition, entry  criteria were adjusted to match the situation of the subjects in scope .
Specificall y, the exclusion criterion for hemoglobin was changed from <10.0 g/dL to 
<8.0 g/dL . Low hemoglobin values are commonly  observed due to dilution of the blood from 
excess fluid. Through application of standard diuretic therap y, it is expected that hemoglobin 
levels will quickly  recover, and hemoglobin will not have an impact on exercise capacity .
List of all CSP sections affected by this modification: Sections 2, 5, 6.1, 6.2.
Modification 2: Simplification of number and timing of study- related p rocedures
Description of modification to the study plan: 
The number of timing of the following measurements was aligned and - in some cases -
reduced : physical exam, echocardiograph y,blood samples for biomarkers, vital patch 
application .
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
19167
21 Feb 2020 Version. 4.0 Page:  83of 108
Rationale for introducing the modification: 
Following the exchange of the AVIVO patch versus the VitalPatch in amendment 2 and 
limitations provided by  the new device , adapt ions of the timing of the planned measurements 
became necessary  to facilitate the c onduct of the study . In addition, the study  team revisited 
procedures with limited value for the envisaged study  objectives and optimized workflows for 
enhanced feasibility .
List of all CSP sections affected by this modification: Sections 2, 4, 5, 9.1, 9.2, 9.6.3, 9.7.1.
15.3.2 Changes to the protocol text
In this section on changes to the protocol text, all protocol sections affected by  the respective 
amendment are detailed; the sequence of the sections follows the structure of the most recent 
previous protocol version.
As applicable, changes to the protocol text are highlighted as follows:
Editing of an existing portion Comparative presentation of “old text” versus “new 
text”, with “old text” referring to the most recent previous protocol version. Deletions are crossed out in 
the “old text”. Additions are underlined in the “new 
text”.
Tables / figures / sections The term “amended” is added to the caption /heading .
Corrections of t ypos or omissions are not highlighted.
Section 2 Extension of study population and simplification of study 15.3.2.1
procedures
This section was changed as a result of Modi fication 1 and 2 (tissue impedance was provided 
by the AVIVO patch but is not measured by the VitalPatch any more) .

Study objective(s) The study aims to explore two mar keted devices providing a multi -marker 
monitoring including physical activity under real -life conditions in patients 
with HFpEF and HFrEF. It aims to identify potential newendpoints for future 
HFpEF trials by exploring clinically relevant changes over time and 
correlations/associations with conventional endpoints such as the six minute 
walking distance  (6MWD), biomarkers and clinical events.

21 Feb 2020 Version. 4.0 Page:  103of 108
Physical examination
A general phy sical examination as routine at the center will be performed at time points given 
in Table 1. Abnormal physical examination findings are recorded either as medical history  or 
as adverse events (see Section 9.6.1.1).
In the event of implau sible results, the laboratory  may  measure additional parameters to 
assess the quality  of the sample (e.g. clotted or hemoly zed) and to verify  the results.  The 
results from such additional anal yses may  neither be included in the clinical database of this 
study nor evaluated further.  If the results are relevant, the investigator will be informed to 
determine follow -up activities outside of this protocol.

Physical examination
A general phy sical examination as routine at the center will not need to be performed, but a 
targeted exam might be triggered b y symptoms. Abnormal phy sical examination findings are 
recorded either as medical history  or as adverse events (see Section 9.6.1.1).
Laboratory evaluations
In the event of implausible results, the laboratory  may  measure additional parameters to 
assess the quality  of the sample (e.g. clotted or hemoly zed) and to verify  the results.  The 
results from such additional anal yses may  neither be included in the clinical database of this 
study  nor evaluated further.  If the results are relevant, the investigator will be informed to 
determine follow -up activities outside of this protocol.
Healthcare Resource U tilization 
The use of Healthcare Resources in conjunction with AEs, in particular due to HF, needs to be 
documented, for example with regard to the time points or periods affected (e.g. 
hospitalizations for HF, urgent visits for HF to an emergency department or outpatient 
facility ).

Daily Patient -Reported Outcome Diary Items for REALIsM -HF Study
Objectives
Develop patient- reported outcome (PRO) items that can be administered as a daily  
diary  in the REALIsM- HF pilot study
Provide a brief high -level outline of how the PRO items can be used to: 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

21 Feb 2020 Version. 4.0 Page:  105of 108
oValidate activity  monitoring data from wearable devices ( VitalPatch 
biosensor42and Dy naPort Move Monitor)
oMeasure s ymptom severity
oFacilitate the calculation of responder definitions/MI Ds for activity  and 
symptom data
We hy pothesized that “subjective” items generated from patient experiences (PRO, 
QoL) in combination with an (objective) activity  monitor would capture all relevant 
dimensions of exercise capacit y in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF a nd thus can be 
used as pa tient centric approach in clinical studies.
INSTRUCTIONS: We would like to know about your ph ysical activities and heart failure 
symptoms in the past 24 hours. Phy sical activities are all activities that require “movement of 
your body ,” such as walking, housework, and lifting objects. Please complete this 
questionnaire in the evening before going to bed. Please select the response that best applies 
to your ph ysical activities and sy mptoms in the past 24 hours.
24 hour interval captures nighttime sy mptoms, such as orthopnea and PND
Shorter instructions are ideal for daily  assessment
Need to develop a training module for use in hospital

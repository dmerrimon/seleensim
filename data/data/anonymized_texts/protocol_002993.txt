OVERALL RATIONALE FO R PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 04
Three recent studi es from the bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab devel opment program, Study 
CA045 -001/17 -214-08, a Phase 3 study  in metastati c melano ma, Study  17-214-09/PIVOT -09, a 
Phase 3 study in metastatic renal cell carcino ma,and Study 18-214-10/PIVOT -10,a Phase 2 study 
in cisplat in ineligible metastatic urothelial  carcino ma have demonstrated that there was no 
additional benefit of combinin g bempegaldesleukin with nivolumab. On 14-Apr-2022, Nektar 
Therapeut ics and Bristol-Myer sSquibb (BMS )announced a joint decisio n to end the clinica l 
development program for bempegaldesleukin in combinat ion with nivolumab. Per Protoco l 
Amendment 04, partic ipants who are currently receiving bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab in 
Arm A of CA045009 are required to discont inue bempegaldesleukin and may continue to receive 
nivolumab monotherapy. The purpose of this amendment is to allow participants who are derivin g 
benefit to continue on study  treatment while minimizing participant burden. 
Allnew enro llment to CA045009 has been stopped ,and study procedures that no longer apply due 
to the discont inuat ion of bempegaldesleukin are indicated throughout the protocol and are 
specified below.
Minor formatting and typographi cal correcti ons have been made; therefore, they have not been 
summarized.
This protocol amendment applies to all part icipants.

BMS -986321 bempegaldesleukin (NKTR -214)
1 SYNOPSIS
A Phase 3, Rando mized, Study of Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Nivo lumab Plus Bempegaldesleukin 
(NKTR -214), Versus Nivolumab Alone Versus Standard of Care in Parti cipants with Muscle -
Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) Who Are Cisplatin Ineligible
Study Phase: Phase 3
Rationale:
On 14-April -2022, Nektar Therapeutics and BMS jointly decided to end the global clinical 
development program for bempegaldesleukin in combination with nivolumab .All new 
enrollment to CA045009 has been stopped. Per Protocol Amendm ent 04, participants who 
are currently receiving bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab are required to discontinue 
bempegaldesleukin and may continue to receive nivolumab monotherapy.
The study  of neoadj uvant nivolumab and bempegal desleukin followed by continued adjuvant 
nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin after radical cystectomy  (RC), aims to demonstrate that 
perisurgical treatm ent with nivolumab combined with bempegaldesleukin will significant ly 
increase the rate of pathol ogic com plete response (pCR)and prolong event -free survival ( EFS)in 
cisplatin -ineligible participants with high-risk urothelial carcino ma (UC) of the bladder , including 
MIBC who undergo RC.
Study Population:
Male or female partici pants, aged 18 years or local age of majority, inclusive, with previously 
untreated high-risk UC , including MIBC ,who are candidates for RC and cisplat in-ineligible.
Key Eligibility Criteria : *No longer applicable as all new enrollment has stopped.
Inclusion
Parti cipants wi th UCof the bladder clinical stage T2 -T4a, N0 (<15mm in short axis on CT or 
MRI), M0or T1-T4aN1 (≥ 15 mm in short axis on computed tomography  [CT]ormagnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI ]), M0, diagnosed at transurethral resecti on of bladder tumor (TURBT )
within 12 weeks of randomizat ion. Variant histology  is acceptable if there is a predominant 
urothelial co mponent .
Note: Stained slides from the initial TURBT used to make the UCof the bladder /MIBC 
diagnosis and associated pathology report must be submitted to the vendor for c onfirmation of 
UCof the bladder /MIBC prior to rando mizat ion.
Parti cipant must be deem ed eligible for RC by his/her urologist, and must agree to undergo 
RC. For arms A and B, participants must agree to undergo RC after complet ion of neoadjuvant 
therapy .
Docum entati on of programmed cell death ligand -1 (PD-L1)status by immunohistochemistr y 
(IHC) performed by the central  laboratory during the screening period; the tumor should be 
classified as PD-L1 1% or PD-L1 <1% as determined by a central  laboratory  during the 
screening period and the resul ts must be submi tted to interactive response techno logy (IRT)

prior to randomization. Indeterminate participants are allowed in the study . Either a formalin-
fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE )tissue block or 20unstained tumor tissue sections with an 
associ ated pathol ogy report, must be submi tted for 
  
evaluation prior to 
rando mizat ion. The bladder tumor sample submi tted shoul d be from the initial TURBT 
(obtained within 12 weeks of rando mizat ion) in which the UC of the bladder /MIBC di agnosis 
was made. Submitted tissue sample must not bepreviously irradiated and systemic therapy 
must not be given after samples are obtained prior to enrollment .
Note: If despite best efforts, a minimum of 20 unstained slides is not o btainable, submissi on 
of fewer slides may be acceptable in some circum stances following discussio n with the 
Medical Monitor.
A documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 45% within 60 days prior to 
rando mizat ion, using standard echocardiogram o r mult igated acqui sition (MUGA) scan test
Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1
Cisplat in-ineligible participants will be defined by any one of the fo llowing criteria:
Impaired renal  function (glomerular filtrat ion rate [GFR] 30 but < 60 mL/min)
GFR shoul d be assessed by direct measurement (ie, creatinine clearance) or, if not 
available, by calculat ion from serum /plasma creat inine (Cockcroft -Gault formula)
Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) versio n 5, Grade 2 hearing 
loss (assessed per local standard of care [SOC] )
CTCAE versio n 5, Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy
Exclusion
Clinical evidence o f ≥ N2 or m etastati c bladder cancer
Prior sy stemic therapy , radi ation therapy , or surgery  for bladder cancer oth er than TURBT or 
biopsies is not permitted. Prior Bacillus Calmette -Guerin (BCG )or other intravesicular
treatm ent of  non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is permitted if completed at least 
6weeks prior to init iating study treatment
Evidence of UC i n upper urinary  tracts (ureters or renal pelv is) or hi story  of previ ous MIBC
Objectives and Endpoints:
Per Protocol Amendment 04, the secondary   object ives except for safet y 
  parameters are no longer applicable. 
  
  
Per Protocol Amen dment 04, Nektar Therapeutics and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS )are 
terminating the development of bempegaldesleukin in combinat ion with nivo lumab. The efficacy 
endpo ints of pCR, EFS by invest igator assessment and overall survival (OS ),as well as safet y and 
tolerabilit y for each treatm ent arm,will be summarized descript ively in all randomized 
participants. Details will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .

3 INTRODUCTION
CA045009 is a Phase 3, randomized study  of neoadj uvant nivolumab plus NKTR -214 
(bempegaldesleukin )or nivolumab alone followed by radical cystectomy (RC) and further post-
surgery  immuno -oncol ogy (IO)therapy , versus standard of care ( SOC )treatm ent with RCalone
in participants with previously untreated high-risk urothelial carcino ma (UC) of the bladder , 
including muscle -invasive bladder cancer (MIBC )who are candidates for RC and arecisplatin-
ineligible.
About 20%- 25% of patientsdiagnosed with UCof the bladder present with MIBC , defined as 
stage T2 -T4a, N0 , M0, or prognostic stage II or III Aper the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) staging manual.1Primary tumor assessment includes mult iple factors and examinat ions to 
properly stage a pat ient’s cancer. The tumor, node, and metastasis ( TNM )categories are assigned 
by using the info rmation and wit h that ,the prognostic stage groups are assigned for these cancers. 
For UC, regional lymph node staging is of significant prognosti c importance given the negat ive 
impact on recurrence after treatm ent and long-term survival. Clinical staging of regional lymph 
node invo lvement by imaging often is inaccurate an ddoes not nece ssarily provide information on 
theextent of disease within the nodes.
The 8th edition of the AJCC staging manual, included changes to the staging of urinary  bladder 
carcino ma, including the AJCC prognosti cstage groups, stage s III and IV disease (stage III into 
stage IIIA and stage IIIB; stage IV into stage IVA and stage IVB) .1Notably, the new staging 
system  groups T1-T4aN1 M0 within stage IIIA and similar prognosti c category  as the T3-
T4aN0 M0. And based on the new staging, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidelines includes the T1 -T4aN1 M0within the same treatm ent as the T3 -T4aN0 M0in the sam e 
prognosti c category .2
For patients who are ineligible to receive cisplat in-based chemotherapy, the primary treatment for 
these patients is RC, without any  neoadj uvant therapy . Although this can be curative for some, up 
to 50% of patients ultimately develop recurrent, metastatic disease.
This Phase 3 study  in the neoadj uvant and adjuvant treatm ent of participants with clinical stage 
T2-T4aN0M0 or T1-T4aN1M0 UC of the bladder ineligible for cisplatinwill allow for direct 
comparison of nivolumab plus bempegaldesleukin versus SOC treatm ent withRCalone. The study 
is designed wi th ananalysis of the rate of pathol ogic complete response (pCR ) and will continue 
follow-up for an analysis of event free survival ( EFS).
Per Protocol Amendment 04, participants who are currently receiving bempegaldesleukin 
plus nivolumab are required to discontinue bempegaldesle ukin and may continue to receive 
nivolumab monotherapy.  
3.1 Study Rationale
The study  of neoadj uvant nivolumab and bempegal desleukin followed by continued adjuvant 
nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin after RC, aims to dem onstrate that perisurgical treatm ent wi th 
nivolumab combined with bempegaldesleukin will significant ly increase the rate of pCR and

who undergo RC.
3.1.1 Research Hypothesis
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. 
The combinat ion of nivo lumab and bempegaldesleukin as neoadj uvant and adjuvant therapy  will
significant lyincrease the pCRand prolong EFS following RCin participants with high-risk UC, 
including MIBC who are ineligible for cisplat in therapy .
3.2 Background
3.2.1 Epidemiology/Indication
Urothelial cancer of the bladder is the ninth most commo n cancer in the world3and the fift h most
commo n malignancy in the United States.4In 2020 , an estimated 81,400 patients were newly 
diagnosed with bladder cancer in the United States and approximately 17,980 patients will 
succumb to the disease.5Bladder cancer is more commo n in men with nearly a 3:1 incidence.
Nonm uscle -invasive tumors account for 75 %–85% of bladde r neopl asms ,whereas the remaining 
15%to 25% are muscle-invasive or metastati c tumors at the time of initial presentati on.6Once 
invasive into the m uscularis propri a, urothelial  cancer of  the bladder is an aggressive di sease that 
requi res multimodal treatment with surgery  or radiat ion therapy  with or without chemotherapy. 
Despite multimodalit y treatm ent, more than 50% of patients will devel op metastatic disease. 
Median survival of pat ients with metastati c urothelial cancer of the bladder is 12 to 14 m onths .7
Management of UCof the Bladder ,Including MIBC
Patients with UCof the bladder , including clinical stage T2-T4aN0 M0, and clinical stage T1-
T4aN1M0 , are at a hig h risk for develop ing metastati c disease, even after receiving SOC treatm ent 
RC.8,9,10For pati ents wi th MIBC who are eligible to receive cisplatin -based chem otherapy , level 
1 evidence demo nstrates a significant increase in overall  survival ( OS)with the use of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. The SWOG 8710 Phase 3 study , which compared neoadj uvant MVAC 
(methotrexate, vinblast ine, doxorubicin, cisplatin) plus RC to RC alone, showed a 66% increased 
risk of death from bladder cancer ( hazard ratio [ HR] = 1 .66; 95% confidence interval [ CI] =1.22-
2.45) and a 33% increased risk of death fro m all causes (HR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.00-1.76) inpatients 
who received RC alone compared to combinat ion treatm ent.11A meta-analysis of 3005 patients 
found a 5% absolute impr ovement in OS at 5 years (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 -0.95, P = 0.003) and 
a 9% abso lute disease free survival ( DFS)improvement at 5 y ears (HR = 0.78 95% CI 0.71 -0.86, 
P < 0.0001) in the chemotherapy group.12The combinat ion of gemci tabine and cisplat in (GC) is
considered an acceptable communit y standard as neoadjuvant therapy based on large retrospective 
analyses demo nstrating similar pCR rates compared to MVAC.13,14
The OS benefit from neoadj uvant chemotherapy is closely associ ated with achieving a 
pCR.11,15,16,17,18The pCR rate associ ated wi th 3to 4 cycles of approved chemotherapy  regimens

(GC or MVAC) is 25 to 30%.17,18Patients who attain a pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have 
5-year EFS and OS rates of greater than 80%.11,19
However in clinical pract ice, cisplat in-ineligible patients account for 40% to 50% of the total 
popul ation with MIBC. Pati ents with MIBC who are ineligible for cisplat in-based chem otherapy 
due to poor renal funct ion (usually defined as a creatinine clearance o f < 60 m L/minute), advanced 
age, hearing loss, peripheral neuropa thy, or poor performance status represent a populat ion with a 
high unmet medical need because there is currently no recommended neoadj uvant therapy  (or 
adjuvant therapy ) for this group. SOC therapy  is to proceed direct ly to RC, which is associ ated 
with a 50% recurrence rate at 2 years. The majorit yof patien ts will die fro m metastatic UCwithin 
1 year.8
Equally ,there are no definit ive randomized trials that demonstrate unequivocal support for the use 
of adjuvant chemotherapy for MIB C in patients who are cisplat in-ineligible. However, meta-
analyses and retrospective studies for patients that were able to receive cisplat in chemotherapy 
suggest there may be a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after cystectomy  in select 
patients .10,20,21A meta -analysis of avail able studies published in 2005 showed a HRfor survival 
of 0.75 for adjuvant chemotherapy (95% CI=0.60–0.96); however, this meta-analysis included 
only 491 patientsfrom 6trials and was thus underpowered .21,22Since then, several  larger 
rando mized trials have been performed, but results of individual studies have been conflict ing. An 
updated meta -analysis in 2014 found a sim ilar benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR = 0.77, 95% 
CI = 0.59-0.99) in pooled data from 9clinical trials .22,23The majo rity of these trials included 
patients with high -risk disease defined as extravesical extensio n and/or posit ive lymph nodes.
A Spanish Onco logy Genitourinary  Group (SOGUG) 99/01 stu dy enrolled high -risk patients with 
MIBC after cy stectomy  and rando mized them to 4 cycles of paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplat in 
(PGC) or observat ion. This study  suffered from  poor recrui tment, and 142 patients were enrolled. 
However, those who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a significant ly improved 5 -year surviva l 
compared to those who did not (60% vs 31 %,P < 0.0009 ).22,24

Recent ly at the America nSociety of Clinical  Oncology Genitourinary  (ASCO GU) Cancers 
Symposi um2021, data from the largest adjuvant trial to date was presented for CheckMate-274
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a Phase 3, rando mized, doubl e-blind study , com paring nivolumab and placebo 
in a 1:1 randomized fashion amo ng participants with high -risk m uscle -invasive UC(with primar y 
tumor sites including bladder, ureter, or renal pelvis) after radical surgery . 
In total , 709 participant swere randomized to the foll owing:
353participants to nivo lumab 240 m g every  2 weeks 
356 participants to placebo
All participants had to have underwent radical surgery (cystectomy or nephroureterectomy) wit hin 
120 days of randomizat ion and rec eived adjuvant therapy for up to 1 y ear. The primary  endpoints 
of the trial were DFS in all rando mized participants (ie,the intention-to-treat [ITT] populat ion) 
and in the subset of participants whose tumors express PD-L1 ≥ 1%. Key secondary  endpoints 
included OS, non -urothelial tract recurrence -free survival ,and disease -specific survival.
Over a median follow-up of approximately 20 months, median DFS was significant ly longer for 
participants receiving nivolumab (21 months) co mpared to pl acebo (11 m onths; HR = 0.70, 95% 
CI=0.54-0.89). The improvement in DFS was generally consistent across subgroups. 
Addit ionally , non-urothelial tract recurrence -free survival and distant metastasis -free survival 
were improved with the administ ration of nivo lumab in both the ITT and PD -L1 ≥1% populat ions. 
The safety  profile of nivolumab was consistent with previously reported studies in participants 
with solid tumors. Treatment -related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 77.5% of participants 
who received nivolumab vs 55.5% of participants who received placebo, while Grade 3 or 4 
TRAEs were observed in 17.9% vs 7.2% of participants , respectively.26
Since there is current lyno neoadj uvant or adj uvant SOC for pati ents who are eligible for RC, but
not eligible forcisplat in-based chemotherapy, defining an unmet medical need, novel therapies are 
needed to increase the number of patients who qualify to receive neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy 
and subsequent ly achieve a pCR and improved EFS. Data from 2 ongoing clinical studies 
demonstrate the safety  and potenti al activi ty of programmed cell death protein -1 (PD-1)inhibitors 
as neoadj uvant therapy  for MIBC.27,28A Phase 2 Study  invest igating the safety  and efficacy of 
neoadj uvant atezolizumab in muscle invasive bladder cancer (ABACUS) enrolled cisplat in-
ineligible patients with operable bladder cancer. After receiving only 2  cycles of neoadj uvant 
atezolizumab, pCR occurred in 31% (95% CI= 21 %-41 %) (37% [95% CI= 21%-55 %] of 
programmed death ligand 1 [ PD-L1]–positive patients and 24% [95% CI= 13%-39 %] of PD-L1–
negat ive patients).27TRAEs were relatively infrequent and study  medicat ion was well tolerated. 
In an ongoing Phase 2, open -label study of neoadj uvant pembrolizumab before RCfor MIBC, 
regard less of cisplat in eligibilit y, neoadj uvant treatm ent with a PD-L1 agent was also well

3.2.2 Nivolumab
3.2.2.1 Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherapy  rests on the premise that tum ors can be recognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effect ively attacked by an activated immune system . An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely  on immune surveillance of tum or anti gens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately resul ts in an adapt ive immune response and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisit ion of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effect ive innate and adapt ive immune responses .29,30,31
Current immunotherapy  efforts attem pt to break the apparent tol erance of the immune system  to 
tumor cells and antigens by either introducing cancer antigens by therapeut ic vaccinat ion or by 
modulat ing regulatory checkpo ints of the immune system. T -cell st imulat ion is a co mplex process 
involving the integrati on of numerous posit ive andnegative co-stimulatory  signals in addition to 
antigen recogni tion by the T-cell receptor (TCR ).32Collect ively, these signals govern the balance 
between T -cell act ivation and tolerance. 
PD-1 is a member of the CD -28 family of T-cell co-stimulatory  receptors that also includes CD-28, 
CTLA4, ICOS, and B and T lymphocy te associ ated (BTLA ).33PD-1 signaling has been shown to 
inhibit CD-28-mediated upregulat ion of IL-2, IL -10, IL -13, IFN-γ,and Bcl-xL. PD-1 expressio n 
also been noted to inhibit T-cell activation, and the expansio n of previously activated cells. 
Evidence for a negative regulatory role of PD -1 comes fro m studies of PD -1 deficient mice, which 
develop a variet y of autoim mune phenoty pes.34These resul ts suggest that PD -1 blockade has the 
potenti al to activate anti-self T-cell responses, but these responses are variable and dependent upon 
various host genetic factors. Thus, PD -1 deficiency or inhibit ion is not accompanied by a universa l 
loss of tolerance to self -antigens.
In vitro, nivol umab (BMS -936558) binds to PD -1 with high affini ty (EC50 = 0.39-2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to itsligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC50 = ± 1 nM). Nivo lumab binds 
specifically to PD-1 and not to related members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA -4,
and BTLA. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway by nivol umab resul ts in a reproducible enhancement  
of both proliferat ion and IFN-γ release in the mixed lymphocy te reacti on(MLR) . Using a 
cytomegalo virus (CMV )re-stimulat ion assay with human peripheral  blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC ), the effect of nivolumab on antigen-specific recall response indicates that nivolumab 
augm ented IFN-γ secretion from CMV specific memory  T-cells in a dose-dependent manner 
versus isotype-matched control . In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine analog of nivoluma b 
enhances the anti-tumor immune response and resul t in tumor reject ion in several 
immunocom petent m ouse tum or models (MC38, SA1/NPAN02).35

3.2.2.2 Clinical Experience wit h Nivolumab
Nivo lumab has demonstrated durable responses exceeding 6 months as monotherapy  in several 
tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC ), melano ma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC ), 
classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), SCLC, gastric cancer, squamous cell carcino ma o f the head 
and neck (SCCHN ), urothelial cancer, hepatocellular carcino ma (HCC ), and colorectal  cancer 
(CRC ). Please refer to the Investigator's Brochure (IB) for addi tional details.36
Nivo lumab monotherapy  has demonstrated clinical benefit in participants with UCwho have 
progressed during or following platinum -containing chemotherapy or progressed within 12 months 
of neoadj uvant or adjuvant treatm ent with platinum -containing chem otherapy , and has been 
approve d for use in the United States and European Union .
The safet y and efficacy  of nivo lumab 3 m g/kg as a single agent for the treatm ent of  patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic UCwas evaluated in a Phase 2, multicenter , open -label, single -arm 
study (CA 209275).37The study  included patients (18 y ears or older) who had disease progression 
during or following pl atinum -containing chemotherapy  for advanced or m etastati c disease or had 
disease progressi on within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatm ent with platinum -
containing chem otherapy . Patientshad an Eastern Cooperative Onco logy Group (ECOG)
perform ance status score of 0 or 1 and were enrolled regardl ess of their tumor PD-L1 status. 
Patientswith act ive brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, active autoimmune disease, or 
medical condit ions requiring systemic immunosuppressio n were excluded fro m the study. Patients
who received more than 2 prior lines of chemotherapy  with liver metasta ses were excluded. A 
total of 270 patients who received nivo lumab 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 60 minutes 
every 2 weeks with a minimum follow-up of 8.3 months were evaluable for efficacy . Treatm ent 
was cont inued as lo ng as clinical benefit was o bserved or until treatment was no longer tolerated.
The primary efficacy outcom e measure was objective response rate (ORR )as determined by 
blinded independent central  review (BICR ). Additi onal efficacy measures included durati on of 
response (DOR) , PFS,and OS. Median age was 66 years (range: 38 to 90years ) with 55%of 
patients aged65 years and 14% aged 75 years. The majorit y of patients were White (86%) and 
male (78%). Baseline ECOG performance score was 0 (54%) or 1 (46%). Median t ime to response 
was 1.9 m onths (range: 1.6 -7.2months). In 77 patients who received pri or sy stemic therapy  only 
in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, the ORR was 23.4% (95% CI =14.5% -34.4%).
Median treatm ent durati onwas 3.3 months (range: 0 to 13.4+ months). Forty -six percent of 
patients had a drug delay for an adverse react ion. Fourteen (5.2%) patients died from causes other 
than disease progressi on. This includes 4 (1.5%) patients who died from pneum onitis or 
cardi ovascular failure thatwas attributed to treatm ent with nivolumab . Nivo lumab was 
discontinued for adverse react ions in 17% of  patients . Seri ous adverse react ions occurred in 54% 
of patients . The most frequent serious adverse reacti ons reported in at least 2% of patients were 
urinary tract infection, sepsis, diarrhea, small intestine obstructi on, and general  physical health 
deteri oration. The most commo n adverse react ions (reported in at least 20% of patients ) were 
fatigue, musculo skeletal  pain, nausea, and decreased appetite.

3.2.3 Bempegaldesleukin
3.2.3.1 Mechanism of Action
Bempegaldesleukin is a prodrug of a conjugated cancer immunotherapy cytokine that exerts its 
biological  activit y by binding to the interleukin- 2 (IL-2)receptor and subsequent activat ion of 
effector T cells. As a PEGylat ed human reco mbinant IL -2 mo lecule of aldesleukin with an average 
of 6  r eleasable polyethylene glyco l (PEG) chains, bempegal desleukin can be administered 
convenient ly in the outpati ent setting using an antibody -like dosing regimen. The polymer 
conjugation renders the cytokine init ially inactive. Upon intravenous (IV) administration, the PEG 
chains slowly rel ease to generate the active cy tokine species ( mainly 2-PEG -IL-2 and 1 -PEG -IL-
2) that have a peak plasma con centrati on of 24 to 48 hours after infusio n. The sl ow gen eration of 
the 2-PEG -IL-2 and 1 -PEG -IL-2 significant ly mit igates the rapid -onset, sy stemic cytokine -related 
toxicities associ ated wi th high -dose IL -2. 
The polymer conjugat ion of bempegaldesleukin prom otes biased signaling through the IL-2 
receptor beta gamma (IL-2Rβγ). Specifically, the location of the bempegaldesleukin PEG chains 
interferes wi th the binding to the IL -2 alpha receptor subunit responsible for the undesirable effect  
of activat ing Tregs in the tumor while continuing to permit binding to the IL-2Rβγ (CD122) 
receptor. Upon infusio n, bempegaldesleukin preferent ially increases the proliferation, activation 
and effector funct ion of tumor anti gen-specific CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK ) cells wi thin 
the tum or microenvironment (TME) over expansio n ofunwanted intra -tumoral regul atory  T cells 
(Tregs) that are activated through the IL -2 receptor alpha beta gamma (IL -2Rαβγ).38,39Consistent 
with this mechanism of action, recent nonclinical studi es demonstrate strong synergy of 
bempegaldesleukin wit h adoptive T cell therapy (ACT), with PD- 1 checkpo int blockade, and with 
tumor anti gen-specific vaccinat ion, in a variet y of mouse m odels.40,41This synergy  was m ediated 
by expansio n of tumor -specifi c CD8+ T cells in the periphery and tumor, without strong expansio n 
of Tregs in the tumor tissue. Bempegaldesleukin also correspondingly pro motes expressio n of PD-
1 on the surface of CD8+ T cells and induction of a Type II interferon gene signature in the TME, 
driving cell surface expressio n of programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) on tum or cells.42
The immuno logical properti es of bempegaldesleukin with the induct ion of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocy tes and upregul ation of the PD-1/PD -L1 axis makes bempegaldes leukin a potenti ally 
promising combinat ion therapy  for use wi th checkpoint inhibitors that target and inhibit the PD-
1/PD -L1 pathway .Moreover, the safet y profile of bempegaldesleukin generally  does not overl ap 
with that of checkpo int inhibitors, further supporting the use of bempegaldesleukin as a potentially 
complimentary  combinat ion partner wi th checkpoint inhibitors.
3.2.4 Clinical Experience with Bempegaldesleukin
3.2.4.1 Study 15 -214-01 (EXCEL ; Bempegaldesleukin Monotherapy)
The bempegaldesleukin clinical devel opment program started with the mo notherapy  study EXCEL

safet y and tolerabili ty, and define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 
dose (RP2D) of bempegaldesleukin. 
The second part of the study  was an expansio n phase following identificat ion of the RP2D, 
designed to evaluate the safet y and tolerabilit y, as well as the efficacy of bempegaldesleukin in 
specific tumor types. Bempegaldesleukin at a dose of 0.009 mg/kg administered once every
3weeks (q3w) was deem ed the MTD by pre-defined dose-limit ing toxicity (DLT) criteria. The 
RP2D was determined to be 0.006 mg/kg q3w. Enrollment was closed after 28 patients were 
exposed to bempegaldesleuki nin the dose -escalat ion phase and the dose expansion phase was not 
initiated. 
The safet y of single -agent bempegal desleukin has been assessed in 28patients across 5dose 
cohorts administered b empegaldesleukin q3w at doses ranging from 0.003 m g/kg to 0.01 2mg/kg 
and a dosing frequency of every  2 weeks (q2w) was explored at 0.006 mg/kg. For the q3w dosing 
frequency , doses up to 0.009 mg/kg were well tolerated. One patient dosed at 0.012 mg/kg 
experienced cytokine release syndro me and the DLTs of hypotensio nand syncope ;this patient 
received 2 additional cycles of bempegaldesleukin a t a lower dose of 0.006 mg/kg and tolerated 
treatm ent well. The bempegaldesleukin dose of 0.009 mg/kg was determined to be the MTD .
As of the data cutoff date of 29-Mar-2018 , 593 treatm ent-emergent adverse events ( TRAEs) were 
reported among the 28 patients who received single -agent bempegaldesleukin . Overall, the most 
commo n TRAEs fatigue (82.1%), flu-like symptom s (consist ing of influenza -like illness, 
influenza, pyrexia, and chills, 71.4%), pruritus (67.9%), hypotensio n (64.3%), rash (also consisting 
of erythema, rash, rash erythematous, rash maculo -papul ar, rash papul ar, rash pruri tic, rash 
pustul ar, rash vesicular, rash generalized, and rash macular, 53.6%), decreased appeti te (53.6%), 
and arthralgia or cough (42.9% each).43
The most commo n AEs considered by the invest igator to be related to bempegaldesleukin were 
fatigue (71.4%), flu -like symptoms (67.9%), pruritus (64.3%), hypotension (57.1%), rash (50.0%), 
decreased appet ite (46.4%), and arthralgia or cough (32.1% each). Such TRAEs as flu-like 
symptoms, rash and pruritus were generally mild or moderate in severit y, predictable, manageable, 
and short -lived. These cytokine -related AEs generally occurred 3 to 4 days after dosing and 
corresponded to the time of peak plasma concent ration of the active cytokines. The flu-like 
symptoms were managed with acetaminophen and non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs) and the cases of rash/pruritus were either self-limit ing or treated w ith anti-histamines 
(steroi ds were administered for occasional patients who had severe rash/pruritus).
Six of 28 patients reported Grade 3 TRAEs,which included hypotensio n, abdo minal pain, 
infusio n-related reacti on, headache, and synco pe. The cases of Grade 3 hypotensi on were rapi dly 
reversed with intravenous fluids, and a hydrat ion management guideline was implemented during 
the study which mitigated the hypotension severity. One patient, who had a prior history  of an 
infusio n react ion to a previously administered immunotherapy , discontinued treatm ent due to an 
infusio n-related reacti on following the first dose of bempegal desleukin 0.009 mg/kg .With the 
exception of one event of hypothy roidism , no other immune mediated AEs consistent with

checkpoint inhibitors were reported. No patient experi enced capillary  leak syndro meand no 
Grade 4TRAEs or treatm ent-related deaths were reported on the study.
Fifteen patients (53.6%) reported 31 SAEs in monotherapy  Study 15-214-01. Eleven SAEs 
reported among 7(25.0%) patients were considered related to treatm ent. The only 
treatm ent-related SAE reported for more than 1 patient was hypotension (5 patients , 17.9%, 4 of 
5 were Gra de 3 in severit y). 
In the 28 patients evaluable for efficacy in Study 15 -214-01, best overall response included stable 
disease (SD) in 14 patients (50%), progressive disease (PD) in 12 patients (42.9%), and not 
evaluable (NE) for 2patients (7.1%). While no object ive responses were observed in Study  15-
214-01, 9patients experienced tumor shrinkage between 1% and 30% and two patients , after 
progressing on multiple prior th erapi es, had durable stable disease over 1 year. One patient wit h 
metastati c melano ma, who was previously treated with ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor, received 
25 cycles of bempegaldesleukin and had durable stabl e disease for 18 months. A second patient
with metastati c renal cell carcino ma (RCC) , who had progressed on high-dose IL-2 and was 
refractory  to single -agent OX40 (ie, an antibody targeting the tumor necrosis factor receptor 
superfamily  member 4) and nivo lumab, was treated with 19 cycles of bempegaldesleukin and had 
durable stable disease for 14 months. Given the biological properti es of bempegaldesleukin and 
nivolumab these observat ions further supported the rationale for combining these two agents.
In Study  15-214-01, hypotension was ident ified as a principal toxicity. Hypotensi on is a known 
AE associated with both IL -2 and engineered cytokines. Instances of hypotension most commonly 
appeared 2-4 days following the infusio n of bempegaldesleukin. Participants for whom 
intravenous (IV) fluid administration was clinically  indicated responded rapidly (in less than 
24hours) to IV hydration. To mitigate the risk of hypotensio n, management guidelines were 
implemented during the conduct of the study .
3.2.4.2 Study 16 -214-02 (PIVOT -02; Bempegaldesleukin and Nivolumab 
Combination T herapy)
The PIVOT -02 trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open -label, multicenter, dose 
escalat ion,and dose expansio n study  of bempegaldesleukin in combinat ion with nivolumab and 
other anti-cancer therapi es in patients with locally  advanc ed or metastatic solid tumors. Part 1 of 
the study  was a dose escalati on phase to eval uate the safet y and tol erabili ty, and define the MTD 
or RP2D of bempegaldesleukin in combinat ion with nivolumab. Following determinat ion of the 
RP2D (0.006 mg/kg bempegal desleukin q3w plus 360 mg nivolumab q3w), Part 2 of the study  is 
evaluat ing the safet y and tolerabilit y as well as the efficacy of the combinat ion by assessing the 
objective response rate (ORR) at the RP2D. The indicat ions studi ed in Part 2 include melano ma, 
RCC, non-small  cell lung cancer(NSCLC), UC, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal  carcino ma 
(CRC ), and small cel l lung cancer (SCLC). Parts 3 and 4 are schedule -finding and dose expansio n

The bempegaldesleukin + nivolumab dose escalatio n porti on of PIVOT -02 has been completed, 
with the safet y resul ts of bempegaldesleukin at 0.006 mg/kg in combinat ion with nivolumab 
360mg every  3 weeks indicat ing no DLTs and no Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs at the time of completion. 
Bempegaldesleukin 0.006 mg/kg in combinat ion with nivolumab 360 mg every 3weeks was the 
recommended dose regimen to be taken forwar d into expansio n cohorts in Part 2.
As of 28-Oct-2020 , a total of 557 patients had been treated with bempegaldesleukin in combinat ion 
with nivo lumab (503 pati ents wi th doubl et [bem pegal desleukin and nivolumab]; 43 patients wi th 
triplet [bempegaldesleukin, nivolumab, and ipilimumab]; and 11patients with doublet 
[bempegaldesleukin and nivo lumab] plus other anti -cancer study  drug). Of the 557 patients, m ost 
have NSCLC (184 patients [33%]), RCC (139 [25%]), or melanoma (102 [18%]), followed by UC
(61 [11%]), breast cancer (47 [8%]), and CRC (22 [4%]), and gastri c cancer (2 [<1%]). The 
median durat ion of exposure was 106.0 days (doublet, 101.0; triplet, 179.0; doubl et plus other anti-
cancer drug, 113.0) (range: 1 to 817 day s). 
As of 28-Oct-2020 , among the 503 patients who received the doublet:
94.6% (476 of 503) of patients reported TRAEs; the most frequent were fatigue (47.1%), 
pyrexia (44.7%), pruritus (36.0%), nausea (31.4%), influenza -like illness (26.8%), decreased 
appeti te (26.6%), rash (26.0% ), and chill s (25.8%).
24.9% (125 of  503) of  patients reported treatm ent-related, Grade ≥ 3 AEs; the most frequent  
(> 2%) were syncope (2.8%), hypotensio n (2.6%), and lipase increased (2.2%) .
16.3% (82 of 503) of pat ients reported treatment -related SAEs; the most frequent were pyrexia 
(3.0%), hy potensi on (2.0%), and pneumonit is (1.0%).
Therefore, the generally non-overl apping toxicities observed with nivolumab and 
bempegaldesleukin are expected to result in a reasonably well -tolerated IO combinat ion therapy .
Serious events of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) have been observed in patients who have 
received bempegaldesleukin in the triplet combinatio n with nivo lumab and ipilimumab and in the 
doubl et combinat ion with nivolumab. A total of 3 of 43 patients (7.0%) who received 
bempegaldesleukin , nivolumab ,and ipilimumab (triplet immunotherapy) and 8 of 478 patients 
(1.7%) who received bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab (doubl et immunotherapy ) in Study 
16-214-02 were determined to have CVA events that were confirmed by the independent  
neuro logy consul tants. No confirmed CVA events occurred in any  patients in any other studies of 
bempegaldesleukin . The incidence of CVA, combining all clinical trials in which the doublet of 
bempegaldesleukin plus nivo lumab was administered was 8 out of 593 patients (1.3% or 3.52 per 
100 person -years [P-Y] ). By comparison, incidence rates of ischemic CVA among patients treated 
with nivo lumab mo notherapy  was 1.4 per 100 (P -Y). Rates of CVA in metastatic cancer patients , 
based on Pharmetri cs and MarketScan data, are 4.17 and 5.35 per 100 P-Y, respectively. The 
incidence rate in the patients receiving doublet immunotherapy  is likely  within the incidence rate 
of CVA in patients with advanced malignancies. The relat ionship of these events to the trip let and 
doubl et combinat ions is unclear. As more information is needed to better understand and 
characterize these events, CVA events will be monitored as adverse events of special interest,

cells express low levels of PD -L1. A total  of 192 pati ents were enro lled and patients were treated 
until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent for up to 24 months. A 
final ORR analysis assessed by BICR showed that bempegaldesleukin in combination with 
nivolumab did not reach an efficacy thresho ld to support continuing the program  in urothelial

3.2.4.4 Pooled Safety Analysis of Participants with Bempegaldesleukin and 
Nivolumab Exposure
A pooled safety  analysis (28-Oct-2020 data cutoff) is available of partici pants who received the 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab doublet from the ongoing combinat ion Phase 1/2 studies 
(16214 -02 and 16-214-05), the ongoing combinat ion Phase 2 study (18-214-10), and the 
completed Phase 1 study  in Japan (CA045010). Of the 696 participants who received the 
bempegaldesleukin and nivo lumab doublet:
93.0% (647 of 696) of participants reported TRAEs; the mo st frequent were py rexia (42.1%), 
fatigue (39.9%), prurit is (37.6%), nausea (27.9%), rash (24.6%), decrease appeti te (23.7%), 
influenza -like illness (22.4%), and chills (22.1%). 
24.6% (171 of 696) of participants reported treatm ent-related, Grade ≥ 3 AEs; the most 
frequent were hypotension (2.6%), fatigue (2.0%), arthralgia (1.1%), diarrhea (0.9%), and 
pyrexia (1.1%).
15.8% (110 of 696) of participants reported treatment -related SAEs; the most frequent were 
pyrexia (2.6%), hypotension (1.7%), dehydrat ion (0.9%), pneumonit is (0.7%), acute kidney 
injury , atrial fibrillat ion, my ocardi tis (0.6% each).
3.2.4.5 Observed Events of Cerebrovascular Accident
3.2.4.5.1 Initial Analysis of Cerebrovascular Accident Events in PIVOT -02 (16-214-02) Study
Serious events of CVA , including one fatal event, have been observed in participants who have 
received bempegaldesleukin in the triplet combinatio n with nivo lumab and ipilimumab ,and in the 
combinat ion of bempegaldesleukin, nivo lumab, and other anti -cancer therapy . As of 28-Oct-2019 , 
3 of 43 participants (7.0%) who received triplet therapy in Study  16-214-02 (PIVOT -02) were 
reported to have CVA events, including one fatal event, all of which were considered by the 
investigator to be related to treatment with bempegaldesleukin , nivolumab, and ipilimumab. 
Addit ionally , 9of 488 participants (1.8%) who received doublet therapy  (bempegaldesleukin and 
nivolumab) had 10CVA events, which were considered by the invest igator to be related to at least 
one of the study  treatments in 4 participants (3 related to the doublet therapy  and 1 related to 
nivolumab only); and one of 10 (10.0%) participants who received combined bempegaldesleukin,
nivolumab , and other anti-cancer therapy (platinum -based chemotherapy) had a CVA event, which 
was c onsidered by the Investigator to be unrelated to study  treatm ent. 
Updated Analysis of CVA Events Observed with Bempegaldesleukin
A cumulative search of the bempegaldesleukin global safety database was conducted on 28-Oct-
2020 , which included 1 ,345 partici pants who received bempegaldesleukin in triplet combinat ions 
with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or with nivolumab plus NKTR -262 (a toll -like receptor agonist 
7/8); in doublet combinat ions with checkpo int inhibitors; in a doublet combinat ion with nivo luma b

(18-214-13), CA04 5010 (18 -214- 14), SP -IND, and 17 -262-01.
Overall, 1.9% (26 of  1,345) of  participants exposed to bempegaldesleukin reported CVA events. 
Of the 26participants , 13 participants experienced Grade 3 or 4 events and 4participants had a 
fatal outcome. The mean time to first CVA event was 218.7 days (range 4 to 727 days; media n 
158 day s). Twent y of the 26 participants with CVA events received a doublet combinat ion with a 
checkpoint inhibitor, which included 1.7% (19 of 1,116) of participants who received nivo lumab, 
1.3% (1 of 76) who received pembro lizumab, and 0% (0 of 23) who received atezolizumab.
Based on these events, CVA was escalated to an AEOSI and mitigations were put in place to 
reduce the risk of CVA. These mitigations include implementation of a CVA adverse event 
management algorithm (Appendix 7) and updates to the exclusio n criteria, renal function and 
hydrat ion assessment, hydrat ion guidelines, conco mitant and prohibited medicat ions, dose 
modificati on guidelines , and discont inuat ion criteria. Addit ional information on the clinical safet y 
and risk o f CVA is found in the bempegaldesleukin Invest igator’s B rochure.
3.3 Benefit -risk Assessment
3.3.1 Bempegaldesleukin Safety Profile
Bempegal desleukin was designed to mitigate the severe toxicities associated with rapid systemic 
immune activation seen with administration of aldesleuki n. The ident ified risks of 
bempegaldesleukin include hypotension, cytokine -related toxicit ies (eg,flu-like symptoms, rash, 
pruritus, fatigue, hepatic transaminase elevat ions, and serum creatinine elevations ), infusion -related 
reactions/hypersensit ivity reactions, thyroid dysfuncti on, eosi nophilic disorder (including cases of 
hypereosinophilic syndrome), and arthralgia. The majorit y of these AEs are mild to moderate in 
severit y and can be monitored and managed in the clinical setting. The goal of engineerin g a 
PEGylated form of IL-2 that reduces the treatment -limiting toxicit ies of aldesleukin, that is, those 
necessitating in-hospi tal administration, appears to have been realized with bempegaldesleukin at 
the doses tested. 
Addit ional details on the clinical experi ence with bempegaldesleukin are provided in the 
bempegaldesleukin Invest igator’s Brochure .
3.3.2 Nivolumab Safety Profile
Extensive details on the safet y profile o f nivo lumab are available in the IBand will not be repeated 
herein.
Overall, the safet y profile of nivolumab monotherapy  is manageable and generally  consistent 
across completed and ongoing clinical trials with no MTD reached at any dose tested up to 
10mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively few related high-grade 
(Grade 3to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severit y, or causalit y of AEs with 
respect to nivo lumab dose l evel.
A pattern of immune -related AEs has been defined, for which management algorithms have been 
developed; these are provided in Appendix 6. Most high-grade events were manageable with the

are al so available in the nivo lumab IB.
3.3.3 Bempegaldesleukin and Nivolumab Benefit and Risk Asses sment
Bempegaldesleukin has been generally well-tolerated in the clinical studies to date, both as 
monotherapy  as well as in combinat ion with nivolumab, with promising evidence of clinical 
efficacy  and a potenti ally favorable benefit -risk profile. Bempegaldesleukin has been safely 
administered in an outpatient setting supported by  appropriate clinical mo nitoring.
Hypotensi on has been ident ified as a clinically significant adverse effect of bempegaldesleukin , 
and can be effect ively mitigated by prophyl axis and hydration guidelines. Other risksassoci ated 
with bempegaldesleukin include cy tokine -related toxi cities (eg, flu-like symptoms, rash, pruritus, 
fatigue, hepat ic transaminase elevat ionsand serum  creatinine elevat ion), infusio n related reacti ons, 
thyroid dysfunct ion, eosinophilic disorder , and arthralgia ; these AEs are generally mild or 
moderate in severi ty, and can be monitored and managed in clinical  setting. Cases of thyroid 
dysfunct ion (hypothy roidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroi ditis), dermat itis, pneum onitis, hepat itis, 
myocardi tis, myositis/myasthenia gravis and vitiligo/hy popigmentati on consistent with immune -
mediated mechanism have been observed in patients receiving bempegaldesleukin plus 
nivolumab; however, there is no evidence that bempegaldesleukin increases the frequency or 
severit y of immune -mediated AEs associ ated wi th nivo lumab wit h the limitat ion of small sample 
size and relat ively shorter treatment duration for bempegaldesleukin- treated patients . 
The continued devel opment of bempegaldesleukin in combinat ion with nivolumab for the 
treatm ent of  various cancers is warranted based on a posi tive benefi t-risk profile. In addi tion, the 
early efficacy  data along with the correlative biomarker showing conversio n of PD-L1 negat ive 
patients to PD-L1 posit ive patients suggests that the addition of bempegal desleukin to a checkpoint 
inhibitor (nivo lumab) may change the tumor m icroenvironment in PD-L1 negat ive patients such 
that the combinat ion may contribute to anti -tumor activit y with an acceptable safet y profile.
In conclusio n, the current ly available safet y data demonstrates that bempegal desleukin and 
nivolumab is a well-tolerated immuno -oncol ogy combinat ion therapy. Given the encouraging 
clinical activity and manageable and generally non- overlapping toxicity profile, the potenti al for 
direct benefit in patients warrants continued evaluatio n of the combinat ion bempegal desleukin and 
nivolumab in the clinical setting and support sfurther development of combinat ion of 
bempegaldesleukin and nivo lumab regimens in patients with cancer.
If a participant had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) during the trial, then the benefit and 
risk consi derati ons remain the responsib ility of the invest igator. Non-live COVID -19 vaccinatio n 
is considered a standard conco mitant medication within the study . However, the efficacy and 
safet y of non-live vaccines (including non-live COVID -19 vaccines) in participants receiving 
nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin is not fully known .

5.1.2.1 Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgical Treatme nt)Randomized Participants
Per Protocol Amendment 04, participants who are currently receiving bempegaldesleukin 
plus nivolumab in Arm A are required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and may continue 
to receive nivolumab monotherapy .
Arm A: Bempegaldesleukin 0.006 mg/kg Q3W + nivo lumab 360 mg Q3W upto 3 cycles
Arm B: Nivo lumab 360 mg Q3W upto 3 cycles
ArmC:SOC ( no therapy ), parti cipants will go to RC within 6 weeks after randomizat ion
Dose reduction will not be allowed for nivo lumab. Some participants may not receive all3cycles
of pl anned pre-surgi caltherapy (eg,toxicity,refusal toreceive further therapy ).However,
participants should receive asmuch oftheplanned pre-surgi caltherapy as possible , with a 
minimum o f at least one cycle.If one of thecomponents of the treatment is not tolerated after the 
first cy cle(s) oftherapy ,thentheothercomponent maybecontinued tocomplete 3cycles. Thus ,

5.1.2.2 Surgery (Radical Cystectomy)
Per Protocol Amendment 04, radical cystectomy will be performed per local SOC. 
Parti cipants should receive RCwithin6 weeks ofthe last neoadj uvant treatm ent administratio n
(Arm  A and Arm B) ,afterrecovery from anyimmunotherapy -related toxicit iesor within 6 weeks 
of rando mizat ion (Arm C) .
Inspecific cases, when RCdoes notoccur within6weeks of the last neoadjuvant treatm ent 
administration ,RCmay be permitted atalaterdate after consul tation wi th Medical  Moni tor.
Analysis of data from the SWOG -8710 Phase 3,randomized, neoadjuvant study forpatients 
undergo ingRCshowed thatnegative surgical margins (P=0.0007) andremoval of>10lymph
nodes (LN) (P=0.0001) were associated withlonger survival anddecreased localrecurrence.50
Positivesurgi calmargins areassoci ated withapoor prognosis, andinexperienced hands, the
positivesoft-tissue margin rate should be 5%.51Lymph node numbers vary amongpatients , 
making itdifficult tojudge thequalit yofthepelvic lymph node dissect ion(PLND) byLNnumbers
alone. Rather thePLND surgi caltemplate isthekey, and iffollowed, should yield adequate
numbers ofpelvic LNfromcriticalsitesthatdrain thebladder.52,53ForRC,thefollowing is
recommended asthesurgical SOC:
When performing RC,thesurgeon shoul dremovethebladder, prostate andseminal vesicles
inmales, andthebladder, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries andanteri orvaginal wall in females. 
All efforts shoul d be made to obtain grossly negat ivesurgical margins.54
Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, should include ataminimum theregion belowthe
bifurcation ofthecommo niliac artery ,which involves removal oftheexternal andinternal
iliac and obturator LNs (standard lymphadenectomy). Dissect ionalongthecommo niliac
artery toatleast thecrossing oftheureter, butmostcommonly theaorticbifurcation, and
sometimes the inferior mesenteric artery isrecommended when thesurgeon isexperienced in
performing this extent of surgery termed an extended lymph node dissect ion.55
If this template is fo llowed, > 10 LN should be obtained in most cases.
Pathol ogistsmust examine theRCspecimen according toSOC practices. Totheextent feasible, 
all excised lymph nodes shoul dbeident ified, processed ,and examined microscopically for the 
presence or absence ofmetastatic bladder cancer.
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04.  Pathology slides ,which includes all H&E from 
every specimen sampled from the entire RC specimen (involved and uninvolved tissue), and if 
applicable, any diagnostically relevant IHC that was used in addition to H&E (comprehensive

Priortosurgery, participants withdisease progressi onthat precludes surgery (asjudged bythe
investigator ,see Section 9.1.1.2 )must bediscontinued fromstudy treatm ent and tumor 
assessments. Participants who do not undergo RCforreasons other thandisease progression that
precludes surgery may continue on protocol -defined treatm entonce consent has been obtained.
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Participants who do not undergo RC but continue 
on study  (eg, do not have disease progression) will be surveyed for disease recurrence/progressio n 
by cystoscopy  every  12 weeks (± 7 days) for the next 2years, then every 24 weeks (± 14 days) for 
3 addit ional years, and then once per year for subsequent years.Moni toring will begin from  the

be perform ed at the time o f the first cy stoscop ic examinat ion.
5.1.2.3 Adjuvant (Post -surgical Treatment)
Per Protocol Amendment 04 , participants who are currently receiving bempegaldesleukin 
plus nivolumab in Arm A are required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and may continue 
to receive nivolumab monotherapy .
Arm A : Bempegaldesleukin 0.006 mg/kg Q3W + nivolumab 360mg Q3W for12 cycles

when allsignificant toxicitiesassociated withneoadjuvant therapy have recovered.
Parti cipants will complete 12 cycles of adjuvant therapy  except in the event of disease progression, 
death, unacceptable toxicity,symptom atic deteriorati on, investigator’s decision to discontinue 
treatm ent, the parti cipant’s decisio n to discont inue treatment or withdraw consent, the participant 
being lost to follow -up, or BMS and Nektar Therapeutics ’decisio n to terminate t he study.
5.1.3 Long -term Follow- up
Per Protocol Amendment 04, participants will be followed one final t ime for recurrence status and 
overall survival and will be discont inued fro m study.  
Long -term follow-up shoul d continue unt il withdrawal  of consent, death, or study terminat ion by 
the Sponsor .For each rando mized participant, the t otal maximum durat ion of the study is up to 62 
weeks + 100 day sofsafety follow-up.
Timing for long -term follow-up will be as fo llows:
Assessments should cont inue as described in Table 2-4
Parti cipants in Arms A andBmust be followed for safet y for at least 100 days after the last 
dose of study  treatm ent.Follow -up Visi t 1 shou ld occur 30 day s from  the last dose ( 7 day s) 
or can be performed on the date of discont inuat ion if that date is greater than 42 days from the

5.2 Number of Participants
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04 as allnew enrollment to CA045009 has been 
stopped.
It is anticipated that approximately 720 partici pants will be screened for approximately 
540participants to be randomized overall to the 3 arms in a 1:1:1 rati o, assuming a screen failure 
rate of appro ximately 25%. See Secti on 10.1 for sample size determinat ion.
5.3 End of Study Definition
The start of the trial is defined as the first visit for the first participant screened. End of trial is 
defined as the last participant’s last visit in the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2). Study co mpletion 
is defined as a maximum of12 cycles of adjuvant therapy  + 100 days safet y follow-up (Arm  A 
and Arm B) or 100 days safet y follow-up from radical cystectomy  (Arm C) from last participant 
rando mizedor earlier on sponsor decisio n.
This paragraph is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. The total duration of the study 
for the primary endpo ints will be determined by accrual events. Final analysis for the primar y 
endpo int examining pCR rate will occur approximately 47months after the date of the first 
participant randomized (approximately 4months after the end of last participant randomized ). 
Final analysis for the primary  endpoint EFS will occur approximately  65months after the date of 
the first participant to be rando mized and is also determined by accrual of events (Secti on10.3).
Addit ional follow-up for OS may be conducted up to approximately 5years after the 
rando mizat ion of the last participant.
5.4 Scientific Rationale for Stu dy Design
About 20 -25% of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer presen t with MIBC , defined as stage T2-
T4a, N0 -N1, M0 . The primary  treatm ent for these pati ents is RC, whi ch can be curati ve for some
but up to 50% ultimately devel op recurrent, metastatic disease. Neoadj uvant chemotherapy has 
been shown in rando mized trials to prolong OS in cisplat in-eligible patients and is the current SOC 
for this patient population. However ,in clinical practi ce, cisplat in-ineligible patients account for 
40% to 50% of  the total  population with MIBC. Standard of care for these patients is to proceed 
directly to RC, which is associated with a  50% recurrence rate at 2 years, with most of these 
patients who recur, dying from metastati c urothelial cancer within 1 y ear.8
Data presented at ASCO 2018 dem onstrate the safety  and potenti al activit y of PD-1 inhibitors as 
neoadjuvant therapy  for MIBC. Since there is current ly no neoadj uvant SOC for pati ents who are 
not eligible to receive cisplatin -based chemotherapy , defining an unmet medical need, nove l 
therapi es are needed to increase the number of pat ients who qualify to receive neoadjuvant therapy 
and subsequently achieve a pCR and improved EFS. See Secti on 3.2.1 for additional details on 
study  design rati onale.

with a cutoff date of 03-Dec-2018 were presented at the ASCO GU Symposium 2019. The cohort 
included 41 patients who were cisplatin-eligible (n=25) or ineligible (n=16). PD-L1 status, as 
determined using tumor staining with the DAKO PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay , was ≥1% 
(posi tive) in 32%, <1% (negative) in 32%, and unknown or not eval uable in 37%. Twenty -seven 
patients were efficacy evaluable, defined as having at least one post-treatm ent scan to evaluate 
response; one patientwas not evaluable (no target lesio ns), 3 patients discontinued prior to the first  
scan, and 10 patients were still pending a first scan. Among the efficacy evaluable popul ation, the 
ORR was 44.4%, including 5 (18.5%) CRs and 7 (25.9%) PRs. The response rate was similar in 
PD-L1 posit ive (5/11, 45.5%) and PD -L1 negative (6/12, 50%) subgroups. The safet y profile was 
consistent with previously published bempegal desleukin + nivo lumab data, with the mo st commo n 
TRAEs being flu- like symptoms and fat igue.
5.4.2 Rationale for Study Comparator and Study Population
Patients with high-risk UCof the bladder (T1-T4a, N1M0) ,including MIBC (stage T2-T4a, N0, 
M0), are at high-risk for the devel opment of metastatic disease, even after receivin g SOC treatm ent 
RC. Currently, there are no neoadjuvant or adjuvant approved therapies for t his patient populat ion 
with cisplat in-ineligible MIBC .56Study  comparators are not available.
5.4.2.1 Rationale for Including Participants with Clinical Stage T2 Bladder 
Cancer
Forparticipants withMIBC confined to th ebladder (clinical stage T2N0), ithasbeen suggested
thatoutcom eswithRCaregood, andfurther neoadj uvant therapy isnot needed.57However, data
fromSWOG 8710 demonstrate thatMVAC neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased median survival
inpatientswithclinical stage T2 (cT2)disease by2.5years.58One ofthereasons forthis is
thatmanypatients diagnosed withcT2 bladder cancer areupstaged atRC; clinical staging of
early stage bladder cancer isnotoriously inaccurate. Data fromMD Anderson Cancer Center
showed that43% of174patients withlow-riskdisease who underwent RCwithout neoadjuvant  
chemotherapy (NAC )were upstaged tomore advanced disease.59Of212 patients withcT2
disease who underwent RCatFoxChase Cancer Center, 153 (73.2%) patients had eitherpT3-
T4or pN+ tumorsatRC.60Therefore, because oftheinaccuracy ofclinical staging ofbladder
cancer, itisimperat ivethat patients withclinical stage T2N0 arenotexcluded fromthis trial .
5.4.2.2 Rationale for Including Participants with N1 in Bladder Cancer
Regional lymph node involvement is an important prognostic factor in invasive bladder cancer. 
The 5-year survival in N1-N3 pati ents in contem porary  series is from 13%-29%.61,62Per the new 
AJCC cri teria, N1 pati ents have been added to the prognosti c stage category  IIIA and per NCCN 
treatm ent guidelines ,are treated similarly and have similar outcomes as patients with c linical stage 
T3-T4aN0 disease , therefore participants with N1 bladder cancer have been included in this 
protocol .1,2

5.4.3 Rationale for Choice of Endpoints
EFS is a primary endpo int thatcapture son-treatm ent clinical benefit .This is the optimal endp oint 
to capture events that could occur both during the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases o f treatm ent.
The pCR as one of the primary  endpo intswill be used to capture the benefit in the neoadjuvant 
part of the treatment .
5.4.3.1 Rationale for pCR as Oneof the Primary Endpoint s
Extensive clinical data dem onstrate that achieving a pCR after NAC is associ ated wi th increased 
OS in cisplat in eligible patients. In a meta -analysis of 886 patients who received NAC and RC, the 
28.5% of patients who attained a pCR had a relative risk for OS of 0.45 (95% CI=0.36-0.56; 
P <0.00001) compared with those who did not achieve a pCR. The relative risk for relapse- free 
survival (RFS)was 0.19 (95% CI=0.09-0.39; P < 0.00001). There was a 26% and 51% lower
absolute risk of m ortality and recurrence, respectively, when pCR was achieved.63
A multicenter assessment of NAC dem onstrated pCR rates of approximately  23% irrespect ive of 
the type of chemotherapy (MVAC vs GC). A Cox regression analysis assessing factors associated 
with OS identified patients achieving pT1N0 status compared with those with residual  MIBC 
(pT2), HR = 0.25 (95% CI = 0.16-0.40; P < 0.001).18
In a combined analysis of the Nordic Cystectomy  Trials 1 and 2, 449 patients who achi eved pCR 
with NAC (22.7%) exhibited an 88.2% 5 -year OS.64
The SWOG 8710 Phase 3 study  of NAC in 317 patients showed an 85% OS at 5 y ears associ ated 
with pCR. Median survival was 77 months for patients receiving NAC and RC compared with 
46months for RC alone; OS at 5 yea rs was 57% vs 43% , respectively (P = 0.06 ).11A retrospective 
analysis of the SWOG data demonstrated that OS was significant ly wo rse for patients with residual 
MIBC after RC.21
Achieving pCR afterNAC forMIBC isclearly associ ated withprolonged OS. The CA045009
study isdesigned to target a doubling of pCR in the experimental arm.
5.4.3.2 Rationale for Event -free Survival asOneof the Primary Endpoint s
Inthe FDA Gui dance forIndustry/Pathological Complete Response in Neoadjuvant Treatment of
High-Risk Early -Stage Breast Cancer: Use asanEndpoint toSupport Accelerated Approva l
(2014), EFS isdescribed as animportant endpoint for neoadj uvant studies and includes thetime
fromrando mizat iontoprogression ofdisease that precludes surgery, recurrence, orall-cause
death. EFS mayalsobearealistic endpoint ifalargepercentage ofparticipants achieve complete
responses andwhere prolonged survival makes anOSendpoint impractical. While theFDA
guidance isexplicit lywritten only forbreast cancer, theprinciples outlined withinprovide a
scientific basis forextension toUC.

5.4.4 Rationale for Open -label Design
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04 . Due to the hydrati on program  and 
the special restrict ions for withho lding ant i-hypertensive in the bempegaldesleukin arm, a placebo -
controlled, double -blinded study  is not appropriate for this study .
Parti cipants must have UC of the bladder/ MIBC that is deemed potenti ally curable by RC, and 
must be considered medically fit for RC and be willing to undergo RC as part of the study 
treatm ent.
For Arm Cparticipants who do not have any neoadjuvant therapy, delaying surgery  is not
acceptable .
5.4.5 Rationale for Stratification by Disease State and PD-L1
Stratificat ion by clinical stage (T2N0vsT3-T4aN0 vs T1-T4aN1 )will help account for any 
potenti al prognosti c outcom e differences.
Previous clinical studi es with nivolumab monotherapy have shown participants with PD-L1 
positive tumors may have higher response rates than those with negative or indeterminate 
expressio n. Therefore, p articipants in the current trial will be stratified by PD-L1 tumor expressio n 
status, as the effect of PD-L1 tumor expressio n on the response to bempegaldesleukin and 
nivolumab combinat ion is not y et known.
5.4.6 Durat ion of Treatment with Nivolumab/ Bempegaldesleukin
The optimal durat ion of immunotherapy is an impor tant question and continues to be invest igated. 
Clinical tri als across different tum ors ty pes in the immunotherapy  devel opment program  indicate 
that most of the responses occur early, witha medi an time to response of 2  to 4 months, and 
emerging data sugge stthat benefit can be maintained in the absence of continued treatment.
This protocol  includes 3 cycles of neoadj uvant therapy  and 12 cycles of adjuvant therapy ,whic h 
comprises approximately  1year in total treatment duration. The decisio n to use 3 cycle s of 
neoadj uvant therapy  was intended to optimize the chance of achieving pCR, and was based, in 
part, on recent data from other neoadjuvant studies with PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors as discussed in the 
background (Secti on3.2).
5.5 Justification for Dose
5.5.1 Justification for Dose of Bempegaldesleukin
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. The dose for bempegaldesleukin is 
0.006 mg/kg Q3W taking in considerat ion the clinical safet y profile associ ated with the robust 
immune system  activation observed in the PIVOT -02 study. See Secti on3.2.4.2 for addit ional 
details on PIVOT -02.
5.5.2 Justification for Dose of Nivolumab
Nivo lumab monotherapy  has been extensively studi ed in multiple tumor types, including 
melano ma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, and UC, using body weight -norm alized dosing (mg/kg), 
and has been safely administered at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W. Nivo lumab is current ly approved

for the treatment of vari ous tum ors, including melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, and UC, 
using one of the following regimen s:nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, or 
nivolumab 480 mg Q4W.
Nivo lumab has been shown to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of nivo lumab 10 mg/kg 
Q2W. Popul ation PK (PPK) analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab islinear with 
proporti onal exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg; no differences in PK across 
ethnicit ies and tumor types were observed. Using the PPK model, the exposures following 
administration of several  dosing regimens of nivolumab administere d as a flat dose were 
simulated, including nivolumab 360 mg Q3W. The simulated steady  state average concentration 
(Cavgss) fo llowing administration of nivo lumab 360 m g Q3W are expected to be similar to those 
following administration of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivo lumab 3 m g/kg Q2W administered 
to participants weighing 80 kg, the approximate median weight of participants with NSCLC, 
melano ma,and RCC used in the PPK analyses. Given that the Cavgss estimates for nivolumab 
360 mg Q3W are predi cted to be simil ar to those for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 
3mg/kg Q2W, the efficacy  is predi cted to be similar for these regimens. It should be noted that 
the Cmaxss following nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are predi cted to be less than those following the 
administration of nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W providing suffic ient safet y margins. Further details 
on nivo lumab 360 m g Q3W dosing can be found in the IB.
  
  
 
 
5.5.3 Rationale for Bempegaldesleukin /Nivolumab Combination Dose

6.4.1 Retesting During Screening Period
Parti cipant Re-enrollment: This study  permit s the re-enrollment of a participant who has 
discontinued the study  as a pre -treatm ent failure ( ie, participant has not been rando mized/ has not 
been treated). If re- enrolled, the participant must be re -consented .
Retesting of laboratory  parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening period 
will be permitted (in addit ion to any  parameters that require a confirmatory  value).
The most current resul t prior to Rando mizat ion is the value by which study  inclusio n will be 
assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current, clinical state .
Laboratory  parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2-1, Screening Procedural 
Outline ,may be repeated in an effort to find all  possible well -qualified participant s. Consultatio n 
with the Medi cal Monitor may be needed to ident ify whether repeat testing of any particular

7.1.1 Bempegaldesleukin Dosing
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Per Protocol Amendment 04, 
participants receiving bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab are requi red to discont inue 
bempegaldesleukin and may cont inue nivo lumab. Each participant’s bempegaldesleukin dose will 
be determined by  the parti cipant’s wei ght in kil ograms, whi ch will  be determined before the start 
of each cycle. If the participant’s weight is within 10% of the Cycle 1 Day 1 weight, the study drug 
doses do not need to be recalculated depending on inst itutional guidelines/preference .
Bempegaldesleukin will be administer ed first before nivolumab. Bempegaldesleukin will be 
administered as an IV infusio n over 30 (± 5) minutes at a starting dose of 0.006 mg/kg every 
3weeks ( ±3 days). Bempegaldesleukin infusio n must be pro mptly followed by a flush of diluent 
to clear the line, and admin istrati on time should include the time required for flushing. Nivo lumab 
administration shoul d start 30 (± 5) minutes after the completion of bempegaldesleukin
administrat ion. 
Parti cipants shoul d be carefully monitored for infusio n react ions during bempegaldesleukin
administration. If an acute infusion react ion is noted, participants shoul d be managed according to 
Secti on 7.4.6 .If the participant experiences a Grade ≥ 2 infusio n-related reacti on or hypotensio n 
during the days after bempegal desleukin dosing, the participant may be monitored overnight at the 
discreti on of  the Invest igator; l onger peri ods of  monitoring may be implemented at the discretio n 
of the Invest igator .
Treatment with bempegaldesleukin may be delayed or reduced as descri bed in Sect ion 7.4. In the 
event that nivo lumab is permanent ly discont inued due to toxicit ies, see Sect ion8.1.1 .

Bempegaldesleukin treatment can continue for participants randomized to the bempegaldesleukin 
and nivolumab combinat ion arm in the event that nivo lumab is perm anent ly discont inued due to 
toxicities (see Sect ion 8.1.1 ).
Bempegaldesleukin ( NKTR -214)Powder for Solutio n for Injection is to be administered as an IV 
infusio n following reconst itution and dilution as described in the Pharmacy Manual .In-line filt ers 
(including in-line filter extensio n sets) must not be used to administer bempegal desleukin due to 
the extent of drug losses by  adsorpti on on the filter m embrane. Bempegaldesleukin infusio n must 
be prom ptly followed by a flush of diluent to cl ear the line. Care must be taken to assure sterili ty 
of the prepared solution as the product does not contain any antimicrobial preservat ive or 
bacteri ostati c agent. 
Bempegald esleukin infusio ns prepared in 0.9% NaCl  solution or 5% Dextrose solutions are 
compatible with polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin containers and infusio n sets, as well as closed-
system  transfer devices (CSTDs) when following specific instructi ons to ensure prepared dose 
accuracy .
Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual/current IBfor details regarding preparati on, storage, and 
administration.
7.1.1.1 Hydration Guidelines
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Important safety informat ion and 
hydrat ion instructions are to be provided to participants.
Hydration and renal function should be assessed within 24 hours prior to study drug administration 
or as soon as locally feasible (Table 2-2and Table 2-3). Underlying reasons for decreased oral 
intake (such as nausea) shoul d be addressed and treatm ent (such as IV hydration) shoul d be 
provi ded. Parti cipants m ay receive addit ional hydrati on precauti ons in a parti cipant handout.
For those participants randomized to Arm A (ie, bempegaldesleukin in combinat ion with 
nivolumab), administer at least 1 liter of IV fluid onbempegaldesleukin dosing days (Day 1 of 
cycle). For the next 3 d ays (Days 2-4) after administrati on of bempegaldesleukin , part icipants are 
to be instructed to drink at least 2liters per day of self-administered oral hydration. Advise 
participants to refrain from activities that may contribute to dehydration (including but not limited 
to, strenuous activity,long hot showers ,and saunas )for Days 1 to 4of each cycle of treatm ent 
with bempegaldesleukin . Advise participants with orthostati c symptom s to call their treating 
oncol ogist and consider increasing oral hydrat ion.
Between Days 3 and 5, inclusive, following administration of the first two doses of 
bempegaldesleukin , site personnel must contact the participant (by telephone or clinic visit) at least  
once to rem ind the parti cipant of the oral  hydrati on gui delines, to assess for any symptom atology 
and compliance with the guidelines , and docum ent the resul ts of the discussio n (Table 2-2and 
Table 2-3). Following subsequent bempegaldesleukin administrati ons, the oral  hydrat ion follow-
up shoul d be conducted as clinically indicated for participants receiving bempegaldesleukin . 
Per clinical judgment, IV fluids may be administered at any  time. The Invest igator may decide to 
forego administering IVfluids to a participant or adjust the recommendat ion for self-oral hydrat ion

to a particular participant if this is deemed to be in the best interest of the participant (eg, evidence 
of fluid overload). Hy dration guidelines should also be provided to the participant.
7.1.2 Nivolumab Dosing
Nivo lumab administrati on shoul d start 30 (± 5) minutes afterthe completion of bempegaldesleukin
administration in ArmA. Parti cipants shoul d receive nivolumab at a dose of 360 mg as a 30-minute 
infusio n on Day  1 of each treat ment cycle unt il progressi on, unacceptable toxi city, withdrawal  of 
consent, complet ion of 12 cyclesof adjuvant treatment or the stud y ends, whichever occurs first.
There will  be no dose escal ations or reducti ons of  nivo lumab allowed. Parti cipants m ay be dosed 
no less than 18 days from the previous dose during Q3W cycles. Prem edicati ons are not 
recommended for the first dose of nivo lumab .In the event that bempegaldes leukin is permanent ly 
discontinued due to toxicit ies, see Sect ion 8.1.1 .
Parti cipants should be carefully mo nitored for infusio n reacti ons d uring nivo lumab administration. 
If an acute infusio n react ion is noted, participants should be ma naged according to Section 7.4.6 .
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discont inued depending on how well the 
participant tolerates the treatm ent. Dosing visits are not skipped, only delayed. Nivo lumab 
treatm ent can continue for participants randomized to Arm A in the event t hat bempegaldesleukin
is stopped due to toxicit ies.
Instructi ons for dilution and infusio n of nivolumab injection may be provi ded in the clinical 
protocol , pharm acy binde r, or Pharmacy Manual .
7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
The fo llowing inform ation is requi red for parti cipant randomizat ion:
Parti cipant number
Year of birth
PD-L1 status (≥ 1% vs < 1%/ indeterminate )
UCof the bladder /MIBC confirmat ion
Clinical stage (T2 N0vsT3-T4aN0 vs T1- T4aN1 )(see Appendix 9)
Stratified permuted block method will be used for rando mizat ion and rando mized part icipants will 
be stratified byclinical T stage and PD-L1 status. Due to the importance of avoiding delays 
associ ated with obtaining a second tumor sam ple forevaluat ion, this study  will allow up to 10% 
(total ) ofrandomized participants to be included in the study  with indeterminate PD -L1 status.
Parti cipants with clinical stage T1-T4aN1M0areeligible from Protocol  Amendment 03. These 
participants will be rando mized in theIRT using a new randomizat ion schedule .
Tumor PD-L1 expressio n data will be transferred directly fro m the analyzing laboratory to the IRT 
vendor .
PD-L1 positive (1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor 
cells)

Study  treatment will be administered at the study visits as listed in the Schedule of Activities 
(Secti on2).
7.3 Blinding
Not applicable as this is an open- label study; however, PD-L1 will be blinded to invest igators but 
provi ded to the bioanaly tical laboratory  as appropriate.
The specific treatment to be taken by a participant will be assigned using an Intera ctive Response 
Techno logy (IRT). Treatment assignments will be released to the bioanalyt ical laboratory  in order 
to minimize unnecessary analysis o f samples.
7.4 Dosage Modific ation
Per Protocol Amendment 04, the text below related to bempegaldesleukin is not applicable; 
however, the criteria remain unchanged for nivolumab . If bempegaldesleukin or nivolumab 
meet the criteria for dose delay, then administration of both drugs must be delayed until the criteria 
to resume are met (see Table 7.4.1 -1).Delay nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin dosing for any 
adverse event, laboratory  abnorm ality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study  medi cation.
Note: Tumor assessments for all participants shoul d continue as per protocol  even if dosing is 
delayed.
Parti cipants who require delay of nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin shoul d be re-evaluated 
weekly or more frequent ly if clinically indicated and resume treatm ent with combinat ion of 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab when re-treatment criteria are met. Immuno -oncol ogy agents 
are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration from AEs caused by other 
therapeuti c classes. Bempegaldesleukin and nivo lumab are considered an immu no-oncol ogy agent 
in this protocol . Early recogni tion and management of AEs associ ated with immuno -oncol ogy 
agents may mi tigate severe toxi city.
Discontinuati on criteria for nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin are found in Secti ons 7.4.1 and
8.1.1 .
7.4.1 Nivolumab and Bempegaldesleukin Dose Delay , Resume, and 
Discontinuation Criteria
Per Protocol Amendment 04, the text below related to bempegaldesleukin is not applicable; 
however, the criteria remain unchanged for nivolumab . The criteria to delay, resume, and 
discontinue nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin were initially devel oped using CTCAE v4.03 
definit ions of AE grading. In Oct-2020, the nivolumab AE grading criteria and algorithms were 
updated to CTCAE v5, which can be found in Table 7.4.1 -1.

SARS -CoV -2 infect ion, either confirmed or suspected, requires delay of nivolumab and 
bempegaldesleukin study  treatm ent.If a study participant has received an invest igational COVID -
19 vaccine prior to screening, enrollment shoul d be delayed until the full dosing schedule of the 
vaccine has been completed and the impact of the vaccine is stabilized, unless a delay would 
compromise the pati ent’s h ealth or sui tabili ty for enrollment, as determined by  the study  team .
AE criteria for delaying, resuming, and discont inuing nivolumab and bempegaldesleukin are 
available in Table 7.4.1 -1andSecti on8.1.1 .Participants may resume treatment with study drug if 
they have completed AE management (ie,corticosteroi d taper) or are on ≤ 10 mg prednisone or 
equivalent.
Parti cipants who requi re del ay of nivo lumab should be re -evaluated weekly or more frequent ly if 
clinically indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when re-treatm ent criteria are met. Dose 
reducti ons for nivo lumab are not permitted in this study .
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04.Dose delays and reducti ons are permitted for 
bempegaldesleukin . Bempegal desleukin may be delayed or reduced to 0.003 mg/kg based on 
observed drug-related toxicities. If the bempegaldesleukin dose is reduced to 0.003 mg/kg ,the 
dose level shoul d remain at this level throughout the remainder of the study and will not be re-
escalated .
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Bempegaldesleukin dosing may resume at the same 
bempegaldesleukin dose or at a lower bempegaldesleukin dose level when toxicity resolves to Grade 
1 or r eturns to baseline, except for instances where the potential recurrence of the event poses an undue 
riskfor the participant. Medical Monitor consultation is required for dose reduction.

7.4.2 Monitoring and Management of Elevated Hepatic Transaminases
Per Protocol Amendment 04, language for bempegaldesleukin is no longer applicable.   
Elevated hepat ic transaminases are an overlapping toxicitythat can occur for both 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab. The elevations in hepat ic transaminases associ ated with 
bempegaldesleukin typically  occur at the time of  peak active cy tokine concentrati on in the blood 
(Day s 2-4), and are often accompanied by other cytokine- related toxicities such as flu-like 
symptoms, rash or pruri tus. The transient elevat ions in hepat ic transaminases are usually mild or 
moderate in severit y, not associated wi th increased total  bilirubin, resolve spontaneously  without 
treatm ent, a nd predominant ly occur in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalit ies wit h 
these characteri stics have been observed in PIVOT -02 during Cycle 1, and participants were able 
to continue study  treatment uninterrupted with close laboratory  monitoring. For transaminase 
elevations occurri ng in Cycle 1 consistent with a cytokine related effect without alternat ive 
etiologies, fo llow the Cy cle 1 hepat ic adverse event management guideline (Section 7.4.1.1 ).
Hepati c events, including elevated liver function tests, have also been observed for nivolumab. 
Most cases were of low or moderate severit y. Higher grade abnormalit ies are concerning for 
immune -mediated hepatit is, and typically occur with a  later onset (median time to onset of 
3.3months). Immune -mediated hepat itis generally resul ts in a quick rise in liver function tests, 
and responds to corticosteroi ds or immune -modulating agents. For transaminase elevations 
occurring in Cycle 2 onwards potenti ally involving an immune -mediated mechanism, follow the 
immune -mediated hepatic adverse event management guidelines in the nivolumab Investi gator’s 
Brochure or product labeling for appropriate manage ment.
7.4.3 Monitoring and Management of Bempegaldesleukin -induced 
Eosinophilia
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Frequent and significant 
eosinophilia has been observed in participants receiving both single agent bempegaldesleukin and 
bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab, primarily  starting at Cycle 2 or later, consistent with the 
known effect of IL -2 therapy . Clinical  data analysis dem onstrated that frequency  of selected AEs 
(primarily  Grade 1 or 2 i n severit y) such as rash, pruri tus, edem a,nausea, vo miting, di arrhea, and 
dizziness increased with level of eosinophilia. Isolated cases of suspected hypereosinophil ic 
syndro me have been reported.
Absolute eosinophil count (AEC) should be c losely monitored per protocol. If study  participant is 
suspected to have hypereosinophilic syndro me (symptoms may invo lve skin, lungs, digest ive tract, 
heart, blood and nervous system ) with AEC at or above 5000/µ L(5x109/L) level, 
bempegaldesleukin treatm ent may need to be withheld ,and the participant shou ld be treated as 
clinically indicated .

7.4.5 Management Algorithms for Immuno -oncology Agents
Per Protocol Amendment 04, the text below related to bempegaldesleukin is not applicable; 
however, the criteria remain unchanged for nivolumab. Immuno- oncol ogy agents are 
associ ated wi th AEs that can differ in severit y and durati on from AEs caused by  other therapeutic 
classes. Bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab are considered immuno -oncol ogy agents in this 
protocol . Early recogni tion and management of AEs associ ated with immuno -oncol ogy agents 
may mit igate severe toxicit y. Management Algorithms (see Appendix 6 , Appendix 7, Appendix 8,
and the nivo lumab IB) have been developed to assist Invest igators in assessing and managing the 
following groups of AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmo nary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy
Skin
Neurol ogical
Myocardi tis
CVA
Cytokine -release Syndrom e(CRS)
Advanced Cardi ac Life Support (ACLS) and institutional guidelines shoul d be followed for all
CVA cases. For participants previously t reated with bempegaldesleukin plus nivo lumab who have 
experienced a CVA or TIA, the Invest igator should discuss risk/ benefit o f cont inuing nivo lumab.  
A management algorithm for possible signs and symptoms of CVA or TIA for participants treated 
with bempegaldesleukin in combination with a checkpo int inhibitor is provi ded in Appendix 7
(notapplicable per Protocol Amendment 04) .
7.4.5.1 Management Algorithm for Cytokine -release Syndrome
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04 . CRS is a clinica l diagnosi s with a 
constellation of symptoms often characterized by fever, tachy pnea, headache, tachy cardia, 
hypotension, rash, and/or hypoxia caused by the release of cytokines. In addit ion, diarrhea and end 
organ dy sfunct ion can be seen in CRS. Many of t hese symptoms overlap with known AEs seen in 
bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab combinat ion therapy  (ie, pyrexia and hypotension). These 
symptoms may be seen in infusio n react ions as well as other known syndro mes, such as tumor 
lysis syndro me and macrophage a ctivat ion syndrome. For suspected CRS of Grade 3 or above, the

7.4.6 Treatment of Bempegaldesl eukin -related or Nivolumab -related Infusion 
Reactions
Per Protocol Amendment 04, the text below related to bempegaldesleukin is not applicable; 
however, the criteria remain unchanged for nivolumab . Infusio n react ions have been reported 
during bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab infusio ns. If such a react ion were to occur with either 
the bempegaldesleukin or nivolumab infusio n, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, 
headache, rash, pruri tus, arthralgias, hypotensio n, hypertensio n, bronchospasm , orother 
allergic -like react ions.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1symptoms (mild reacti on; infusio n interruption not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at the bedside and monitor the participant until recovery  from symptoms . The 
following prophylact ic prem edicat ions are recommended for future infusio ns: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 100 0mg at 
least 30 minu tes before subsequent infusio ns.Subsequent infusions may be administered at a 
reduced rate (eg, 50% of the original infusio n rate ).
For Grade 2 symptom s (moderate reacti on requi res therapy  or infusi on interrupti on but responds 
prom ptly to symptom atic treatm ent [eg, antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, 
narcoti cs, corticosteroi ds, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylact ic med ications indicated for 
24hours):
Stop the bempegaldesleukin or nivo lumab infusio n, begin an IV infusio n of normal saline, and 
treat the participant with diphenhydramine 50mg IV (or equivalent) and/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg; remain at the bedside and mo nitor the participant 
until resolution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be 
administered as appropri ate. If the infusio n is interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of  
the original  infusi on rate when symptom s resolve. If symptoms recur after restarting the 
bempeg aldesleukin or nivolumab infusio n, then no further bempegaldesleukin or nivolumab 
will be administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50mg IV, remain at the 
bedside, and monitor the participant until reso lution of symptoms. 
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c prem edicat ionsare recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325to 1000 mg 
shoul d be administered at least 30minutes before the infusio n. If necessary , corticosteroi ds 
(up to 25mg of methylpredniso lone or equivalent) may be used (see Section 7.7.1 for 
corticosteroi d dose equivalents). Subsequent infusio ns may be administered at a reduced rate 
(eg, 50% of the original infusio n rate ).

7.7.1.1 Effect of Bempegaldesleukin on PK of Concomitant Medications
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04.Bempegaldesleukin causes transient  
increases in circulat ing cytokines lasting for about one week after bempegaldesleukin dosing in 
the Q3W dosing schedule. Several of these cytokines (IFN -γ, IL-6, IL-10) have the potential to 
decrease the act ivity of multiple enzymes and drug transporters.65,66Consequently, treatment with 
bempegaldesleukin may lead to temporary  decrease in clearance of drugs that are substrates of 
metabo lizing enzymes or drug transporters . Where indicated based on decreased tolerabili ty or the 
occurrence of adverse effects related to a concomit ant drug, reduce the dosage of the concomitant 
drug during Days 3 to 8 of each cycle o f bempegaldesleukin .

venous thromboembolic disease was included to mit igate the potenti al increased ri sk of  ischemic 
cerebrovascular events (ICEs) observed in partici pants treated with bempegaldesleukin plus 
nivolumab. Per Protocol Amendment 04participants will receive nivolumab monotherapy  only. 
Nivo lumab monotherapy  does not appear to be associ ated with an increased risk of ICE; 
anticoagulation therapy will no longer be mandated for patients enrolled on the study . There are

no data suggesting how long the durati on of potent ial increased risk of ICE persists after the 
discontinua tion of bempegaldesleukin. Decisi ons regarding antithrombotic therapy  should be 
based on the invest igator’s assessment of the risk benefit for each individual patient.
Per protocol amendment 04 , the remainder of this section is not applicable.
Parti cipants with a history of a venous or arterial thromboembolic event must be receiving a stable 
regimen of therapeutic a nticoagulation (LMWH or DOAC). Addit ionally :
Use of warfarin (Coumadin) is permitted; however, therapeutic dosing should target a specific 
Inter national Normalised Ratio (INR)stable for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. 
Bempegaldesleukin has the potential to down -regulate m etabo lizing enzymes for warfarin for 
approximately  1week after administration of each dose of bempegaldesleukin . Due to the 
possibilit y of drug-drug interacti ons between warfarin and bempegaldesleukin , frequent  
monitoring of INR and ongoing consideration of dose adjust ments are warranted throughout 
the participant’s part icipation on study .
Unless there is a new medical cont raindicat ion observed after Cycle 1 Day 1, a participant with 
a history  of venous or arterial thromboembo lic event must be maintained on therapeutic 
anticoagulation throughout the participant’s time on study  treatm ent.
7.7.2.2 Imaging Restriction and Precautions
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibilit y to determine, based on participant attributes (eg, 
allergy  history , diabetic history , and renal  status), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast 
regimen per imaging study . Imaging contraindicatio ns and contrast risks are to be considered in 
this assessment. Parti cipants wi th renal insufficiency  are to be assessed as to whether or not they 
shoul d receive contrast and if so, which contrast agent and dose is appropri ate. Specific to MRI, 
participants withsevere renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, therefore MRI 
contrast is contraindicated. In addition, participants may be excluded from MRI if they have 
tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined in the image manual.
Gent le hydrat ion before and after IV contrast should follow local standard of care. The ultimate 
decisio n to perform MRI in an individual partici pant in this study rests with the site radiologist, 
the invest igator, and standards set by  the l ocal Ethics Committee.
7.7.2.3 Blood Pressure Precautions
This section is not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04.Considerat ion shoul d be given to 
withhol ding antihypertensive medications including diuretics, as well as other drugs with 
hypotensive properties (eg, alpha-blockers for benign prostati chyperplasia , particularly  when 
therapy  involves multiple antihypertensive drugs and classes other than thiazide diuretics. If 
withholding antihypertensive medications, withhold no less than 12hours and no more than 48 
hours prior to each dose of bempegaldesleukin . Participants who are on medications with 
antihypertensive effects for the treatment of coronary  artery  disease ( CAD ) (eg, beta-blockers, Ca 
channel blockers, nitrates, etc) should be able to withholdthese drugs prior to initiation of 
treatm ent.

Antihypertensive medications may be reinst ituted in between doses of bempegaldesleukin at any 
time as clinically indicated (eg, bas ed on bl ood pressure m onitoring resul ts).
In parti cipants receiving beta -blockers, consider a step -wise tapering of doses before initiation o f 
bempegaldesleukin to av oid reflex tachycardi a. If Grade 2 or higher hypertensio n is observed in 
any cycle, participants shoul d be monitored more frequent ly (at least weekly until a new stable 
antihypertensive regimen is ident ified). Participants may be monitored more frequent ly at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator as clinically warranted.
7.7.3 Permitted Therapy
PerProtocol Amendment 04, the text below related to bempegaldesleukin is not applicable; 
however, the criteria remain unchanged for nivolumab.
Prophylaxis for flu-like symptoms with either acetaminophen or ibuprofen is permi tted on study 
per the Investigato r’s discret ion. Prophylaxis for flu-like symptom s shoul d be initiated on either 
Day 1 or Day 2 of the dosing cycle and may  continue through Day  5 or l onger as needed.
Prophylaxis for rash and/or pruritus with anti-histamines is permitted on study  per the 
Invest igator’s discretion. Prophylaxis for rash and/or pruritus shoul d be initiated on either Day 1 
or Day 2 after dosing of bempegaldesleukin or nivolumab and may continue through Day 5 or 
longer as needed.
Parti cipants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalat ional 
corticosteroi ds (with minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal replacement steroi d doses > 10 mg 
daily  prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroi ds for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy ) or for treatment of non-autoimmune condi tions (eg, 
delayed -type hypersensi tivity react ion caused by a contact allergen) is permitted.
7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the end of the study /Peri od, BMS will not continue to provide BMS supplied study  treatment 
to participants/invest igators unless BMS chooses to extend the study . The invest igator should 
ensure that the participant receives appropriate SOC to treat the condit ion under study .
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied study  treatment ifany of the fo llowing 
occur: a)the study  is terminated due to safet y concerns; b)the devel opment of the 
bempegaldesleukin is terminated for other reasons, including but not limited to lack of efficac y 
and/or not meet ing the study  object ives; c) the participant can obtain medicat ion from a 
government sponsored or private healt h program . In all cases BMS will fo llow l ocal regulat ions.
Per Protocol Amendment 04, BMS is terminat ing the devel opment of bempegaldesleukin in 
combinat ion with nivo lumab. If BMS decides to terminate the study ,all sites will be notified and 
given a period of time to discont inue study treatment and transi tion all participants to commercially 
available SOC treatment. The sponsor may provide alternative mechanisms to receive treatm ent 
for parti cipants who cannot afford or access commercially  available SOC treatments.

8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Parti cipants MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Parti cipant’s request to stop study treatm ent. Participants who request to discontinue study 
treatm ent will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specified 
follow-up procedures. The only  excepti on to this is when a parti cipant specifically  withdraws 
consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by participant to 
provi de this informat ion.
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory  abnormalit y or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinio n of the invest igator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study is not in the best 
interest of the participant
Terminat ion of t he study  by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)
Loss of ability to freely  provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatm ent of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious disease) illness . (Note: Under 
specific circumstances, a participant who has been imprisoned may be permi tted to c ontinue 
as a parti cipant. Stri ct condi tions apply and BMS approval is required.)
EFS event as defined in Section 9.1.1
Refer to the Schedule of Activities(Secti on 2)for data to be collected at the time of treatm ent 
discontinuat ion and fo llow-up and for any  further evaluat ions that can be completed.
In the case of pregnancy , the invest igator m ust immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Moni tor/desi gnee of thisevent. In allcases, the study 
treatm ent will be perm anent ly discontinued in an appropri ate manner (eg, dose taperi ng if 
necessary  for parti cipant safet y. See Secti on 9.2.5 , Pregnancy ).
All part icipants who discont inue study treatment should comply wit h protocol specified fo llow-up 
procedures as outlined in Sect ion 2. The only  excepti on to this requi rement is when a parti cipant 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the 
abilit y to consent freely  (ie, is imprisoned or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
If study  treatm ent is di scontinued prior to the participant’s co mpletion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be docum ented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
8.1.1 Nivolumab and Bempegaldesleukin Discontinuation Criteria
Per Protocol Amendment 04, participants receiving bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab are 
required to discontinue bempegaldesleukin and will receive nivolumab monotherapy.
Per Protocol Amendment 04, the text below related to bempegaldesleukin is not applicable;

Prior to re-initiating treatm ent in a participant with a dosing delay  lasting > 8weeks, the BMS 
Medical Moni tor (or designee) must be consulted. Tumor assessments shoul d continue as per 
protocol  even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety and laboratory  studies 
shoul d also continue every  6weeks or m ore frequent ly if clinically  indicated during such dosing 
delays.
8.1.2 Post -study Treatment Study Follow- up
In this study, pCR, EFS, and OS are key endpo ints of the study. Post -study fo llow-up is of crit ical 
importance and is essential to preserving participant safet y and the integrity of the study . 
Parti cipants who discont inue study  treatment must continue to be followed (in this study  or a 
rollover study ) for collect ion of survival fo llow-up data as required and in line with Sect ion 5until 
death or the concl usion of the study. For each randomized participant, the maximum total duration 
of the study  is up to 62 weeks + 100 day s of safet y follow-up .
BMS m ay request that survival data be co llected on all treated/randomized participants outside o f 
the protocol -defined window (see Secti on 2). At the time of  this request, each participant will be 
contacted to determine their survival status unless the participant has withdrawn consent for all 
contacts or is lost to fo llow-up.
Per Protocol Amendment 04, this section is no longer applicable.   Addit ional subsequent cancer 
therapy  details such as regimen, setting of the regimen, line of therapy , start da te and end date of 
each regimen, best response to the regimen, and date of progression after next line of therapy will 
be co llected .
Parti cipants who discontinue study treatment may continue to be fo llowed.
8.2 Discontinuation from the Study
Parti cipants who discont inue study  treatment will remain in the study  and must continue to be 
followed up to 100 daysfor protocol specified follow-up procedures with documentati on of last 
overall survival upon discont inuat ion. The only exception to this is when a participa nt specifically 
withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authori zed by 
participant to provi de this informat ion.

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and timing are summarized in the Sche dule of Activit ies(Secti on 2). Protocol 
waivers or exempt ions are not allowed. Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including 
those specified in the Schedule of Activities(Secti on 2), is essent ial and required for study conduct .
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potenti al participants 
meet all eligibilit y criteria before rando mizat ion. The invest igator will maintain screening log to 
record details o f all part icipants screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening 
failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routi ne clinical management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained bef ore signing of informed consent may be ut ilized for screening or baseline purposes

timeframe defined in the Schedule o f Activities(Section 2).
All immediate safet y concerns must be di scussed with the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence 
or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discont inue treatment.
Addit ional measures, including non-study  required laboratory  tests, shoul d be performed as 
clinically indicated or to com ply with local regulati ons. Laboratory  toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluat ions) will be monitored during the foll ow-up phase via on -site/local 
labs unt il all study drug- related toxicit ies resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
If a participant shows pulmonary -related si gns ( hypoxi a, fever) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, 
and fever ) consistent with possible pulm onary AEs, the participant shoul d be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmo nary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary  toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS -936558 (nivo lumab) Invest igator ’sBrochure.
Some of the assessments referred to in this sect ion may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safet y monitoring by the treati ng physician. Addit ional testing or 
assessments may be perform ed as clinically  necessary  or wh ere required by institutional or local 
regul ations.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
Per Protocol Amendment 04, tumor assessments will be determined by investigato r.
9.1.1 Definition of Events in EFS
EFS isdefined asthetime from randomizat iontoanyofthefollowing events: progression of
disease thatprecludes surgery, localor di stant recurrence, ordeath duetoanycause. Details on
EFS events are provided below:
Worsening of disease that precludes surgery (as determined by Invest igator or Section 9.1.1.2 )
If surgery is possible, but not performed for other reasons (eg , part icipant refuses, AEs), and there 
has been RECIST v1.1 assessed progre ssionin the neoadjuvant peri od, then it will be considered 
an EFS event (seeSecti on9.1.2.2 ).
If surgery is possible but not performed for other reasons (participant refuses or worsening of 
medical condition), then the participant may continue on study treatment and will be considered 
to have an EFS event if and when:
There i s RECIST v1.1 defined progression
Ifthereiscarcinoma in situ (CIS), high grade Ta, T1, or ≥T2 disease at anytime after 
neoadj uvant therapy  is completed observed on cystoscopy and confi rmed bypathol ogic 
review after TURBT and/or bladder biopsy (see schedule of cystoscopy in Secti on 2)
If surgery isattem ptedbut gross resection is abandoned, due to unresectable tumor or 
worsening of disease, then that will be considered an EFS event.
IfRCiscompleted withnooronly microscopic residual disease (posit ivemargins, notvisible
onimaging), then theparticipant willcontinue onstudy andwillbeconsidered tohave anEFS
event ifandwhen radiographically (or by bi opsy) visible recurrence occurs.

biopsy ), itwillbeconsidered as an EFS event .Equivocal residual disease shoul dbeconfirmed
bybiopsy orconfirmed byfurther progression (RECIST v1.1)atfollowing scan (see Appendix 
10).
Local or distant recurrence or new upper tract tumor confirmed byimaging orbiopsy
Death due to any cause
9.1.1.1 Definition of Disease Recurrence
Bladder cancer recurrence will be defined as any unequivocal evidence of new bladder cancer 
lesions that are det ected after RC. Biopsy should be emplo yed where required to prove recurrence. 
In cases where recurrence is equivocal and biopsy cannot be performed or were not diagnostic, the 
participant may cont inue treatment and imaging of suspect lesio ns should be repe ated in 4 -8 weeks 
(Secti on9.1.2.3 ).
The first post -surgery  assessment will  occur wi thin 60 to 90 days after RC and pri or to beginning 
post-surgery  IO therapy  for Arm s A and B. Parti cipants who have new LNs defined asshort axis
10mmwithgrowth of≥ 5mm(eg,9 mmLNgrows to14mm) or have findings of other new, 
unequivocal non-nodal  lesions will be considered as having recurrence. Confirmation of 
recurrence must be attempted as described in Sect ion 9.1.2.2 .
Tumor may  recur in the following sites:
Local , urothelial tract: Any  new UC in ureter or renal pelvis, including lesio ns thought to be a 
second UC primary, will be considered recurrences, as well as new CIS, Ta high grade, T1 or 
muscle invasive lesio n in participants who do not undergo RC.
Local , non -urothelial tract: Any new UC in pelvic soft tissue or involving pelvic nodes below 
the aortic bifurcat ion.
Distant: Any  new non -local recurrence
Unequivocal recurrence of urothelial cancer at any of these sites will be considered an EFS event 
requi ring that study  treatm ent be di scontinued.
9.1.1.2 Definition of Disease Progression
All part icipants including those who didnotundergo RCduetoreasons other thanworsening of
disease precluding surgery will befollowed byimaging fordisease progression according to 
RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 10) .Forparticipants who are undergoing surveillance cystoscopies, 
see Section 9.1.1 above.
9.1.1.3 Definition of pCR
The pCR rate is defined as the proporti on of  randomized parti cipants wi th absence of  any cancer 
(T0, N0) in patho logy specimens after RC, as assessed by  blinded pathol ogy review.

9.1.2 Imaging Assessment for the Study
As per Protocol Amendment 04, images will no longer be submitted to central imaging 
vendor.
All images will be submi tted to a central  imaging vendor for BICR at any time during the study . 
Copi es of  addi tional scans conducted at the time of UC of  the bladder/MIBC diagnosis should be 
stored at the sites for possible future analysis, at the Sponsor’s discret ion.Sponsor may also request 
additional historical scans to clarify baseline assessment. Prior to scanning first parti cipant, sites 
shoul d be qualified and understand the image acqui sition guidelines and submissi on process as 
outlined in the CA045009 Imaging Manual provided by the central imaging vendor. Screening and 
on study  images shoul d be acquired as outlined in Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2).
Tumor assessments at other time points may  be perform ed if clinically  indicated . 
Tumorassessments forallparticipants should continue asperprotocol even ifdosing isdelayed
or discontinued. Tumor measurements shoul d be made by  the same investigator or radiologist for 
each assessment, whenever possible.
9.1.2.1 Methods of Measurement
Contrast -enhanced CT of the chest, abdom en, pelvis (including excretory  imaging) , and all other 
known and/or suspected sites of disease shoul d be performed for tumor assessments. Images 
shoul d be acquired with slice thickness of 5 mm or less with no intervening gap (conti guous). 
Every  attem pt shoul d be made to image each part icipant using an ident ical acqu isition protocol on 
the same scanner for all imaging time points. Tumor measurements shoul d be made by the same 
investigator or radio logist for each assessment, whenever possible . Change in tumor measurements 
and tumor response to guide ongoing study treat ment decisio ns will be assessed by the invest igator 
using the RECIST v1.1 criteria.
If a parti cipant has a contraindicat ion for CT IV contrast, then a non -contrast CT of the chest and 
a contrast -enhanced MRI of the abdo men, pelvis, and other known/suspecte d sites of disease 
shoul d be obtained.
If a participant has a contraindicat ion for both MRIand CT IV contrasts, then a non-contrast CT 
of the chest and a non-contrast MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other known/suspected sitesof 
disease shoul d be obtaine d.
If a participant has a contraindicat ion for MRI (eg, incompatible pacemaker) in addition to 
contraindicat ion to CT IV contrast, then a non -contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other 
known/suspected sites of disease is acceptable.
Use of CT component of a PET -CT scanner : Combined modalit y scanning such as with PET-CT 
is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modalit y/techno logy that is in rapid evolution; 
therefore, the recommendat ions outlined here may change rather quickly with time. At present, 
low dose or attenuation correcti on CT porti ons of a  combined PET-CT are of limited use in 
anatomically -based efficacy  assessments and it is therefore suggested that they should not be 
subst ituted for dedicated diagnost ic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically -based 
RECIST v1.1 m easurements. However, if a si te can docum ent that the CT perform ed as part of  a

CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST v1.1 measurements. Note, however, that the 
PET portion of the CT introduces addit ional data that may bias an invest igator if it is not routinely 
or serially performed.
9.1.2.2 BICR Confirmation of Progression or Recurrence
Per Protocol Amendment 04, BICR will be discontinued and all study treatment decisions 
will be based on the investigator’s assessment of tumor images.
See comprehensive Definit ion of Events in EFS (Section9.1.1 ). Not applicable per Protocol 
Amendment 04. All invest igator-assessed events requi re BICR confi rmation withtheexcept ion
of events fr om preclusio n of surgery due to disease worsening or abandoned surgery do not require 
BICR confirmation.
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Sites should submit all scans to the central imaging 
vendor on a rolling basis, throughout the durati on of the study . The site will inform  the central 
imaging vendor when the invest igator assessment indicates either (i) unequivocal disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1 criteria (for participants without RC) or (ii) unequivocal evidence 
of disease recurrence after RC, in order for BICR assessment of progression /recurr ence to be 
perform ed. The BICR will be completed and the resul ts provi ded to the site as specified in the 
imaging vendor documents, provided there are no pending imaging queries to the site. All details 
on the timelines and associated process requirements will be outlined in the Imaging Manual.
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Participants whose [progression or recurrence] is 
not confirmed by the BICR will be requi red to continue tum or assessments (if clinically  feasible) 
according to the protocol -specified schedule (Sect ion2) or sooner if clinically indicated. Also, if 
participants discont inue treatm ent without radiographic [progres sion or recurrence], tumor 
assessments will continue according to the protocol -specified schedule, as noted in Schedule of 
Activities (Secti on 2) until progressi on has been confirmed by  BICR (Secti on 9.1.2.2 ).
All study  treatm ent deci sions will  be based on the investigator’s assessment of tum or images and 
noton the BICR assessment.
9.1.2.3 Confirmation and Date of Progression or Recurrence

are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before compl eting the study.
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 3
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
Serious Adverse Drug React ions sectionin the IBrepresent the Reference Safety Inform ation to 
determine expectedness of SAEs for expedi ted reporti ng.
The collect ion of non-serious AEs (with the excepti on of non-serious AEs related to SARS -
CoV -2 infect ion) shoul d begin at initiation of study treatm ent. All SAEs, and all AEs (SAEs 
and non -serious AEs) associated with confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV -2 infect ion must be 
collected from the date of the participant’s written consent until 100 days following 
discontinuat ion of dosing.
All SAEs must be collected from the time of signing the consent, including those thought to 
be associ ated with protocol -specified procedures and within 100 day s of discont inuat ion of 
dosing .
For participants rando mized to trea tment and never treated with study  drug, SAEs shoul d be 
collected for 30 day sfrom the date of randomizat ion.For participants in Arm C, SAEs should 
be co llected for 100 days fo llowing RC.
The invest igator must report any  SAE that occurs after these t ime periods and that is believed 
to be rel ated to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure, (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ).
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment bu t after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF module.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours , as i ndicated 
in Appendix 3.
The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours
ofupdated informat ion being ava ilable .
CVA(any grade) is considered an AEOSI and shoul d be assessed for seriousness using the 
standard seriousness definit ion. However, all CVAs are requi red to follow the timelines for 
SAE reporting (eg,24 hours) . CVA management gui delines ,provi ded in Appendix 7,are no 
longer applicable per Prot ocol Amendment 04. 
Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study  participants. 
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged fro m the study, and he/sh e considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igator must prompt ly notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluat ing, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/ transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluation of a participant . Care shoul d be taken not to introduce bias when

collect ing AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement in 
the context of known AEs, when appropriate for the program or protocol.
All nonserious AEs (not only those deemed to be treatm ent-related) shoul d be collected 
continuously during the treatm ent period and for a minimum of 100 days fo llowing discont inuat ion
of adjuvant therapy  for Arm s A and B and 100 days from RCfor Arm  C. For parti cipants who do 
not continue adjuvant therapy in Arms A and B, AEs and/or SAEs should be collected for a period 
of 100 day s following RC.
Every  AE must be assessed by the invest igator with regard to whether it is considered 
immune -mediated. For events which are potenti ally immune -mediated, additional informat ion will 
be co llected on the participant’s case report form.
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me seriou s (see Appendix 3).
Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discont inuation of 
study  treatm ent and for those present at the end of study  treatm ent as appropri ate.
All ident ified nonseri ous AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Com pletion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory  abnorm alities that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the invest igator i s requi red to proactively fo llow each parti cipant 
at subsequent visit s/contacts. All SAEs, non -serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Sect ion
9.2), and AEs (SAEs and non -serious AEs) associ ated wi th confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV -2 
infect ion will be followed until resol ution, the condi tion stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, the event is deem ed irreversible, the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in 
Secti on 8.3) or for suspected cases, until SARS -CoV-2 infect ion is ruled -out.
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condi tion stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwi se explained, or until the participant is lost to fo llow-up (as defined in Sect ion9.2).
Further informat ion on fo llow-up procedures i s given in Appendix 3.
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prom pt notificat ion by the invest igator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essent ial so that legal 
obligat ions and ethical responsibilit ies towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
An invest igator who receives an invest igator safety report describing SAEs or other specif ic 
safet y information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the Invest igator’s Brochure and will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropri ate according to local 
requi rements.
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regul atory authori ties and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of

9.2.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  treatm ent, it is subsequent ly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 5 half-
lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of this event and co mplete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillanc e Form  to BMS 
Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance withSAE reporti ng 
procedures described in Appendix 3.
Serum  or urine pregnancy  tests will be perform ed on women of childbearing potenti al according 
to the Schedule of Activities. A negat ive pregnancy test result must be obtained before the 
administration of the study  drug(s).
A pregnancy test does not need to be performed on women who are postmenopausal. A definit ion 
of post -menopausal can be found in Appendix 4.
If a female participant beco mes pregnant, administration of the study drug(s) must be discont inued. 
Requi rements for reporting a pregnancy  are provi ded in Appendix 3. 
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outco me and, where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form .
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance 
inform ation from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this informat ion. Inform ation on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
If any sexual activi ty (eg,vaginal, anal, oral) has occurred between a male participant and a 
pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the information should be reported to the Sponsor or designee, even 
if the male part icipant has undergone a successful vasectomy . In order for Sponsor or desi gnee to 
collect any pregnancy surveillance informat ion from the female partner, the female partner(s) must 
sign an inform ed consent form for disclosure of this inform ation. Inform ation on the pregnancy 
will be co llected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
9.2.6 Immune-mediated Adverse Events
Immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism or 
immune -mediated component for which non-inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include even ts with an alternate etio logy which were 
exacerbated by the induction of autoimmunit y. Inform ation supporting the assessment will be 
collected on the participant’s case report form.

also be collected on select AEs primarily related to bempegaldesleukin , including hypotension, 
capillary  leak syndro me, and eosinophilic disorders. A list of relevant AE terms will be maintained 
by the Medical Surveillance Team/Drug Safet y Com mittee or equivalent.
9.2.7 Adverse E vents of Special Interest ( AEOSI)
CVA (any grade) is considered an AEOSI and shoul d be assessed for seriousness using the 
standard seri ousness defini tion. However, all CVAs are requi red to f ollow the timelines for SAE
reporti ng (eg,24 hours). CVA management guidelines ,provided in Appendix 7, are no longer 
applicable per Protocol Amendment 04.
9.2.8 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory  test resul t abnorm alities shoul d be captured on the nonseri ous AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form  electronic ,as appropri ate. Paper f orms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the el ectronic system is not functioning.
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the participant to have study  treatm ent
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting invest igator ( eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
9.2.9 Potential Drug -induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Specific criteria for identifying potential DILI have not been identified for this protocol . Standard 
medical pract ice in ident ifying and monitoring hepatic issues should be fo llowed.
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Secti on 9.2and Appendix 3 for reporting 
details).
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defined as:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 times ULN ( >2x baseline AND >3x ULN for 
participants wi th baseline elevat ion),
AND
Total  bilirubin > 2 times ULN (>2x baseline AND >2x ULN for participants with baseline

9.2.10 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, anyother potenti al safet y assessment required or not required by protocol  should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.
9.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdoses that meet the regulatory 
definit ion of SAE will be reported as an SAE (see Appendix 3).All instances of accidental 
overdose and/or dosing errors should be reported on t he Dosage Administration Record eCRF.

pCR comparison of Arm A vs Arm C in all randomized participants
EFS com parison of Arm A vs Arm C in all randomized participants
The overall 2-sided alpha for this study  is 0.05. For sample size determinat ion thisis split with 
0.001 for the pCR comparison and 0.049 for the EFS comparison.
According to the original  protocol  assumpt ionfrom 2019 ,the accrual rate of 17participants per 
monthestimated anaccrual period ofapproximately  32months for completion.Based on the 
revised accrual projection from April 2021 and the impact of COVID -19, the accrual period will 
take approximately  43 m onths to com plete.
Sample size consideration for the pCR primary comparison of Arm A vs Arm C
Assuming the pCR rate for the experimenta l and the control arms are 36% and 15% respectively ,11
a total of 360 p articipants (180 per arm) will provide approximately  90% power for the 2-sided 
test at overall sign ificance level of 0.001 . The analysis will occur when all rando mized participants 
will be eligible for pCR evaluation (approximately 4 months after the last participant is 
rando mized ).
Sample size consideration for the EFS primar y comparisons of Arm A vs A rm C
Amo ng the approximately 360 rando mized participants (180 per arm), approximately  156 EFS 
events provi de at least 88% power to detect a HR of 0.6 with an overall type 1 error of 0.049 
(2-sided). The EFS distributi on is assumed to be piecewise exponent ial with the following 
landmark values for the control group (Arm C): EFS rates of 43% at 36 months, 37% at 60 months 
and 25% at 120 months. These assumpt ions are based on the control arm (ie ,local radical therapy 
alone without n eoadj uvant therapy ) of MRC/EORTC BA06 Phase3study72incremented by 5% 
to account for the fact that a subset of participants did not undergo RC as definit ive treatm ent in 
that study . Proporti onal hazard is modeled for the treatm ent effect. The calculat ion accounts for 
approximately  11% drop out duri ng study  durati on (exponenti al wi th 5% by  12months).
Two interim analyses for EFS are planned and corresponding stopping boundaries will be based 
on an O’Brien and Fleming alpha spending function. The first will take place at the time of final 
pCR analysis (based on the assumpt ions, approximately 101 EFS events in Arms A and Cwill 
occur at this time). The second interim analysis will take place when approximately 85% of the 
total number of events have occurred (approximately133 EFS events in Arms A and C ). If the first 
interim analysis is performed exact ly at 101 events, the boundary  in terms of statistical  significance 
for declaring superi ority would be 0.01. If the second interim analysis is performed exact ly at 
133events, the boundary  in terms of statistical significance for declaring superi ority would be 
0.026 . The boundary  for declaring superi ority in terms of statistical significance for the final 
analysis after 156 eventsin Arms A and Cwoul d be 0.04. The final analysis of EFS is projected 
to occur approximately 65months after the start of the study  (approximately  43months accrual 
and 22months follow-up). Given the slowdown in events rate observed after 24 months in
histori cal data,which could prevent the analysis to be perform ed in a reasonable time window, if

Two interim analyses are planned and corresponding stopping boundaries will be based on an 
O’Brien and Fleming alpha spending funct ion. The first will  take pl ace at the time of second EFS 
analy sis (approximately  after 133 EFS events in ArmsA and C). At that time, approximately 
109OS events in Arms A and C are expected. The second interim analysis will take place at the 
time of final EFS analysis (approximately  156 EFS events in Arms A and C). At that time,
approximately  84% of the total  number of OS events will have occurred (approximately  131 OS 
events in Arms A and C ). In case EFS reaches significance at an interim  analysis, the subsequent 
OS analyses timing will be based on the OS number of events described above. The final analysis 
of OS will take place when 156 OS events in Arms A and C are observed, and it is projected to 
occur approximately  86months after the start of the study  (approximately  43months accrual and 
43months follow-up). If the 156thevent in Arms A and C has not occurred 44 months after 
rando mizat ion of the last participant, then the final OS analysis will take place at that time. In such 
case,the final analysis boundary will be re -calculated based on the actual updated final number of 
events.

Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Primary
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) in Arm A vs 
Arm C
The pCR rate is defined as the proportion of 
randomized participants with absence of any cancer 
(T0, N0) in pathology specimens after RC, as assess ed 
by blinded pathology review.pCR rates and corresponding 95% exact CIs will be 
calculated using the Clopper Pearson method for each 
treatment group in the all randomized participants 
populatio n. Participants who do not undertake surgery 
will be counted as non -pCR and will be included in 
the denominat or.
pCR rates will be compared usi ng a 2 -sided stratified 
Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test. Associated 
odds ratio and estimate of the difference with 99.9% 
and 95% CI will be calculated.
Event -Free Survival (EFS) in Arm A vs Arm C 
EFS is defined as time from randomization to any of 
thefollowing events: progression of disease that 
precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence , or death 
due to any  cause. Participants who die without a 
reported progression/disease recurrence will be 
considered to have experienced an event on the date of 
their death. Participants who did not report 
progression/recurrence of disease or die will be 
censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor 
assessment. Participants who did not have any on study 
tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on 
their date of randomization. Further details on the 
censoring rules for consideration of subsequent 
therapies will be described in the Statistical Analysi s 
Plan (SAP) .EFS will be analyzed in the all ran domized 
participants population.
EFS will be compared between 2arms with a 
stratified 2-sided log rank test. The hazard ratio and 
the corresponding 95% and (100 -adjusted alpha)% CI
will be estimated in a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model using the randomized arm as a single 
covar iate. The EFS curves for each randomized arm 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) 
product -limit method. In addition, EFS rates at 
specific time points will be estimated using KM 
estimates on the EFS curve for each randomized arm. 
Associated 2-side d 95% CIs will be calculated using 
the Greenwood formula (using log -log 
transformation). The EFS endpoint will be analyzed 
by BICR assessment (primary analysis) as well as by 
investigator (ie, all events assessed by the 
investigator)as sensitivity analysis. In the primary 
analy sis by BICR assessment, type of events that can 
only be assessed by investigator (s ee Section 9.1,eg,
worsening o f disease precluding surgery, abandoned 
resection due to unresectable disease) will be 
considered as events.
Additional s ensitivity analysis on EFS will also be 
performed, and details will be included in the SAP
.
Secondary
pCR in Arm B vs Arm C
Same definition as the corresponding primary endpoint .Similar analyses of pCR in Arm B vs Arm C will be 
conducted. The hypothesis testing will only be 
performed if the higher hierarchical endpoints are 
met, as described in the SAP.
EFS in Arm B vs Arm C 
Same definition as the corresponding primary endpoint .Similar analyses of EFS in arm B vs arm C will be

formula (using log -
log transformation).
The hazard ratio and the corresponding 95% will be
estimated in a stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model using the randomized arm as a single covariate. 
The stratificat ion factors for analysis are the following :
Clinical Stage (T2 N0vs T3 -T4aN0 vs T1
 -
T4aN1 )
PD-L1 status ( 1% vs < 1%/indeterminate)
Text related to alpha spending and hierarchical testing in the following paragraphs is not applicable 
in Protocol  Amendment 04. The overall 2-sided alpha for this study  is 0.05, which is split with 
0.001 for pCR and 0.049 for EFS for both Arm A vs Arm C co mpar ison. 
No formal powered compar ison of Arm A versus Arm B is planned, therefore, it may not be 
possible to draw any conclusio n from the trial results about the superiorit y of Arm  A co mpared to 
Arm B.

To control  the ty pe I error rate, the fo llowing hierarchical test ing approach will be implemented:
1)pCR: A vs C will be first tested at 0.001 alpha (two -sided)
2)pCR: B vs C will be tested at 0.001 alpha (two-sided) if i. was significant
3)EFS: A vs C will be tested at 0.049 (or 0.05 if ii. was significant) alpha (two -sided)
4)EFS: B vs C will be tested if iii. was significant and with the same alpha (two -sided)
5)OS: A vs C will be tested if iv. was significan t and wi th the same alpha (two -sided)
6)OS: B vs C will be tested if v. was significant and with the same alpha (two -sided)
This approach has a graphical representation, which is illustrated in Figure 10.3-1.
Figure 10.3-1: * Not Applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Graphical 
Representation of the Statistical Testing Approach
Given EFS and OS endpo ints are tested hierarchically using a group sequential approach, the 
overall hierarchical testing approach will be used where each endpo int/com parison will have its 
own specific Lan-DeMets alpha spending funct ion with the O’Br ien-Fleming type of boundaries.73

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SE RIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS : 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW U P AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defined as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent
and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not consi dered rel ated to the study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al laboratory  test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, cons idered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, t he reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis .
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condit ion including eit her an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study intervent ion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervent ion 
or a conco mitant medicat ion. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the invest igator), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardl ess of sequelae and 
shoul d specify "intent ional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospital).
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event i s not an AE per definit ion above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious condi tions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospi talizat ion (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studi es: 
a visit to the emergency room  or other hospi tal departm ent < 24 hours, that does not resul t 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol  for a pl anned medical/surgical procedure
routi ne health assessment requiring admissi on for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routi ne col onoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi te, family ci rcumstances, administrative reason)
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s)
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
Is an important m edical event (defined as a medical event(s) that m ay not be immediately life-
threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participant or may require intervent ion [e.g., medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchosp asm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.9 for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potenti al druginduced liver injury (DILI) must follow the same transmissio n timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).

Any co mponent of a study  endpoint that i s considered related to study  therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is an endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be rul ed out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine t he relat ionship.
Alternat ive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study intervent ion administratio n 
will be considered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Inform ation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opinio n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion 
and send a SAE fo llow-up report wi th the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow-up reports are requi red. (Note: Foll ow-
up SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensit y or relationship to study  treatm entor if new 
inform ation beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL DEFINITI ONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpingectomy
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medical 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence o f other bio logical or physio logical causes. In addit ion, femal es under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of

judgement in ch ecking serum FSH levels. 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the wom an can be considered 
postm enopausal.
End of Relevant Systemic Exposure
End of relevant systemic exposure is the time point where the IMP or any active major

Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is consid ered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
Continuous abstinence must begin at least 30 days prior to init iation of study  therapy
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly  effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego comple te abst inence 
Periodic abstinence (including but not limited to calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for t his study.
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may  differ from those when used consistently  and correctly . Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment , which may reduce the 
efficac y of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medicati ons will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine hormone releasi ng systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the absence of definitive drug 
interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness

APPENDIX 6 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM S
These general  guidelines const itute guidance to the Invest igator and may be supplemented by 
discussio ns with the Medical Moni tor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncol ogy agents and regimens.
A general princi ple is that different ial diagnoses shoul d be diligent ly evaluated according to 
standard medical pract ice. Non-inflammatory etiologies shoul d be considered and appropriately 
treated.
Corti costeroi ds are a primary therapy for immuno -oncol ogy drug -related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory  patients with low-
grade toxicit y. The lower bioavailabilit y of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultat ion with a medical or surgi cal specialist , especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeuti c procedure, is recommended.
The frequency and severit y of the rel ated adverse events covered by  these algori thms will  depend 
on the immuno -oncol ogy agent or regimen being used.

judgement of the Invest igator and/or discussio ns with the Medi cal Monitor representing the 
Sponsor.
CEREBROVA SCULAR ACCIDENT
ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT ALGORITHM
This guideline pertains to all participants receiving bempegaldesleukin (NKTR -214) in 
combination with nivolumab .
For unexplained neurological symptoms (such as hemiparesis, confusio n, dy sarthri a,or visual 
disturbances) thatmay be associ ated wi th CVA :
Recommend following the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Adult Suspected 
Stroke Algorithm that includes time -sensitive assessment and rtPA use guidance .a
Perform  neurological imaging wit hDWI MRI as soon as feasible after theinitialpresentation
of symptom s, preferably within 24 hours , or as indicated following an acute intervention
. 
DWI MRI is preferred, but if contraindicated, alternative imaging modalitiesmay be used.
If imaging is consistent with a CVA, proceed to the following :
1
For any new CVA event confirmed by imaging (DWI MRI
preferred unless 
contraindicated) , regardless ofneurol ogical symptom s (eg, cryptogeni c CVA)
, and for 
suspected TIA without clear alternat ive et iology:
Discontinue study  treatm ent for participants receiving bempegaldesleukin
in 
combinat ion with a checkpo int inhibitor (ie, nivolumab).

3
Perform  pertinent laboratory  assessments including coagul ation (D-dimer, complete 
blood coun twith differential, serum  blood urea ni trogen ,and creati nine)
 
, 
preferably by
 central  laboratory  testing. Local  laboratory  
testing is allowed when central laboratory  testing is not possible.

bempegaldesleukin is provi ded below. This general  guideline const itutes guidance to the 
Invest igator and may be supplemented by discussions wi th the Medical Moni tor representing the 
Sponsor.
As a general principle, differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to standard 
medical practice. Non- inflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropriately treated.
For patients with suspected CRS:
For Grade 1 or Grade 2 events, implement supportive care, including management of isolated 
symptoms based on institutional practices
Consider admitting the patient for monitoring and to provide supportive care, including management 
of isolated symptoms based on institutional practices and protocol management guideline 
(eg,hydration management guideline s in Section 7.1.1.1).
For patients with a persistent or worsening clinical condition after initial treatment of CRS, 
re-evaluate for other contributing conditions. It is particularly important to reassess the patient for 
coexisting infections, cardiac, pulmonary, thromboembolic, and other c omplications.

High- dose steroid (eg, solumedrol 2 mg /kg up to 1 gram daily 
for 3 days) may be considered for severe CRS that failed to 
respond after repetitive steroid treatments.
For severe CRS cases that require simultaneously aggressive 
management of hypotension, oxygenation and cardiac

APPENDIX 10 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TU MORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) WITH BMS MODIFICATIONS
1 EVALUATION OF LESION S
Solid tumors will be evaluated using Response Evaluat ion Criteria In Solid Tumors versio n 1.1 
(RECIST 1.1)guideline with BMS m odificati ons.1
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categori zed as measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimensio n (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by CT /MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) , or 2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologi cally enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT /MRI scan (scan slice thickness reco mmended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be ident ified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a  short axis of 
15mm by CT /MRI scan. Only  the short axi s of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter norm ally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved by  solid tum or. Nodal  size is norm ally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisit ion may be axial, sagi ttal or coronal ). The smaller of these measures is the short axi s. For 
example, an abdo minal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis o f 20mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, m easurable node. In this example, 20 mm  should be rec orded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm but < 15 mm) 
shoul d be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-patho logical and should not be recorded or fo llowed.
Note: Lesi ons on X -Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non -Target Lesions.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including small lesio ns (longest diameter 
<10mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesio ns considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdo mina l 
masses/abdo minal organomegaly  identified by physical exam  that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.

1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techni ques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesio ns. 
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blast ic lesions, wit h identifiable softtissuecomponents , that 
can be evaluated by  cross secti onal imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesio ns if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of measurabilit y 
described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable .
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non- Target’ Lesions
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum  of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all invo lved organs shou ld 
be ident ified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respect ively will be recorded).
Note: A maximum o f two l esions can be selected per organ system . For example, a maximum o f 
two lung lesio ns can be selected (selected from one lung or one lesio n fro m each). A maximum o f 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (l esions wi th the longest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in additi on shoul d be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated m easurem ents. It m ay be the case that, o n occasion, the largest lesio n does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axi s is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as ref erence to f urther characteri ze any objective tum or regressi on in 
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patho logical lymph nodes shoul d be identified as 
non-target lesions and shoul d also be recorded at basel ine. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions shoul d be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to foll ow). In addi tion, it is possible to record m ultiple non-target l esions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘m ultiple liver m etastases’).

2 RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance o f all target lesio ns. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% i ncrease in the sum of  diameters of target l esions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study ). In addi tion to the rel ative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an abso lute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also 
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diam eters while on study .
Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too sm all to measure (due to missing or poor quali ty images), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased 
sufficient ly to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
2.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes ident ified as target lesions shoul d always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (m easured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examinati on), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm o n study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if compl ete response criteria are met, since a norm al 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case report forms or other data collectio n 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesio ns recorded in a separate sectio n 
where, in order to qualify for CR, each node m ust achieve a short axis < 10 mm . For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesio ns.
2.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study , all lesions (nodal  and non-nodal ) recorded at baseline shoul d have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluat ion, even when very small (eg,2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
beco me so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion o f the rad iologist that the lesio n 
has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm . If the lesi on is believed to 
be present and is faint ly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned
as the ref erence diameter. (Note: It is less likely that thi s rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually  have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to m easure, a def ault value of  5 mm shoul d be assigned in this circumstance as well). This

defaul t value is derived fro m the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potenti ally non-reproducible, therefore 
provi ding this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement 
error. To rei terate, however, if the radi ologist i s able to provi de an actual  measure, that shoul d be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm .
2.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions shoul d be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane betwe en 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance shoul d be the maximal longest diameter for the 
‘coal esced lesio n’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions
This section provides the defini tions of the criteria used to de termine the tumor response for the 
group of non -target lesio ns. While some non -target lesio ns may actually be measurable, they  need 
not be measured and instead shoul d be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target l esions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-patho logical in size (< 10mm short axi s). 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target l esion(s)
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of exist ing non -target l esions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target di sease requi res addi tional explanati on as fo llows:
2.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable disease
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there 
must be an overall level o f substant ial worse ning in non -target di sease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesio ns is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progressi on status. Pleural  effusions, pericardial 
effusio ns and ascites will not be fo llowed as target or non -target l esions and will not contribute to 
response or progression. The designati on of overall progressi on solely on the basis of change in 
non-target di sease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
2.2.1.2 When the patient has only non -measurable disease
This circumstance arises in so me trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general  concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretati on of an increase in non -measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in no n-target disease cannot be easily quant ified (by definit ion:

if all lesio ns are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall  disease burden based on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be requi red to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden represent ing an addit ional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangit ic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to requi re a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal  progressi on’ is seen, the 
patient shoul d be cons idered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substant ial.
2.2.2 New Lesions
The ap pearance of new malignant lesio ns denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identificat ion of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesio ns may be simply 
healing or flare of pre -exist ing lesio ns). This is parti cularly important when the pat ient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesio n may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cyst ic lesio n, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collect ions (pleural effusi ons, pericardial  effusions, and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesio ns and will not contribute to response or progression. In the event a new fluid 
collect ion is seen on a post -baseline imaging exam, a comment m ay be made, but the appearance 
ofa new fluid collect ion alone shoul d not resul t in an assessment of Progressive Di sease (PD). A 
lesion ident ified on a follow-up study  in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progressi on. An example of this is the pat ient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imagi ng at baseline. A lesion ident ified on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesio n and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of it s small size, continued fo llow-up evaluat ion 
will clarify  if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely  a  new 
lesion, then progressi on shoul d be declared using the date of the initial scan. While FDG -PET 
response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of 
FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (parti cularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be ident ified according 
to the following algorithm:
1)Negativ e FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesio n.
2)No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confi rmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive 
FDG -PET at f ollow-up is not confi rmed as a new site of disease on CT, addi tional follow-up

CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that si te (if so, the 
date of  PD will be the date of  the initial abnorm al FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre -exist ing site of disease on CT that i s not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
2.3 Response Assessment
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from  the start of the study  treatm ent until 
disease progressi on or the last response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmat ionand censoring rules regarding subsequent therapy . The patient’s best overall response 
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study 
and the protocol requireme nts, it may  also requi re confi rmatory  measurement.
2.3.2 Time Point Response
At each protocol  specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Table 2.3.2 -1provides a 
summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease 
only, Table 2.3.2 -2is to be used.

aNon-CR/no n-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used as endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.3.3 Best Overall Response
Best response determination of complete or partial response requi res confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
4 weeks (28 days) later. In thi s circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.3-1. When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified 
minimum t ime from the date of first treatment or rando mizat ion date.
For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 (7 days) for a particular 
proto col, a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subject is on -study  for a minimum  of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-study  of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on study).  If thesubject is not on -study 
for at least this amount of time, any tumor assessment indicat ing stable disease before this time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is ident ified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum o f target lesio ns 
and the nodes decrease to ‘norm al’ size (< 10 mm), they  may still have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overst ate progression shoul d it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on w hether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response i s PR.
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assi gned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor m easurements 
must be confi rmed by consecut ive or subsequent repeat assessments that should be performed no 
less than 28 days after the cri teria for response are first met. Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may provide confirmat ion of apreviously ident ified CR even with an intervening NEor PR(eg, 
CR NE CRor CR PR CR).Subsequent documentati on of a PR may provi de confirma tion of a
previously ident ified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (eg, PR NE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR /CRs for confirmat ion.
Verification of Progression :Progressi on of disease should be ver ified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progressio n should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

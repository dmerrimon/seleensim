Title of study: A randomized, evaluator -blinded, no- treatment controlled, multi -center 
study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Sculptra Aesthetic for 
correction of cheek wrinkles.
Study population: Women or men over 21 years of age with the intent to undergo 
correction of cheek wrinkles . 
Countries involved, 
number of 
sites/country:United States, up to 13 sites
Number of subjects : 150 subjects 
Study Design This is a prospective, randomized, evaluator -blinded, no- treatment 
controlled study. Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized (2:1) 
to either treatment with Sculptra Aesthetic (Treatment Group) or no 
treatment (Control Group), 100 subjects to treatmen t with Sculptra 
Aesthetic and 50 subjects to no treatment. At least 15 subjects will be 
Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) IV, and a least 1 4will be FST V -VI.
Effectiveness and safety data will be collected for up to 12 months 
following the initial treatment.
All subjects will be offered to participate in an open extension stud y 
beginning after successful completion of this study. Subjects in the no-
treatment control group will be offered treatment with Sculptra
Aesthetic in the extension study. Subj ects in the treatment group will 
continue to be followed foradditional data collection as described in the 
extension study protocol.

Investigational 
product :Sculptra Aesthetic is a sterile, freeze -dried, injectable poly -L-lactic acid
(PLLA) with excipients . Each vial of dry powder contains: 
150 mg PLLA
90 mg sodium carboxymethylcellulose
127.5 mg of non -pyrogenic mannitol
The contents in one vial will be reconstituted prior to use by the 
addition of 8 mL of sterile water for injection ( SWFI )at the 
investigational site.
Immediately prior to injection, 1 mLof 2% lidocaine will be added to 
make a total volume of 9 mL.
Refer ence therapy : No treatment.
Treatment regimen
andlocation of treated 
area :Each subject in the treatment group will receive a single regimen of 
Sculptra Aesthetic . A single regimen consists of up to four ( 4)injection 
sessions with 1 -month (+ 5week) intervals. Sculptra Aesthetic will be 
administered using a 25G (gauge) needle using the bolus, fanning, 
cross -hatching ,linear threading injection technique or other technique s
at the discretion of the Treating Investigator .  Injections will be made
subdermally, i.e. in the subcutaneous and suprape riosteal region. A 
maximum of 18 mL(2 vials) of Sculptra Aesthetic will be administered 
per treatment session with a maximum of 9 mL(1 vial) per cheek, 
evenly distributed within the treatment area.
The tr eatment area is within the following borders:
  Superior border - from top of tragus to top of alar crease
  Medial border - from top of the alar crease, along the nasolabial fold 
(NLF )to the inferior border of the mandibular ramus
  Inferior border - from medial border at mandibular ramus to angle of 
mandibular ramus
  Lateral border - from angle of mandibular ramus to top of tragus

Safety Assessment (s):1. Adverse Event reporting: AEs will be obtained from signs and 
symptoms reported by the subjects or dete cted during each examination.
2. A subject diary will be dispensed to all subjects in the treatment 
group for daily completion for 28 days beginning on injection day for 
each treatment with direct questioning for pain, tenderness, redness, 
bruising, swelling, itching, lumps/bumps and “other ”. Subjects will be 
specifically asked to record any of the following s ymptoms in the other 
section; changes in vision (i.e. loss of vision, blurriness, double vision, 
pain in or around your eye, blindness, blind sp ots, problems moving 
your eyes), skin changing color around the eyelids, crusty or scabby 
skin around the eyelids, pain, headache, fever, dizziness, confusion, 
weakness or numbness in the arms or legs, changes to consciousness or 
alertness, difficul ty spea king/ speech impairment and face droop.
3. Functionality, sensation, firmness, symmetry, mass formation and 
palpation tests according to pre -defined methods, at baseline and at each 
on-site follow -up visit.
4. Device deficiencies will be assessed at treatment visits.
5. Visual function assessments will be performed before and 30 minutes 
following injection and at all scheduled follow up visits.
Statistical Methods: Principles for the analysis
For a si gnificant result, the two -sided p -value of the comparison of 
responder rates between the treated and untreated subjects at month 12
using the Fisher’s exact test needs to be smaller than 0.05. The 
estimates of the responder rate in each treatment group wil l be 
presented along with the difference in responder rates. Corresponding 
confidence intervals for both responder rates and difference in 
responder rates and p- value for difference in responder rates will also be 
presented.

Page 12of 70The secondary endpoints of ) as assessed 
live by the Blinded Evaluator will be analyzed in the same way. Results 
for the right and left side of the face separately as well as combined will 
be presented.
All other secondary effectiveness endpoints will be analyz ed 
descriptively, including 95% confidence intervals.
All safety endpoints will be analyzed descriptively.
Sample size
A total sample size of approximately 150 subjects will be included in 
this study; approximately 100 will be randomized to treatment with 
Sculptra Aesthetic and approximately 50 will be randomized to no 
treatment. Sample size justifications are given below.
Previous data
Since the primary endpoint will be based on a new scale, no existing 
data is available.
Assumptions : Based on what is seen in clinical studies of injectable 
fillers in the facial areas, it is reasonable to assume a responder rate of 
at least 70 % in the Sculptra Aesthetic treatment group at month 12. For 
the no treatment control group, respon derrates up to almost 30% have
been observed in data on file. Based on this, it is assumed that the 
response rate will be maximum 35% in the no- treatment control group 
at month 12.
Sample size calculation
For the responder rate in , testing the difference using a two -
sided test at the 5% significance level will have approximately 90% 
power to demonstrate difference between a responder rate of 70% in the 
Sculptra Aesthetic group, and a responder rate of 3 5% in the no 
treatment control group when the sample sizes are 84and 42, 
respe ctively. Accounting for 1 5% drop- outs, approximately 150 
subjects need to be randomized i n a 2 :1 ratio .

2 Backg round Information
2.1 Indication and population description
Sculptra Aesthetic isindicated foruseinimmune competent people assingle regimen for correction 
of shallow to deep nasolabial fold (NLF) contour deficiencies and other facial wrinkles. (2)
This is a 12- month study to assess the effectiveness and safety of Sculptra Aesthetic for the correction 
of cheek wrinkles . Approximately 150 subjects , out of which at least 15 will be Fitzpatrick skin type 
(FST) IV, and 14 will be FST V -VI, will be enrolled. Subject sfulfilling all inclusion criteria but no 
exclusion criteria as outlined here in the protocol will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either treatment 
with Sculptra Aesthetic (Treatment Group) or no treatment (Co ntrol Group).
After successful completion of the study ,subjects will be offered to participa te in an open extension 
study. Subjects in the no- treatment control group will then be offered treatment with Sculptra
Aesthetic . Subjects in the treatment group w ill continue to be followed for additional data collection 
as described in the extension study protocol. The sponsor plans to submit the clinical data obtained in 
the initial 12 -month study in support of the cheek wrinkles indication to the Sculptra Aesthetic label 
as a Panel -Track supplement.

Page 26of 70Investigator blinding will be accomplished by using a Treating Investigator to administer the 
treatments and a Blinded Evaluator, to whom randomization and treatment are concealed, to conduct 
the blinded assessments . Safety assessments will be performed by non -blinded personnel.
Eligible subjects will perform a screening visit and baseline visit, these visits may be combined if 
appropriate. All subjects randomized to receive treatment will be injected by the Treating 
Investigator at Day 1, the procedure is outlined in section 6. Sufficient amount of product, as 
determined by the Treating Investigator, should be injecte d to achieve optimal correction , which is 
defined as at least a one grade improvement on the  Scale At 
Rest and best correction that could be achieved as agreed upon by the Treating Investigator and the 
subject . Three additional treatment sessions may be performed if needed to achieve optimal 
corre ction, as determined by the Treating Investigator and subject. Treatment will stop when optimal 
correction has been achieved and subsequent visits will be follow -up visits. All subjects in both the 
treatment and the control group will return to the clinic at month 7, 9 and 12. The Schedule of Events 
is outlined in Tables 1 & 2.
4.2 Number of subjects
Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled . The duration of the enro llment period is expected to be 
three months.
4.3 Duration of subject participation
The total duration of the study is expected to be 17 months. A subject will be involved in the study for 
up to 13.5 months. 
Note: One month is defined as 4 weeks in the study.
End of study is when enrol lment has reached the target number of subjects and all subjects have 
completed the last study visit.
4.4 Randomization and blinding
4.4.1 Randomization
Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized (2:1) to either treatment with Sculptra Aesthetic
(Treatment Group) or no treatment (Control Group). At le ast 15 subjects will be Fitzpatrick skin type 
(FST) IV, and a least 1 4subjects will be FST V -VI. Before starting the study , a randomization list 
will be prepared under the supervision of a designated statistician from the Sponsor .The 
randomization will be stratified by FST group (FST I-III, FST IV, and FST V -VI). Subjects in the 
FST I-III stratum will be further stratified by center ; subjects in the FST IV and FST V -VI strata will 
not be further stratified by center due to the smal l sample size in these groups , randomization numbers 
will be allocated in ascending sequential order to each subject .Randomization will be performed 
using an Interactive Response System by assigning each subject to treatment group or control group
accordi ng to the randomization list.
4.4.2 Blinding
Blinding will be accomplished by using a Treating Investigator to administer the treatments and a 
Blinded Evaluator, to whom randomization and treatment are concealed, to conduct the blinded 
assessments. The Treating Investigator will not be blinded. The Blinded Evaluator is not allowed to 
discuss treatments with the Treating Investigator or subjects. No study related documents that contain 
information regarding the treatment of subjects should be available to the Blin ded Evaluator. Safety 
assessments will be performed by non -blinded personnel who are qualified by training and 
experience.

4.5 Medical history
History of relevant surgical events and medical conditions should be documented (including anyprior 
dermatological procedures or implants) in the electronic case report forms (eCRF) using medical 
terminology.
4.6 Prior and c oncomitant therapies
4.6.1 Definition
Prior therapies are def ined as therapies that have been used within 30 days of the Screening visit or 
within the timelines specified in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria .
Concomitant therapies are defined as follows:
any existing therapies ongoing at the time of the Screening visit,
any changes to existing therapies (such as changes in dose or formulation) during the course 
of the study, or
any new therapies received by the subject since the Screening visit
4.6.2 Categories
The following three categories are to be considered for prior and concomitant therapies:
Drugs/therapies including but not limited to prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), birth 
control pills/patches/hormonal devices, vitamins, herbal medicines/supplements, and 
homeopathic preparations .
Medical and surgical procedures including, but not limited to dental work, such as root canals 
or sinus surgery
 Aesthetic procedures including , Resurfacing (laser, photomodulation, light, radiofrequency, 
ultrasound, chemical peel, dermabrasion, or other ablative/non -ablative procedures, needling 
or mesotherapy, cryotherapy, neurotoxin injections, lipolytic injections (e.g. dexycholic acid 
or other lipolytic substances), previous tissue augmenting therapy, contouring or 
revitalization treatment in the face.
4.6.3 Recording
Prior and concomitant therapies are to be recorded in source documents and on the appropriate form
in the eCRF. Concomitant therapies are to be recorded, reviewed, and updated at each visit. Any new 
concomitant therapy or modification of an existing therapy may be linked to an AE. A corresponding 
AE form must be completed to account for the change in therapy, except in some cases such as 
therapy used for prophylaxis, or dose modification for a chronic condition.
4.6.4 Authori zed concomitant therapies
Unless listed in prohibited concomitant therapies ( Section 4.6.5 ), all therapies are authori zed.
4.6.5 Prohibited concomitant therapies

a.with Collagen or Hyaluronic Acid 
b.with Calcium Hydroxyapatite (CaHa), Poly L -Lactic Acid (PLLA) or permanent (non -
biodegradable
Participation in any interventional clinical study . 
The study product contains lidocaine, but additional local anesthesia may be used. Lidocaine 
should however be used with caution in subjects receiving other local anesthetics or agents 
structurally rel ated to amide -type anesthetics, e.g. certain anti -arrhythmics , as the systemic 
toxic effects can be additive.
If a prohibited therap ybecome sa necessary treatment for the safety or best interest of the subject, the 
Sponsor should be notified , time permitt ing,to discuss possible alternatives prior to administration of 
a prohibited therapy.
If a subject receives prohibited therapy during the clinical study, the Sponsor should be notified to 
discuss the pertinence and the modalities for the subject to contin ue in the clinical study.

randomization, each subject will be assigned a subject numbers that will be allocated in ascending 
order within each center. A screen failure is a subject who signed the informed consent but never 
enrolled (i.e. was randomized and/or received treatment) in the study. For screen failures, the subject 
source documents should indicate which assessments have been made and the reason why the subject 
was determined to be a screen failure. A screen failure should not be re -entered in the study.
For the duration of the clinical study, each subject will be identified using the s ubject number for all 
documentation and discussion.
5.5 Withdrawal of subjects
Each subject should be advised in the ICF that the subject has the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time, for any reason, without prejudice.  Subjects may also be discontinued from this study if the 
investigator determines that it is in the subject’ s best interest to do so, and may be withdrawn at the 
investigator discretion at any time.  
The withdrawal criteria are:
Medical Reasons If the subject suffers from a medical condition and/or adverse events 
that, in the judgment of the Investigator makes it medically necessary to 
withdraw the subject. The specific rationale for Investigator -initiated 
withdrawal of a subject for medical reasons should document the 
specific condition for withdrawing the subject.
Withdrawal by 
Subject:Includes consent withdrawal, subject relocation, schedule conflicts. A 
subject can withdraw their consent to participate in the study at their own 
request or be withdrawn from participation in the study at the request of 
their legally authorized representative at any time for any reason.
Lost to follow -up: If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort shall 
be made to contact that subject, confirm with three documented phone 
calls and a certified letter (delivery receipt requested) without answer 
before declaring the subject lost to follow -up.
Other: This category is to be used for a subject who discontinues due to a 
reason other than as specified in the pre -defined categories above. 
Explain the reason for discontinuation.
The reason and date for withdraw al should be documented in the subject’s source document sand 
eCRFs.  When possible, an explanatory comment should be added to further explain the reason for 
the withdrawal.  If withdrawal of a subject occurs during a regular study visit, the eCRF for that 
specific visit shall be completed as far as possible.  
If withdrawal of a subject occurs between regular study visits, the subject should when possible 
(irrespective of the reason for withdrawal) be scheduled for a termination visit to document s ubject

6.4.3 Product accountability
The study product will be released to the Investigator or his/her authorized designee after study 
approvals have been received from the FDA and IRB and the CTA has been signed by all parties.
The Investigator must ensure that the study products are kept in a secure location, with access limited 
to those authorize d by the Investigator.
The study products must be traceable from the manufacturer to their use in subjects until return or 
disposal. It is therefore important that the Investigator maintains accurate product accountability 
records, i.e. documentation of th e physical location of all investigational products, deliveries, and 
return of investigational products between the Sponsor and the Investigator, and documentation of 
administration of product to the subject.
When the study is completed, all unused or expired investigational product at each study site shall be 
returned to the Sponsor representative for destruction, or be destroyed locally at the site if 
documented as agreed with Sponsor.
Any malfunctioning investigational products shall be reported as d escribed in Section 8.7.3. 
Products deliberately or accidentally destroyed during shipment or at a study site shall be accounted 
for and documented. Used vials, syringes, needles, and any unused material must be discarded 
immediately after the treatment s ession and must not be reused due to risk for contamination of the

The study products must not be used outside of the study.
All study products sent to the Investigator will be accounted for and no unauthorized use is 
permitted.
6.5 Treatment
6.5.1 Treatment procedure 
The investigational product is reserved for use by Treating Investigators who are experienced in 
treating cheek wrinkles.  
Before treatment, the subject will be informed about the expected post -treatment e vents thatshould 
be recorded in the subject diary and potential risks involved w ith the treatment and when to contact 
the Investigator in case of emerging symptoms.
The investigational product is reserved for use by doctors trained in the appropriate injection 
technique. Injection procedures are associated with a risk of infection. As eptic technique and
standa rd practice to prevent cross -infections should be observed at all times including the use of 
disposable gloves during the injection procedure. All traces of make -up in the treatment area should 
be removed prior to any injection. The treatment site should be cleaned with a suitable antiseptic
solution.
An ice pack can be applied on the site for a short per iod. Topical orlocal injection anesthesia ma y be 
used to further reduce pain on injection. If (topical or local) anesthetic or ice is used, the area should 
be cleaned after anesthetic is removed. The use of anesthetic or ice should be recorded in the source 
documentation and on the eCRFs.
Sculptra Aesthetic (sterile, freeze -dried, injectable poly -L-lactic acid) is available in 367.5 mg dose 
vials and will be reconstituted prior to use by the addition of 8 ml of SWFI at the investigational site 
following the reconstitution instructions in the study IFU.
Immediately prior to injection, 1 mL of 2% lidocaine shall be added to make a total volume of 9 mL 
and the vial should be shaken
For intravascular complications or embolic events, the treating physician should provide prompt 
medical attention and follow relevant clinical practice guidelines (8)for handling these symptoms. 
The treating physician should also review the Intravascular Treatment Protocol provided separately as 
a supportive tool.
Sculptra Aesthetic will be administered using a 25G needle. Injections will be made subdermally, i.e. 
in the subcutaneous and supraperiosteal region. A maximum of 18 mL(2 vials) of Sculptra Aesthetic
will be administered per treatment session wit h a maximum of 9 mL(1 vial) per cheek, evenly 
distributed within the treatment area. 
In this study, the study pr oducts will be administered in the Treatment area defined within the 
following anatomical borders:
  Superior border - from top of tragus to top of alar crease
  Medial border - from top of the alar crease, along the NLF to the inferior border of the 
mandi bular ramus
  Inferior border - from medial border at mandibular ramus to angle of mandibular ramus
  Lateral border - from angle of mandibular ramus to top of tragus

Page 45of 70Injection technique
The injection technique isimportant fortheaestheticeffectofthetreatment. It is recommended to use 
a standard inj ection technique for all subjects per site to limit variability due to technique. Before 
product is injected, aspiration should be done to avoid intravascular injection.
The injection technique is at the discretion of the investigator, proposed techniques are:
Antegrade linear threading : also called push- ahead technique as some product is pushed ahead 
of the needle. Once the needle is in place, the product is injected ahead while inserting the 
needle in the tissue .
Retrograde linear threading : the needle is threaded into the tissue at the appropriate depth, and 
the product in injected as a straight line on withdrawal of the needle
Bolus : multiple aliquot injections of the product is injected along a line or regions of the 
tissues
Fanning : a number of linear threads to spread the product over a wider area
Cross -hatching : combines multiple injections of linear threading that crisscross at right angle to 
provide volume in a square shape
6.5.2 Treatment regimen (dose and interval )
Eligible subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive a single regimen of Sculptra 
Aesthetic . A single regimen consists of up to 4 injection sessions with 1 -month (+ 5week s) intervals. 
The first treatment will be administered on Day 1/ Baseline visit. Sufficient amount of study product, 
as determined by the Treating Investigator, should be injected to achieve optimal correction:
  Optimal correction is defined as at least a one-stepimprovement on the  
t and the best correction that can be achieved as agreed by 
Treating Investigator and subject.
  Three additional treatment sessions may be performed if needed to achieve optimal 
correction, as determined by the Treating Investigator and subject.
Treatment will stop when optimal correction has been achieved and subsequent visits will be follow -
up visits. Treatment will not be performed if the subject has a disease or condition described in the 
exclusion criteria, or an ongoing treatment -related AE that in the opinion of the Treating Investigator 
would be worsened by a treatment.
6.5.3 Post-treatment care
The subject should avoid excessive sun, UV lamp exposure and extreme temperature until any initial 
swelling and redness has resolved.
The subject sh ould be asked to avoid touching or shaving the treated area and not to apply any creams 
or cosmetics in the treated area before the skin has healed completely in order to prevent infections or 
elicit an inflammatory reaction. The subject should also be rem inded to abstain from prohibited 
medications, treatments, and procedures.
A subject diary will be handed out after each treatment session, and the subject should be reminded to 
record all expected symptoms in the treated area.
Detailed information regarding the post -treatment care and patient instruction is provided in the study 
IFU. 
6.5.4 Post-trial provisions
In time, the implant will be degraded in the body and additional treatments will be necessary to 
maintain the aesthetic result.

Page 53of 70Information on AEs can also be obtained from signs and symptoms detected during each examination 
by the Investigator or designee, which should include visual inspection of the treatment a rea.
AEs must be documented in the source document and eCRF without regard for cause or relation to 
investigational product. Events that occur after Screening but prior to randomization should be 
recorded in the subject’s medical history. 
If in the proces s of the interview, additional information regarding medical history or pre -planned 
medical or surgical procedures is revealed, it must be documented in the source document(s) and the 
eCRF.
It is the responsibility of the Treating Investigator to determine severity of the AE and relatedness of 
the event to the study product and/or injection procedures.  Adverse Events must be r eported as 
outlined below in section 8.6. 
8.1 Assessment of AEs by direct questioning to subject and evaluation of subject
Each subj ect should be questioned about AEs at each visit following randomization and/or treatment.
Definition and Reporting requirements are found in section 8.6. 
8.2 Subject Diary Data
A subject diary will be dispensed to all s ubjects for daily completion for 28 days beginning on 
injection day for each treatment with direct questioning for pain, tenderness, redness, bruising, 
swelling, itching, lumps/bumps and “other ”. 
The subject will also be specifically instructed to record presence of any of the following symptoms in 
the “other” section ; Changes in vision (i.e. loss of vision, blurriness, double vision, pain in or around 
your eye, blindness, blind spots, problems moving your eyes), Skin changing color around the eyelids, 
Crusty or scabby skin around the eyelids, Pain, Headache, Fever, Dizziness, Confusion, Weakness or 
numbness in the arms or legs, Changes to consciousness or alertness, Difficul ty speaking/ speech 
impairment or Face droop . The diary will include specific instructions to seek immediate medical 
attention if any of these symptoms or signs are observed.
Diary data will be counted and displayed separately from other AE data.
8.3 Laboratory assessments
For all women of childbearing potential, including thos e currently using contraception, a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at screening and all injection visits (prior to treatment). The test 
result must be negative for the subject to receive any treatment with study product.  The test result 
will be doc umented in source data and the eCRF.
8.4 Visual Function assessments
Visual function assessment swill be performed for all subjects. For subjects in the treatment group, the 
assessments will be performed both prior to and post injection of the study product at baseline and all 
scheduled treatment visits. The post-treatment assessments should be performed 30 min after the 
injections are completed. In the event of blindness or any significant ophtha lmic sign or symptom,

of visual disturbances, regardless of relationship to study product or seriousness, areconsidered 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and include but are not limited to thefollowing: any loss of 
vision, blurry vision, double vision, pain in or around the eye, blind spot or shadow in the visual field, 
trouble moving eyes. AESI’s should be reported (using the Adverse Event Clarification Form) within 
24 hours of awareness . Please refer to recording instructions in section 8.6.6 .
8.4.1 Snellen visual acuity test 
A Snellen Eye Chart will be used to assess visual acuity for distance vision.  Visual Acuity will be 
conducted using the subject’s best distance correction (e.g. with contacts or spectacles) at a distance of 
6 feet from  the chart.  Each eye will be m easured separately by either using an occluder or having the 
subject cover one eyeat a time.  The subject will be asked to start reading the letters at the top of the 
chart working their way to the bottom.  The smallest row of letters that the subject can read will indicate 
their visual acuity listed on the chart.  Snellen Visual Acuity will be recorded in their source 
documentation and eCRF.  If there are two or more visual acuity line changes during the course of 
study, these should be reviewed and assessed by the Investigator for a potential adverse event.
8.4.2 Extraocular muscle function test
Extraocular muscle function testing examines the function of the eye muscles.  This test observes the 
movement of the eyes in six specific directions to evaluate weakness or other problem s in the 
extraocular muscles.  The subject will be asked to sit or stand with their head up and looking straight 
ahead.  The assessor will hold a pen or other object approximately 16 inches in front of the subject’s 
face.  The assessor will then move the object in several directions and ask the subject to follow it with 
their eyes, without moving their head.  Normal or Abnormal will be recorded in the source 
documentation and eCRF.  Changes in movement of the eyes during the course of the study should be 
reviewed and assessed by the Investigator for a potential adverse event.
8.4.3 Confrontation visual field
The Confrontation Visual Field test will be used to assess the subject’s peripheral vision.  The 
examiner will sit facing the subject, about 3 to 4 feet away from the subject and ask the subject to fix 
their gaze on the examiner’s eye.  The examiner will hold their arms straight out to the side and bring 
their hands into the subject’s visual field from the sides in each quadrant.  The subject will signal as 
soon as the hand is seen.  Results will be recorded as normal or abnormal in the source documentation 
and eCRF.  Changes in the visual field of the eyes during the course of the study should be reviewed 
and assessed by the Investigator for a pote ntial adverse event.
8.5 Other safety assessments
At all physical visits, a study staff member who is qualified by training and experience to perform 
safety assessments, will assess each subject’s cheek sensation ; firmness and symmetry; and mass 
formation. Afte r treatment with the study product, product palpability will be performed at each 
physical visit.
8.5.1 Cheek sensation 
Cheek sensation will be tested at all physical study visits using two methods:
1) Monofilament test -assessing the subject’s ability to feel the sensation of a 0.4G monofilament 
on 3 points on right and left cheek and
2) Cotton Wisp test - assessing the subject’s ability to feel the sensation of a cotton wisp on 3 
points on the right and left cheek . The 3 dif ferent points on each side will be tested randomly.

point. Any lack of sensation should be further assessed by the Investigator for confirmation of any 
potential adverse event. 
. 
8.5.2 Cheek firmness , symmetry and function
At all physical visits, a study staff member who is qualified by training and experience to perform 
safety assessments will assess each subject’s cheek firmness, symmetry (with face at rest and with 
eyes tightly closed), and function (puff cheeks, broad smile, and chewing motion). These parameters 
will be rated as “Normal” or “A bnormal.” Anyabnormal result should be further assessed by the 
Investigator for confirmation of any potential adverse event.   
8.5.3 Mass formation
Mass formation in the cheeks will be assessed by a study staff member that is qualified by training and 
experience to perform safety assessments at screening/baseline and at all physical visits. Mass formation 
will be defined as lumps or aggregation of coherent material. An assessment of mass formation is to be 
recorded as an adverse event.
8.5.4 Device palpability -only for subjects in the treatment group
Device palpability will be assessed at each scheduled post -treatment visit and will assess whether or 
not the palpability is the normal expected feel. An unexpected feel is to be recorded as an adverse 
event.  
8.6 Adverse events
8.6.1 Definition of an adverse event
An AEis any untoward medical occurrence , unintended disease or injury ,or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons1, whether or not related to 
the study product . 
This definition include s:
a)events related to the investigational product or the reference product
b) e vents related to the procedures involved
8.6.2 Definition of a serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that:
a)led to death ,
b)led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject,thateither resulted in
1.a life -threatening2illness or injury , or
2.a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function , or
                                                
1For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the investigational product.
2The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe. (Source: ICH -E2A clinical safety data management : definitions and standards for expedited 
reporting ).

permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function,
c)led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital a bnormality or birth defect
In cases of doubt , whether an AEfulfils a serious criterion or not , there should be a predisposition to
report as a SAE rather than not report as such (see S ection 8.6.5 ).
8.6.3 Definition of unanticipated adverse effect 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the investigational product, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity , or degree of incidence, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the right, safety or welfare 
of the subject (see US requirement CFR 812.3 (s).
8.6.4 Recording instructions
Each subject with an AE occurring after enro llment through study exit should be fully recorded in the 
source document(s) for further transcription into the eCRF.  Each subject should be questioned about 
AEs at each study visit following randomization and treatment.  .The question asked should 
be:”Since your last clinical visit ;have you had any health problems ?”Information on AE s can also be 
obtained from signs and symptoms detected during each examination or from a laboratory test , 
observ ations made by the study sitepersonnel , subject diaries ,or spontaneous reports from the 
subjects or their relatives . 
When an AE is related to a device deficiency (refer to Section 8.7), including technical device 
malfunction, the AE shall be recorded on the AE form/module in the eCRF and the technical 
complaint shall be reported separately on the clinical study complaint f orm,provided separately in the 
investigator file , and the eCRF.
Investigator s, or other study sitepersonnel, shallrecord all AEs in the eCRF , including :
a)Event term (recorded in standard medical terminology and avoiding abbreviations)
b) A ffected area
c)Start date ( first day with symptoms)
d)Stop date ( last day with symptoms)
e)Intensity (mild, moderate, or severe according to definition in Section 8.6.4.1)
f)Seriousness (serious or not serious, according to definition in Section 8.6.4.2 )
g)Causal relationship to study product orstudy product injection procedure (yes or no)
h)Action taken (none, medication treatment, non- pharmacological treatment ,orother 
procedures/tests, subject withdrawn)
i)Outcome of the AE(ongoing, recovered, recovered with sequelae, death , chronic / stable , not 
recovered at the endof the study )
The pre -defined, expected post -treatment events shall be assessed separately.  These events shall be 
collected daily by subjects in a diary for up to 28 days after each treatmen t.  
                                                
3Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the CSP, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE. (Source: ISO14155:2011).

Intensity will be recorded f or each reported AE . The following definitions of intensity are to be used:
Mild : A wareness of symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated (acceptable )
Moderate: Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity (disturbing)
Severe: Incapacity to work or to do usual activity (unacceptable)
If the intensity changes within one day, the maximum intensity of the AEduring that day shall be 
recorded.
8.6.4.2 Causal relationship and seriousness
Each AE , serious as well as non- serious, shall be assessed by the I nvestigator for causal relationship 
with the study product and its us e(the injection procedure) and for seriousness (Yes or No)of the 
event . 
A two- point scale (Yes or No response ) shall be used for the causality assessments . The Investigators 
shall be asked to indicate aresponse to each of the following questions in the eCRF:
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the study product ?”,and 
“Do you consider t hat there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
the study product injection procedure?”
If any of these questions is answered Yes, the AE is considered related .
Each AEwill also be assessed for causal relationship and seriousness by the Sponsor , in order to fulfil
regulatory requirements. 
8.6.5 Reporting of adverse events 
Adverse event reporting on each subject shall start upon enrollment (i.e. randomized and/or treated) in 
the study.  Any events that occur after the subject signs the ICF but before enrollment will be recorded 
in the subject’s medical history.  
The reporting shall continue during each follow -up visit (including telephone contacts and extra visits 
between planned visits )until the last scheduled visit in the study .
All AEs, non -serious as well as serious, are to be reported as an AEin the eCRF .
8.6.6 Reporting of adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
All incidences of visual disturbances, regardless of relationship to study product or seriousness, are 
considered Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and include but are not limited to the following: 
any loss of vision, blurry vision, double vision, pain in or around the eye, blind spot or shadow in the 
visual field, trouble moving eyes.
AESIs should be reported (using the AE Clarification Form) within 24 hours of awareness to the 
Contract Research Organization (CRO )at the email address  In case 
of difficulty to obtain all the required information within 24 hours, an initial report can be submitted 
with follow up information provided within 24 hours of awareness of the new information.
The following information should be provided when reporting an AESI:

regulations.
8.6.8 Stopping Rule
Enrollment and injections at an investigational site will be temporarily halted if an SAE occurs for a 
vascular embolic event that leads to skin necrosis, vision loss, or stroke and is determined by the 
Investigator to be directly or possibly related to th e investigational device or injection procedure.  The 
SAE will be investigated by the Sponsor. 
If the Sponsor’s investigation concludes:
• The SAE was unanticipated, directly related to the investigational product or device injection 
procedure, and presents an unreasonable risk to study subjects, enrollment and/or injections 
will be immediately suspended for all study sites until the event ca n be properly characterized 
and an appropriate treatment strategy is established to prevent recurrence of the unanticipated 
event.  All Investigators will be notified of the suspension.  The IRB and RA will also be 
notified.  
• If the SAE does not meet t he above criteria, then enrollment and injections in the study will 
continue.  
8.6.9 Reporting of unanticipated adverse device effects
The Investigator shall submit to the sponsor and to the reviewing IRB a report of any unanticipated 
adverse device effect occ urring durin g the study as soon as possible , but in no event later than 10 
working days after the investigator first learns of the effect (see US requirement 21 CFR 812:150 (a.), 
for contact details, see section 8.6.7.
8.6.10 Follow -up of unresolved events ongoing at termination of the study
All serious as well as non- serious AEs with a causal relationship to the study product or treatment 
procedure and on going at study end, shall be followed up after the subject's participation in the study 
is over. Such events shall be followed -up after the last study visit until resolved, assessed as chronic 
or stable, or subject is lost to follow up. Follow -up informati on shall be reported on the AE follow -up 
form.
8.6.11 Reporting and follow -up of events occurring after subject termination of the 
study

9 Data Handling and Management 
9.1 Data m anagement
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities define d to achieve safe routines to enter 
clinical data information into a database, efficiently and avoiding errors. The data management 
routine include sprocedures for database set -up and management, data entry and verification, data 
validation, and documentat ion of the performed activities including information of discrepancies in 
the process. The data management process will be described in detail in the data management plan 
(DMP).
The database, the data entry screens and program will be designed in accordanc e with the CIP and the 
CRF template. Data validation will be performed by computerized logical checks and manual review. 
Drugs and events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization ( WHO )Drug and 
medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA )dictionaries as specified in the DMP. Safety 
data (SAE and if applicable AE of special interest) in the clinical database will be reconciled against 
the data in the safety database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in the 
database is as correct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study data will be 
transferred to SAS datasets, which thereafter will be write -protected. Statistical analyses will be 
generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.
9.2 Electronic case report forms 
Anelectronic data capture application , compliant with regulatory requirements for software validation 
USFDA 21CFR11 will be used to collect , modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit study 
data. A n eCRF is required and shall be completed electronically for each screened subject ( screening 
visit) and enrolled subjects ( subsequent visits ). 
The e CRF includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, 
to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Study data shall be entered directly 
from the source documents, which are to be defined at each site before inclusion of the first subject .
Authorized study site personnel designated by the PI shall complete data collection. Appropriate 
training and security measures shall be completed with all authorized investigation site personnel 
prior to the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any subject.
The study data isthe sole property of the Sponsor and shall not be made available in any form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of appropriate RA, without written permission from the 
Sponsor. At the end of the study , electronic data are kept at the Sponsor and a copy (provided by the 
vendor) at the study site as part of the Investigator file.
Any delegation of collection of data shall be specified and recorded .

Page 62of 709.2.1 Data entry
All data shall be entered in English. The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations on the 
subjects participating in the study . Therefore, the eCRFs shall be completed as soon as possible during 
or after the subject’s visit. The subject’s identity must always remain confidential, i.e. the name and 
address of the subjects must not be registered in the eCRFs or in the database. The Investigator must 
verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some assessments are not done, or 
if certain information is not available, not applicable or unknown, the Investigator shall indicate this 
in the eCRF. The Investi gator shall electronically sign off the study data. By signing, the Investigator 
takes responsibility for the accuracy, completeness ,and legibility of the data reported to the Sponsor 
in the eCRF.
9.2.2 The query process
The monitor shall review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency. Each eCRF 
shall be compared with the respective source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies 
between critical data. All entries, corrections, and alterations shall be made by the PI or his/her 
authorized designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once study data have been 
submitted to the central server via the eCRF, corrections to the data fields will be audit trailed, 
meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person who mad e the change, together with time 
and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the site personnel responsible for entering study data into 
the eCRF shall be determined in advance. If discrepant data is detected during review of the data, 
either by the Spons or or by its representatives, the responsible data manager or monitor shall raise a 
query in the electronic data capture application. The query shall state the question or data to be 
changed and shall be resolved in the system by the PI or his/her authoriz ed designee. The appropriate 
study site personnel shall answer the queries in the eCRF within a reasonable timeframe Answered 
queries will be audit trailed by the electronic data capture application meaning that the name of study 
site personnel, time, and date is logged. Answered queries will then be closed by the appropriate study 
personnel (i.e. data manager, site monitor, etc.)
9.2.3 U seridentification
Electronic CRF records will be automatically appended with the identification of the creator, by 
means of th eir unique UserID. Specified records shall be electronically signed by the Investigator to 
document his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are accurate. This will be 
facilitated by means of the Investigator’s unique UserID and passwor d; date and time stamps will be 
added automatically at time of electronic signature. If an entry in an eCRF requires change, the 
correction shall be made in accordance with the relevant software procedures. 
9.2.4 Audit trail
All changes will be fully recorded i n a protected audit trail and a reason for the change shall be stated.
Once all data have been entered, verified, and validated, the database will be locked.
9.3 Source documents
Source documents are all documents used by the Investigator or hospital that relate to the subject’s 
medical history, that verifies the existence of the subject, the inclusion andexclusion criteria, and 
all records covering the subject’s participation in the study. They include laboratory notes, 
memoranda, material dispensing reco rds, subject files, etc.
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. Source data should be 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data 
should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry and should be explained if necessary.
Source documents shall be made available for inspection by the monitor at each monitoring visit. 
The Investigator must submit a completed eCRF for each subject for whom signed informed 
consent has been collected.

9.4 Record keeping and access to source data
The PI/ Institution shall permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review ,and RAinspections and 
shall provide direct access to the source data/medical record including the identit y of all participating 
subjects (sufficient information to link records, i.e. eCRF,medical record s, original signed informed 
consent forms and detailed records of study product accountability ). The records shall be retained by 
the PIas required by local legislation and international guidelines. Any transfer of responsibility for 
storage of the records shall be documented and the Sponsor shall be informed in writing .
The Sponsor shall verify that each subject has consented in writing to direct access to the original 
medical record/source data (by the use of written subject information and signed informed consent). 
The data recorded in the eCRFs will be checked for consistency with the source documents/medical 
record by the monitor during monitoring (source data verification; SDV). In order to be able to 
perform SDV, information about each subject’s participation in the study has to be detailed in the 
medical record or other relevant source . 
9.5 D ocument and d ata retention
All records pertaining to the conduct of the study, including signed e CRFs, informed consent forms, 
study product accountability records, source documents, and other study document ation must be 
retained for retained for as long as is specified in the CTA after study completion or longer if required 
by national legislation. Sponsor will inform the site(s) as to when these documents no longer needs to 
be retained. Measures shall be taken to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these 
documents (e.g. protection against damage and unauthorized access ,preferably by storage in a 
fireproof cabinet).
After study completion and database lock, a security sealed CD with electronic study data shall be 
provided by the eCRF vendor for archiving .
It is the PI’s responsibility to inform the Sponsor in writing i f the Investigator f ile is moved or if the 
responsibility for the documents is transferred to someone else .
10 Statistical Methods
10.1 General
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) with detailed description of all statistical analyses 
will be developed. 
All study data will be listed in subject data listings.
All statistical analyses, including summary tables and data listings, will be performed using SAS. 
Confidence intervals will be two -sided and constructed at a confidence level of 95%. Statistical tests 
will be performed at a significance level of 5%, and p -values will be two- sided.
All endpoints will be summarized descriptively. Continuous endpoints will be summarized using 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values , for the observed value as well as 
the change from baseline . Categorical endpoints will be presented in frequency tables with number 
and percentage of observations for each level.

Page 64of 7010.2 Analysis populations
The following populations will be defined:
Safety Includes all subjects who were treated with Sculptra Aesthetic 
or randomized to no treatment control group. Subjects are 
analyzed based on the as treated principle (i.e. according to 
the treatment actually received).
Intention -to-treat (ITT) Includes all subjects who were randomized based on the as 
randomized principle (i.e. according to the treatment they 
were randomized to).
Per protocol (PP) Includes all subjects in ITT who complete the 12month after 
baseline visit without any deviations considered to have 
substantial impact on the primary effectiveness outcome.
ITTis the primary population for all effectiveness analyses. The primary effect iveness analysis will 
be repeated using the PP analysis set if there is at least a 10% difference in the number of subjects 
between the PP and ITT sets. Safety analysis is performed based on the safety population set.
The disposition of subjects will be presented in tables and/or fi gures as appropriate.

No adjustment to the level of significance will be done; p -values obtained for any endpoint other than 
the primary will only be provided for ease of interpretation of the results.
For responder rat es based on the and GAIS, and percentage of improved subjects according to 
IPR, results for the right and left side of the face combined as well as separately, will be calculated.
Number and percent of s ubjects in each response category for  GAIS and IPR, will also be 
presented.
10.4.1 Primary effectiveness analysis
The null hypothesis will be that there is no relationship between responder rate and treatment. The 
alternative hy pothesis will be that the re is a relationship between responder rate and treatment .
The estimates of the responder rate in each treatment group will be presented along with the 
difference in responder rates. Corresponding confidence intervals for responder rates a s well as
difference in responder rates and p -value for difference in responder rates will also be presented. 
In order to investigate the poolability of the results of the primary analysis across different subgroups ,
subgroups defin ed by study cen ter, age (≥55 vs <55) , and FST (I-III vs IV -VI)will be used. Logistic
regression models will be fitted which will include the subgroup factor as well as the corresponding 
interaction term (subgroup x treatment) in order to obtain estimates and confidence intervals at each 
level of the subgroup factor. These will be displayed in graphs.

the observed cases in the ITT set.
All other effectiveness endpoints will be evaluated based on the obse rved cases in ITT.
Descriptive statistics of all safety data will be performed on observed cases.
10.7 Data monitoring committee
Not applicable to this study.
10.8 Withdrawals and deviations
All withdrawn subjects will be listed individually, including at least subj ect number, date and reason 
for withdrawal, and last visit performed.
Subjects with CIP deviations will be listed individually, including subject number and observed 
deviation. Depending on the seriousness of the deviation, subject might be excluded from t he PP 
population, which shall be documented prior to database lock.
Deviations from the statistical plan will be documented in the CSR. If the need of changing the 
statistical plan arises before DBL but after the finalization of the SAP, the SAP will be amended.
10.9 Sample s ize
A total sample size of approximately 150 subjects will be included in this study; approximately 100 
will be randomized to treatment with Sculptra Aesthetic and approximately 50 will be randomized to 
no treatment. Sample size justificatio ns are given below.
10.9.1 Previous data
Since the primary endpoint will be based on a new scale, no existing data is available. 
10.9.2 Assumptions
Based on what is seen in clinical studies of injectable fillers in the facial areas, it is reasonable to 
assume a responder rate of at least 70% in the Sculptra Aesthetic treatment group at month 12. For the 
no treatment control group, responder rates up t o almost 30% have been observed in data on file. 
Based on this, it is assumed that the response rate will be maximum 35% in the no -treatment control 
group at month 12.
10.9.3 Sample size calculations
For the responder rate in , testing the difference using a two- sided test at the 5% significance 
level will have approximately 90% power to demonstrate difference between a responder rate of 70% 
in the Sculptra Aesthetic group, and a responder rate of 35% in the no treatment control group when 
the sample sizes are 84 and 42, respectively. Accounting for 15% drop -outs, approximately 150 
subjects need to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio.
11 Protection of p ersonal d ata
All processing of personal data must be carried out in accordance with national legislation concerning 
the protection of personal data. The Institution and the Investigator are responsible for complying with 
all requirements pursuant to national legislation in which the Institution and the Investigator are

in the investigation, but also to the processing of Personal Data. Such information includes 
information regarding the purposes of the processing, the length of time during which Personal Data 
will be stored, the right of access to stored Personal Data and the right to correction or purging of 
incorrect or obsolete Personal Data. A subject may also withdraw his or her consent at any time.
A subject who withdraws  his  or  her  consent  to  the  processing  of  Personal  Data must be 
considered to have withdrawn from the investigation but the data collected until the consent was 
withdrawn may be used in the statistical analyses.
Authorized representatives from the Sponsor or a RA may visit the investigational site to perform 
audits/inspections, including source data verification, i.e., comparing data in the subjects’ medical 
records and the eCRF. Data and information will be handled with strict confidentiality.
The study shall include collection and processing of personal data as specifi ed in the Regulation (EU) 
2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) on the protection of individuals with regard to 
the processing of personal data. For the purposes of the study, Sponsor will be considered the data 
controller, and Institution and PI will both be considered data processors.

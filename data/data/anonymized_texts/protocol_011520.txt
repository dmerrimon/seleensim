 4 Background and Rationale (including feasibility) 
 
Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is associated with several well-known side effects 
including neuropathy and generalized body aches (1).  The latter has recently been described as 
paclitaxel- associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS) and often occurs in the 1st 3-4 days after 
admi
nistration (2).  It affects about 58-90% of patients (2, 10).  Previously, these symptoms have been 
described as myalgias and arthralgias (1).  However, recent data support that P-APS may in fact be an 
early manifestation of neuropathy, as opposed to being musculoskeletal in origin. For instance, it was 
noted that patients with higher P-APS pain scores with the first dose of paclitaxel are at risk for 
developing chronic neuropathy (2, 3). 
 P-APS can be severe, and may require use of potent analgesics for symptom control.  Non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used as frontline therapy. However, there is concern over 
side effects including gastrointestinal bleeding and acute renal injury.  Many therapies have been studied 
including steroids (4), glutamine (5), antihistamine (6), opioid analgesics, and herbs (7), with variable 
results. 
Low dose oral prednisone starting 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and continued for a total of 
5 days has been previously reported to result in substantial improvement in symptomatology (3). 
However, this study was limited due to the small sample size.  In addition, given the variable schedule of 
paclitaxel ranging from weekly to every 3 weeks, this regimen could result in a significant amount of 
prednisone and can increase the risk of side effects over time. 
In a placebo-controlled, double blind randomized crossover trial, the effect of glutamine on paclitaxel 
associated myalgias and arthralgias showed that glutamine, although well tolerated, had no effect on the 
development and severity of symptoms, as reported by the treating physician and by patient log (5).  
Oral low-dose antihistamine, in the form of terfenadine 60 mg at the onset of pain and subsequently, has 
been reported to be temporarily effective in controlling paclitaxel-induced myalgia and /or dysesthesia 
(5). However, this study was also limited by its sample size with only 9 patients included. 
Currently, there is no standard of care for P-APS.  Since paclitaxel is a commonly used chemotherapeutic 
agent and P-APS is common and can be debilitating to some patients, an agent with a favorable toxicity 
profile that may prevent P-APS and possibly prevent the development of neuropathy will have significant 
clinical utility.  
 
Data on the Pathophysiology of Paclitaxel-Associated Acute Pain Syndrome  
The mechanism of P-APS is currently unknown.  For many years, these subacute aches and pains were 
described as myalgias/ arthralgias based on patient reported symptoms.  The self-limited course led to a 
hypothesis that symptoms are possibly the result of an inflammatory reaction to paclitaxel (1,3).  More 
recently, Loprinzi et al reported the natural history of P-APS (2,3). In this study, P-APS symptoms were 
assessed in 94 patients using patients’ daily symptom log with 10 items assessing pain symptoms and 
used of pain medication, adapted from Cleeland’s Brief Pain Inventory (Appendix I).  In addition, a 22-
item summary questionnaire regarding symptom characteristics was given after paclitaxel use.  
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms were assessed using the validated 
EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(QLQ)-CIPN-20 given at baseline and weekly after each paclitaxel dose.   
. 
 5 With regards to the P-APS, it was noted that the most common manifestation was a diffuse achiness 
mainly involving the legs, hips and lower back, typically evolving over 1-4 days.  Interestingly, in the 
wee
kly paclitaxel treatment group, the initial pain experienced with the first treatment did not predict the 
severity of pain with additional doses, but appear ed to predict the severity of symptoms associated with 
peripheral neuropathy, predominantly sensory, which evolved over the 12-week period of treatment. This 
is the first study showing that the P-APS may in fact be an early manifestation of neuropathy and is 
associated with the development of chronic neuropathy (2, 3). 
One mechanism proposed for P-APS is an early inflammatory process characterized by macrophage 
activation in both the DRG and peripheral nerve occurring shortly after paclitaxel therapy (9).  
Morphologic alterations in DRG satellite cells have been noted and upregulation of proinflammatory 
cytokines have been hypothesized as early events in the development of neuropathy (9). Therefore, it is 
possible that paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain may be mediated by proinflammatory cytokines. If P-
APS and chronic neuropathy are indeed part of a continuum, the inflammatory pathway would be a 
reasonable target for therapy.   
The exact mechanism on how paclitaxel eventually leads to the development of neuropathy is still not 
understood.  Taxanes promote stabilization of microtubules leading to disruption of normal cell division, 
and eventually resulting in cell death.  Results of a study showed that short-term administration of 
paclitaxel induces mainly reversible changes in the peripheral nerves and spinal roots (8). Microtubules 
seem to be the main target of paclitaxel neurotoxicity, in much the same way as has been described for its 
antineoplastic activity. It has been hypothesized that microtubule-dependent axonal transport is disrupted 
by paclitaxel. Abnormal aggregation of microtubules in neuronal cells is hypothesized to contribute to 
neurosensory abnormalities leading to impairment of axonal transport (8).  
Taken together, an intervention with both anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective properties would 
be an ideal candidate for testing in the prevention of P-APS and subsequent development of peripheral 
neuropathy. 
 
Rationale for Studying Omega 3 Fatty Acids to Prevent or Ameliorate  P-APS 
Omega 3 Fatty Acids:  Anti-Inflammatory Properties and P-APS.  
Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have two major families, the omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 
(n-3).  The 20 carbon (n-3) and (n-6) fatty acids compete for the same enzymes and therefore, the intake 
of one omega fatty acid will diminish the metabolism of the other (10,15).   
Arachidonic Acid (AA) is a primarily diet-derived 20 carbon omega-6 PUFA which serves as a precursor 
of proinflammatory metabolites such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes (10). These 
eicosanoids are involved in modulating the intensity and duration of an inflammatory response. 
Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are the rate limiting enzymes in the conversion of AA to prostaglandin 
E2 (PGE2) and are a target for therapy, of which the most widely studied are the NSAIDS. 
Long chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)  and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are 
common dietary supplements. They have well established anti-inflammatory properties which serve as the 
basis for their use in therapeutic trials in inflammatory conditions (10, 11).  
EPA competes with AA for enzymatic metabolism, thereby decreasing inflammatory derivatives.   
Recently, omega-3 PUFAs have also been identified as precursors of anti-inflammatory mediators called 
protectins and resolvins.  Resolvins occur in the resolution phase of inflammation.  Protectin D1 was 
. 
 6 initially found to decrease damage of brain ischemia-reperfusion injury and thus named neuroprotectin 
D1 (12-14). 
Sever
al clinical studies have reported the pain relieving effects of omega 3 fatty acids for inflammatory 
joint diseases.  In a recent meta-analysis of 17 trials, supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids for 3-4 
months resulted in reduction in patient reported pain severity, duration of morning stiffness and amount 
of NSAID consumption (11).  
As noted above, there is evidence that early inflammatory processes are observed in paclitaxel induced 
nerve damage. This may in part account for the symptoms of P-APS, and sustained inflammation may 
lead to downstream effects responsible for evolution of peripheral neuropathy (8, 9).  Omega-3 fatty acids 
consumption can attenuate the production of pro-inflammatory metabolites.  In addition, it can generate 
local mediators that facilitate resolution of inflammation (12-14).  Thus, if P-APS is indeed mediated by 
inflammation, the anti-inflammatory activity of omega-3 fatty acids may be one mechanism to prevent P-
APS.  Additionally, given its well established safety profile, it may be an attractive alternative to 
NSAIDS. 
 
Omega 3 Fatty Acids:  A Dietary Supplement with Neuroprotective Properties 
The nervous system is richly endowed with omega-3 fatty acids, primarily DHA.  Omega-3 fatty acids may 
act as natural neuroprotective agents, as well as key component s in nerve hemostasis.  Several studies have 
reported the role of omega-3 fatty acids in maintaining nerve integrity and function (16, 21). Long chain n-
3 PUFAs such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown to have promising in the treatment of a 
broad range of neurodegenerative conditions (16).   
Several preclinical models have shown the neuroprotective effect of DHA in models of spinal cord injury 
(17- 19).  A mouse model has recently been used comparing groups with different fatty acid profiles (19).  
One group expressed the fat-1 gene  from Caenorhabditis elegans, which encodes a fatty acid desaturase, 
the enzyme that converts n-6 into n-3 PUFAs, leading to enrichment in tissue n-3 PUFA levels (low n-6/n-
3 ratio). This was compared to the group that had a high n-6/ n-3 ratio as well as to wild type strain.  Utilizing 
in vitro and in vivo injury models, neurite growth, axonal regeneration, sensory and motor function were 
assessed and compared. Interestingly, the dorsal root ganglion neurons from fat-1 mice ( n-3 enriched) had 
significant increase in neurite outgrowth and improved neuronal survival after injury. The omega- 3 
enriched group did not exhibit an increase in neuronal cell death after mechanical or hypoxic injury, in 
contrast to the 2 groups where hypoxia resulted in neuronal cell death in the order of 2.3 - 2.6 fold increase. 
The mice expressing the fat-1 gene showed a more complex neurite outgrowth phenotype, with neurons 
displaying both longer neurites and branches, supporting the notion that n-3 PUFA level had improved 
neuroregenerative potential. Interestingly, the in vivo experiments also showed that the higher tissue n-3 
PUFA group also exhibited a faster recovery of sensory loss, as assessed by mechanical stimulation 
thresholds.  Even after a severe form of injury such as a crush injury, recovery of sensation was faster in 
the group that was enriched for omega-3.   
In the clinical setting, omega-3 fatty acids have been studied in a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative 
disorders (21- 24).  Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, has been reported to 
strongly correlate with decreases in omega -3 fatty acid levels in the brain and peripheral tissue compared 
to age-related controls (22).  Epidemiological studies have also shown a correlation between lower levels 
of dietary omega-3 fatty acids and the development of Alzheimer’s disease (23), suggesting a 
. 
 7 neuroprotective effect.  Similar observations have been seen in Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative 
disorder of the basal ganglia (24).  Dietary interventions however have shown conflicting results. 
There are also emerging data on the role of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in acute neurologic injuries. 
As an example, it was reported that administration of moderate to high dose human albumin rich in DHA 
is neuroprotective in focal brain ischemia (25).   
These observations lend credence to the notion that omega-3 fatty acids promote neuroprotection and 
neuroregeneration.  These, along with its anti-inflammatory properties make it an attractive agent to study 
in the prevention and amelioration of paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. We hypothesize that 
omega-3 fatty acid supplementation started prior to initiation and administration of chemotherapy can 
potentially attenuate paclitaxel induced nerve damage.  
 
Omega 3 Fatty Acids and Paclitaxel 
Currently, there are no documented safety concerns with the combination of omega-3 fatty acids and 
paclitaxel.  On the contrary, preclinical and clinical studies have investigated the potential synergy with the 
combination treatment (26-28).  In early preclinical data, sequential exposure to Omega-3 PUFA 
docosahexanoic acid (DHA) followed by paclitaxel or docetaxel was demonstrated to enhance cytotoxicity 
of taxanes against the metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA- MB-231 (26). The investigational drug 
Taxoprexin  (DHA-Paclitaxel), a 2’-O-acyl conjugate of paclitaxel covalently bound to DHA via an ester 
bond, was developed to improve paclitaxel’s therapeutic performance.  Phase I trials did not show any dose 
limiting toxicities with the conjugated preparation (27).  Oral omega-3 fatty acids, classified as a nutritional 
additive, have several commercial preparations available for over the counter use. To date, there are no 
reported adverse drug reactions with FDA approved Lovaza and paclitaxel. 
 
Feasibility 
P-APS is common and occurs in about 50-90% of patients.  Paclitaxel is a common chemotherapeutic 
agent used in a variety of malignancies, both in the early and advanced setting.  Therefore, it is expected 
that the many patients will be eligible for this clinical trial. 
Omega-3 fatty acids have a well-established safety profile and have led to their wide availability and over 
the counter use. As detailed above, its anti-inflammatory properties and favorable side effect profile make 
them an attractive alternative to NSAIDS.  Furthermore, its potential neuroprotective properties make 
them an intriguing candidate for testing in paclitaxel induced neuropathy. 
This will be a multi-institutional study and the Principal Investigators are Zoneddy Dayao, MD (NCCTG) 
from the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and Debra Barton, RN, PhD (NCCTG)  from the 
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.  Melanie Royce, MD, PhD (ACOSOG) from the University of New 
Mexico is a co-investigator. The primary site will be the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA), 
as defined below.  
New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance is a New Mexico nonprofit corporation established in February, 2002, 
tha
t functions as a single point of contact for the management of oncology trials at multiple sites. 
NMCCA  includes: University of New Mexico Cancer Research and Treatment Center; Lovelace Health 
Systems; the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System; Presbyterian Healthcare Services 
(Presbyterian Hospital, Presbyterian Kaseman Hospital, Presbyterian Medical Group); Memorial Medical 
Center, Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center; Hematology-Oncology Associates; New Mexico 
. 
 8 Cancer Care Associates and  New Mexico Ear, Nose, Throat Specialists, P.C.; PMG Surgery. It is a joint 
venture representing approximately 100 physicians in central, northern and southern New Mexico who 
are engaged in the care of cancer patients.  
The NMCCA utilizes a centralized IRB for all participating sites: either the University of New Mexico 
Human Research Review Committee (HRRC), or the Western IRB.  Each trial has only one full review 
regardless of how many sites will participate. 
NMCCA has a strong commitment to clinical trial accruals. From 2010-2011, a total of 517 patients were 
enrolled in therapeutic and cancer control trials, with 229 from UNM and 288 from the other sites.  The 
last 5 years have shown a steady increase in clinical trial enrollment, with  a total of 2214 patients accrued 
at all sites from 2006-2011.

Protocol Treatment: 
Treatment:   Omega-3 Fatty Acid: 4 capsules (1 gram/capsule) or a double-blinded placebo either once 
daily or 2 capsules two times daily beginning 1 week prior to starting paclitaxel and continued until 12 
weeks or until paclitaxel is discontinued, whichever comes first (maximum of 12 weeks).  
Rationale for dosing :  A dose of at least 2.7 g/day of EPA and DHA have been reported to have 
analgesic effects in inflammatory conditions (11). The dose of 4 g/day is an FDA approved dose of 
omega-3 fatty acids (Lovaza) for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and has a well-documented 
toxicity profile. On the basis of this, a dose of 4 g/day was selected. 
Formulation of omega-3-fatty acid:   Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) capsules  will be used .  Each 1-
gram capsule of Lovaza contains approximately 465 mg EPA and 375 mg DHA.  
Formulation of placebo:   Placebo will be provided by Clinical Encapsulation Services or UNM 
Pharmacy.  Excipient material will be microcrystalline cellulose. It will be odorless like Lovaza. Since the 
placebo may slightly differ from Lovaza, the pills will be dispensed in opaque bottles and providers will 
not be allowed to open them.  In addition, to document blinding, the patients will be asked on cycle 1 Day 
2, if they know what medication they are receiving.  
Randomization:   Clinical Encapsulation Services or UNM Pharmacy will package both placebo and 
active drugs.  Our pharmacy will take care of randomization.  Then our research nurses will dispense the 
drug. 
 
Measurement tools:    
For P-APS symptoms , there will be 4 types of questionnaires, adapted from NCCTG N08C1: (1) a 
baseline/pretreatment questionnaire.  (2) a daily paclitaxel induced acute pain syndrome symptom log from 
Day 2-7 (2, 20).  (3) day 8 P-APS symptom summary.  (4) 1 month after completion of paclitaxel 
questionnaire. 
. 
 10 For chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN ) neurotoxicity , the EORTC-QLQ CIPN20 
patient questionnaire will be used.  The questionnaire will be filled out on the 8th day of each chemotherapy 
treatment and 1 month after completion of therapy.  
Dietary counseling :  As omega-3 fatty acid metabolism is affected negatively by the amount of arachidonic 
acid in the diet, dietary counseling will be provided to assess the fatty acid intake.   Omega-3 and Omega- 6 
Fatty Acid Dietary Intake Questionnaire will be given at baseline, Week 2, Week 4 and monthly thereafter 
(prepared by Laura Taber, PhD). 
Laboratory tests :  Due to a small risk of increased LDL and transaminase levels, LDL and transaminase 
levels will be determined at baseline, at Week 4 and the last day of paclitaxel treatment. 
 
D. Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0.  Adverse events will be assessed to determine 
tolerability as part of the secondary objectives of the study.  Analyses will be performed for all patients 
having received at least one dose of omega-3 (Lovaza).  Recording of AEs and their attribution (whether 
they are due to omega-3  or due to standard of care chemotherapy treatment (paclitaxel) is important to 
determining the tolerability of omega-3.  Since this study focuses on determining whether omega-3 can 
prevent P-APS and/or peripheral neuropathy as well as the tolerability of omega-3 in patients undergoing 
treatment with paclitaxel, the scope of AE collection will be limited to: 
1) Any AEs involving aches or pain 
2) Any AEs involving neuropathy 
3) Any AEs that are definitely, probably, or possibly related to omega-3/placebo or paclitaxel 
In addition to recording AEs, data will be captured on whether AEs attributed to omega-3 or AEs 
involving aches, pains, or neuropathy cause a given patient to discontinue participation in the study. 
Reported adverse reactions for omega-3 fatty acids are minimal.  While none of these symptoms require 
dose modification or discontinuation for safety concerns, patients may discontinue therapy should they 
choose, or if they are experiencing significant discomfort.  The common side effects reported in at least 
3% or greater rate than placebo in prior clinical trials using Lovaza are as follows: 
(1) Eructation (belching) which occurs in about 4%  
(2) Dyspepsia occurring in about 3%  
(3) Altered taste in about 4% 
(4) As Lovaza contains omega-3 fatty acids obtained from several fish sources, patients with known 
hypersensitivity or allergy to fish/shellfish are excluded. However, a person who develops a rash on the 
1st week of Lovaza treatment, prior to paclitaxel administration, should be evaluated for Lovaza allergy. 
The rash should be graded per NCI-CTAE version 4 criteria and be recorded as a possible Lovaza allergy. 
 
Paclitaxel Side Effects:   These should be reported per NCI-CTAE version 4.  Dose modification of 
paclitaxel will be at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Side effects of paclitaxel include:  
. 
 11 1) neutropenia,  
2) transaminitis,  
3) neuropathy,  
4) hypersensitivity reactions,  
5) alopecia,  
6) arthralgias  
7) myalgias.  
Patients who discontinue paclitaxel treatment due to allergy to paclitaxel will not be evaluable. 
 
E. Data Analysis 
In this pilot study, the effect of omega-3 on severity of paclitaxel associated pain syndrome will be evaluated 
in 60 patients using 1:1 randomization into omega-3 plus paclitaxel group and placebo plus paclitaxel group 
to achieve the primary aim. The primary endpoint will be determined by questions in N08C1 pain inventory.  
Mean severity will be calculated for each group and differences between groups will analyzed via t-tests or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as appropriate.  We will also consider a binary variable for incidence (no pain 
versus any pain, no relief versus any relief, does not interfere versus other) to evaluate the primary aim.  A 
formal sample size justification based on statistical hypothesis is not applicable to this pilot study. 
Considering 60%-80% incidence of paclitaxel associated pain syndrome, we can detect a minimal 
difference of 37.6%-37.9% pain syndrome difference base on 5% significance level and 80% power with 
our proposed sample size. In this effect size calculation, the significance level actually achieved by this 
design is 2.2%-2.6%. Our sample size justification is based on primary aim with a binary variable of 
incidence. 
Similarly, we will consider both continuous variables and binary incidence variable for the secondary aims.  
For continuous variables, t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests will be used. Fisher’s exact test will be used 
for the incidence variable with 95% confidence intervals. 
Patients will be evaluable regardless of the number of cycles of paclitaxel completed.  A patient will be 
considered evaluable if they have completed a baseline pre-paclitaxel questionnaire and at least one 
questionnaire during paclitaxel treatment. 
The study will last for approximately 5 years including data analysis. 
 
F. Data Safety Monitoring: 
Data Safety Monitoring will be done by the University of New Mexico Data Safety Monitoring Board.

This pilot study will explore the role of omega 3 fatty acids in preventing or ameliorating the severity of paclitaxel 
associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS) and development of peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients.  This will be a 
multi-institutional study conducted by the University of New Mexico under the auspices of the New Mexico Cancer Care 
Alliance (NMCCA), a nonprofit corporation with approximately 100 physicians in central, northern and southern New 
Mexico. The NMCCA functions as a single point of contact for clinical trials.  Through this organization, cooperative trials 
including NCCTG, ACOSOG and CALGB, have been opened and several patients have been accrued. 
This feasibility trial will provide an opportunity for three investigators from the legacy groups to collaborate:  Zoneddy 
Dayao, MD (NCCTG) , Debra Barton, RN, PhD (NCCTG) and Melanie Royce, MD, PhD ( ACOSOG). This also provides an 
opportunity for mentoring a junior faculty in the conduct of symptom intervention trial.  If the results are positive, a 
definitive ALLIANCE Phase III trial will be conducted.  The legacy group NCCTG, now ALLIANCE have conducted and 
published the largest body of evidence in P-APS and CIPN.  Well established methodologies as well as correlative studies 
from the NCCTG experience will be used to further enhance the design of the Phase III trial. Given the straightforward 
intervention schema and the high incidence of P-APS, rapid accrual to this trial is anticipated. 
 
Other support for this project:  Currently none.

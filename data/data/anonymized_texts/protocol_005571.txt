PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title  A Randomized, Mu lti-center, Double -Blind, Parallel -Group Clinical 
Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of MYL-1501D Produced by 
Two Manufacturing Processes in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients  
Background 
and Rationale MYL-1501D  is being developed as a follow -on biologic to the reference 
product Lantus® (insulin glargine) . A phase 1 PK/PD study comparing 
MYL -1501D with Lantus® sourced from Europe and U.S. demonstrated 
PK and PD equivalence between the 3 products. PK/PD equivalence was 
also demonstrated with MYL-1501D product produced using two 
manufacturing processes (Process V and Process VI).  
 
The aim of this study is to demonstrate similar efficacy and safety 
between M YL-1501D products produced from two manufacturing 
processes  (Process V and Process VI)  in combination with insulin lispro 
in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) . 
Primary 
Objectives To test whether M YL-1501D product from  Process VI once daily is 
non-inferior to MYL -1501D product from Process V once daily based on 
change in HbA1c from baseline to week 18  when administered in 
combination with mealtime insulin lispro.  
Primary 
endpoints  The primary efficacy endpoint is change in HbA1c from baseline to week 
18 for the ITT analysis set . 
Methodology 
and 
treatments  This is a multicenter, double -blind , randomized, parallel -group phase 3 
study in subjects  with T1DM comparing the efficacy, immunogenicity  
and safety of MYL -1501D products from two manufacturing processes 
(Process V and Process VI).  
After u p to 2-week screening period, all subjects  will be titrated on 
Lantus® during a 4- week run-in period, and will be shifted from their 
current mealtime insulin to Humalog®. The subjects will be randomized 
(stratified by time of administration of glargine [mo rning and evening]); 
one group will re ceive MYL -1501D product from Process V, while the 
other group will receive MYL -1501D product from Process VI for 18 
weeks. A follow-up visit will be scheduled 2 weeks after last dose of MYL -1501D. 
The study will be conduc
 ted in the US. Approximately 110 sites will be 
included in the study. 
Inclusion/ 
exclusion 
criteria  Inclusion criteria  
1. Written and signed informed consent needs to be provided by subjects or 
their legal representatives before starting any protocol -specific

Sample size  A total of 202 subjects with T1DM are planned to be randomized for this 
study and will receive either MYL -1501D Process V product or MYL-
1501D Process VI product, in a 1:1 ratio.  
The sample size estimation is based  on assumptions for the change from 
baseline up to week 18 in HbA1C with either MYL-1501D product from 
Process V or Process VI. It is assumed, that true mean groups mean difference is 0.03 and standard deviation is equal to 0.74. To demonstrate non-inferio rity margin of 0.4% using a 2- sided 95% confidence interval 
and a 90% power, a total of 172 subjects (86 subjects per treatment group) are required. To account for a maximum of 15% of subjects being not eligible for the per protocol analysis, a total sampl e size of 202 is planned 
to be randomized for this study. The true treatment difference and standard deviation is based on previous study MYL- GAIA -3001. 
Statistical 
Methods  A repeated measures analysis employing a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) -based, mixed  model repeated measures (MMRM) -effects model 
approach will be used to estimate  a 95% confidence interval for the 
absolute difference between MYL -1501D Process V product and MYL-
1501D Process VI product for mean change in HbA1c at Week 18. 
Non- inferiority for primary objective  will be established if the upper limit 
of a two sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference (MYL -1501D Process VI minus MYL -1501D Process V) of mean change 
from baseline for HbA1c is no greater than 0.4% at 18 we eks of 
treatment .

2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Indication 
MYL -1501D is
 being developed as a follow- on bio logic (US terminology) or biosimilar (EU 
terminology) to  Lantus®.  
2.2 Background and Rationale 
Insulin
 secretion in healthy subjects is characterized by relatively constant basal insulin 
secret
ion with a post-prandial surge. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by 
loss of the insulin-producing beta- cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to 
a deficiency of insulin. The main cause of beta -cell loss is a T -cell mediated autoimmune 
attack [1]. The principal treatment of patients with T1DM is initiation of insulin and diet 
control a
nd careful monitoring of blood glucose levels. 
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [2] and other trials [ 3] provide c onclusive 
evidence
 that maintaining tight glycemic control can prevent or delay microvascular and 
macrovascular complications in patients with T1DM. A number of different insulin regimens 
have been proposed for treatment of patients with T1DM. It is generally accepted that the so-called basal -bolus insulin regimen (1 or 2 daily injections of long/intermediate- acting insulin 
covering basal insulin requirements in combination with 3 daily injections of short-/rapid acting insulin to cover meal- related insulin requiremen ts) generally yields the best glycemic 
control in diabetes. Clear targets for plasma glucose levels have been recommended for basal -
bolus insulin regimens [ 4]. 
Different insulin preparations are available for management of basal insulin requirements, including
 intermediate -acting insulins (neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin) and long- acting 
insulin analogs such as insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Long- acting  insulin analogs have 
proven efficacy and offer good glucose control over 24 hours for a single dose. Insulin glargine is a long -acting insulin analogue allowing once- daily administration to cover basal 
insulin requirements for over 24 hours. After injection of Insulin glargine into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralized; leading to formation of micro-precipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, predictable concentration versus time profile with a prolonged duration of action.  
MYL -1501D is a human insulin analogue of r-DNA origin produced in the host organism  
Pichia pas
toris. P pastoris  is a methylotropic yeast that has been successfully used in the 
production of proteins.  The aim of this study i
 s to demonstrate similar efficacy and safety between MYL -1501D 
product produced from two manufacturing processes in combination with insulin lispro in 
patients with T1DM . 
Since the two  investig ational products have an identical presentation of prefilled pen to be 
used by the subject s during the treatment period, the subject  and the treating physician will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment. Furthermore, the evaluation of the study endpoints, 
such as  analysis of immunogenicity and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) , will be 
performed  in a blinded manner by  blinded personnel. The sponsor team as well as the CRO 
team will also be blinded to the subject assigned  treatment .

To ensure that both treatment arms are comparable at baseline with respect to drug -induced 
immune responses and other parameters, only subjects  who have been on a stable dose of 
Lantus® for at least 3 months prior to screening will be included.  
During the 4- week  ru n-in period with Lantus® and Humalog®, the dose of insulin will be 
titrated (if required) to ensure diabetes control. T he run -in period ensures comparable drug 
exposure for all subjects , and increases the likelihood of comparable immune responses at the 
start of the treatment period. An 18- week treatment period is  an adequate period to detect 
differences in HbA1c of the treatment arms  [5]. 
Dosin g with MYL -1501 D during treatment period and Lantus® during run -in period will be 
guided by self -monitored blood glucose ( SMBG )-based glucose level assessments, as 
suggested in the dosing algorithm.  
Rescue criteria based on HbA1c are defined  based  on week 12 HbA1c measurement, so that a 
potential worsening of metabolic control in subjects during the study can be identified and 
therapy modified at the discretion of the investigator.  
A follow-up visit, 2 weeks after the end of  trea tment, will ensure the safety of all subject s 
after they stop the study medication and return to receiving  approved medications. 
Complete information for the study medication  can be f ound in MYL -1501D Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB). [6] 
2.2.1 Rationale for Dose Selection 
Onl
y subject s who have  been on a stable dose of Lantus® for at least 3 months prior to 
screening will be included in the study, thus subjects would be on a stable dose  at study entry . 
If required , subject  dose should be adjusted during the 4- week run-in period to  stabilize the 
subjects . During the treatment pe riod, dose adjustment should be avoided but it is permitted 
to ensure subject’s  stable state and safety.

5.3 Storage, Disposition of Unused Study Drug and Drug Accountability  
T
he Investigator, or an approved representative, e.g. pharmacist, will ensure that all 
i
nvestigational products are stored in a secured area under recommended storage conditions 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements while at the investigator site.  
Study drug should be stored in accordance with the drug label.  St orage conditions stated in 
the Investigator’s Brochure may be superseded by the label storage.  
Temperature of storage facilities should be monitored and recorded on a daily basis using val
idated devices that rec ord maximum and minimum temperatures. Should the storage 
facility experience any excursion of temperature outside of the labelled storage condition this must be reported immediately to Mylan or designee. At sites where daily monitoring and recording is not possible on weekends, the temperature record (e.g. max/min thermometers) should be checked immediately for any temperature excursions  on the next working day after 
the weekend . Devices used for temperature monitoring should be regularly calibrated. 
Affect ed material must be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion has been 
assessed and confirmed by Mylan.  
The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
dis
position of the study drug. D rug accountability forms must be used. Alternatively,  Mylan

may approve use of standard institution forms. In either case, the forms must identify the 
study drug, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition on a subject -by-
subject  basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be signed by the 
individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Mylan or designee. 
At the end of the study, Mylan will provide instructions with regards to disposition of any 
unuse
d investigational product. If Mylan authorizes destruction at the study site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided b y 
Mylan.  Destruction must be adequately documented. 
5.4 Randomization  
A
ssignment of Subject Identification number (SID), randomization number and study 
me
dication, as well as site drug inventory control will be managed by an automated 
IVRS/IWRS.  A manual containing complete instructions for Web or telephone access and 
use will be provided to each site prior to study start. T he IVRS/IWRS will assign a SID  for 
each subject’s first clinic visit. Each SID will be unique and serve as the primary subject identifier throughout all phases of the study. The SID must appear on all case report form 
(CRF ) pages, source documents, laboratory data, ECG and diary data. Subject s qualifying to 
enter the study drug treatment phase, will be assigned an additional “randomization number” by the IVRS/IWRS at randomization. Dynamic allocation with minimization algorithm will 
be used for treatment randomization.  Randomization will be stratified by investigator  and 
basal insulin (Glargine) dose time (morning or evening). 
5.5 Breaking the B
 lind 
Regardless of the assigned treatment arm, all subj ects in the study are provided with active 
anti-diabetic treatment, Insulin glargine.  
The blinded treatment code must not be broken except in emergency situations for which the 
id
entification of the study treatment of a subject is required by the Qualified Investigator to 
complete a serious adverse event report or the clinical report. In such situations, the 
randomization information will be held by designated individual(s), and the date and reason for breaking the blind must be recorded. If possible, the CRO project manager should be contacted by telephone prior to unblinding but no later than 24 hours after unblinding. The investigator should follow the study ’s randomization procedures and should ensure that the 
code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. As the study is blinded, the investigator should promptly document and explain to the sponsor any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to a serious adverse event) of the investigational product(s). Unblinding of treatment code for final data analysis will be done after database lock. Unblinding process will be performed in accordance to both sponsor’s and CRO’s unblinding SOPs , as detailed in the statistical analysis plan . 
5.6 Concomitant Medications  
A
ll concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to post-
st
udy follow-up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of 
administration in the CRF.  All subject s will be questioned about concomitant medication at 
each clinic visit and at follow up.

Medications taken within 28 days prior to screening and prior to dosing with study 
medication will be documented as a prior medication. Medications taken after dosing with 
study medication will be documented as concomitant medications.  
Other than study drugs, insulin, insulin analogs and other anti- diabet es medications as well as 
glucocorticoid therapy (oral, intravenous, inhaled or other routes that produce systemic 
effect s) are prohibited during the study (including the run-in period and the treatment period ), 
except in case of rescue medication treatment .

olanzapine and clozapine).  
 
Subject s will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
sec
tion of this protocol ( Section  4.3.2). Use of prohibited medication during the study will be 
deeme
d a protocol deviation and such subjects will be assessed by Mylan or designee 
regarding the potential need to early terminate study drug (e.g. for safety reasons : see 
Section  4.3.4).  
5.7 Recommended Procedure for Subjec t Experiencing Adverse Effects Secondary to 
Excessive Pharmacological Effects of Study Drug 
The following rescue criterion will be implemented to protect the  safet y of subject s during 
the study: 
“Worsening of HbA1c by >1.0% compared to baseline at 12 weeks post randomization”. If the subject  mee
 ts the criterion the investigator can switch the subject  to Lantus® provided 
as part of the study at week 15 (V isit 13) or earlier , and continue with the study activities and 
procedures until the end of the study.

6 STUDY CONDUCT  
Subject s eligible for study recruitment will have the nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
ex
plained to them by the investigator.  They will be  provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and given sufficient time to consider the study’s 
implications before deciding to participate.  Subject s agreeing to participate in the study will 
sign the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before undergoing any screening or pre-screening (if required) procedures. A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by IVRS/IWRS  
system.  
Once a subject enrol
 ls in this study,  the site will make every effort to retain the subject for the 
planned duration of the study . Clinical study site staff are responsible for developing and 
implementing support and retention plans. Elements of this plan may include the following. 
• Thorough explanation of the complete clinical study  v isit schedule an d procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re- emphasis at each clinic visit.  
• A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the 
st
udy's successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatment grou ps to the 
overall success of the study . 
• Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic vis
it attendance and full study participation and compliance.  
• Collection of contact information at screening (address, phone numbe rs , email), 
which is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits. 
• Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.  
• I
mmediate and multifaceted follow -up on m issed clinic visits, including the possible 
use of trained staff to complete in -person contac t with subjects at their homes.  
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
res
chedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the 
subject so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study. All contact attempts should be documented in the subject's medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of "Los t to Follow -up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the 
study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless of site plans to support and retain subjects within the study, subjects may voluntarily withdraw from th e study for any reason and at any time.  
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of stud
y would be up to 26 weeks .  
For details and timings of assessments, refer to Sec tion 6.5. 
6.1 Screening Procedures

confirm that they meet the selection criteria for the study.  If the time between screening 
procedures and potential randomization exceeds 6 weeks  as a result of unexpected delays, 
then the subject  will need to be discussed  with Mylan or designee to consider potential for 
re-screening (if re screening is agreed, the subject will need to be re consented and assigned a 
new SID via IVRS/IWRS). Re -screening for other reasons may be possible following 
discussion with the Mylan or designee. If re screening occurs this will be clearly documented 
within the site file.  
The following will be completed in dur ing the visit:

6.3.7 Early study drug Termination (ET) visit 
S
ubject s may request termination of study drug or withdrawal from the study a t any time, or 
be required to withdraw or terminate study drug by the investigator or sponsor for reasons as per Section  4.3.4. If study drug is terminated or the s
 ubject  withdraws or is withdrawn, the 
reason for termination/withdrawal should be established and recorded. If a subject  does not 
return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject . In any 
circumstance, every effort should be made to document the outcome of subject contact attempt, if possible. The investigator will contact Mylan or designee , if subject  fails to 
complete the study or violates the protocol.  
If the subject  w
 ithdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The spons or may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent. 
Unless consent is withdrawn, subject s w
 ho prematurely terminate study drug will be asked to 
return to the clinic  to conduct the ET visit as soon as possible after their last dose of study 
drug, and in case consent subject will be asked to conduct all the remaining visits according 
to study schedule table until the end of the study.  
At the ET visit the  E nd of Treatment visit (Week 18/ Visit 14), pro cedures should be 
compl eted.  
The site should explain the importance of data collection and make every effort to consent the 
su
bject  to continue follow up per the SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES  until Week 20 visit.

 Treatment Procedures  
E
very effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
com
pleted as described.  However , it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may m ake it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases,  the investigator or designated representative will take all 
steps necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of the subject. When a protocol required 
test cannot be performed the investigator or des ignated representative will document the 
reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The Mylan study team will be informed of these incidents in a time ly fashion.

6.5.2 Safety Testing  Assessments 
Safety will  be a ssessed through physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, 12- lead 
electrocardiograms, laboratory analyses, and adverse event monitoring. 
6.5.2.1 Adverse Event Assessment  
If
 a subject  reports any symptoms after the signing of the informed consent form, they will be 
evaluated by medical staff and necessary measurements will be performed. The Principal Investigator or Medical Sub- Investigator will be notified before dosing to determine the 
course of action. 
Clinically relevant f indi
 ngs from screening procedures, e.g., laboratory tests or physical 
examinations will be recorded as medical history.  Clinically significant changes from the 
screening procedures results  will be recorded as adverse events.  
Subjects will be routinely queried with re gard to the presence or absence of adverse events 
using open ended questions. The clinic will provide documentation of any adverse events in 
the subject’s CRF.  The adverse event source documentation will minimally include the 
following information: date and time of as sessment, the outcome of the response, and 
identification of the clinic staff member collecting the information.  
6.5.2.2 Hypoglycemia 
I
ncidence of hypoglycemic episodes will also be summarized by category (Severe 
Hy
poglycemia, Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia, Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia, 
Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia, Relative Hypoglycemia and Nocturnal Hypoglycemia). In addition, nocturnal hypoglycemia rate and incidence will be analyzed in a same way as overall hypoglycemic episodes.  
Hypoglycemia is a state  pr
 oduced by a lower than normal level of glucose in the blood. This 
may develop, if for example:

• The subject misses or delays meals or there is a change in diet  
• The subject  t akes a higher dose of study drug than prescribed  
• The subject  consumes alcohol  
• The subject  doe s more intense or longer physical exercise or work than normal,  
• The subject  i s recovering from an injury, operation, fever or other illness, or from 
other forms of stress  
 
6.5.2.2.1 Classification  
A. Severe Hypoglycemia  
A
n event is considered as severe hypoglycemia if it requires the assistance of another person 
to a
ctively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions which results in 
neurological recovery, regardless of the availability of a blood glucose measurement. These 
episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of normal plasma glucose is considered suffic ient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.    
B. Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia  
A
n event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia are accompanied by a measured 
pla
sma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol /L). 
C. Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia  
A
n event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but with a measured 
pla
sma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
D. Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia.  
C
haracteristic symptoms of hypoglycemia with no blood g lucose level measurement that 
resolved with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous glucose. 
E. Relative Hypoglycemia.  
A
n event during which the subject  re ports any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, and 
interprets the symptoms as indicative of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose 
concentration > 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). F. Nocturnal Hypoglycemia.  
N
octurnal hypoglycemia will include hypoglycemia that occurs from the time the su bject  
goes to bed at night till the time he or she wakes up. This may include any of the above 5 
types of hypoglycemia.  
Note: A diagnosis of severe hypoglycemia as per above classification will always be 
con
sidered as serious adverse event. Other hypoglycemic episodes which fulfils ICH criteria 
for seriousness (life -threatening, hospitalization etc.) or represent important medical events 
based on investigator’s judgment should also be reported to sponsor within 24 hours.

Symptoms of hypoglycemia include but are not limited to the following: palpitations, 
sweating, hunger, nervousness and shakiness, perspiration, dizziness or light–headedness, sleepiness, confusion, difficulty speaking, feeling anxious or weak. Neuroglycopenic manif estations may include seizure, coma, and even death.  
Subject  will be instructed to be alert for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; and if possible 
to t
ake glucose meter readings at the time of the episode and to record the details of the 
episode with any remedial action taken and the blood glucose level (if it was checked) in their diary.  
Investigators will instruct the sub
 jects on self- management of hypoglycemic episodes. 
Investigators will also instruct subject s on remedial actions to be taken during the episodes of 
severe hypoglycemia. Subject  will be encouraged to call the study site if they experience 
hypoglycemia.  
6.5.2.2.3 Manage ment of Hypoglycemia 
The following steps are recommended for managing hypoglycemic episodes:  
1. The subject  shoul d begin with 15 to 20 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 3-4 teaspoons of 
table sugar dissolved in water, 1 tablespoon of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 3-4 
glucose tablets).  
2. Subsequently, if the glucose level is ≤50 mg/dL, then the subject  wil l be asked to 
consume 20 to 30 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 4-6 teaspoons of table sugar dissolved in water, 2 tablespoons of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 4-5 glucose tablets).  
3. Subject  wi
 ll be asked to recheck blood glucose after 15 minutes and to repeat 
hypogl ycemia treatment if the blood glucose does not return to normal after 15 minutes. If the 
next meal is more than 1 hour away, subjects should follow with additional carbohydrate or a 
snack.  
4. If hypoglycemia persists after the second treatment, subject  or c ompanion should be 
instructed to contact the investigator.  It is recommended that the sub
 jects always carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits, or 
sugary fruit juice.  For an event of severe hypoglycemia the subject  can be
  treated with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) 
given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate training, 
or glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. Intravenous glucose can also be given if the subject  does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended in order to prevent a relapse.  
Full hypoglycemic episode documentation includes time of occurrence, duration, time of recov
ery, remedial measures undertaken, recording  the symptoms and plasma glucose / 
SMBG levels at the beginning and end of the episode with time and date, and classification in to the different subtypes (Refer to Section 6.5.2.2.1).

Hypoglycemic events and any associat ed symptoms are recorded only on the hypoglycemic 
episodes page of the CRF. Severe hypoglycemia and those episodes meeting any of the ICH 
seriousness criteria ( Section 9.2.4) are also to be notified as SAEs to the Mylan Global

characterization. Samples collected pre-dose at the  randomization visit (Visit 6) will be 
considered as baseli ne. S amples collected at screening  and the supplemental samples 
collected at baseline may  also be used for method development and validation. Sample  
handling instructions are specified in the laboratory manual. 
A conventional radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) will be employed for the assessment 
of anti-drug anti
bodies in clinical samples. In this assay, s amples will undergo a pre-
treatment step th at includes acid dissociation to release any anti -insulin antibodies complexed 
with free drug, followed by charcoal adsorption of the free insulin analog. The treated samples will be incubated with a fixed amount of 
125I-MYL -1501D, and anti -drug antibody  
complex formation with the tracer is measured via gamma counter and expressed as a 
percentage of bound to total radioactivity (%B/T).  
The multi- tiered sample analysis recommendations for immunogenicity testing from 
published white papers [ 7, 8], and current regulatory guidance [ 9, 10] , will be e mployed for 
the immunogenici
ty assessment of MYL-1501D Process V and Process VI. The antidrug 
antibody analysis  methodology will be fully validated, and the sample analysis procedures 
will be documented in a Sample Analysis Protocol.  Sample handling, processing, and storage 
instructions will be detailed in a separate manual.  The laboratory for immunogenicity 
analysis will be designated by the Sponsor. 
6.5.2.4.1 PK Assessment  
One blood sample of
 4 mL will be taken into  a K2EDTA plasma tube at each time point, as 
outlined in Table 1. The blood samples will be taken by direct venipuncture, and the exact 
times of blood sam
pling w ill be recorded in the CRF. The PK sample will be taken along 
with the immunogenicity sample s. The exact time of last MYL -1501D dose prior to 
withdrawal  of blood for PK will be noted. The blood samples will be analyzed for Insulin 
Glargine, Glargine M1  and M2 metabolite concentrations by Covance Laboratories Ltd. 
(Harrogate, UK) using a fully validated analytical method. Sample handling instructions are 
specified in the laboratory manual . 
The PK samples are taken as outlined in  Table 1 . The PK sample will be taken during the 
visit, pref
erably taken p rior to the daily glargine dose. The timing of study drug 
administration from prior day should be collected along with the time of PK sample collection.  
6.5.2.5 Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate  
Blood pres
sure and pulse rate will be measured at times specified in Sections 1 and Sectio n 6. 
Additional colle
ction times, or changes to collection times of blood pressure and pulse rate 
will be permitted, as necessary, to ensure appropriate collection of safety data.  
Supine blood pressure will be measured with the subject ’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart, and recorded to the nearest mmHg after 5 minutes of rest. Where possible, the same arm (preferably the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study. 
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used 
to measure bl
ood pressure each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring blood 
pressure and pulse rate are acceptable, although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds.  Any clinically significant

changes in blood pressure and pulse rate should be recorded as an AE. Determination of 
clinical significance  and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment. 
6.5.2.6 12-lead ECG  
In this study, 12- lead E CGs will be recorded using local  ECG devices  and review . ECGs 
should be collected at times specified in the study schedules in Sections  1 and Section  6.  
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject  has rested quietly for at least 
10 minutes in a supine position. 
To ensure safety of t he su bject s, a medically qualified individual at the site will assess ECG 
recordings and make any comparisons to baseline measurements.  
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
place
ment as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  Any clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities measured at screening should be assessed for their effects on subject  eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history. ECG parameters will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinical significant changes between the screening and subsequent ECGs should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment. 
6.5.2.7 General Physical Examination 
A f
ull general physical examination will consist of an examination of the abdomen, 
cardi
ovascular system, lungs, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal and neurological systems, skin, 
extremities, head, ears, eyes, nose, and thyroid gland by trained medical personnel at the site. 
A full physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (screening), 6 (randomization) and 
14 (EOT or ET) . 
Height and w eigh t will be assessed at Visit 1. Physical examination results will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinical significant finding at Screening (Visit 1) should be 
recorded under medical history and changes between Screening (Visit 1) and subsequent 
examinations should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the investigator's medical judgment.

 total of 202 subjects  w ith T1DM  are planned to be randomized for this study and will 
receive either  MYL -1501D Process V product or MYL -1501D Process VI product , in a 1:1 
ratio.  
The sample size estimation is based on assumptions for the change from baseline up to week 
18 in 
HbA1 C with  either MYL -1501D product from Process V or Process VI . It is assumed, 
that true mea n groups mean difference is 0.03 and sta ndard deviation is equal to 0.74. To 
demonstrate non- inferiorit y margin of 0.4% using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval and a 
90% power, a total of 172 subjects  (86 subjects  per treatment group) are required .  
To account for a maximum of 15% of subjects  bei ng not eligible for the per protocol analysis, 
a total sample size of 202 is planned to be randomized for this study.  The true treatment 
difference and standard deviation is based on previous study MYL- GAIA -3001. 
No replacement of subj ect will be perfo rmed if subject  discontinued prematurely from the 
study.  
7.2 Primary Endpoints  
7.2.1
 Definition of Primary Endpoints  
T
he change in HbA1c from baseline up to week 18  is  the primary endpoint for this study. 
7.2.2 Statistical Methodology for Primary Endpoints 
F
or the analysis of the primary endpoint all subject s will be taken account – irrespectively of 
their missing value pattern, which are expected to be limited to less than 5% of the subjects . 
Then the treatment effect will be estimated using a  repeated measures analysis employing a 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based, mixed  model repeated measures (MMRM) -
effects model approach . In this model all subject s will be used for the estimation of the 95% 
confidence interval of the difference between MYL -1501D Process VI product and Process V 
product for mean change in HbA1c at week 18. The MMRM model will include the fixed, 
categorical effect of treatment group assignment, visit, treatment group -by-visit interaction 
and the other fixed effect terms investigator , basal in sulin dose time, and baseline HbA1c 
value as covariates.  
Further details on the MMRM model will be provided in the SAP. In vestigator pooling will 
be finalized before unblinding treatment to avoid introducing bias. The detailed method of investigator pooling will be documented in the SAP.

7.2.3 Primary Analysis for Primary Endpoints 
For primary endpoint analysis, non- in feriority for efficacy will be establish ed if the upper 
limit of a two sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference ( MYL -1501D 
Process  VI minus Process V) of mean change from baseline to endpoint for HbA1c is no 
greater than 0.4% at Week 18. The primary analysis will be performed on the intent to treat 
(ITT) analysis set .  
7.2.4 Secondary/Sensitivity Analyses for Primary Endpoints 
A
 further ro bust ness check will be conducted using the PP population and applying the same 
MMRM procedure as described in previous section to establish non- inferiority. Any 
differences in the conclusion will be further investigated by examining differences between 
the ITT and the PP populations. 
Other sensitivity analysis addressing missing data will be c onducted in the following manner:  
Multiple imputed datasets will be generated based on the assumption of a monotone missing 
da
ta pattern. The imputation will be perfo rmed using the monotone regression method for 
week 12 and week 18 sequentially. The variables treatment, pooled investigator, and basal insulin dose time  will be used as independent. 
In a second step, the imputed values will be corrected such that the full non- inf
 eriority margin 
will be added for imputed values in Process VI group. All imputed datasets will be analyzed using the same model parameters as used in the primary analysis, and the results will be combined using Rubin’s rules. 
A standard last obse
 rvation carried forward (LOCF) approach will be conducted such that 
missing data will be imputed by LOCF. This dataset will be analyzed for the ITT and PP 
populations using the ANCOVA model described in the protocol. 
7.2.5 Missing Data 
T
he only imputed data will be performed in the s e nsitivity analysis as described above for 
HbA1c . Otherwise, missing data will not be imputed.  
7.2.6 Sub- Group Analyses 
Subgroup analyses of important factors, including but not limited to factors such as age 
gr
oup, gender and race are planned for the key outcomes of HbA1c and immunogenicity 
variables. These will be conducted by adding factor and treatment- by-factor interactions to 
the MMRM model models of the main analyses. Other exploratory subgroup analyses may be performed, as deemed  appropriate.  
7.3 Secondary Endpoints  
T
he following efficacy measures (both actual and change values) will be summarized at 
ba
seline and scheduled visit. Similar statistical analysis approach for primary will be 
performed for continuous variables. Contrasts of LS mean at each scheduled visit will be 
used to evaluate all pairwise treatment comparisons, and 95% confidence intervals for treatment differences in LS means will be computed for each visit.

• Increase in total or basal in sulin dose at any visit  
 
The total incidence of Dev ice-related safety events will be summarized for each treatment 
group and would include device- related TEAEs and events related to device complaints or 
failures. For device- related TEAEs, two categories will be summarized for each treatment: 
needle-related TEAEs such as pain, bruise, and bleeding; and other device- related TEAEs, 
such as  hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. For confirmed device-related malfunctions or 
failures, incidence will be listed and summarized for each treatment.  
All above analyses will be performed on safety set.

9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
9.1 Adverse events  
A
ll observed or subject- rep orted AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as outlined in this section.  
The Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome 
of
 all AEs and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Mylan. The Investigator is required to assess causality and should obtain sufficient information to determine the causality of all AE s. All AEs  will be followed 
until the event is resolved, deemed to be stable, or until the event is found to be due to another known cause (concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted with the sponsor concurring with that assessment.  
9.2 Definitions  
9.2.1
 Adverse Events  
A
n AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
pat
ient administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with  the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with drug administration, whether or not related to the product. 
The above definition covers also cases of  
• Exacerbation of pre-existing diseases or conditions. 
o
 Pre-ex i sting diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is 
an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the 
disease or condition.  
An AE will be defined as a TEAE if the first onset (or worsening, in the case of pre- ex isting 
disease) is after the first administration of MYL -1501D after randomization through follow-
up visit or 14 days after last dose [for subjects  that do not have a follow- up visit].  
9.2.2 Adverse Drug Reaction  
A
ll noxious and unintended responses to an investigational product related to any dose should 
be c
onsidered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase “responses to an investigational 
product” means that a causal relationship between an investigational product and an AE is at 
least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by either the reporting Investigator or the sponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to an investigational product will be designated as ADRs.  
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the st
 udy drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the AE must be treated as if the relationship were “po ssible.” 
9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
A
n unexpected AE or ADR is defined as one whose nature or severity is not consistent with 
th
e applicable reference safety information designated for the study . For example, hepatic

necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  
The reference safety document  fo
 r MYL -1501D is the IB. For Humalog® and any 
concomitant medication, the respective SmPC or US prescribing information will be the reference safety document.  
9.2.4 Serious Adverse Events  
A
 SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death. 
•
 Is life -th reatening.  
o NOTE: The term “ lif e-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have c aused death if it were 
more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
•
 Is a congenital anomaly.  
o
 NOTE: A  congenital anomaly  in an infant born to a mother who was exposed 
to the study drug during pregnancy is considered an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a patient that has received the study drug is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the study drug interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. The patient with newly diagnosed pregnancy will discontinue receiving study treatment and will be 
followed-up every 3 months until delivery or termination to gather information 
about the outcome of the pregnancy.  
• Is an important medical event.  
o
 NOTE: I mportant Medical Event: Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hos pitalization but may jeopardize the patient 
and / or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
o For this protocol, any cancer, including localized basal cell carcinoma, is 
c
onsidered an important medical event, to be reported as a SAE.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
o
 NOTE: I npatient hospitalization  is defined as 24 hours in a hospital or an 
overnight stay. Events NOT  to be reported as SAEs are hospitalizations for the 
following:  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
w
ith any deterioration in condition.  
 Treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing condition t
hat is unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen. 
 Admissio n t o a hospital or other institution for general care due to social or 
economic reasons (e.g., no access to local ambulatory medical care).

 Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any 
of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hospital admission. 
Hospitalization  al
 so does not include the following: 
 Rehabilitation facilities.  
 Hospice facilities.  
 Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief).  
 Skilled nursing facilities.  
 Nursing homes. 
A
ny non- serious AE that is dete r mined by the medical monitor/sponsor to be serious (per 
company policy or regulatory requirements) will be communicated to the Investigator for reclassification. To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the Investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study. 
9.3 Management of Adverse Events  
A
Es or SAEs will be collected from the time the su bject  signs the informed consent form 
until the follow -up visit or 14 da ys after last dose of study medication .  Pre -existing diseases 
or conditions (reported at visit 1 in medical history) will not be considered as AEs unless 
there is an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the disease or condition. An SAE deemed  to be related to the study drug by the Investigator in consultation 
with sponsor will be reported even after the F ollow -up visit if reported by subjects . 
9.3.1 Collection  
T
he Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
cr
iteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as described previously. At each visit, the subject  
will be allowed time to spontaneously report any issues since the last visit or evaluation. The Investigator will then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non-leading questions, such as  
• “How are you feeling?”  
•
 “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?”  
•
 “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?”  
A
ny clinically relevant observations made by the In vestigator during the visit will also be 
considered AEs. 
The Subject ’s di ary should also be reviewed at each study visit for adverse events. At week 0 
visit when study diaries are issued, subject s will be appropriately educated by the study 
designee on what constitutes an adverse event and instructed to record adverse events in the 
study diary in a timely manner.  
9.3.2 Evaluation 
9.3.2.1
 Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
T
he clinical severity of an AE will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE Criteria Version 4.03. A 
cop
y of these criteria will be provided to each study site. If an AE is not listed in the CTCAE, 
its clinical severity will be classified as follows:

MYL -1501D Protocol 18 SEP 2017  Confidential  
Table 5: Clinical Severity of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will use the terms defined below to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  
Grade 1 – MILD  Does not interfere with subje ct's usual function.  
Grade 2 – MODERATE  Interferes to some extent with subject 's us ual function.  
Grade 3 – SEVERE  Interferes significantly with subject 's us ual function.  
Grade 4 - LIFE -THREATENING Risk of death at time of event  
Grade 5 – DEATH  Death related to AE  
 
If an AE is graded 4 or 5 according to the above criteria, then the AE meets the criteria for an 
SAE and t
he Investigator should immediately notify the sponsor or designee as described in 
Section  9.3.2.8.  
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of inten sit 
y based on the CTCAE grading or on the above table, whereas an SAE is an AE that 
meets any of the regulatory specified criteria required for designation as seriousness described in Section  9.2.4. 
9.3.2.2 Action Taken  
The poss
ible actions taken for an AE are described in Table 6. 
Table 6: Action Taken for an Adverse Event  
Dose reduced  The dose regimen was reduced by changing its frequency, strength, or 
amount.  
Dose increased  The dose regimen  was i ncreased by changing its frequency, strength, or 
amount.  
Treatment interrupted  The treatment was temporarily interrupted.  
Treatment withdrawn  The treatment was permanently discontinued.  
Concomitant therapy or procedures  Treatment was needed as a result of the AE (the concomitant treatment shoul
d be recorded on the relevant page of the CRF).  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
No action taken  The AE did not require any intervention.  
Not applicable  AE occurred after study m edicat ion was permanently withdrawn or 
subject  completed the treatment period.  
9.3.2.3 Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as:

All ongoing AEs without fatal outcome (i.e. did not cause death) will be recorded as not 
recovered/not resolved at the time of death. 
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than one AE is 
poss
ibly related to the subject ’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
which is the most plausible cause of death in the opinion of the Investigator.  
Note:  although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or 
une
xplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
9.3.2.4 Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
A
n Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
re
asonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must make an assessment of the relationship of each AE (serious and 
non-serious) to the study treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF. In addition, if the Investigator determines an AE or SAE is associated with study procedures, 
the
 Investigator must record this information about the causal relationship in the source 
documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report the assessment in accordanc e with the 
reporting requirements, as applicable, AE or SAE. 
Factors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include:  
• Temporal relationship (e.g., time of onset) 
•
 Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s)  
•
 Pharmacological plausibility  
•
 Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history) 
•
 Drug Interactions  
•
 De-challenge/re- ch allenge 
• Dose relationship 
 A
 suspected relationship (definite, probable, and possible) between the events and the study 
med
ication means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment in accordance with the following definitions: 
Table 7: D
efinition of Suspected Relationship between the Events and Study  Medication  
DEFINITELY  Causal relationship is certain  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de -challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
PROBABLY  High degree of certainty for ca
usal relationship  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to de-
challenge (re -challenge  is not required), and other

causes have been eliminated or are unlikely.  
POSSIBLY  Causal relationship is 
uncer
tain For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the AE onset/course is reasonable 
or unknown, de -challenge information is either 
unknown or equivocal, and while other potential 
causes may or may not exist, a causal relationship to study drug does not appear probable  
UNLIKELY  Not reasonabl y rel ated 
although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out  For Example: Event or labor ator
 y test abnormality, 
with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible), or disease or other 
drugs provide plausible explanations  
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATED  No possible relationship  The temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or 
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is impossible  
 
For SAEs,  the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
rel
ated/unrelated, an alternative suspected et iology should preferably be provided (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercurrent condition) wherever applicable and available. 
9.3.2.5 Documentation 
Al
l AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the 
CRF
 with the following information; where appropriate (the period of observation for the 
study is described in Section  6): 
• AE name or term in standard medical terminology.  
• W
hen the AE first occurred (start date and time); SAE start date is defined as the date 
th
e AE became serious.  
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or date and time of last observation if 
ongoi
ng, i.e., recovering or not recovered). 
• Severity of the AE.  
• S
eriousness criteria (hospitalization, death, etc.).  
• A
ction taken with study med ication as a result of AE.  
• Outcome.  
• I
nvestigator’s opinion regarding the AE relationship to the study treatments.  
 
Hy
poglycemic events and associated signs/symptoms will only be recorded on the 
hyp
oglycemic episodes page of the CRF, unless they are SAEs  (i.e., a severe episode) . 
9.3.2.6 Treatment of Adverse Events  
AE
s that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by established standards of care. 
If 
such treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the reason should be documented 
in the CRF; this can include temporary interruption of study treatment. The decision about 
whether the subject may resume the study treatment will be made by the sponsor after 
consultation with the Inv estigator and/or medical monitor.

9.3.2.7 Follow- up 
Any AE will be followed -up t o a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can 
be explained by another known cause (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical 
judgment indicates tha t further evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject ’s medical record and recorded on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
9.3.2.8 Notification 
F
or SAEs, the active reporting period to Mylan, begins from t he  time that the subject  provides 
informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject ’s participation in the study, i.e., prior 
to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including the follow up visit. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAE occurring any time after the active reporting period, the SAE must be promptly reported to Mylan only in case of reasonable causality (i.e. suspected ADR).  
The SAE reporting form  i
 s to be completed for al l serious adverse events, signed by the 
Investigator, and emailed or faxed with supporting documentation (e.g., CRFs, hospital records, laboratory reports). Subject  identity details (such as but not limited to name or 
clinic/hospital number) must not be visible on SAE forms or any supporting documentation provided by the Investigator. These should be “blacked out”, and replaced with the site and 
subject ’s study identification number on every page. 
At that time of first notification, the Investigator/designe e s hould provide the following 
information via the SAE report form:  
• Protocol number 
•
 Reporter ( s tudy site and Investigator) 
• Subject’s uni que identification number  
• Subject ’s  age 
• Investigational medicinal product 
•
 Date of first dose of s tudy treatment  
• Date of last dose of s tudy treatment, if applicable  
• SAE term  
•
 The seriousness criteria that were met  
•
 Investigator’s opinion of the relationship to the study treatment  
•
 Severity  
•
 Start and stop (if applicable) of the event (date and time)  
•
 A brief description of the event, outcome to date, and any actions taken 
•
 Concomitant medication at onset of the event 
•
 Relevant past history information  
•
 Relevant laboratory test findings 
 
I
f the initial notification of an SAE is by telephone, within 24  hours  of the initial telephone 
notification the Investigator must email the written SAE report form that describes the SAE 
to the Mylan Product Safety and Risk Management department.

The Investigator may be requested by Mylan to obtain specific additional follow-up 
information  in an expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed 
than that captured on the AE CRF. In general, this will include a description of the SAE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject  death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Mylan.  
Any missing or additional relevant information concerning the SAE should be provided on a 
fol
low-up SAE Report Form. Ensure that any additional information requested by the sponsor 
or designee about the event, as outlined above (e.g., hospital reports, autopsy report) is provided to the sponsor as soon as it is available. 
Sponsor Contact Information for Immediately Reportable Events 
                       All SAEs must be notified within 24 hours by email (preferred) or fax  to:

PV MAIL HUB FOR IMMEDIATE SAFETY REPORTS:  
pvclinical@mylan.com  
In the event that an electronic ac knowledgment is not received within 24 hours for a SAE 
report submitted by email, please forward the report via fax to +1.304.285.6409. 
9.3.2.9 Regulatory Reporting 
A
ll AEs, including suspected serious unexpected AEs will be reported in accordance with 
appl
icable local regulations. The Investigator is required to comply with applicable 
regulations (including local law and guidance) regarding notification to her/his regulatory 
authorities, ethics committees (ECs) and institutions.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), SAEs and other cases required by the
 concerned competent authorities will be reported by the sponsor or the sponsor’s 
representative to all concerned parties within the prescribed timeframe. The sponsor or representative will also submit periodic safety reports (for e.g., Development Safety Update Reports) as required by international regulations. 
9.4 Special Situ at
 ions 
The Investigator should report any case of pregnancy within 24 hours via the pregnancy 
re
port form. Pregnancy exposures must be followed until a final outcome is determined (e.g., 
parturition, spontaneous or scheduled termination). 
9.4.1 Pregnancy  
Al
l wom en of childbearing potential who participate in the study should be counseled on the 
ne
ed to practice adequate birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
study participation. Women should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if 
pregnancy occurs or is suspected.

Pregnancy testing will be conducted throughout the study, as detailed in the schedule of 
assessments. A woman who is found to be pregnan t at the randomization visit (Visit 6 [Week 
0]), will be excluded from the study. A woman who becomes pregnant during the study will 
be immediately discontinued from study treatment. Early discontinuation visit assessments 
should be performed as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. This information should be captured in the pregnancy form and reported to Mylan Product Safety and Risk Management within 24 hours from the time of initial knowledge, even if beyond the closure of the clinical database.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or el
ective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
cons
idered to be an elective procedure and not an AE, nevertheless, Mylan requests that the 
outcome (e.g., elective termination) be reported within 24 hours and sent as a follow-up on the Delivery and Infant Follow-up Form).  
The Investigator is also responsible for following up the pregnancy at 3 monthly intervals 
unti
l delivery or termination, informing the sponsor about its outcome.   
9.4.2 Overdose, Medication Errors and Other Events  
O
verdose per se  o f either study treatment or a concomitant medication will not be reported as 
an AE; unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Signs, symptoms, and clinical sequelae associated with intentional overdose are to be recorded on the AE CRF page. Dosing and other medication errors are to be recorded as protocol deviations. 
9.5 Abnormal Test Findings  
A
bnormal laboratory findings per se (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
asse
ssments (e.g., ECG, X -rays, and vital signs) are not reported as AEs. However, abnormal 
findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with signs and/or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (and recorded as an SAE if they 
meet th e criteria of being serious). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other 
abnormal findings that are detected after study drug administration or that are present at 
baseline and worsen following the administration of study drug are included as AEs (and 
SAEs, if serious). The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Broad guidance for determining whether an abnormal objective tes t finding 
should be reported as an AE follows:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms and/or  
•
 The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
a
nd/or 
• The test result leads to a change in s tudy dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or 
• The test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or sponsor.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Tit le A Randomized, Multi -center, Double -Blind, Parallel -Group Clinical 
Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of MYL-1501D Produced by 
Two Manufacturing Processes in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients  
Background 
and Rationale MYL-1501D  is being developed as a follow -on biologic to the reference 
product Lantus® (insulin glargine) . A phase 1 PK/PD study comparing 
MYL -1501D with Lantus® sourced from Europe and U.S. demonstrated 
PK and PD equivalence between the 3 products. PK/PD equivalenc e was 
also demonstrated with MYL-1501D product produced using two 
manufacturing processes (Process V and Process VI).  
 
The aim of this study is to demonstrate similar efficacy and safety 
between M YL-1501D products produced from two manufacturing 
processes  (Process V and Process VI)  in combination with insulin lispro 
in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) . 
Primary 
Objectives To test whether M YL-1501D product from  Process VI once daily is 
non-inferior to MYL -1501D product from Process V once daily based on 
change in HbA1c from baseline to week 18  when administered in 
combination with mealtime insulin lispro.  
Primary 
endpoints  The primary efficacy endpoint is change in HbA1c from baseline to week 
18 for the ITT analysis set . 
Methodology 
and 
treatments  This is a multicenter, double -blind , randomized, parallel -group phase 3 
study in subjects  with T1DM comparing the efficacy, immunogenicity  
and safety of MYL -1501D products from two manufacturing processes 
(Process V and Process VI).  
After up to 2-week screening period, all subjects  will be titrated on 
Lantus® during a 4- week run-in period, and will be shifted from their 
current mealtime insulin to insulin lispro ( Humalog®). The subjects  will 
be randomized (stratified by time of administration of glargine [morning and evening]); one group will re ceive MYL -1501D product from Process 
V, while the other group will receive MYL -1501D product from Process 
VI for 18 weeks. A follow-up visit will be scheduled 2 weeks after last 
dose of MYL -1501D. 
The study will be conducted in the US. Approximately 110 sites will be 
i
ncluded in the study. 
Inclusion/

a. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as stage 2 hypertension by 
Joint National Committee VII (even if therapy is ongoing, blood 
pressure ≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥100 mm Hg diastolic). 
b. Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (e ven if therapy is ongoing, LDL 
>160 mg/dL or triglycerides >500 mg/dL). 
c. Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism ( su bject s can 
be included if these conditions are controlled with thyroid 
hormones or anti -thyroid drugs). 
d. Impaired hepatic function (ala n ine transaminase [ALT] or 
aspartate transaminase [AST] value >2 times the upper limit of the reference range and/or serum bilirubin 1.5 times the upper 
limit of the reference range at the screening visit). Subject s with 
evidence of Gilberts disease may be included in the study if they 
have total bilirubin of <3 mg/dL with indirect bilirubin contributing to >80% of the total bilirubin. 
15. History of a significant medical condition, such as:  
a. Clinically significant cardiac disease like unstable angina, 
m
yocardial infarction, grade 3 or 4 congestive heart failure 
(CHF) according to New York Heart Association criteria,

and pulmonary hypertension; during the year prior to screening. 
b. Stroke or transient i schemic attack (TIA) in the 6 months before 
screening.  
16. Subject s with major depressive illness in the last 3 years (those who 
have well -controlled depression for 3 months on a stable dose of 
antidepressants, with no major depressive episodes in the last 3 years, 
can be included, even if they are on medication), subject s with history of 
other severe psychiatric diseases (manic depressive ps ychosis [MDP], 
schizophrenia), which in the opinion of the investigator precludes the 
subject  from participating in the study (recorded while collecting subject  
history). 
17. History of hematological disorders that can affect the reliability of 
H
bA1c estimation (hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell 
anemia, etc.).  
18. Subject s us ing the following in the 3 months prior to screening: 
a. Insulin pump therapy 
b.
 Any anti-diabetic drugs other than the study insulins allowed by

19. Moderate insulin resist a nce, defined as requiring insulin of ≥1.5 
U/kg/day.  
20. Subject s w ho have received ≥14 consecutive days of glucocorticoid 
therapy by oral, intravenous, inhaled or other routes that produce 
systemic effects within the past 1 year, or who have received steroids by 
any route (except intra- nasal, intra- ocular, and topical) within the 4 
weeks immediately preceding screening.

Sample size  A total of 202 subjects with T1DM are planned to be randomized for this 
study and will receive either MYL -1501D Process V product or MYL -
1501D Process VI product, in a 1:1 ratio.  
The sample size estimation is based on assumptions for the change from 
baseline up to week 18 in HbA1C with either MYL-1501D product from Process V or Process VI. It is assumed, that true mean groups mean difference is 0.03 and standard deviation is equal to 0.74. To demonstrate non-inferiority margin of 0.4% using a 2- sided 95% confidence interval 
and a 90% power, a total of 172 subjects (86 subjects per treatment group) are required. To account for a maximum of 15% of subjects being not eligible for the per protocol analysis, a total sample size of 202 is planned to be randomized for this study. The true treatment difference and standard deviation is based on previous study MYL- GAIA -3001. 
Statistical 
Meth ods A repeated measures analysis employing a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) -based, mixed  model repeated measures (MMRM) -effects model 
approach will be used to estimate  a 95% confidence interval for the 
absolute difference between MYL -1501D Process V product and MYL-
1501D Process VI product for mean change in HbA1c at Week 18. 
Non- inferiority for primary objective  will be established if the upper limit 
of a two sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference (MYL -1501D Process VI minus MYL -1501D Process V)  of mean change 
from baseline for HbA1c is no greater than 0.4% at 18 weeks of treatment .

2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Indication 
MYL -1501D is being
 developed as a follow- on biologic (US terminology) or biosimilar (EU 
terminology ) to Lantus®.  
2.2 Background and Rationale 
Insulin sec
retion in healthy subjects is characterized by relatively constant basal insulin 
secretion wit
h a post-prandial surge. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by 
loss of the insulin-producing beta- cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, leading to 
a deficiency of insulin. The main cause of beta -cell loss is a T -cell mediated autoimmune 
attack [1]. The principal treatment of patients with T1DM is initiation of insulin and diet 
control and care
ful monitoring of blood glucose levels. 
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [2] and other trials [ 3] provide conclusi ve 
evidence th
at maintaining tight glycemic control can prevent or delay microvascular and 
macrovascular complications in patients with T1DM. A number of different insulin regimens 
have been proposed for treatment of patients with T1DM. It is generally accepted that the so-called basal -bolus insulin regimen (1 or 2 daily injections of long/intermediate- acting insulin 
covering basal insulin requirements in combination with 3 daily injections of short-/rapid acting insulin to cover meal- related insulin requirements) generally yields the best glycemic 
control in diabetes. Clear targets for plasma glucose levels have been recommended for basal -
bolus insulin regimens [ 4]. 
Different insulin preparations are available for management of basal insulin requirements, including inter
mediate -acting insulins (neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin) and long- acting 
insulin analogs such as insulin glargine and insulin detemir. Long-acting insulin analogs have proven efficacy and offer good glucose control over 24 hours for a single dose. Insulin glargine is a long -acting insulin analogue allowing once- daily administration to cover basal 
insulin requirements for over 24 hours. After injection of Insulin glargine into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralized; leading to formation of micro-precipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, predictable concentration versus time profile with a prolonged duration of action.  
MYL -1501D is a human insulin analogue of r-DNA origin produced in the host organism  
Pichia pastoris . 
P pastoris  is a methylotropic yeast that has been successfully used in the 
production of proteins.  The aim of this study is to
  demonstrate similar efficacy and safety between MYL -1501D 
product produced from two manufacturing processes in combination with insulin lispro in 
patients with T1DM . 
Since the two  investigationa l products have an identical presentation of prefilled  pen to be 
used by the subject s during the treatment period, the subject  and the treating physician will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment. Furthermore, the evaluation of the study endpoints, 
such as  analysis of immunogenicity and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) , will be 
performed  in a blinded manner by  blinded personnel. The sponsor team as well as the CRO 
team will also be blinded to the subject assigned  treatment .

To ensure that both treatment arms  are comparable at baseline with respect to drug -induced 
immune responses and other parameters, only subjects  who have been on a stable dose of 
Lantus® for at least 3 months prior to screening will be included.  
During the 4- week  run-i n period with Lantus® and Humalog®, the dose of insulin will be 
titrated (if required) to ensure diabetes control. T he run -in period ensures comparable drug 
exposure for all subjects , and increases the likelihood of comparable immune responses at the 
start of the treatment period. An 18- week treatment period is  an adequate period to detect 
differences in HbA1c of the treatment arms  [5]. 
Dosin g with MYL -1501D dur ing treatment period and Lantus® during run -in period will be 
guided by self -monitored blood glucose ( SMBG )-based glucose level assessments  and by the 
titration committee as detailed in the  insulin monitoring ( titration committee ) plan. 
Rescue criteria based on HbA1c are defined  based on we ek 12 HbA1c measurement, so that a 
potential worsening of metabolic control in subjects during the study can be identified and 
therapy modified at the discretion of the investigator.  
A follow-up visit, 2 weeks after the end of  treatmen t, will ensure the safety of all subject s 
after they stop the study medication and return to receiving  approved medications. 
Complete information for the study medication  can be found in MYL -1501D Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB) . [6] 
2.2.1 Rationale for Dose Selection 
Only subj
ects who have be en on a stable dose of Lantus® for at least 3 months prior to 
screening will be included in the study, thus subjects would be on a stable dose  at study entry . 
If required , subject  dose should be adjusted during the 4- week run-in period to  stabilize the 
subjects . During the treatment period , dose adjustment should be avoided but it is permitted 
to ensure subject’s  stable state and safety.

ll other females will be considered to be of childbearing potential.  
4.3.2 Females -  Childbearing Potential  
Female subjects of child-bearing potential must use an acceptable, highly effective method of 
c
ontraception (i.e. a method with a failure rate <1% when used consistently and correctly) 
starting from screening through to at least 7 days after the final dose of study drug. For this study, such methods include at least one of the following: 
• Abstinence (periodic abstinence is not acceptable).

• Male pa rtner who has had a vasectomy for at least 6 months. Male partners with 
vasectomies of <6 months are NOT considered protected.  
• Hormonal contraceptives (oral, injected, transdermal or implanted) with the exception 
of
 low dose gestagens, i.e. only containing lynestrenol or norethisterone, since they do 
not inhibit ovulation and are therefore not considered as highly- effective. The subject 
must remain on the hormonal contraceptive throughout the study and must have been 
using hormonal contraceptives for an adequate period prior to the study to ensure effectiveness (e.g., 3 months).

he Investigator, or an approved representative, e.g. pharmacist, will ensure that all 
i
nvestigational products are stored in a secured area under recommended storage conditions 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements while at the investigator site.  
Study drug should be stored in accordance with the drug label. Storage conditions stated in th
e Investigator’s Brochure may be superseded by the label storage.  
Temperature of stora ge  facilities should be monitored and recorded on a daily basis using 
validated devices that record maximum and minimum temperatures. Should the storage facility experience any excursion of temperature outside of the labelled storage condition this must be reported immediately to Mylan or designee.  At sites where daily monitoring and 
recording is not possible on weekends, the temperature record (e.g. max/min thermometers) should be checked immediately for any temperature excursions  on the next working day after 
the weekend . Devices used for temperature monitoring should be regularly calibrated. 
Affected material must be placed into quarantine until the impact of the excursion has been assessed and confirmed by Mylan.  
The investigator must maintain adequate re
 cords documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the study drug. Drug accountability forms must be used. Alternatively,  Mylan

may approve use of standard institution forms. In either case, the forms must identify the 
study drug, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition on a subject -by-
subject  basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be signed by the 
individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Mylan or designee. 
At the end  of t he study, Mylan will provide instructions with regards to disposition of any 
unused investigational product. If Mylan authorizes destruction at the study site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable  
environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Mylan.  Destruction must be adequately documented. 
5.4 Randomization  
A
ssignment of Subject Identification number (SID), randomization number and study 
med
ication, as wel l as site drug inventory control will be managed by an automated 
IVRS/IWRS.  A manual containing complete instructions for Web or telephone access and 
use will be provided to each site prior to study start. T he IVRS/IWRS will assign a SID  for 
each subject’s  first clinic visit. Each SID will be unique and serve as the primary subject 
identifier throughout all phases of the study. The SID must appear on all case report form (CRF ) pages, source documents, laboratory data, ECG and diary data. Subject s qualifying  to 
enter the study drug treatment phase, will be assigned an additional “randomization number” by the IVRS/IWRS at randomization. Dynamic allocation with minimization algorithm will 
be used for treatment randomization.  Randomization will be stratified by investigator  and 
basal insulin (Glargine) dose time (morning or evening). 
5.5 Breaking the Blind  
R
egardless of the assigned treatment arm, all subj ects in the study are provided with active 
anti-diabetic treatment, Insulin glargine.  
The blinded treatment code m ust not be broken except in emergency situations for which the 
identification of the study treatment of a subject is required by the Qualified Investigator to 
complete a serious adverse event report or the clinical report. In such situations, the randomization information will be held by designated individual(s), and the date and reason for breaking the blind must be recorded. If possible, the CRO project manager should be contacted by telephone prior to unblinding but no later than 24 hours after unblindi ng. The 
investigator should follow the study ’s randomization procedures and should ensure that the 
code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. As the study is blinded, the investigator should promptly document and explain to the sponsor any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to a serious adverse event) of the investigational product(s). Unblinding of treatment code for final data analysis will be done after database lock. Unblinding process will be performed in accordance to both sponsor’s and CRO’s unblinding SOPs , as detailed in the statistical analysis plan . 
5.6 Concomitant Medications  
A
ll concomitant medications taken during the study (from signing informed consent to post-
st
udy follow-up) must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of 
administration in the CRF.  All subject s will be questioned about concomitant medication at 
each clinic visit and at follow up.

Medications taken within 28 days prior to screening and prior to dosing with study 
medication will be documented as a prior medication. Medications taken after dosing with 
study medication will be documented as concomitant medications.  
Other than study drugs, insulin, insulin analogs and other anti- diabetes  medications as well as 
glucocor ticoid therapy (oral, intravenous, inhaled or other routes that produce systemic 
effects)  are prohibited during the study (including the run-in period and the treatment period ), 
except in case of rescue medication treatment .  
A list of medications that may  interf ere with the effect of insulin is provided in Table 2. No 
drugs
 listed in this table should be started during the run -in period or treatment period.

13. phenothiazine derivatives  
14. atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. 
olanzapine and clozapine).  
 
Subject s will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
sect
ion of this protocol ( Section  4.2.2). Use of prohibited medication during the study will be 
deemed a protocol deviation and such subjects will be assessed by Mylan or designee 
regarding the potential need to early terminate study drug (e.g. for safety reasons : see 
Section  4.3.4).  
5.7 Recommended Procedure for Subject  Experiencing Adverse Effects Secondary to 
Excessive Pharmacological Effects of Study Drug 
The following rescue criterion will be implemented to protect the safety of subject s dur ing 
the study: 
“Worsening of HbA1c by >1.0% compared to baseline at 12 weeks post randomization”. 
If the subject  meets  the criterion the investigator can switch the subject  to Lantus® provided 
as part of the study at week 15 (V isit 13) or earlier , and continue with the study activities and 
procedures until the end of the study.

6 STUDY CONDUCT  
Subject s eligible for study recruitment will have the nature, purpose, and risks of the study 
exp
lained to them by the investigator.  They will be provided with a written copy of the 
informed consent form (ICF) for the study and given sufficient time to consider the study’s 
implications before deciding to participate.  Subject s agreeing to participate in the study will 
sign the ICF and be given a duplicate copy before undergoing any screening or pre-screening 
(if requ ired) procedures.  A unique SID will be issued at the time of consent by IVRS/IWRS  
system.  
Once a subject enroll s in this study,  the site will make every effort to retain the subject for the 
planned duration of the study . Clinical study site staff are resp onsible for developing and 
implementing support and retention plans. Elements of this plan may include the following. 
• Thorough explanation of the complete clinical study  visi t schedule and procedural 
requirements during the informed consent process and re- emphasis at each clinic visit.  
• A simple explanation of the key data and key time points that are critical for the 
stud
y's successful analysis, and the importance of all the treatment groups to the 
overall success of the study . 
• Discussion at screening, and subsequent regular review of possible barriers to clinic visit 
attendance and full study participation and compliance.  
• Collection of contact information at screening (address, phone numbers, email), whic
h is regularly reviewed at subsequent clinic visits. 
• Use of appropriate and timely study visit reminders.  
• Imme
diate and multifaceted follow -up on mi ssed clinic visits, including the possible 
use of trained staff to complete in -person contact with subjects at their homes. 
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to 
resc
hedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the 
subject so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study. All c ontact attempts 
should be documented in the subject's medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of "Lost to Follow-up." For all other subjects withdrawing from the study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF. Regardless of site plans to support and retain subjects within the study, subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason and at an y time.  
For a subject that completes the study and all procedures it is anticipated that the duration of study
 would be up to 26 weeks .  
For details and timings of assessments, refer to Sectio n 6.5. 
6.1 Screening Procedures  
Each 
prospective subject must agree to participate in screening procedures by signing the 
most
 recent ICF before any screening procedure is initiated.  The Principal Investigator or

Medical Sub -Investigator will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm 
eligibility of each subject prior to enrolment.  
6.1.1 Screening (Visit 1  [Week -6 to Week -4]) 
Subjects will commence screening pro cedures within 6 weeks  prior to randomization, to 
confirm that they meet the selection criteria for the study.  If the time between screening 
procedures and potential randomization exceeds 6 weeks  as a result of unexpected delays, 
then the subject  will need to be discussed with Mylan or designee to consider potential for 
re-screening (if re screening is agreed, the subject will need to be re consented and assigned a 
new SID via IVRS/IWRS). Re -screening for other reasons may be possible following 
discussion with the Mylan or designee. If re screening occurs this will be clearly documented 
within the site file.  
The following will be completed in dur ing the visit: 
• Obtain written informed consent before any study- r elated procedure is initiated, 
including the cessation of prohibited concomitant therapy.  A copy of the signed ICF

If the subject  wi thdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent. 
Unless consent is withdrawn, subject s who pr
 ematurely terminate study drug will be asked to 
return to  the clinic  to conduct the ET visit as soon as possible after their last dose of study 
drug, and in case consent subject will be asked to conduct all the remaining visits according 
to study schedule table until the end of the study.  
At the ET visit the  End of  Treatment visit (Week 18/ Visit 14), pro cedures should be

leted as described.  However , it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases,  the investigator or designated representative will take all 
steps necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of the subject. When a protocol required 
test cannot be performed the investigator or designated representative will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The Mylan study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.

6.5.2 Safety Testing  Assessments 
Safety will be assessed through physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, 12- le ad 
electrocardiograms, laboratory analyses, and adverse event monitoring. 
6.5.2.1 Adverse Event Assessment  
If
 a subject  reports any symptoms after the signing of the informed consent form , they will be 
evaluated by medical staff and necessary measurements will be performed. The Principal 
Investigator or Medical Sub-Investigator will be notified before dosing to determine the course of action. 
Clinically relevant f indi
 ngs from screening procedures, e.g., laboratory tests or physical 
examinations will be recorded as medical history.  Clinically significant changes from the 
screening procedures results  will be recorded as adverse events.  
Subjects will be routinely queried with re gard to the presence or absence of adverse events 
using open ended questions. The clinic will provide documentation of any adverse events in 
the subject’s CRF.  The adverse event source documentation will minimally include the 
following information: date and time of assessment, the outcome of the response, and identification of the clinic staff member collecting the information.  
6.5.2.2 Hypoglycemia 
I
ncidence of hypoglycemic episodes will also be summarized by category (Severe 
Hy
poglycemia, Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia, Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia, 
Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia, Relative Hypoglycemia and Nocturnal Hypoglycemia). In addition, nocturnal hypoglycemia rate and incidenc e will be analyzed in a 
same way as overall hypoglycemic episodes.  
Hypoglycemia is a state produced by a lower than normal level of glucose in the blood. This ma
y develop, if for example:  
• The subject misses or delays meals or there is a change in diet  
•
 The subject  t akes a higher dose of study drug than prescribed  
• The subject  consumes alcohol  
• The subject  doe s more intense or longer physical exercise or work than normal,

• The subject  is recovering from an injury, operation, fever or other illness, or from 
other forms of stress  
 
6.5.2.2.1 Classification  
A. Severe Hypoglycemia  
A
n event is considered as severe hypoglycemia if it requires the assistance of another person 
to a
ctively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions which results in 
neurological recovery, regardless of the availability of a blood glucose measurement. These 
episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurologi cal 
recovery attributable to the restoration of normal plasma glucose is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  
B. Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia  
A
n event during which typical symptoms of hypo gl ycemia are accompanied by a measured 
plasma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
C. Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia  
A
n event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but with a measured 
pla
sma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
D. Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia.  
C
haracteristic symptoms of hypoglycemia with no blood glucose level measurement that 
re
solved with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous glucose. 
E. Relative Hypoglycemia.  
A
n event during which the subje ct re ports any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, and 
interprets the symptoms as indicative of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose 
concentration > 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
F. Nocturnal Hypoglycemia.  
N
octurnal hypoglycemia will include hypoglycemia that occurs from the time the su bject  
goes to bed at night till the time he or she wakes up. This may include any of the above 5 
types of hypoglycemia.  
Note: A diagnosis of severe hypoglycemia as per above classification will always be 
con
sidered as serious adverse event. Other hypoglycemic episodes which fulfils ICH criteria 
for seriousness (life -threatening, hospitalization etc.) or represent important medical events 
based on investigator’s judgment should also be reported to sponsor within 24 hours. 
6.5.2.2.2 Identification of Hypoglycemia 
S
ymptoms of hypoglycemia include but are not limited to the following: palpitations, 
sw
eating, hunger, nervousness and shakiness, perspiration, dizziness or light–headedness,

sleepiness, confusion, difficulty speaking, feeling anxious or weak. Neuroglycopenic 
manifestations may include seizure, coma, and even death.  
Subject  will be instructed to be alert for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; and if possible 
to 
take glucose meter readings at the time of the episode and to record the details of the 
episode with any remedial action taken and the blood glucose level (if it was checked) in their diary.  
Investigators will instruct the subj
 ects on self- management of hypoglycemic episodes . 
Investigators will also instruct subject s on remedial actions to be taken during the episodes of 
severe hypoglycemia. Subject  will be encouraged to call the study site if they experience 
hypoglycemia.  
6.5.2.2.3 Managem ent of Hypoglycemia 
The following steps are recommended for managing hypoglycemic episodes:  
1. The subject  should be gin with 15 to 20 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 3-4 teaspoons of 
table sugar dissolved in water, 1 tablespoon of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 3-4 
glucose tablets).  
2. Subsequently, if the glucose level is ≤50 mg/dL, then the subject  will  be asked to 
consume 20 to 30 grams carbohydrate (e.g., 4-6 teaspoons of table sugar dissolved in water, 2 tablespoons of honey, ¾ cup of juice or regular soft drink, 4-5 glucose tablets).  
3. Subject  wil
 l be asked to recheck blood glucose after 15 minutes and to repeat 
hypoglycemia treatment if the blood glucose does not return to normal after 15 minutes. If the 
next meal is more than 1 hour away, subjects should follow with additional carboh ydrate or a 
snack.  
4. If hypoglycemia persists after the second treatment, subject  or com panion should be 
instructed to contact the investigator.  It is recommended that the subj
 ects always carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits, or 
sugary fruit juice.  For an event of severe hypoglycemia, the subject  can be t
 reated with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) 
given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate training, 
or glucose given intravenously by a medical professional. Intravenous gl ucose can also be 
given if the subject  does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon regaining 
consciousness administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended in order to prevent a relapse.  
Full hypoglycemic episode documentation includes time of occurrence, duration, time of recove
ry, remedial measures undertaken, recording the symptoms and plasma glucose / 
SMBG levels at the beginning and end of the episode with time and date, and classification in to the different subtypes (Refer to Section  6.5.2.2.1).  
6.5.2.2.4 Reporting of hypoglycemic episodes 
Hyp
oglycemic events and any associated symptoms are recorded only on the hypoglycemic 
episo

collected at baseline  may  also be used for method development and validation. Sample 
handling instructions are specified in the laboratory manual. 
A conventional radioimmunoprecipitation assay will be employed for the  assessment of anti-
drug antibodies  in clinical samples.  In this assay, samples will undergo a pre- treatment step 
that includes acid dissociation to release any anti -insulin antibodies complexed with free 
drug, followed by charcoal adsorption of the free insulin analog. The treated samples will be 
incubated with a fixed amount of 125I-MYL -1501D, and anti -drug antibody  complex 
formation with the tracer is measured via gamma counter and expressed as a percentage of 
bound to total radioactivity (%B/T).  
The multi- tiered sample analysis recommendations for immunogenicity testing from 
published white papers [ 7, 8], and current regulator y guidance  [9, 10] , will be empl oyed for 
the immunogenicity assess
ment of MYL-1501D Process V and Process VI. The antidrug 
antibody analysis  methodology will be fully validated, and the sample analysis procedures 
will be documented in a Sample Analysis Protocol.  Sample handling, processing, and storage 
instructions will be detailed in a separate manual.  The laboratory for immunogenicity 
analysis will be designated by the Sponsor. 
6.5.2.4.1 PK Assessment  
One blood sample of 4  mL will 
be taken into  a K2EDTA plasma tube at each time point, as 
outlined in Table 1. The blood samples will be taken by direct venipuncture, and the exact 
times of blood sampling w ill b
e recorded in the CRF. The PK sample will be taken along 
with the immunogenicity sample s. The exact time of last MYL -1501D dose prior to 
withdrawal  of blood for PK will be noted. The blood samples will be analyzed for Insulin 
Glargine, Glargine M1  and M2 metabolite concentrations by Covance Laboratories Ltd. 
(Harrogate, UK) using a fully validated analytical method. Sample handling instructions are 
specified in the laboratory manual . 
The PK samples are taken as outlined in  Table 1 . The PK sample will be take n during the 
visit, preferabl
y taken prior to the daily glargine dose. The timing of study drug 
administration from prior day should be collected along with the time of PK sample collection.  
6.5.2.5 Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate  
Blood pressure and pulse rate w
ill be measured at times specified in Sections  1 and Section 6. 
Addit
ional collection times
, or changes to collection times of blood pressure and pulse rate 
will be permitted, as necessary, to ensure appropriate collection of safety data.  
Blood pressure will be measured at sitting position, after 5 minutes rest.  
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used to measure blood press
ure each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring blood 
pressure and pulse rate are acceptable, although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds.  Any clinically significant 
changes in blood pressure and pulse rate should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment.

6.5.2.6 12-lead ECG  
In this study, 12- lead ECG s will be recorded using local  ECG devices  and review . ECGs 
should be collected at times specified in the study schedules in Sectio ns 1 and Section 6.  
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject  has res ted quietly for at least 
5 minutes in a supine position. 
To ensure safety of the subject s, a me dically qualified individual at the site will assess ECG 
recordings and make any comparisons to baseline measurements.  
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement 
as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  Any clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities measured at screening should be assessed for their effects  on 
subject  eligibility of the study and recorded in medical history.  ECG parameters will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinical significant changes between the screening and subsequent ECGs should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical sig nificance and 
seriousness will be based on the Investigator's medical judgment. 
6.5.2.7 General Physical Examination 
A full 
general physical examination will consist of an examination of the abdomen, 
cardiovas
cular system, lungs, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal and neurological systems, skin, 
extremities, head, ears, eyes, nose, and thyroid gland by trained medical personnel at the site. 
A full physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 6 (randomization) 
and Visit 14 (EOT or ET) . 
Height and w eight w ill be assessed at Visit 1. Physical examination results will not be 
recorded in the CRFs, but any clinical significant finding at Screening (Visit 1) should be 
recorded under medical history and changes between Screening (Visit 1) and subsequent 
examinations should be recorded as an AE. Determination of clinical significance and 
seriousness will be based on the investigator's medical judgment.

7 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in t his  study 
will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained 
by the sponsor. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or it s analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment. 
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
A
 total of 202 subjects  w ith T1DM  are planned to be randomized for this study and will 
receive either  MYL -1501D Process V product or MYL -1501D Process VI product , in a 1:1 
ratio.  
The sample size estimation is based on assumptions for the change from baseline up to week 18 in 
HbA1 C with  either MYL -1501D product from Process V or Process VI . It is assumed, 
that true mea n groups mean difference is 0.03 and sta ndard deviation is equal to 0.74. To 
demonstrate non- inferiorit y margin of 0.4% using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval and a 
90% power, a total of 172 subjects  (86 subjects  per treatment group) are required . 
To account for a maximum of 15% of subjects  bei ng not eligible for the per protocol analysis, 
a total sample size of 202 is planned to be randomized for this study.  The true treatment 
difference and standard deviation is based on previous study MYL- GAIA -3001. 
No replacement of subj ect will be performed if subject  discontinued prematurely from the 
study.  
7.2 Primary Endpoints  
7.2.1
 Definition of Primary Endpoints  
T
he change in HbA1c from baseline up to week 18  is  the primary endpoint for this study. 
7.2.2 Statistical Methodology for Primary Endpoints 
F
or the analysis of the primary endpoint all ra ndomized subject s will be taken account – 
irrespective of whether subjects having post- baseline measurement . All scheduled 
non-missing data combined together with imputed missing data will be performed for 
primary analysis. Multiple imputed datasets will be generated based on the assumption of a 
monotone missing data pattern. The imputation will be performed using the monotone regression method for week 12 and week 18 sequentially. The variables treatment, pooled investigator, and basal insulin dose time will be used as independent variables . 
Then the treatment effect will be estimated using a  r
 epeated measures analysis employing a 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based, mixed  model repeated measures (MMRM) -
effects model approach . In this model all subject s will be used for the estimation of the 95% 
confidence interval of the difference between MYL -1501D Process VI product and Process V 
product for mean change in HbA1c at week 18. The MMRM model will include the fixed, 
categorical effect of  treatment group assignment, visit, treatment group- by-visit interaction 
and the other fixed effect terms investigator , basal insulin dose time, and baseline HbA1c 
value as covariates.

Further details on the MMRM model will be provided in the SAP. Investig ator pooling will 
be finalized before unblinding treatment to avoid introducing bias. The detailed method of 
investigator pooling will be documented in the SAP. 
7.2.3 Primary Analysis for Primary Endpoints 
F
or primary endpoint analysis, non- in feriority for effic acy will be establish ed if the upper 
limit of a two sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute difference ( MYL -1501D 
Process VI minus Process V) of mean change from baseline to endpoint for HbA1c is no 
greater than 0.4% at Week 18. The primary analysis will be performed on the intent to treat 
(ITT) analysis set .  
7.2.4 Secondary/Sensitivity Analyses for Primary Endpoints 
A
 further robustness check will be conducted using the PP population and applying the same 
MM
RM procedure as described in previous section to establish non- inferiority. Any 
differences in the conclusion will be further investigated by examining differences between 
the ITT and the PP populations. 
Other sensitivity analysis addressing missing data will be c onducted in the following manner:  
Same analysis approach as primary analysis without imputing missing values.  
In another method, the imputed values will be corrected such that the full non- i nferiority 
margin will be added for imputed values in Process VI group. All imputed datasets will be 
analyzed using the same model parameters as used in the primary analysis, and the results will be combined using Rubin’s rules. 
A standard last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach will be conducted such that 
miss
ing data will be imputed by LOCF. This dataset will be analyzed for the ITT and PP 
populations using the ANCOVA model for which details will be described in the SAP. 
7.2.5 Missing Data 
T
he only imputed data will be performed in the primary and se nsitivity analys es as described 
above for HbA1c . Otherwise, missing data will not be imputed.  
7.2.6 Sub- Group Analyses 
Subgroup analyses of important factors, including but not limited to factors such as age 
gr
oup, gender and race are planned for the key outcomes of HbA1c and immunogenicity 
variables. These will be conducted by adding factor and treatment- by-factor interactions to 
the MMRM model models of the main analyses. Other exploratory subgroup analyses may be performed, as deemed appropriate. 
7.3 Secondary Endpoints  
T
he following efficacy measures (both actual and change values) will be summarized at 
ba
seline and scheduled visit. Similar statistical analysis approach for primary will be 
performed for continuous variables without imputing missing values . Contrasts of LS mean at 
each scheduled visit will be used to evaluate all pairwise treatment comparisons, and 95% 
confidence intervals for treatment differences in LS means will be computed for each visit.

• Increase in total or basal in sulin dose at any visit  
 
The total incidence of Dev ice-related safety events will be summarized for each treatment 
group and would include device- related TEAEs  and events related to device complaints or 
failures. For device- related TEAEs, two categories will be summarized for each treatment: 
needle-related TEAEs such as pain, bruise, and bleeding; and other device- related TEAEs, 
such as hyperglycemia or hypoglyc emia. For confirmed device-related malfunctions or 
failures, incidence will be listed and summarized for each treatment.

8 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
8.1 Source Documentation Forms  
A
ll clinical data will be recorded by the clinical staff on raw data sheets and/or recorded 
elect
ronically using validated software.  If computerized systems are used to create, modify, 
maintain, archive, retrieve or transmit source data, they must comply with the applicable 
regulatory regulations and/or guidance. 
The nature and location of all source documents will be documented separately. Source data 
ma
y be directly captured from devices, transf erred from 3rd parties (e.g. laboratory data) or 
entered manually into CRF/database.  
8.2 Access to Data/Source Documentation  
T
he Investigator or designated representative will permit full access to data and source 
docum
entation for the purpose of clinical monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review and regulatory 
inspections. 
8.3 Final Clinical St udy Report and Case Report Forms (CRFs) 
A written clinical study re port will be provided in accordance with the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E- 3 guidelines inclu ding Annex I (Synopsis) 
documenting the clinical execution of the study. This report will include a description of any 
protocol deviations. The final report will also include reasons for withdrawals and any necessary treatment(s).  The report will also include tables presenting demographics (separate 
summary tables for enrolled and completed subjects), and adverse events recorded during the study.  In addition, the clinical study report will include a Quality Assurance statement, 
documenting that the report has been reviewed for completeness, accuracy, and compliance with the protocol and applicable loc al and federal regulations.  For final clinical reporting 
purposes only, adverse events deemed “definite”, “probable” or “possible” will be included in the treatment -related summaries/listings.  
Case Report Forms containing data transcribed from subject source documents (as appr
opriate) and copies of other source documents will be supplied by the clinical site. The 
Principal Investigator must sign each subject’s CR F after completion of data entry, signifying 
that the data entered in the CRF is complete and accurate.  Electronic CRFs may be provided. 
8.4 Adherence to Protocol  
E
xcept for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety and well-
bei
ng of the study subjects requires medical treatment, the study will be conducted as 
described in the approved protocol (and amendments, if applicable), GCP and applicable SOPs.  In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the applicable regulat ory 
requirements of the country where the study is being conducted as well as the country where the study will be submitted.  Any deviation(s) from the protocol will be recorded and 
presented in the final report.

9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
9.1 Adverse events  
A
ll observed or subject- rep orted AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as outlined in this section.  
The Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome 
of
 all AEs and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Mylan. The Investigator is required to assess causality and should obtain sufficient information to determine the causality of all AE s. All AEs  will be followed 
until the event is resolved, deemed to be stable, or until the event is found to be due to another known cause (concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted with the sponsor concurring with that assessment.  
9.2 Definitions  
9.2.1
 Adverse Events  
A
n AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
pat
ient administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with  the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with drug administration, whether or not related to the product. 
The above definition covers also cases of  
• Exacerbation of pre-existing diseases or conditions. 
o
 Pre-ex i sting diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is 
an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the 
disease or condition.  
An AE will be defined as a TEAE if the first onset (or worsening, in the case of pre- ex isting 
disease) is after the first administration of MYL -1501D after randomization through follow-
up visit or 14 days after last dose [for subjects  that do not have a follow- up visit].  
9.2.2 Adverse Drug Reaction  
A
ll noxious and unintended responses to an investigational product related to any dose should 
be c
onsidered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase “responses to an investigational 
product” means that a causal relationship between an investigational product and an AE is at 
least a reasonable possibility. All AEs judged by either the reporting Investigator or the sponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to an investigational product will be designated as ADRs.  
All AEs, with the causal relationship to the st
 udy drug reported as “possible”, “probable” or 
“definite” will be considered ADRs. If the relationship to the study drug is not given, then the AE must be treated as if the relationship were “po ssible.” 
9.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event/Adverse Drug Reaction  
A
n unexpected AE or ADR is defined as one whose nature or severity is not consistent with 
th
e applicable reference safety information designated for the study . For example, hepatic

necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  
The reference safety document  fo
 r MYL -1501D is the IB. For Humalog® and any 
concomitant medication, the respective SmPC or US prescribing information will be the reference safety document.  
9.2.4 Serious Adverse Events  
A
 SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death. 
•
 Is life -th reatening.  
o NOTE: The term “ lif e-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have ca used death if it were 
more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
•
 Is a congenital anomaly.  
o
 NOTE: A  congenital anomaly  in an infant born to a mother who was exposed 
to the study drug during pregnancy is considered an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a patient that has received the study drug is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the study drug interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. The patient with newly 
diagnosed pregnancy will discontinue receiving study treatment and will be 
followed-up every 3 months until delivery or termination to gather information about the outcome of the pregnancy.  
• Is an important medical event.  
o
 NOTE: I mportant Medical Event: Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hos pitalization but may jeopardize the patient 
and / or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
o For this protocol, any cancer, including localized basal cell carcinoma, is 
c
onsidered an important medical event, to be reported as a SAE.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
o
 NOTE: I npatient hospitalization  is defined as 24 hours in a hospital or an 
overnight stay. Events NOT  to be reported as SAEs are hospitalizations for the 
following:  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
w
ith any deterioration in condition.  
 Treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing condition 
t
hat is unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen. 
 Admission to a hospital or other institution for general care due to social or eco
nomic reasons (e.g., no access to local ambulatory medical care).

 Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any 
of the definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hospital admission. 
Hospitalization  al
 so does not include the following: 
 Rehabilitation facilities.  
 Hospice facilities.  
 Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief).  
 Skilled nursing facilities.  
 Nursing homes. 
A
ny non-serious AE that is determined by the medical monitor/sponsor to be serious (per 
com
pany policy or regulatory requirements) will be communicated to the Investigator for 
reclassification. To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the Investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study. 
9.3 Management of Adverse Events  
A
Es or SAEs will be collected from the time the su bject  signs the informed consent form 
until the follow -up visit o r 14 days after last dose of study medication .  Pre -existing diseases 
or conditions (reported at visit 1 in medical history) will not be considered as AEs unless 
there is an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the disease o r 
condition. An SAE deemed  to be related to the study drug by the Investigator in consultation 
with sponsor will be reported even after the F ollow -up visit if reported by subjects . 
9.3.1 Collection  
T
he Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
cr
iteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as described previously. At each visit, the subject  
will be allowed time to spontaneously report any issues since the last visit or evaluation. The Investigator will then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non-leading questions, such as  
• “How are you feeling?”  
•
 “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?”  
•
 “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?”  
A
ny clinically relevant observations made by the In vestigator during the visit will also be 
considered AEs. 
The Subject ’s di ary should also be reviewed at each study visit for adverse events. At week 0 
visit when study diaries are issued, subject s will be appropriately educated by the study 
designee on what constitutes an adverse event and instructed to record adverse events in the 
study diary in a timely manner.  
9.3.2 Evaluation 
9.3.2.1
 Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
T
he clinical severity of an AE will be graded using the NCI- CT CAE Criteria Versi on 4.03. A 
copy of these criteria will be provided to each study site. If an AE is not listed in the CTCAE, 
its clinical severity will be classified as follows:

 Protocol MYL -1501D -3004  Page 58 of 65 
MYL -1501D Protocol 11 JAN 2018  Confidential  
Table 5: Clinical Severity of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will use the terms defined below to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  
Grade 1 – MILD  Does not interfere with subject ' s usual function.  
Grade 2 – MODERATE  Interferes to some extent with subject 's usua l function.  
Grade 3 – SEVERE  Interferes significantly with subject 's usua l function.  
Grade 4 - LIFE -THREATENING Risk of death at time of event  
Grade 5 – DEATH  Death related to AE  
 
If an AE is graded 4 or 5 according to the above criteria, then the AE meets the criteria for an 
SAE and the 
Investigator should immediately notify the sponsor or designee as described in 
Section  9.3.2.8.  
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensit
y based on the CTCAE grading or on the above table, whereas an SAE is an AE that 
meets any of the regulatory specified criteria required for designation as seriousness 
described in Section  9.2.4. 
9.3.2.2 Action Taken  
The possi
ble actions taken for an AE are described in Table 6. 
Table 6: Action Taken for an Adverse Event  
Dose reduced  The dose regimen was reduced by changing its frequency, strength, or 
amount.  
Dose increased  The dose regimen  was inc reased by changing its frequency, strength, or 
amount.  
Treatment interrupted  The treatment was temporarily interrupted.  
Treatment withdrawn  The treatment was permanently discontinued.  
Concomitant therapy or procedures  Treatment was needed as a result of the AE (the concomitant treatment should
 be recorded on the relevant page of the CRF).  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
No action taken  The AE did not require any intervention.  
Not applicable  AE occurred after study medication was permanently withdrawn or 
subject  com
pleted the treatment period.  
9.3.2.3 Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recove
red/resolved with sequelae  
•
 Recovering/resolving  
• Not re
covered/not resolved 
• Fatal*  
•
 Unknown

MYL -1501D Protocol 11 JAN 2018  Confidential  
All ongoing AEs without fatal outcome (i.e. did not cause death) will be recorded as not 
recovered/not resolved at the time of death. 
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE resu lt s in death. If more than one AE is 
possibly related to the subject ’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
which is the most plausible cause of death in the opinion of the Investigator.  Note:  although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or 
une
xplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
9.3.2.4 Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
A
n Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
re
asonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. The 
Investigator must make an assessment of the relationship of each AE (serious and 
non-serious) to the study treatment(s) and record this relationship in the CRF. In addition, if the Investigator determines an AE or SAE is associated with st
 udy procedures, 
the Investigator must record this information about the causal relationship in the source 
documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report the assessment in accordance with the reporting requirements, as applicable, AE or SAE.  
Factors that need to be considered when making a causality assessment include:  
• Temporal relationship (e.g., time of onset) 
•
 Clinical and pathological characteristics of the event(s)  
•
 Pharmacological plausibility  
•
 Exclusion of confounding factors (medical and medication history) 
•
 Drug Interactions  
•
 De-challenge/re- ch allenge 
• Dose relationship 
 
A
 suspected relationship (definite, probable, and possible) between the events and the study 
med
ication means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Receipt of additional or clarifying information may warrant reassessment of 
causality. The Investigator is responsible for assessing relationship of AEs to study treatment in accordance with the following definition s: 
Table 7: D
efinition of Suspected Relationship between the Events and Study  Medication  
DEFINITELY  Causal relationship is certain  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the adverse event (AE) 
onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically 
compatible response to de -challenge, other causes 
have been eliminated; the event must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure if necessary.  
PROBABLY  High degr ee o f certainty for 
causal relationship  For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to de-
challenge (re -challenge is not required), and other

causes have been eli minated or are unlikely.  
POSSIBLY  Causal relationship is 
uncert
ain For Example: the temporal relationship between 
drug exposure and the AE onset/course is reasonable or unknown, de -
challenge information is either 
unknown or equivocal, and while other pote ntial 
causes may or may not exist, a causal relationship to study drug does not appear probable  
UNLIKELY  Not reasonabl y relat ed 
although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out  For Example: Event or laboratory test abnormality, 
with 
a time to drug intak e that makes a relationship 
improbable (but not impossible), or disease or other 
drugs provide plausible explanations  
UNRELATED/NOT 
RELATED  No possible relationship  The temporal relationship between drug exposure 
and t
he AE onset/course is unreasonable or  
incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is impossible  
 
For SAEs,  the relationship to the study treatment(s) is considered to be unlikely or not 
rel
ated/unrelated, an alternative suspected etiology should preferably be provided (e.g., 
concomitant medications, intercurrent condition) wherever applicable and available. 9.3.2.5 Documentation 
All
 AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the 
CRF w
ith the following information; where appropriate (the period of observation for the 
study is described in Section  6): 
• AE name or term in standard medical terminology.  
• Wh
en the AE first occurred (start date and time); SAE start date is defined as the date 
the 
AE became serious.  
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or date and time of last observation if 
ongoin
g, i.e., recovering or not recovered). 
• Severity of the AE.  
• Se
riousness criteria (hospitalization, death, etc.). 
• Ac
tion taken with stud y medication as a result of AE.  
• Outcome.  
• Inv
estigator’s opinion regarding the AE relationship to the study treatments.  
 
Hypo
glycemic events and associated signs/symptoms will only be recorded on the 
hypog
lycemic episodes page of the CRF, unless they are SAEs  (i.e., a severe episode) . 
9.3.2.6 Treatment of Adverse Events  
AEs
 that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by established standards of care. 
If suc
h treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the reason should be documented 
in the CRF; this can include temporary interruption of study treatment. The decision about 
whether the subject may resume the study treatment will be made by the sponsor after 
consultation with the Investigator and/or medical monitor.

Any AE wi ll b e followed -up to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can 
be explained by another known cause (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical 
judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted. All findings r elevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject ’s medical record and recorded on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
9.3.2.8 Notification 
F
or SAEs, the active reporting period to Mylan, begins from the time that the subject  provides 
informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject ’s participation in the study, i.e., prior 
to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including the follow up visit. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAE occurring any time after the active reporting period, the SAE must be promptly reported to Mylan only in case of reasonable causality (i.e. suspected ADR).  
The SAE reporting form  i
 s to be completed for all serious adverse events, signed by the 
Investigator, and emailed or faxed with supporting documentation (e.g., CRFs, hospital records, laboratory reports). Subject  identity details (such as but not limited to name or 
clinic/hospital number) must not be visible on SAE forms or any supporting documentation provided by the Investigator. These should be “blacked out”, and replaced with the site and 
subject ’s study identification number on every page. 
At that time of first notification , the  Investigator/designee should provide the following 
information via the SAE report form:  
• Protocol number 
•
 Reporter ( s tudy site and Investigator) 
• Subject’s uni que identification number  
• Subject ’s  age 
• Investigational medicinal product 
•
 Date of first dose  of study treatment  
• Date of last dose of s tudy treatment, if applicable  
• SAE term  
•
 The seriousness criteria that were met  
•
 Investigator’s opinion of the relationship to the study treatment  
•
 Severity  
•
 Start and stop (if applicable) of the event (date and time)  
•

•
 Concomitant medication at onset of the event 
•
 Relevant past history information  
•
 Relevant laboratory test findings 
 
I
f the initial notification of an SAE is by telephone, within 24  hours  of the initial telephone 
notification the Investigator must email the written SAE report form that describes the SAE 
to the Mylan Product Safety and Risk Management department.

parturition, spontaneous or scheduled termination). 9.4.1 Pregnancy  
A
ll women of childbearing potential who participate in the st udy should be counseled on the 
need to practice adequate birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
study participation. Women should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if 
pregnancy occurs or is suspected.

Pregnancy testing will be conducted throughout the study, as detailed in the schedule of 
assessments. A woman who is found to be pregnant at the randomization visit (Visit 6 [Week 
0]), will be e xcluded from the study. A woman who becomes pregnant during the study will 
be immediately discontinued from study treatment. Early discontinuation visit assessments 
should be performed as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. This information should be captured in the pregnancy form and reported to Mylan Product Safety and Risk Management within 24 hours from the time of initial knowledge, even if beyond the closure of the clinical database.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or el
ective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or an SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Elective termination (i.e., without medical reasons) of an uncomplicated pregnancy is 
cons
idered to be an elective procedure and not an AE, nevertheless, Mylan requests that the 
outcome (e.g., elective termination) be reported within 24 hours and sent as a follow -up on 
the Delivery and Infant Follow-up Form).  
The Investigator is also responsible for following up the pregnancy at 3 monthly intervals 
unti
l delivery or termination, informing the sponsor about its outcome.   
9.4.2 Overdose, Medication Errors and  Other Events  
Overdose per se  o f either study treatment or a concomitant medication will not be reported as 
an AE; unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Signs, symptoms, and clinical sequelae associated with intentional overdose are to be recorded on the AE CRF page. Dosing and other medication errors are to be recorded as protocol deviations. 
9.5 Abnormal Test Findings  
A
bnormal laboratory findings per se (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
asse
ssments (e.g., ECG, X -rays, and vital signs) are not reported as AEs. However, abnormal 
findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with signs and/or symptoms 
must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (and recorded as an SAE if they 
meet th e criteria of being serious). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other 
abnormal findings that are detected after study drug administration or that are present at 
baseline and worsen following the administration of study drug are included as AEs (and 
SAEs, if serious). The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Broad guidance for determining whether an abnormal objective tes t finding 
should be reported as an AE follows:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms and/or  
•
 The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
a
nd/or 
• The test result leads to a change in s tudy dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or 
• The test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or sponsor.

Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute 
an AE.   
Any abnormal test result determined by retest to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE.

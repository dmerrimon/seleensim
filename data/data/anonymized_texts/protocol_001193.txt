TITLE: An Open Label Phase II Study of Tipifarnib in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory 
Peripheral T -Cell Lymphoma  
SPONSOR: Kura Oncology, Inc 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: KO- TIP-002 
STUDY SITES : Multiple centers  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: Phase II  
STUDY PERIOD: This  trial was planned to initiate enrollment in the third quarter of 2015. This 
amendment was instituted in July, 2019.  It is estimated that an additional 12 months  may  be 
required to complete all its study objectives . 
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  To determine the antitumor activity in terms of ob jective response rate 
(ORR) of tipifarnib  in su bjects with relapsed or refractory peripheral T -cell l ymphoma (PTCL) . 
Secondary Objective 1 :  To determine the antitumor activity in terms of progression free 
survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) of tipifarnib  in subject s with relapsed or 
refractory PTCL . 
Secondary Objective 2 :  Safety and tolerability of tipifarnib  in subject s with relapsed or 
refractory PTCL . 
Exploratory Objective:  To explore the feasibility of collecting tissue biopsies , buccal swabs 
and blood samples and analysing these samples for the detection of biomarkers potentially 
related to tipifarnib activity .  The b iomarker analyses may include oncogene panel sequencing 
from tumor tissue samples, immune cytokine profiling from serum samples and Killer cell 
Immunoglobulin- like Receptor ( KIR) genotyping from blood samples.  
 
STUDY DESIGN: 
This Phase II study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib  in 
subject s with relapsed or refractory PTCL. 
Eligible subjects  will receive tipifarnib administered  at a starting dose of 300 mg, orally with 
food, twice a day ( bid) on Days 1-21 in 28 day cycles (i.e. 3 weeks on / 1 week off). Stepwise 
100 mg dose reductions to control treatment- related, treatment- emergent toxicities are also 
allowed.  In the absence o f unmanageable toxicities, subjects may continue  to receive  tipifarnib  
treatment for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression and unmanageable toxicity. 
Treatment may continue beyond 12 months upon agreement of the Investigator and Sponsor.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Tumor assessments will be performed at screening , at the Day 22 visit (± 5 days) performed 
during Cycles 2, 4, 6 and once every approximately 12 weeks (cycles 9, 12, 15, etc.) thereafter, 
until disease progression . Additional tumor assessments may be conducted if deemed necessary 
by the Investigator. Subjects who  discontinue tipifarnib  treatment for reasons other than disease 
progression must  continue tumor assessments until disease progression, withdrawal of subject’s 
consent to study procedures or in itiation of another anticancer therapy. 
Determination of objective tumor response will be performed based on the Lugano Classification 
(Cheson 2014, Appendix II: The Lugano Classification ) and/or measurable cutaneous disease 
according to the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT, Olsen 2011, Appendix 
III: Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool ).  Subjects who have experienced a complete 
response may be considered for transplantation. Information on this intervention and other subsequent anti -cancer therapies will be collected for these subjects.  
Upon disease progression, subjects will be followed approximately every 12 weeks for survival 
until either death or 12 months after accrual of the last study subject, whichever occurs firs t. 
Information on subsequent anticancer therapy will be collected. 
All subjects will be followed -up for safety during treatment and  for approximately 30 additional 
days after treatment discontinuation  (or until immediately before the administration of another 
anticancer treatment) .  Additional safety follow up may be conducted if unresolved toxicity is 
present at the End of Treatment visit.

STATISTICAL METHODS:  
As part of Amendment 6, up to 42 evaluable subjects could be enrolled (re ceived tipifarnib), 
with the first 18 subjects designed to test the null hypothesis of ORR less than 10% vs alternative 
hypothesis is at least 30%.   
Up to 18 subjects may be initially enrolled. A two -stage design will be employed. Eleven study 
subject s will be enrolled; if 2-4 objective  responses ar e observed, 7 additional study subject s will 
be enrolled. At the completion of the study, treatment will be considered of further interest if the 
true ORR is higher than 10%. T o determine the total trial size, a response of interest of 30% is 
assumed.  This design provides 80% power to detect a difference between 10% and 30% ORR at 
one-sided significance level of 0.087. Using this design, the probability of terminating the study at the end of stage 1 if the true ORR is 10% is 0.697 while the probability of terminating the 
study at the end of stage 1 if the true ORR is 30% is 0.113. 
Based on the observed antitumor activity during stage 1 and stage 2 of the study (2 subjects 
enrolled with AITL and both subjects achieved a partial response), an AITL cohort will be 
enrolled (N = 12) according to  Amendment 4 to the protoc ol.  With this sample size, if 4  or more 
responses are observed, the probability that the true response rate in AITL subjects is at least 30% is 82.6 %.   

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 8  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Based on the observed antitumor activity during stage 1 and stage 2 of the study in which 
subjects who were found to have high levels of CXCL12  gene expression by retrospective 
analysis had a longer PFS compared to subjects with low expression, a CXCL12+  cohort will be 
enrolled (N = 12) according to  Amendment 6  to the protoc ol.  With this sample size, if 2 or more 
responses are observed, the probability that the true response rate in CXCL12+ subjects is 10% 
or higher is at least 8 9%. 
Upon the observation of 5 confirmed responses in the AITL cohort, and 5 confirmed responses in 
the CXCL12+  cohort , including 2 of them in subjects with tumors of AITL histology, the trial 
was amended to include up to 20 additional subjects with AITL and related T follicular helper cell tumors  in the AITL cohort in order to further characterize the safety and tolerability of 
tipifarnib in this patient population. The choice of 20 additional subjects was empirical based on the relative rarity of the patient population and n o statisti cal hypotheses will be tested in this 
extension. Including Amendment 7, up to 70 evaluable subjects in total may be enrolled.

CONFIDENTIAL   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Tipifarnib 
Beginning in 1997, t ipifarnib was the first specific inhibitor of farnesyl transferase (FTase)  to 
enter clinical studies  and has been evaluated in over 70 clinical oncology and hematology 
studies.  
Brief information on tipifarnib  is presented in this section; more extensive i nformation is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (Tipifarnib Investigator’s Brochure, Edition 13, March 
2017) .  
5.1.1 Mechanism of Action  
Tipifarnib is a potent and selective nonpeptide inhibitor of  FTase. FTase is an enzyme that 
couples an isoprenyl group, the 15 carbon farnesyl moiety, to proteins for membrane localization 
including the Ras family of oncoproteins. The Ras family (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) are among 
the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer.  Although FTase inhibitors were originally developed to target Ras mutant cancers, tipifarnib and other FTase inhibitors failed to 
demonstrate significant clinical activity specifically in Ras mutant cancers, likely due to the 
observation that KRAS and NRAS undergo an alternate prenylation, geranylgeranylation, when FTase is inhibited (Baines 2011,  Takashima 2013).  
The correlative biology of FTase inhibition by tipifarnib has been studied extensively. FTase inhibitors likely exert their cy totoxic effects by inhibition of multiple farnesylated proteins in the 
cell that are important for proliferation and survival such as members of the Rho, Rheb and 
CENP families.  In vitro, the concentration resulting in 50% of maximum inhibition values for 
isolated human FTase depends on the nature of its substrate, ranging from 0.86 nM for lamin B, a nuclear protein, to 7.9 nM for KRAS.  
Tipifarnib has shown promising signs of clinical activity in a variety of cancers including 
hematological cancers such as AML, MDS and certain lymphomas in multiple clinical trials (Martinelli 2008) . Defining the patient subset or biomarker-defined subset where tipifarnib 
shows high level of efficacy remains as a key focus in the tipifarnib development program. 
5.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
Tipifarnib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with maximum plasma concentrations observed within 2 to 4 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of tipifarnib under fed conditions is 29.3% in cancer patients and similar in healthy subjects. Concomitant intake of a 
high fat meal increases the extent of absorption by an average of 26.8% compared with 
administration under fasting conditions.  
Tipifarnib has an initial fast distribution half -life of about 36 minutes, followed by a dominant 
elimination half -life of about 2.4 hours, and a slower terminal half-life of about 19 hours.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Tipifarnib does not accumulate with multiple dosing. Linear pharmacokinetics are observed for 
tablets over the dose range of 100 mg through 600 mg. Metabol ism and elimination are primarily 
hepatic. Steady state is reached within 2 to 3 days, with no evidence of drug accumulation or 
induction of drug metabolism over time. In adults, the apparent oral clearance of tipifarnib is not influenced by age, sex, body weight, body surface area or the presence of liver metastases.  
Tipifarnib inhibits FTase activity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from study subjects after doses as low as 100 mg bid.  Following a single 600 mg dose, both total  and 
unbound plasma concentrations of tipifarnib over a 12- hour interval exceed those req uired to 
inhibit farnesylation.  Inhibition of FTase is reversible within 3 to 7 days upon discontinuation of tipifarnib administration.  
Increases in tipifarnib bioavailability by  18% to 34% have been consistently observed after its 
administration with food and therefore, tipifarnib has been administered with food throughout 
most of its  clinical development program.  H owever,  the magnitude of the food effect is small 
compared to the variability of pharmacokinetic parameters.  
Pharmacokinetic data suggest that H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors do not alter the 
exposure to tipifarnib  to a clinically significant extent. Subjects may use proton pump inhibitors 
or H2 antagonists during the treatment portion of this study. However, subjects should be instructed to use antacids (magnesium or aluminum containing products) at least 2 hours before or after intake of oral study drug. 
Tipifarnib is a substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and glucuronosyltransferase. 
Inhibitors of CYP 450 enzymes, including azole antifungals and omeprazole, did not reduce the 
clearance of tipifarnib in humans. However, antiepileptic drugs that are potent inducers of 
CYP450 enzymes (e.g. phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine) reduce plasma 
concentrations of tipifarnib and caution is warranted if concomitant administration of such agents 
is necessary.  Therefore,  it is recommended that subjects use non-enzyme-inducing anti-
convulsants (e.g., gabapentin, topiramate, valproate) if necessary while taking tipifarnib.  
In addition, population pharmacokinetic analyses evaluated the influence of various concomitant medic ations on the pharmacokinetics of tipifarnib in clinical studies. Amphotericin, antiemetics, 
5HT3 antagonists (dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, and tropisetron), antifungal azoles (econazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole), benzodiazepines, ciprofloxacin, and corticosteroids appeared to have no discernible impact on the plasma concentrations of tipifarnib.  
5.2 Clinical Experience  
Promising activity of tipifarnib  in an unselected  hematology population was reported in poor- risk 
acute leukemia s, in which clinical responses occurred in 10 (29%) of the 34 evaluable patients, 
including 2 complete remissions (Karp 2001). Subjects we re dosed at doses ranging from 100 
mg to 1200 mg twice daily for 21 days. In a second phase 2 trial in subjec ts with MD S, tipifarnib  

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 19  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   showed activity in 3 of 27 subjects , resulting in two complete remission s and one partial 
remission  (Kurzrock 2004). The drug was administered at a dose of 600 mg twice daily for 4 
weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest. Subsequent phase 2 and 3 studies in acute myeloid leukemia 
and MDS  failed to confirm a clinical benefit derived from tipifarnib  treatment  in the se 
indications. 
A phase 2 study of tipifarnib was conducted in 93 adult subjects with relapsed or refractory 
lymphoma (Wi tzig 2011) . Subjects received tipifarnib 300 mg twice daily on days 1-21 of each 
28-day cycle. The median number of prior therapies was 5 (range, 1-17). For the aggressive B-cell, indolent B -cell, and T -cell and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL/T) groups, the response rates were 
17% (7/42), 7% (1/15), and 31% (11/36), respectively. Of the 19 responders, 7 were diffuse large 
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 7 T-cell NHL, 1 follicular grade 2, and 4 HL. The 
median response duration for the 19 responders was 7.2 months (mean, 15.8 months; range, 1.8-62). Safety findings included ( grade 3, 4) 37% neutropenia, 31% thrombocytopenia, and 11% 
anemia. 
Of the 11 responses observed in the T-cell and Hodgkin lymphoma group, 6 were complete 
(CR). Two responses were observed in 4 subjects with mycosis fungoides and 4 in 8 subjects 
with PTCL, including 3 CRs. Median time to progression and DOR for this group were respectively 2.5 and 11.3 months. Median overall survival was 19.7 months. Eighty one percent of the subjects enrolled in the T-cell and Hodgkin lymphoma group had 4 or more prior therapies 
and 67% (24/36) a prior stem cell transplant  (Witzig 2011). 
A preliminary  assessment of the first 50 s ubjects enrolled into the current trial was recent ly 
published ( Witzig 2019).  In the initial stages of the study, a retrospective assessment had 
suggested a high- degree of anti -tumor activity of tipifarnib in AITL and in PTCL- NOS subjects 
whose tumors expressed high levels of CXCL12 and carried  reference CXCL12 3’UTR 
sequences of the CXCL12 gene ( Witzig 2017) .  The median progression- free survival (mPFS) in 
subjects with reference 3’UTR sequences (n = 8) was 134 days, vs. a median PFS of 50 days (n = 7) in subjects whose tumors expressed the rs2839695 A>G variant of the gene, which result ed in 
low levels of CXCL12  expression.  Based on those findings, a cohort of PTCL NOS subjects 
with reference CXCL12 3’UTR and a cohort enrolling AITL  subjects were added to the trial. 
These cohorts investigated  prospectively whether selection for subjects with  high CXCL12 
expressing tumors enriches for the activity of tipifarnib. Of 15 subjects enrolled into the PTCL 
expansion cohort, 12 were evaluable for efficacy at the time of the report.  In the per protocol set 
(PPS, or all subjects who received at least 1 dose of tipifarnib and had 1 post- baseline efficacy 
assessment) the objective response rate (ORR) was 41.7% (3 CR, 2 PR) and the clinical benefit 
rate (CBR) was 91.7% (3 CR, 2 PR and 6 SD).  Fo ur subjects of AITL histology were enrolled in 
the cohort.  Of the 3 CRs observed, 2 were experienced by AITL subjects.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   In the AITL expansion cohort, 16 patients were enrolled with  11 being evaluable for efficacy.  
The ORR in the PPS was 45.4% and the CBR was 72.7% (3 CR, 2 PR, 3 SD).  If all AITL 
subjects enrolled in the study are considered  (expansion cohort subjects plus the AITL subjects 
in the early phases of the trial, n = 23, 17 evaluable), the ORR was 52.9% and the CBR was 70.6% (5CR, 4PR, 3 SD). 
5.3 Rationale for the Study  
Lymphomas derived from mature ( post-thymic) T- cell clone s with T- cell receptor gene 
rearrangement are referred to as PTCL. Multiple subtypes have been identified . Lymphomas that 
do not fit into a defined category are referred to as PTCL NOS and comprise the largest group with 34% of all subjects with PTCL. PTCL, with the exception of the ALK- positive ALCL , is 
associated with a poor prognosis with a 5 -year overall survival of less than 32%. The majority of 
these subjects experience recurrence of their disease. Pralatrexate, romidepsin and belinostat have been  recently approved in the US and other countries for the treatment o f subjects with 
relapsed  PTCL; however, responses with these agents are generally seen only in less than one 
third of the subjects and overall progression free survival is short lived. Consequently, additional treatment options are still needed  for these subjects.  
Tipifarnib was  well tolerated and has shown initial activity in a small cohort of subjects with 
PTCL (Witzig 2011). The present study is designed to provide further evidence of safety and efficacy in this patient population. In addition, based on the observed antitumor activity during 
stage 1 and stage 2 of the present study (2 subjects enrolled with AITL and both subjects 
achieved a partial response), an AITL cohort will be enrolled (N = 12) according to Amendment 4 to the protocol in order to further explore the antitumor activity of tipifarnib in this histological subtype of PTCL.  
In Amendment 6, a cohort (n=12) of subjects with CXCL12+ PTCL was added based on 
preliminary tumor mutational data and outcomes from 16 subjects enrolled in stage 1 and 2 of 
the current study which suggested that subjects with high levels of CXCL12 gene expression 
and/or absence of 3'UTR CXCL12 gene variation derive clinical benefit from tipifarnib.  In those 16 subjects, a high rate of CXCL12 3’UTR single nucleotide variation (SNV) was observed. 
Seven of 16 pts carried the rs2839695 variant while an additional patient carried a novel variant. 
The presence of 3’UTR SNVs was associated with low levels of CXCL12 gene expression and disease progression while all pts deriving clinical benefit  from tipifarnib carried reference (wild 
type) 3’UTR CXCL12 and had tumors that expressed high levels of mRNA for this chemokine (Witzig 2017). 
Given the results shown in Section 5.2 above, in the current amendment, additional subjects with 
AITL, nodal PTC L with T -follicular helper phenotype and follicular PTCL will be added to 
further assess the safety and tolerability of tipifarnib in this patient population .

8 TRIAL DESIGN  
8.1 Study Design  
This Phase II study will investig ate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib  in 
subject s with relapsed or refractory PTCL.  Only c onsented subject s who meet all the eligibility 
criteria will be enrolled in the study. All screening evaluations will be completed within 4 weeks 
(28 days) of Cycle 1 Day 1 . Any screening evaluation, including disease status, will need to be 
repeated if performed more than 4 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 .  
Up to  70 subjects may  be enrolled (receive tipifarnib) in the study.  The first 18 subjects may be 
of the following PTCL sub- types: PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL- NOS), 
angioimmunoblastic T- cell lymphoma (AITL), ALK -positive and -negative anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma (ALCL), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, enteropathy- associate T -cell lymphoma

CONFIDENTIAL   (EATL), extranodal natural killer (NK) T -cell lymphoma, nasal type and subcutaneous 
panniculitis- like T -cell lymphoma.  The AITL expansion cohort (N=12) will enroll only subjects 
with A ITL.   
A two -stage study de sign for the first 18 subjects will be used  in order t o minimize the number of 
study subject s treated if tipifarnib  were considered  not sufficiently efficacious to grant further 
development in this subject population. Th is design is intended to allow the  termination of 
accrual  in case of  unacceptably low efficacy after  objective responses in  the first 11 evaluable 
subjects (stage 1)  asse ssed in a Full Analysis Set (FAS)  basis. If 0-1 objective responses are 
observed after th e first 11 evaluable subjects, the study will be closed to further enro llment. If 2-
4 responses are observed, 7 additional subjects will be enrolled  (stage 2) . Treatmen t will be 
considered of further interest if at least 4 responses are observed  (out of 18 subjects) .  
Based on the observed antitumor activity during stage 1 and stage 2 of the study (2 subjects 
enrolled with AITL and both subjects achieved a partial response), an AITL cohort will be 
enrolled (N = 12) according to  Amendment 4 to the protocol.  With this sa mple size, if 4 or more 
responses are observed, the probability that the true response rate in AITL subjects is at least 
30% is 82.6 %.   
Based on the observed antitumor activity during stage 1 and stage 2 of the study in which subjects who were found to have high levels of CXCL12 gene expression by retrospective analysis had a longer PFS compared to subjects with low expression, a CXCL12+ cohort will be 
enrolled (N = 12) according to Amendment 6 to the protocol.  With this sample size, if 2 or more 
response s are observed, the probability that the true response rate in CXCL12+ subjects is at 
least 10% is at least 8 9%.  
Based on the high antitumor activity  observed in AITL subjects in the AITL cohort and other 
portions of the study, enrolment in the AITL cohort has been expanded to include up to 20 
additional subjects with tumors of AITL and related T follicular helper cell histologies in order 
to further characterize the safety and tolerability of tipifarnib in this relatively rare population. 
The selection of  20 subjects was empirical and no statistical hypotheses will be tested. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to report response rate.  
Eligible subjects will receive tipifarnib administered at a starting dose of 300 mg, orally with food, bid on days 1  - 21 in 28 day cycles. Stepwise 100 mg dose reductions to control treatment-
related, treatment -emergent toxicities are allowed  and further detailed in Section 9.5. Subjects 
who received tipifarnib bid on days 1 – 7 and days 15 – 21 in 28 day cycles during the conduct 
of earlier versions of this protocol may remain on that dose regimen at the discretion of the investigator.  Alternatively, the subject may transition to receive a dose of 300 mg, orally with 
food, bid on days 1-21 of 28 day treatment cycles beginning on Day 1 of their next cycle. 
Subjects may use proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists during the treatment portion of this 
study. However, subjects should be instructed to use antacids (magnesium or aluminum containing products) at least 2 hours before or after intake of oral study drug.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   In the absence of emerging unmanageable toxicity, subjects may continue tipifarnib  treatment for 
as long as the investigator considers that the treatment is providing clinical benefit up to 12 
months since the subject’s enrol lment . Treatment may continue beyond 12 months upon 
agreement by the Investigator and Sponsor if there is documented evidence of sustained clinical benefit.  
Tumor assessments will be performed at screening, at the Day 2 2 visit (± 5 days) performed 
during Cycles 2, 4, 6 and once every approximately 12 weeks (cycles 9, 12, 15, etc.) thereafter, 
until disease progression. Tumor assessments will be performed more frequently if deemed 
necessary by the investigator. A tumor assessment will be performed upon  treatment 
discontinuation (End of Treatment visit) if the reason for discontinuation is other than disease 
progression and no tumor assessment was performed in the prior 8 weeks. Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression must continue tumor assessments until disease progression, withdrawal of subject’s consent or initiation of another 
anticancer therapy.  Dete rmination  of objective tumor response will be performed by the 
Investigator  according to the Lugano Classification  and/or mSWAT criteria.   Subjects who have 
experienced a complete response may be considered for transplantation.  
Efforts will be made to collect information on the subject’s response and duration of response to 
the last prior therapy.  
Upon disease progression , all subjects will be followed approximately every 12 weeks for 
survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or 12 months after accrual of the last 
study subject, whichever occurs first . Information on survival and subsequent anticancer therapy 
may be collected by phone.  
All subjects will be followed -up for safety during treatment and up to approximately 30 days (+/ - 
7 days) after treatment discontinuation  or until immediately before the initiation of another anti -
cancer therapy, whichever occurs first . Additional follow up may be implemented until the 
subject recovers from any emergent treatment related  toxicity  or the adverse event is considered 
irreversible by the investigator. Target organ toxicities will be monitored via clinical and 
laboratory assessments using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE v 4.03).  
8.2 Subject Identification and Replacement of Subjects 
Each subject will be assigned a unique subject identifier. This unique identifier will be on all eCRF pages.  
Subjects within the initial trial subset of 18 subjects (stage 1 and 2) and in the AITL expansion 
cohort who do not receive at least one dose of tipifarnib will be replaced. Subjects within the 
initial trial subset of 18 subjects (stage 1 and 2) and in the AITL expansion cohort who are 
unable to provide archival tumor tissue by the end of Cycle 1 and who did not have a biopsy 
performed prior to initiation of tipifarnib treatment will be replaced. Replacement subjects will

tissue that is of insufficient quality for biomarker evaluation, may be replaced. 
8.3 Assignment to Treatment Groups  
This is a nonrandomized study. S ubjects will be enrolled sequentially.  
8.4 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment 
Subjects may withdraw their consent to participate in this study at any time without prejudice. 
The Investigator must withdraw from the study any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A 
subject’s participation in the study may also be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. Every effort should be made to 
complete, whenever possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the End of Treatment visit. The 
Sponsor must be notified of all subject withdrawals as soon as possible. The Sponsor also  
reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for ei ther clinical research  or 
administrative reasons and to discontinue participation by an individua l Investigator or site for 
poor enrollment or noncompliance. 
Overall, the r easons for which the Investigator or Kura  Oncology may wi thdraw a subject from 
study treatment include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Subject experiences disease progression  
• Subject experiences unacceptable toxicity  
• Subject requires more than 2 dose reductions 
• Subject experiences toxicity that is deemed  by the Investigator to be no longer safe for 
the subject to continue therapy  
• Subject requests to withdraw from the study treatment  
• Subject requires or has taken medicati on prohibited by the protocol 
• Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the study requirements  
• Subject withdraws consent to collect health information  
• Subject was erroneously admitted into the study or does not meet entry criteria 
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
• Subject becomes pregnant 
Subjects will return for an End of Treatment visit within approximately 30 days after the last 
administration of the study drug (or sooner if another anticancer therapy is to be initiated). If a 
subject fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to determine the 
reason. If the subject cannot be reached by telephone after 2 attempts, a certified letter should be

CONFIDENTIAL   sent to the subject (or the subject’s legally authorized representative,  if appropriate ) requesting 
contact with the Investigator. This information should be recorded in the study records.  
Prior to enrollment into the study, the Investigator or designee must explain to each subject, that 
the subject’s protected health information obtained during the study may be shared with the 
study Sponsor, regulatory agencie s, and IRB/ IEC in order to analys e and evaluate study results. 
It is the Investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected 
health in formation per country- specific regulations, such as HIPAA in the US , from each subject, 
or if appropriate, the subject’s legally authorized repr esentative. If permission to use protected 
health information is with drawn, it is the Investigator’s responsibil ity to obtain a written request 
from the subject , to ensure that no furt her data will be collected from the subject and the subject 
will be removed from the study. 
8.5 Premature Discontinuation of the Trial 
This trial may be discontinued prematurely in the event of any of the following: 
• New information leading to a judgment of unfavorable risk -benefit of tipifarnib  becomes 
available, e.g. due to: Evidence of inefficacy of tipifarnib  in PTCL , occurrence of 
significant previously unknown adverse reactions or unexpectedly high intensity or 
incidence of previously known adverse reactions, or other unfavorable safety findings in 
the PTCL patient population. Evidence of inefficacy may arise from this trial or from other trials; unfavorable safety findings may arise fr om clinical or non -clinical 
examinations, e.g. toxicology. 
• Sponsor’s decision that continuation of the trial is unjus tifiable for medical or ethical 
reasons.  
• Poor enrollment of subjects making completion of the trial within an acceptable time frame  unlikely.  
• Discontinuation of development of tipifarnib  by the Sponsor.  
• Request by a Health Authority. 
Health Authorities and IRBs/IECs  will be informed about the discontinuation of the trial in 
accordance with applicable regulations. In the case of premature discontinuation of the study, the 
investigations scheduled for the End of Treatment assessment should be performed and the 
appropri ate eCRF section completed.  
8.6 Definition of End of Study  
For administrative and safety reporting purposes, the end of this clinical study is defined as 12 months from enrollment of the last enrolled study subject.  If the last enrolled study subject 
discontinues treatment within 12 months of study enrollment, the End of Study will occur no earlier than the date of the last enrolled subject’s safety follow -up assessment performed 

Tipifarnib

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   approximately 30 days after treatment discontinuation (or until initiation of ano ther anti -cancer 
therapy).   At the time of End of Study, provisions will be made to transition all remaining study 
subjects who demonstrate sustained clinical benefit beyond the end of the study to other means 
of continued treatment with appropriate safety  monitoring, e.g. single patient treatment protocol.  
9 TREATMENTS  
Subjects will receive tipifarnib  as monotherapy in this study. In the absence of unacceptable 
tipifarnib  related emergent toxicity or disease progression, subjects may receive treatment with 
tipifarnib  for up to 12 months at the discretion of the Investigator. Treatment beyond 12 months  
may continue upon agreement of the Investigator and the Sponsor. Kura  Oncology, Inc or its 
designee will provide the study site with a supply of tipifarnib  sufficient for the completion of 
the study. 
All study subject s will be also eligible to receive best supportive care (BSC) defined as any 
standard supportive measure s that are not considered a primary treatment of the disease under 
study, including the use of growth factors (i.e. GCSF) for myelosuppression. BSC will be 
provided by the study sites. 
9.1 Investigational Product (IP) 
Tipifarnib  is a small molecule being developed as a potent, selective inhibitor of FTase  for the 
treatment of cancer and other malignancies. 
9.1.1 Product Characteristics  
Tipifarnib film -coated tablets for oral administration are supplied in HDPE bottles. Two 
strengths (100 mg and 300 mg) of tablets are provided containing either 100 or 300 mg of 
tipifarnib active substance, respectively. In addition to the active substance, the tablets contain 
the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, maize starch, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, colloidal anhydrous silica, and magnesium stearate. 
The nonfunctional, taste-masking film coatings contain hypromellose, titanium dioxide, lactose 
monohydrate, polyethylene glycol, and triacetin. Each strength of tablet has the same excipients but the quantitative composition is slightly different. Further information can be obtained from the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
9.1.2 Storage and Labeling  
At a minimum, the label of each bottle of tipifarnib  tablets shipped to the study sites will provide 
the following information: batch number/lot number, study identification, required storage conditions, directions for use, and country specific required caution statements (including “New Drug – Limited by United States federal law to in vestigational use” language).

CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 30  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Tipifarnib  accountability records will be maintained by the pharmacy or designated drug 
preparation area at the study sites. Upon receipt of tipifarnib  supplies, the pharmacist or 
designated study site investigational drug handler will inventory tipifarnib  (separately for each 
strength, if applicable ) and complete the designated section of the shipping form. The 
shipping/inventory form must be sent to Kura  Oncology, Inc or its designee, as instructed.  
Tipifarnib  should be stored at controlled room temperature 15 to 30 C (59 to 86 F). All study 
supplies must be kept in a restricted access area.  
9.2 Treatment Administration  
Tipifarnib will be administered with food at a starting dose of 300 mg, orally , bid on days 1 - 21 
of 28 day tre atment cycles.   Subjects who received tipifarnib bid on Days 1 – 7 and Days 15 – 21 
during the conduct of earlier versions of this protocol may remain on that dose regimen at the 
discretion of the investigator. Alternatively, the subject may transition to receive a dose of 300 mg, orally with food, bid on days 1-21 of 28 day treatment cycles beginning on Day 1 of their next cycle. 
The first study dosing (Cycle 1 Day 1) will take place in the study clinic.  Tipifarnib  will be 
administered orally with a meal in the morning and again approximately 12 hours later at 
approximately the same times each treatment day. Tablets should be swallowed whole with 
water (~8 oz.  or 250 mL), but may be chewed or crushed if the Investigator deems it necessary . 
Use of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes is allowed at the judgment of the Investigator.   If a dose is vomited or partially vomited, it should not be replaced with a new dose. 
Subjects may use proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists during the treatment portion of this study. However, subjects should be instructed to use antacids (magnesium or aluminum containing products) at least 2 hours before or after intake of oral study drug. 
Subjects will be provided with diaries with instructions to record the date and time of each dose and asked to bring the diaries and tablet  bottles to each clinic visit for subject  compliance and 
drug accountability review by the site staff.  
9.3 Treatment Assignment  
Treatment will be  conducted in an open label manner.  Kura  Oncology, Inc or it s designee will 
assign  a subject number identifier for each subject that is enrolled  into the study. Study s ites 
cannot enroll or start dosing the subject without receiving the assigned subject number.  
9.4 Dose Selection 
In the majority of its phase 2 program, tipifarnib was given orally at a dose of 300 mg bid for 21 days, followed by 1 week of rest, in 28 day treatment cycles ( 3 weeks on/1 week off schedule).  
Prior studies have shown that  
 those shown to demonstrate anti -tumor activity in preclinical tumor models.  In the AML

CONFIDENTIAL   studies which administered tipifarnib at doses up to 600 mg bid for 21 days in 28- day treatment 
cycles, the most common adverse events were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disorders, 
fever, fatigue, hypokalemia, rash, renal impairment, and dyspnea. The most common drug-related grade 3 or 4 events were myelosuppression, hypokalemia, fatigue, and rash. 
Thrombocytopenia, r enal impairment, rash, and sepsis were the most common adverse events 
that led to discontinuation.  In the completed MDS study (INT-28) which administered tipifarnib 
at a dose of 300 mg bid for 21 days in 28- day treatment cycles, the most common adverse events 
were myelosuppression, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and rash. The most common drug- related 
grade 3 or 4 events were myelosuppression, fever, pneumonia, bacterial infection, and rash. The 
most common adverse events that lead to discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and rash.  
No data are currently available in the sponsor’s database on the safety and tolerability of tipifarnib from prior studies in subjects with lymphoma. However, a phase 2 investigator-
initiated study of tipifarnib was conducted in 93 adult patients with relap sed or refractory 
lymphoma.  Patients received tipifarnib 300 mg twice daily on days 1-21 of each 28- day cycle. 
The median number of prior therapies was 5 (range, 1-17).  For the aggressive B- cell, indolent 
B-cell, and T -cell and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL/T) groups, the response rates were 17% (7/42), 
7% (1/15), and 31% (11/36), respectively. Of the 19 responders, 7 were diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 7 T-cell NHL, 1 follicular grade 2, and 4 HL. The median response duration for the 19 responders was 7.2 months (mean, 15.8 months; range, 1.8-62). The grade 3/4 toxicities observed were fatigue and reversible myelosuppression (Witzig 2011) . 
In the original version and amendments 1 – 4 of the current study, an effort was made to evaluate the safety  and tolerability of administering tipifarnib  
 
 two 
trials in MDS and AML  subjects investigating alternate week dosing , i.e. 7-day bid dosing 
followed by 7 days of rest ( Kurzro ck 2008, Kirschbaum 2011) .  
Based on these data, a  for evaluation in this 
study.  However,  
 in 
amendment 3.  Ongoing review of preliminary data from subjects enrolled in stages 1 and 2 of the current study suggested that toxicities were consistent with known safety profile of tipifarnib.  
No subject discontinued due to AEs .  Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurring in > 10% of subjects were 
hematology-related and included neutropenia (83%), thrombocytopenia (61%), leukopenia 
(50%), anemia (39%), febrile neutropenia (33%) and lymphopenia (17%). Myelosuppression was manageable with treatmen t interruption, dose reductions and/or growth factor support.   
As of July 2017, four subjects required further dose  in alternating 
weeks, including t he two ongoing subjects enrolled in stage s 1 and 2 of the study.   
 over a 28- day treatment 
cycle achieved with the prior regimen (300 mg bid on days 1 – 21 of 28- day treatment cycles).

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Based on these preliminary data, it was concluded that the  
 over a 28-
day cycle.   
Therefore, in Amendment 5 the dose and dose regimen was revised to tipifarnib 300 mg bid for 
21 days in 28- day treatment cycles.  This dose and dose regimen is expected to be well tolerated 
and to provide potential clinical benefit to subjects with PTCL.  In addition, the current study 
allows for step -wise 100 mg dose de- escalation based on subject tolerability.  Subjects who 
received tipifarnib  during the conduct of earlier versions of 
this protocol may remain on that dose regimen at the discretion of the investigator. Alternatively, 
the subject may transition to receive a dose of 300 mg, orally with food, bid on days 1-21 of 28 day treatment cycles beginning on Day 1 of their next cycle. 
The data obtained from this study will be used to select the optimal dose and dose regimen to 
support the further development of tipifarnib in subjects w ith PTCL.

An overdose is defined as any dose greater than  20% over the scheduled daily tipifarnib  dose. 
Any overdose must be recorded in the trial medication section of the eCRF. There is no known 
antidote for tipifarnib . In the event of overdose of tipifarnib , subjects should receive appropriate 
advice and supportive medical care by the investigator or his/her designee and be followed-up accordingly. 
For monitoring purposes, any case of overdose – whether or not associated with an AE (serious 
or non- serious) – must be reported to the Sponsor in an expedited manner. 
9.7 Blinding  
This is an open label study with no placebo or comparators. 
9.8 Treatment Compliance 
The importance of treatment compliance should be emphasized to the subject. Subjects will  be 
given study drug, dose diaries and detailed instructions on how to take medications at home. 
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused study drug containers at each study visit, 
unless otherwise specified  per site SOP . Subject compliance with the dosing schedule will be 
assessed by reconciliation of the used  and unused study drug at each clinic visit and review of 
the dosing diaries. The quantity dispensed, returned, used, lost, etc. must be recorded on the dispensing log provided.   
Compliance will be mo nitored and documented by site personnel on the appropriate form. The 
site personnel will question the subject regarding adherence to the dosing schedule by reviewing the dosing diaries, recording the number of tablets ( and strengths , if applicable)  returned, the 
date returned, and determining treatment compliance before dispensing new medication to the study subject.

CONFIDENTIAL   9.9 Investigational Product Accountability  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including dates and 
quantities) of IP received, subjects t o whom IP is dispensed (subject by subject  specific 
accounting), and IP lost or accidentally or deliberately de stroyed. The Investigator or designee 
must retain all unused or expired study supplies until the Sponsor’s designated  trial monitor has 
confirmed the accountability data or a waiver for site drug destruction prior to monitoring visits is provided by the Sponsor. 
9.10 Return and Disposition of Clinical Supplies  
Unused study drug must be kept in a secure location for accountability and reconciliation by the 
Sponsor’s designated clinical trial monitor. The Investigator or designee must provide an 
explanation for an y destroyed or missing study drug or study materials. 
Study drug may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard operating procedures, but only after 
the Sponsor or its designee has granted approval for drug destruction. All study drug destroyed 
on site must be documented. 
Documentation must be provided to the Sponsor or its  designee and retained in the Investigator’s 
study files. If a site is unable to destroy study drug appropriately, the site can return unused study 
drug to the Sponsor or it s designee upon request. The return of study drug or study drug 
materials  must be accounted for on a form provided by the Sponsor or its  designee.  
All study drug and related materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and destroyed or returned according to applicable state and federal regulations and study procedures. 
9.11 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prescription and over-the-counter medications taken by a subject within 28 days before the first study drug administration will be recorded in  the e CRF.  
Supportive care medications considered necessary for the subject’s safety and well -being may be 
given at the discretion of the Investigator. Any concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study should be recorded on the e CRF.  
BSC will be provided by the clinical study sites according to local guidelines and standard practices.  
Furthermore, the following treatments are allowed during the trial:  
• IV hydration  
• Correction of electrolyte deficiency.  
• Hematopoietic growth factors and transf usions of blood or blood products in subjects 
who are experiencing hematological toxicity in accordance with standard institutional 
practice.

resection.  
Any additional concomitant therapy that becomes necessary during the trial and any change to 
concomitant drugs must be recorded in the corresponding section of the eCRF, noting the name, dose, duration and indication of each drug. 
9.12 Non-permitted Treatments  
Use of the following medications and therapies is not allowed during the trial: 
• Investigational agents other than tipifarnib . 
• Any other anticancer therapy, including radiation or surgery, for the primary disease under study with the exception s of palliative treatment . 
• Subjects should not use enzyme-inducing anti- convulsants (e.g. phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
and carbamazepine) while taking tipifarnib. If needed, subjects may use non-enzyme-inducing anti-convulsants (e.g. gabapentin, topiramate, valproate) while taking tipifarnib.  
• High dose systemic corticosteroids or any other i mmun osuppressive drugs except  
glucocorticosteroid treatment administered with a  daily dose of ≤ 20mg prednisone or 
equivalent, and single doses for the management of treatment -related adverse events or 
for premedication  of BSC agents. 
If the administration of a non-permitted concomitant drug becomes necessary during the trial, e.g., because of AEs or disease progression, the subject in question will be withdrawn from the trial, and the subject’s data which will have been obtained before the withdrawal may be used for safety and efficacy evaluations.  
9.13 Dietary or Other Protocol Restrictions 
No dietary restrictions  related to tipifarnib  are required .

CONFIDENTIAL   9.14 Medical Care of Subjects after End of Trial  
After a subject has completed the trial or has w ithdrawn from the study, standard treatment will 
be administered, if required, in accordance with the trial site’s  standard of care and generally 
accepted medical practice and according to  the subject’s individual medical needs.  
9.15 Potential Effects on R eprod uction and Development 
Male and female fertility and reproductive capacity has been shown to be impaired in rats.  
In a fertility study conducted in male rats, the no observed effect level (NOEL) for tipifarnib  
  Although toxicokinetic data were not generated in this study, systemic exposure 
can be estimated from the 3 -month oral toxicity study conducted with tipifarnib in rats (Study 
No. 4389).  In that study, steady state (Day 87) systemic exposure (AUC0- 24) to tipifarnib in 
male rats at  
 
Tipifarnib was shown to have adverse effects on the developing embryo/fetus in rats. The no 
observe d adverse effect level (NOAEL) for embryo -fetal toxicity . Maternal 
systemic exposure data at this dose level are not available.  
There were no adverse effects on the developing embryo/fetus when tipifarnib was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis.  The NOAEL for embryo- fetal toxicity in 
this study . Maternal systemic exposure 
(AUC0 -24) to tipifarnib at this dose level was  on Gestation Day 18 (the last day 
of dosing). 
When tipifarnib was administered to pregnant rats from Gestation Day 6 through Lactation Day 
21, the NOAEL for effects on pre- and post-natal development .  Maternal 
systemic exposure (AUC0 -t) to tipifarnib was  on Gestation Day 16 and  
 on Lactation Day 8. 
In light of these observations, both female subjects and male subjects with female partners of 
child -bearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception for 2 weeks 
prior to screening, during, and at least 4 weeks after last dose of trial medication.  Female 
subjects must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to start of trial 
medication. 
In addition, since tipifarnib could induce toxicity of male reproductive organs and cause 
impairment of fertility, sperm cryopreservation should be recommended for male subjects 
wishing to preserve their fertility following tipifarnib treatment.  
10 EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES  
Table 1 summarizes the study required  evaluations. 

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 40  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   10.1 Efficacy Variables 
Radiological and/or physical assessments of the tumor lesions  will be made at screening (4 
weeks before the first study dr ug administration ) and at regular intervals as indicated in the 
schedule of activities ( Table 1). Additional tumor assessments may be conducted at the judgment 
of the investigator. The imaging schedule (approximately every 8 weeks during the subject’s first 
6 months on study, thereafter every 12 weeks) should be maintained regardless of dosing delays or additional imaging assessments performed. Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons 
other than disease progression must continue tumor assessments until disease progression, 
withdrawal of their consent to study procedures or initiation of another anticancer therapy.  
Efficacy assessments may also be co nducted at treatment discontinuation (End of Treatment 
visit) if the reason for the treatment termination is other than disease progression and a tumor assessment was not done within 8 weeks before treatment discontinuation ( assessment must be 
conducted before additional anti-tumor the rapy is started) . Scans at the End of Treatment visit 
will be also conducted if required to confirm response to treatment. 
Lesions to be included in the t umor assessments should follow the Lugano Classification criteria  
and/or mSWAT. In subjects with FDG a vid lymphomas, PET -CT is the preferred  scanning 
method for screening and all subsequent tumor assessments (Cycle 2, Cycle 4, Cycle 6, etc.).   In 
subjects with low or variable FDG avid lymphomas, Spiral CT with contrast is the preferred 
scanning method for screening and all subsequent tumor assessments (Cycle 2, Cycle 4, Cycle 6, 
etc.).   Subjects with contrast allergy may use non-contrast CT or MRI, whichever is required t o 
adequately assess all disease. The same method of imaging must be used throughout a subject’s 
participation on this study.   
Bone marrow assessment (biopsy or PET assessment) will be performed at screening within 28 
days of Cycle 1 day 1. If baseline bone marrow assessment was positive for  lymphoma, a bone 
marrow biopsy or PET evaluation would be mandatory to confirm a complete response (i.e. after radiographic assessment).  
Objective response (complete response and partial response) as determined by the subject’s best tumor response, duration of response, and time to progress ion will be assessed using the Lugano 
Classification  and/or mSWAT.  
Upon disease progression, all subjects will be followed approximately every 12 weeks for survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or 12 months after accrual of th e last 
study subject, whichever occurs first. Information on survival and subsequent anticancer therapy may be collected by phone.  
10.2 Assessment of Safety  
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.03. Adverse events will be summarized by relationship to trial drug, severity and grade. The safety profile of the IPs will 
be assessed through the recording, reporting and analyzing of baseline medical conditions, 

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 41  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   adverse events, physical examination findings including vital signs and laboratory tests. 
Comprehensive assessment of any apparent toxicity experienced by the subject will be 
performed throughout the course of the trial, from the time of the subject’s signature of informed consent. Trial site personnel will report any adverse event (AE), whether observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject. 
The Investigators and Sponsor clinicians or designees will review all relevant safety data by 
teleconference on a regular basis  (at least monthly or more frequently if required to monitor 
emerging adverse events) . No external  independent data safety monitoring board is planned for 
this study. Any decisions affecting the conduct of the study will be minute d. Institutional IRBs 
and regulatory authorities will be informed of any major changes that might require a modification of the study protocol. 
10.3 Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relatio nship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. In cases of 
surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  In case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered as 
the AE, and the death is cons idered as its outcome. 
The Investigator is required to grade the severity/intensity of each adverse event.  Investigators 
will reference the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03. This is a descriptive terminology that can be used 
for adverse event reporting. A general grading (severity/intensity) scale is provided at the beginning of the referenced document, and specific event grades are also provided. If a particular AE’s severity/intensity is not specifically graded by the guidance document, the Investigator is to 
revert to the general definitions of Grade 1 through Grade 5 and use his or her best medical judgment. 
The 5 general grades are:  
• Grade 1: Mild  
• Grade 2: Moderate  
• Grade 3: Severe ; disabling  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE. Note: Death (Grade 5 as defined by NCI- CTCAE version 
4.03) is mainly regarded as an outcome, to be documented as described below.  

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 42  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   According to the Sponsor’s convention, if a severity/intensity of Grade 4 or 5 is applied to an 
AE, then the Investigator must also report the event as a serious adverse event (SAE; see 
definition below) according to Section 10.5. However, a laboratory abnormality with a severity/intensity of Grade 4, such as anemia or neutropenia, is considered serious only if the condition meets one of the serious criteria described below.  
In the case of death, the primary cause of death (the event leading to death) should be recorded and reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this respective event; death  
will not be record ed as separate event. Only if no cause of death can be reported (e.g., sudden 
death, unexplained death), the death per se might be reported as an SAE. 
Investigators must also systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the IPs, other 
medicinal products using the following definitions. Decisive factors for the assessment of causal 
relationship of an AE to the trial treatments include, but may not be limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the trial treatments, known side effects of the trial treatments,  
medical history, concomitant medications and procedures, course of the underlying disease, trial procedures. 
Relatedness of an AE will be evaluated as follows:  
• Not related: Not suspected to be reasonably related to the IPs. AE could not medically  
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IP s under trial in this clinical  trial 
protocol. A reasonable alternative explanation must be available. 
• Related: Suspected to be reasonably related to the IP s. AE could medically 
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IP s under trial in this clinical  trial 
protocol. 
10.4 Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal 
Investigational Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g. on an ECG trace)  
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead  
to treatment discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by the Investigator.  
If an abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition (e.g. anemia, increased 
ALT) must be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself. 
10.5 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. NOTE: The term “lif e-threatening” in this definition refers to an event 
in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 43  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Results in  persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is otherwise considered as medically important.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening , or require  
hospitalization may be considered as SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm  
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in subject hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via an IP  is also 
considered a serious adverse reaction and all such cases should be reported in an expedited  
manner. 
10.6 Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE  
Elective hospitalizations to administer, or to simplify trial treatment or trial procedures (e.g. an  
overnight stay to facilitate chemotherapy and related hydration therapy application) are not considered as SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned hospitalizations or unplanned prolongation of an elective hospitalization (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs. 
10.7 Events Not to Be Considered as AEs/SAEs  
Medical conditions are present at the initial trial visit that do not w orsen in severity or frequency 
during the trial are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions, and are NOT to be considered AEs.  
Progression of underlying disease is not an AE and therefore not an SAE per se, rather an 
efficacy end -point, unless deemed to be causally related to administration of IP s. However, if 
adverse signs or symptoms occur in association with disease progression then these should be 
recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs if meeting any seriousness criteria.  
10.8 Methods of Recording and Assessing Adverse Events  
At each trial visit, the subject will be queried on changes in his/her condition. During the reporting period of the trial any unfavorable changes in the subject’s condition will be recorded as AEs, whether reported by the subject or observed by the investigator. 
Complete, accurate and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting 
period (defined below) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the 
eCRF. Among these AEs, all serious AEs must be additionally documented and reported using 

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 44  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   an Adverse Event Report Form. It is important that each AE report include a description of the 
event, its duration (onset and resolution dates (/times “/times” to be completed when it is 
important to assess the time of AE  onset relative to the recorded treatment administration time)), 
its severity, its relationship with  the trial treatment, any other potential causal factors, any 
treatment given or other action taken  (including dose modification or discontinuation of the IP s) 
and its outcome. In addition, serious cases should be identified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented.  Specific guidance can be found in the eCRF completion and monitoring 
conventions provided by the Sponsor.  
10.9 Adverse Event Reporting Period 
The adverse event reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject is included  
into the trial (date of first signature of informed consent) and continues through the trial’s post-treatment follow -up period, defined as 30 days from the final administration of the trial treatme nt 
or immediately before initiation of any other anticancer therapy, whichever comes first.  
10.10  Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In the event of any new SAE occurring during the reporting period, the Investigator must 
immediately (i.e. within a maximum 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event) inform the 
person (s) identified in the Serio us Adverse Event Report Form by telephone, by fax or by e mail.  
When  an event (or follow-up information) is reported by telephone, a written report must be sent 
immediately thereafter by fax or e -mail.  Reporting procedures and timelines are the same for any 
new information on a previously reported SAE. For names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers for SAE reporting, see information included in the Adverse Event Report Form. All 
written reports should be transmitte d using the Adverse Event Report Form, which must be 
completed by the Investigator following specific completi on instructions. 
The AE section of the eCRF must be completed and a copy of the information transmitted with the Adverse Event Report Form. Other relevant pages from the eCRF  may also be provided (e.g., 
medical history, concomitant drugs). The Investigator/Reporter must respond to any request for 
follow-up information (e.g. additional information, outcome and final evaluation, specific 
records where needed) or to any question the Sponsor may have on the AE within the same 
timelines as described for initial reports. This is  necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the 
event by the Sponsor to allow for strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting obligations. 
10.11  Safety Reporting to Health Authorities, Institutional Review  
Boards and Investigators  
The Sponsor will send appropriate safety notifications to Health Authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Investigator must comply with any applicable site- specific 

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 45  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   requirements related to the  reporting of SAEs (and in particular deaths) involving his/her 
subjects to the IRB/IEC that approved the trial. 
In acco rdance with ICH GCP guidelines , the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of “findings 
that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the trial or alter the 
IRB/IEC’s approval/favorable opinion to continue the trial.” In particular and in line with 
respective regulations, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be relate d to the administered product (“suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions”, SUSARs). The Investigator should place copies of Safety reports in the Investigator Site Fil e. National regulations with regard s to s afety  reporting notifications to 
Investigators will be taken into account.  When specifically required by regulations and 
guidelines, the Sponsor will provide appropriate safety reports directly to the concerned lead IRB/IEC and will maintain records of these  notification s. When direct reporting by the Sponsor 
is not clearly defined by national or site specific regulations, the Investigator will be responsible 
for promptly notifying the concerned 
IRB/IEC of any Safety reports provided by the Sponsor and of filing copies of all related  
correspondence in the Investigator Site File.  
10.12  Monitoring of Subjects with Adverse Events  
Any AE that occurs during the course of a clinical trial and is considered to be possibly related to 
the IP  must be monitored and followed up by the Inves tigator until stabilization or until the  
outcome is known, unless the subject is documented as “lost to follow- up”. Reasonable attempts 
to obtain this information must be made and documented. It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that  any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow -up 
procedures are performed. The Sponsor will actively follow -up and collect information on any 
AE that occurs during the course of a clinical trial, however while this activity will continue for any serious AEs until stabilization or until the outcome is known, it will be discontinued at the  
time of database lock for non- serious AEs.  
10.13  Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure 
Only pregnancies considered by the Investigator as related to trial treatment (e.g., resulting from a drug interaction with a contraceptive medication) are considered as adverse events. However,  
all pregnancies with an estimated conception date during the study safety period must be 
recorded by convention in the AE page/section of the e- CRF. The same rule applies to  
pregnancies in female subjects and in female partners of male subjects. The Investigator must  
notify the Sponsor in an expedited manner of any pregnancy using the Pregnancy Report Form, 
which must be transmitted  according to the same process as described for SAE reporting. 
Investigators must actively follow up, document and report on the outcome of all these pregnancies, even if the subjects are withdrawn from the trial.  The Investigator must notify the

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Sponsor of these outcomes using the Pregnancy Report Form, and in case of abnormal outcome, 
the Adverse Event Report Form when  the subject sustains an event and the Parent -Child/Fetus 
Report Form when the child/fetus sustains an event . 
Any abnormal outcome must be reported in an expedited manner, while normal outcomes must 
be reported within 45 days from delivery. 
In the event of a pregnancy in a subject occurring during the course of the trial, the subject must 
be discontinued from trial medication immediately. The  Sponsor must be notified without delay 
and the subject must be followed as mentioned above. 
10.14  Laboratory Assessments 
All clinical safety laboratory tests listed in the section s below will be performed at local 
laboratories. Subject eligibility will be determined based on the baseline laboratory results. 
Clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained.  
10.14.1  Blood Sample Collection for General Clinical Laboratory 
Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for the following clinical labora tory tests:  
• Serum Chemistry: Blood Urea Nitrogen  (or Uric Acid), Creatinine , Sodium, Potassium , 
Calcium , Total Protein , Albumin , Total Bilirubin , Alkaline P hosphatase, ALT , AST , 
Lactate D ehydrogenase. 
• Hematology: White Blood Cell Count, Hemoglobin, Platelet Count , Neutrophils, 
Lymphocytes, Monocytes

• Collection of available archival tumor tissue in  paraffin embedded block or a mini mum 
of 6 unstained slides (10 preferred). The archival tumor tissue may be collected during 
Cycle 1 if additional time  is needed to locate the samples but must be shipped to the 
Sponsor (or designee) by the end of Cycle 1. Efforts should be made to collect these 
materials as early as possible. If the site is unable to confirm during screening that 
sufficient archival tissue is available, a new biopsy must be taken at any time pri or to the 
initiation of dosing. 
The following evaluations and procedures will be performed within 14 days prior to the first

CONFIDENTIAL   should have their tumor assessed approximately every 8 weeks from starting 
tipifarnib treatment through the first 6 months of study participation.  Thereafter, 
the tumor assessment  is to be performed approximately every 12 weeks.  The 
frequency of tumor assessment (every 8 or 12 weeks depending on duration of study participation) is to be maintained regardless  of the subject’s treatment cycle.   
o For the purposes of tumor assessment recording, the nomenclature Cycle 2 Day 22, Cycle 4 Day 22, Cycle 6 Day 22, Cycle 9 Day 22, Cycle 12 Day 22, etc. is 
used to name the tumor assessment visits.  However, due to treatment delays or 
interruptions, it may happen that the tumor assessment visit will not coincide with the current treatment cycle for a given subject.  
11.6 End of Treatment Visit  
The following assessments will  occur approximately 30 days (± 7 days) after the last 
administration of study drug or immediately before the administration of a nother anti -cancer

In subjects who have experienced a response and in whom only residual tumor tissue remains, 
irradiation of the remaining tumor lesions will be permitted as per standard of care.  
11.7.1  Follow Up  after Disease Progression  
Upon disease progression, all subjects will be followed approximately every 12 weeks for 
survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or 12 months after accrual of the last study subject, whichever occurs first. Information on survival and subsequent anticancer therapy may be collected by phone.  
12 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This section outlines the statis tical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. Specific details 
of the primary and key secondary analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). If, after the study has begun, but prior to the final analysis, important changes are made to 
the protocol that affect principal features of the primary or key secondary analyses, then the 
protocol and/or SAP will be amended, as appropriate. Any other changes made to the planned analyses after the protocol and SAP have been finalized, along with an  explanation as to when 
and why they occurred, will be listed in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) for the study. Post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the CSR. 
12.1 Populations 
12.1.1  Efficacy Analysis  
The FAS population will serve as the prim ary population for the analysis of tumor response and 
other efficacy -related data. Subjects will be excluded for FAS for the following reasons: 
• No baseline data  
• Failure to receive at least one dose of tipifarnib  
• No post- baseline endpoint data subse quent to at least 1 dose of study drug

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   12.1.2  Safety Analysis  
The All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) population will be used for the analysis of safety data.  The 
ASaT population consists of all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of tipifarnib . At 
least one laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least one dose of study 
drug is required for inclusion in the analysis of a speci fic safety parameter. To assess change 
from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.  
12.2 Endpoints 
12.2.1  Efficacy  
The objective response rate will be estimated for each tumor histology type evaluated.  The estimate of the objective response rate will be calcu lated based on the maximum likelihood 
estimator (i.e., crude proportion of subje cts whose best overall response is CR or PR). The 
estimate of the objective response rate will be accompanied by 2-sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence intervals. 
The duration of objective response will be calculated for subjects who achieve CR or PR.  For 
such subjects, the duration of objective response is defined as the number of days from the start 
date of PR or CR (whichever response is achieve d first) to the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented. Disease pr ogression will be determined by the Investigator using the 
Lugano Classification and/or mSWAT. The duration of objective response will be right- censored 
for subjects who achieve CR or PR and meet 1 of the following conditions: 1) non-protocol 
anticancer treatment started before documentation of disease progression, 2) death or documented disease progression after more than 1 missed disease assessment visit, or 3) alive and does not have documentation of disease progression before a data analysis cutoff date.  
The duration of obje ctive response will be summarized descr iptively using the Kaplan- Meier 
method. The 50th percentile of the Kaplan- Meier distribution will be used to estimate the median 
response duration. Progression free survival will be defined as the time (in months) from enrollment to either first 
observation of progressive disease or occurrence of death due to any cause within 126 days 
(approximately 2 time intervals for tumor assessments) of either first administration of tipifarnib  
or the last tumor assessment. In sub jects without a progression date or with a death date  more 
than 126 days after the first administration of study drugs or the last tumor assessment, the  PFS 
time should be censored on the date of last tumor assessment or date of first administration  of 
study tipifarnib . Progression free survival analyses should consider tumor assessments after  
treatment discontinuation or metastatic surgery.  
The PFS will be summarized descr iptively using the Kaplan- Meier method. The 50th percentile 
of the Kaplan- Meier distribution will be used to estimate the median PFS.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   12.2.2  Safety and Tolerability  
Safety and tolerability of tipifarnib  will be assessed based on the following: 
• Incidence, duration, and severity of treatment- emergent adverse events, serious adverse 
events, adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug, and deaths 
within approximately 30 days from the last dose of study drug (or immediately before the administration of another anti- cancer treatment)  
• Changes in vital signs including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature 
• Changes in electrocardiogram results 
Adverse events will be coded using the latest available versio n of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -emergent adverse events are def ined as adverse 
events that start on or after the first dose of study drug and within approximately 30 days of the 
last administration of stu dy drug. Adverse events will be summarized by the number and 
percentage of subjects who experienced the event, according to system organ class and preferred 
term. A subject reporting multiple cases of the same adverse event will be counted  once within 
each system organ class and similarly counted once within each preferred term.  
Unless specified otherwise, the denominator for these ca lculations will be based on the number 
of subjects who received at least one administration of  tipifarnib, irrespective of th e total number 
of doses or treatment cycles administered. These conventions will be appropriately modified to calculate AE incidence rates separately for each cycle that study therapy is admin istered. AE 
incidence rates may also be calculated based on other measures of subject exposure (e.g., total 
number of treatment cycles administered). AEs will also be summ arized by NCI-CTCAE version 
4.03 severity grade and by relationship to each study drug. A dditional summaries may also be 
provided for SAEs, and events resulting in the permanent discontinuation of therapy. All AEs 
will be included in individual subject listings. 
The incidence of grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities (including neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anemia) will be provided by treatment cycle and across all treatment 
cycles. The toxicity grades for laboratory tests will be based on NCI- CTCAE version 4.03 
criteria. The use of blood transfusions (platelets, red blood cells) and/or gr owth factor support 
will be reported. Similar analyses will be do ne for selected chemistry tests (including liver and 
renal function tests).  
Vital sign results (blood pressure, pulse, and temperature) will be summarized descriptively for each scheduled and  unscheduled protocol time point. Changes will be calculated relative to the 
assessments at baseline and on the first day of each cycle of therapy.

CONFIDENTIAL   12.4 Sample Size Determination  
A two -stage study design was used in the initial cohort of PTCL subjects without histological or 
genetic selection in  order to minimize the number of study subject s treated if tipifarnib  were to 
be not efficacious. This design is intended to allow the termination of  accrual in case of 
unacceptably low efficacy after the first subjects are evaluated in a Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
basis.  
A two -stage desi gn will be employed. Eleven initial study subject s will be enrolled; if 2-4 
responses ar e observed, 7 additional subje cts will be enrolled. At the comple
tion of this  cohort, 
treatm
ent will be considered of further interest if the true ORR is higher than 10%.  To determine 
the total trial size  of the initial cohort of subjects, a response of interest of 30% is assumed. This 
design provides 80% power to detect a difference between 10% and 30% ORR at one-sided 
significance level of 0.087. Using this design, the probability of terminating the study at the end 
of stage 1 if the true ORR is 10% is 0.697 while the probability of t erminating the study at the 
end of stage 1 if the true ORR is 30% is 0.113.  
An AITL
 cohort will be enrolled (N = 12) according to  Amendment 4 to the protocol.  With this 
sample size, if 4 or more responses are observed, the probability that the true respo nse rate in 
AITL subject s is at least 30% is 82.6 % (Table 6 ).  
Based on the observed antitumor activity during stage 1 and stage 2 of the study in which 
subjects who were found to have high levels of CXCL12 gene expression and reference CXCL12 
3’UTR by retrospective analysis had better outcomes in terms of response and PFS compared to 
subjects with low CXCL12 expression and CXCL12 3’UTR variant seque nces, a CXCL12+ 
cohort will be enrolled (N = 12) according to Amendment 6 to the protocol.  With this sample size, if 2 or more responses are observed, the probability that the true response rate in CXCL12+ subjects is 10% or higher is at least 87% ( Table 7 ).  
It is assumed that the presence of CXCL12 3’UTR gene variants is of germinal, not somatic, origin. By default, CXCL12+ subjects are defined as those who present w ith reference CXCL12 
reference gene sequence in a buccal swab assay and in whom no CXCL12 3’UTR variant or

enrolled in the CXCL12+ cohort based on CXCL12+ status in the buccal swab test and later 
demonstrated to have a somatic tumor 3’UTR CXCL12 sequence variant will be allowed to continue treatment but may be replaced and not included in the evaluable study population for efficacy analyses.  
Upon the observation of 5 confirmed responses in the AITL cohort, and 5 confirmed responses in 
the CXCL12+  cohort, including 2 of them in subjects with tumors of AITL histology, the trial 
was amended to include up to 20 additional subjects with AITL and related T follicular helper cell tumors in the AITL cohort in order to further characterize the safety and tolerability of tipifarnib in this patient population.  The choice of 20 additional subjects was empirical based on the 
relative rarity of the patient population and no statistical hypotheses will be tested in this 
extension.  Including Amendment 7, up to 70 evaluable subjects in total may be enrolled (dosed).   
12.5 Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses  
Only the Sponsor, upon consultation with the principal investigator may modify the protocol. The Sponsor will issue a formal protocol amendment to implement any changes. The only exception is when an Investigator considers that a subject’s safety is compromised without 
immediate action. In these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IRB/I EC 
must be sought, and the Investigator should inform the Sponsor and the full IRB/I EC within 2 
working days after the emergency has occurred.  
The IRBI /EC must review and approve all protocol amendments. Protocol ame ndments that have 
an impact on subject risk or the study objectives, or require revision of the ICF, must receive 
approval from the IRB/I EC prior to their implementation.  
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study d esign or the potential risk s or burden 
to subjects, the ICF will be amended and approved by the Sponsor and the IRB/I EC, and all 
active subjects must again provide informed consent.  
13 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY ASPECTS  
13.1 Responsibilities of the Investigator  
The Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the trial at his/her site. He/she will ensure that 
the trial is performed in accordance with the clinical trial protocol and with the ethical principles  
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, as well as with the ICH Note for Guidance 
on Good Clinical Practice (ICH Topic E6, 1996) and applicable regulatory requirements. In 
particular, the Investigator must ensure that only subjects who have given their informed consent are included into the trial.  

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 57  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   13.2 Subject Information and Informed Consent 
An unconditional prerequisite for a subject’s participation in the trial is his/her written informed  
consent. The subject’s written informed consent to participate in the trial must be given before 
any trial- related activit ies are carried out.  
Adequate information must therefore be given to the subject by the Investigator before informed consent is obtained (a person designated by the Investigator may give the information, if permitted by local regulations).  
With the cooperation of the Sponsor, and in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (ICH Topic E6, 1996), and the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, the Investigator will prepare the informed consent form and other 
written information to be used in obtaining informed consent from the trial subjects. The 
investigator should cooperate with the sponsor for preparation of aforementioned written information. 
Before the consent may be obtained, the potential subject (or the potential subject’ legally  
acceptable representative) should be provided with sufficient time and opportunity to be accessed 
to the details of clinical trial and to decide if they would participate in the trial. All the queries  
related to the tria l from the potential subject or legally acceptable representative should be 
answ ered by the investigator or collaborators. 
In addition to providing this written information to a potential subject, the Investigator or his/her 
designate will inform the subject verbally of all pertinent aspects of the trial. The language used 
in doing so must be chosen so that the information can be fully and readily understood by lay persons. 
Depending on local  regulations, a person other than the Investigator may inform the subject  and 
sign the Informed Consent Form. Where the information is provided by the Investigator, the 
Informed Consent Form must be signed and personally dated by the subject and the Investigator. 
The signed and dated declaration of informed consent will remain at the Investigator’s site, and  
must be safely archived by the Investigator so that the forms can be retrieved at any time for 
monitoring, auditing and inspection purposes. A copy of the signed and dated information and Informed Consent Form should be provided to the subject prior to participation. 
Whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s 
consent, the written subject information sheet and any other written information provided to 
subjects will be revi sed by the Sponsor and be submitted again to the IRB/IEC for review and 
favorable opinion. The agreed, revised information will be provided to each subject in the trial 
for signing and dating. The Investigator will explain the changes to the previous version.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   13.3 Subject Identification and Privacy  
A unique subject number will be assigned to each subject at inclusion, immediately after  
informed consent has been obtained. This number will serve as the subject’s identifier in the trial  
as well as in the clinical trial database.  
The subject’s data collected in the trial will be stored under this number. Only the Investigator 
will be able to link the subject’s trial data to the subject via an identification list kept at the site.  
The subject’s original medical data that are reviewed at the site during source data verification  
by the Monitor, audits and Health Authority inspections will be kept strictly confidential. 
Data protection and privacy regulations will be observed in capturing, forwarding, processing, 
and storing subject data. Subjects will be informed accordingly, and will be requested to give 
their consent on data handling procedures in accordance with national regulations. 
13.4 Emergency Medical Support and Subject Card  
Subjects enrolled in this clinical tr ial will be provided with Emergency Medical Support cards 
during their trial participation, which will be provided  by the Sponsor  or designee. The 
Emergency Medical  Support card is based on the need to provide clinical trial subjects with a 
way of identifying themselves as participating in a clinical trial, and subsequently to give health care providers  access to the information about this participation that may be needed to determine 
the course of the subject’s medical treatment.  
This service is designed t o provide information to health care providers who are not part of the 
clinical trial.  Clinical trial Investigators, who are already aware of the clinical trial protocol and 
treatment,  have other means of accessing the necessary medical information for the management 
of emergencies occurring in their subjects.  
The first point of contact for all emergencies will be the clinical trial Investigator caring for the  
affected subject. The Investigator agrees to provide his or her emergency contact information on 
the card for this purpose. If the Investigator is available when an event occurs, s/he will answer  
any questions. Any subsequent action will follow the standard processes established for the 
Investigators.  
In cases where the Inves tigator is not available, the Sponsor or designee will provide a 24 hour 
contact number whereby health care providers will be given access to the appropriate Sponsor ’s 
physician or designee to assist with any  information regarding tipifarnib  in case of a medical 
emergency.  
13.5 Clinical Trial Insurance and Compensation to Subjects 
The Sponsor is entirely responsible for AEs that are associated with this trial and cause damage 
to the health of the subjects, except for AEs caused by an intentional and/or significant deviation 
on the part of the Investigator, the trial site, and/or the subject. Insurance coverage shall be

CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 59  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   provided for participating to the trial. Insurance conditions shall meet good local standards, as 
applicable. 
13.6 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethnic Committee 
Prior to commencement of the trial at a given site, the clinical trial protocol will be submitted  
together with its associated documents (investigator’s brochure, Subject Information and Informed Consent Forms) to the responsible IRB/IEC for its favorable opinion/approval. The written favorable opinion/approval of the IRB/IEC will be filed in the Investigator Site File, and  
a copy will be filed in the Trial Master File at the Sponsor.  
The trial must not start at a site before the Sponsor has obtained written confirmation of  
favorable opinion/approval from the concerned IRB/IEC. The IRB/IEC will be asked to provide 
documentation of the date of the meeting at which the favorable opinion/approval was given, and 
of the members and voting members present at the meeting. Written evidence of favorable opinion/approval that clearly identifies the trial, the clinical trial protocol version and the Subject 
Information and Informed Consent Form version reviewed should be provided. Where possible, 
copies of the meeting minutes should be obtained. 
Amendments to the clinical trial will also be submitted to the concerned IRB/IEC, before  
implementation  in case of substantial changes. Relevant safety information will be submitted to 
the IRB/IEC during the course of the t rial in accordance with national  regulations and 
requirements.  
13.7 Communication to Health Authorities  
The clinical trial protocol and its amendments and any applicable documentation (e.g. 
Investigator’s Brochure , Subject Information and Informed Consent Form) will be submitted or 
notified  to the Health Authorities . 
14 TRIAL MANAGEMENT 
14.1 Case Report Form Management 
The Investigator or designee will be responsible f or entering trial data in the e CRFs that will be 
provided by the Sponsor or its designee. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the data entered in  the eCRFs.  Database lock will occu r once quality control and 
quality assurance procedures (if applicable) have been co mpleted.  
14.2 Source Data and Subject Files  
The Investigator must keep a subject file (medical file, original medical records) on paper or 
electronically for every subject included in the trial. This file will contain the available  
demographic and medical information for the subject, and should be as co mplete as possible.  

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 60  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   In particular, the following data should be available in this file: 
• Subject’s full name 
• Date of birth  
• Gender 
• Height 
• Weight 
• Relevant medical history and concomitant diseases 
• Prior and concomitant therapies (including changes during the trial) 
• Trial identification  
• Date of subject’s inclusion int o the trial (i.e. date of  informed consent) 
• Subject identifier in the trial  
• Dates of the subject’s visits to the site  
• Any medical examinations and clinical findings predefined in the clinical tria l protocol 
• All adverse events observed in the subject  
• Date of subject’s end of trial, and  
• Date of and reason for early withdrawal of the subject from the trial or from treatment , if 
applicable. 
It must be possible to identify each subject by using this sub ject file.  Additionally, any other 
documents containing source data must be filed. This includes original printouts of data recorded 
or generated by automated instruments, PET- CT or CT  scan images, ECG  recordings, laboratory 
value listings, etc. Such docum ents must bear at least the subject identifier  and the date when the 
procedure was performed. Information should be printed by the instrument used to perform the assessment or measurement, if possible. Information that cannot be printed  by an automated 
instrument will be entered manually. Medical evaluation of such records should be documented 
as necessary and the documentation signed and dated by the Investigator. 
The following information described in the e CRFs is regarded as the source data:  
• Any investigator’s comments  
• Subject identifier  
• Information on AE (e.g. seriousness, severity, outcome, and causality to the IP ) 
• Reason for providing concomitant medications and procedures (if applicable) 
• Assessment of antitumor effect including tumor measurements

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   • Description about trial discontinuation  
14.3 Investigator Site File and Archiving  
The Investigator will be provided with an Investigator Site File upon initiation of the trial. This 
file will contain all documents necessary for the conduct of the t rial and will be updated and 
completed throughout the trial. It must be available for review by the Monitor, and must be ready for audit by the Sponsor as well as for inspection by Health Authorities during and after the trial, 
and must be safely archived for at least 15 years (or per local requirements or as otherwise 
notified  by the Sponsor) after the end of the trial. The documents to be thus archived include the 
Subject Identification List and the signed subject Informed Consent Forms. If archiving of the 
Investigator Site File is no longer possible at the site, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor.  
All original subject files (medical records) must be stored at the site (hospital, research institute,  
or practice) for the longest possible time permitted by the applicable regulations, and/or according to ICH GCP guidelines or ordinance of GCP, whichever is longer. In any case, the 
Investigator should ensure that no destruction of medical records is performed without the written approval of the Sponsor. 
14.4 Monitoring, Quality Assurance and Inspection by Health 
Authorities  
This trial will be monitored in accordance with the ICH Note for Guidance on Good Clinical 
Practice (ICH Topic E6, 1996). The site Monitor will perform visits to the trial site at regular 
intervals.  
The Sponsor , as well as Health Authorities, must be permitted to inspect all trial- related 
documents and other materials at the site, including the Investigator Site File, the completed CRFs, the IP (s), and the subjects’ original medical records/files.  
The clinical trial protocol, each step of the data captures procedure, and the handling of the data, 
including the final clinical trial report, will be subject to independent Quality Assurance  
activities. Audits may be conducted at any time during or after the trial to ensure the validity and  
integrity of the trial data.  
14.5 Changes to the Clinical Trial Protocol  
Changes to the clinic al trial protocol will be documented in written protocol amendments. Major 
(substantial, significant) amendments will usually require submission to the Health Authorities  
and to the relevant IRB/IEC for approval or favorable opinion. In such cases, the amendment 
will be implemented only after approval or favorable opinion has been obtained. 

Tipifarnib   
CTP KO-TIP-002           Page 62  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Minor (non-substantial) protocol amendments, including administrative changes, will be filed by 
the Sponsor and by the Investigator at the clinical study site. They will be submitted to the 
relevant IRB/IEC or to Health  Authorities only where requested by pertinent regulations. 
Any amendment that could have an impact on the subject’s agreement to participate in the trial 
requires the renewal of the subject’s informed consent prior to implementation . 
14.6 Clinical Trial Report 
After completion of the trial, a clinical trial report according to ICH  E3 will be generated  by the 
Sponsor in consultation with the Principal  Investigator.  
14.7 Publication 
The first publication will be  a publication of the results of the analysis of the primary endpoint , 
that will include data from all trial sites.  Lead I nvestigators will be identified based on accrual and 
Good Publication Practices and the decision to publish or present initial data will reside in the 
Sponsor in consultation with the lead Investigators. Publications or presentations prior to the 
generation of a final clinical study report will be clearly marke d as preliminary reports.  
Investigators will inform the Sponsor in advance about any subsequent plans to publish or present 
data from any portion of the trial. Any publications and presentations of the results (abstracts in 
journals or  newspapers, oral presentations, etc.), either in whole or in part, by Investigators or their  
representatives will require a pre-submission review by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will not suppress 
or veto publications, but maintains the right to a reasonable  delay of a publication in order to 
protect intellectual property rights.

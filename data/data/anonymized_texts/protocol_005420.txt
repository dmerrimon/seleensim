You are being invited to participate in a research study. The purpose of this consent form is to give 
you the information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study. Please read this  
form carefully. You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to 
do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research 
or this form that is not clear. When we have answered all your questions, you can decide whether 
you want to be in the study. You are free to discuss this with friends or family. This process is called 
“informed consent.”  We will give you a copy of this form to keep for your records.   
1.Purpose of research study and how long it will last:  The purpose of this study is to test the
effectiveness of  a web- based ( Internet) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment for women
Veterans compared to a phone monitoring -only condition. The web- based treatment  is called
DESTRESS− WV, which stands for DE livery of Self-TRaining and E ducation for S tressful
Situations −Women Veteran version. It  is an online intervention based on cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT). The goal of CBT therapy is to help people recognize and address their thoughts and
their behaviors in positive way s with the aim of influencing their feelings  and their ability to function
as well as possible in their lives .
In order to determine if the study is right for you and whether you are a good fit for the study, if you 
decide to enroll in the study you would first participate in an eligibility screening i nterview . This 
would take place over the phone and would take up to two and a half  hours. The interview  includes 
questions about your mental health, previous trauma experience, and substance use. If you are

 eligible based on this screening, you would be randomly assigned to one of the two study 
conditions.  
 
If you are assigned to the DESTRESS −WV intervention condition, you will receive this intervention 
plus weekly phone monitoring  from a study coach for 8 weeks. During these 8 weeks, you will be 
asked to log on to the web- based (internet)  treatment twice a week, complete the online activities , 
and complete homework assignments. If you are assigned to the phone monitoring -only condition, 
you will receive weekly calls from a study coach for 8 weeks to check in with you to  see how you’re 
doing.  
 Another part of the study involves completing onli ne survey s. This is a way for us to track your 
symptoms and see how they change over time. We would ask you to complete four online survey s 
while you’re in the study : before you begin participating in either condition, after you finish the 8-
week treatment  or monitoring phase , and also 3 and 6 months after you finish the 
treatment/monitoring  phase. Each online survey  would take about 60 -90 minutes  to complete and 
will include questions regarding your PTSD symptoms, depression, and quality of life .  
 You have been asked to participate in this study because you are a woman Veteran 18 years of age or older, are likely to have  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, have not been in specialty mental health 
care for the past 2 months, and you have routine access to a computer and the Internet.  We expect 
approximately 100 participants to participate in this study. The length of time you would be involved 
in the study is about 9 months , with the majority of activity occurring within the first 8 weeks of either  
the treatment  or the monitoring condition.  
 This study is sponsored by Clinical Science Research & Development, which is part of the Veterans Health Administration.  
 Whether or not you take part in this study is completely up to you, and you can decide at any time to  
end your involvement.  
 
2. Description of the study including procedures to be used:  If you decide to participate in 
this study and sign this consent form, we will then invite you to participate in a screening interview  
to determine if this study is a good fit for you. If you are eligible, you would participate in the study 
procedures outlined in the table and text below.

Informed Consent and Questionnaires . We will first ask you fill out several forms and mail them 
back to us. These include the informed consent document , HIPAA form, and two brief 
questionnaires. The questionnaires ask demographic questions about your background as well as 
about various stressful events  that sometimes happen to people. Some of the stressful events that 
you will be asked about include physical assault, sexual assault, and combat.   
 Once we have reviewed the consent forms with you by phone, we would ask you to mail the signed forms back to  us should you decide to participate, along with the completed questionnaires. Once 
we receive the forms, we will schedule a time for the screening interview .  
 Screening Interview . You will be evaluated by study staff to determine if the study is right for you 
and whether you are a good fit for the study. This screening appointment will take place over the phone and will take up to two and a half  hours. You will have the option of breaking up the call into 
shorter segments. The interview  will include quest ions about your mental health, previous trauma 
experience, and substance use. Examples of some of the most sensitive questions you will be asked to answer are:  
• “Has there ever been a time when your life was in danger or you were seriously injured or harmed?”  
• “What about experiencing some type of sexual violence?”  
You are free to not answer any question that you do not want to answer.

 If this study is not a good match for you, we will provide you with a list of resources  of websites and 
organizations that serve women Veterans and that focus on a variety of health concerns . 
 
Baseline and Follow -up Survey s. If the study is found to be a good fit for you, we will ask you to 
complete an initial (baseline) survey  online. The online survey is a set of questionnai res and will 
take approximately 60-90 minutes  to complete . You will also be asked to complete three follow- up 
surveys online. These will take place at the end of the 8- week treatment /monitoring  phase, and 
again at 3 and 6 months following the end of treatm ent/monitoring . These follow -up survey s will also 
take approximately 60-90 minutes  to complete .  
 These surveys will involve questions about PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and quality of 
life. The first follow -up survey will also ask about your opinions and feedback regarding the 
intervention you were assigned to.  
 If you are found to be eligible for the study, you will also be sent a form which you will fill out along 
with the study coach during the first call. The form is a Safety Plan, which will pr ovide guidance as 
to what you  can do and whom you  can contact if you are feeling particularly overwhelmed or 
distressed.  
 
Assignment to Study Condition.   Once you are in the study, you will be randomly assigned 
(similar to a flip of a coin) to one  of two groups, either DESTRESS −WV or phone monitoring  only. 
Your chances of being assigned to either group are equal.  Regardless of which study condition you 
are assigned to, a study coach will call you every week for 8 weeks.  
 If you are assigned to phone monitoring  only: 
• A study coach will call you once a week for 8 weeks for approximately 10-15 minutes. The 
coach will assess your PTSD symptoms and safety .   
 If you are assigned to DESTRESS −WV:  
Study Coach  
• A study coach will call you once a week for 8 weeks for  approximately 10- 15 minutes.  S he 
will explain how to use the website that you will need to log onto twice per week during the  8-week treatment program. During the calls, she will address your progress in the program.  
 DESTRESS- WV Sessions  
• You will be asked to log on to the website twice per week. However, you may log on to the website anytime and as many times as you wish.  From the website, you will be able to find 
information about specific homework assignments  and review educational materials.  
 You w ill spend about 30 −60 minutes each time you log on to the website. On two occasions, 
you will be asked to write about current stressors, demands, or hassles. Additionally, on two occasi ons you will be asked to write about a traumatic experience. You will b e guided in 
using various coping skills taught in the program during this writing process.

 DESTRESS- WV Homework  
• H omework is assigned for each session (e.g., for each time you log into the website) , and 
you would be required to complete the homework before  you could move on to the next 
session. The homework assignments will require both time and effort.  They  will include 
stress management skills that you will be asked to practice and apply in your daily life.  
 
DESTRESS- WV Security  Basics 
• The web page has been developed so that only you will be able to log onto the web page using a personalized username and password. You can log in as often as you want; however, you will have to enter your username and password each time. The log -in page will 
not reveal any information about the study.    
 
• You will be given a study identification number during your initial phone call with the study coach that you will use for all communications done on the web (internet) . This will help 
protect your identity and information. Also, only authorized study personnel (trainers, evaluators, and investigators) will be allowed to access your web- based data  (internet) . We 
suggest you access the website only in private/secure physical surroundings (such as at home rather than at the library or at work). This will help to reduce the risk of accidental breaches of security by onlookers, family members, coworkers, and supervisors.   At the end of the data collection period for each participant, all the research information that was stored on the web server will be transferred to a non- web-based storage VA computer 
for evaluation. The records will not be used for any other research study or any other purposes.  
 
The screening interview  and phone calls with the study coach will be audio -recorded. We recognize 
that confidentiality of your information and securing your data on the website is critical. Please refer to Section 7 for steps we will take to protect your confidentiality and web- stored data.  
 
After Study Treatment.   The treatment /phone mo nitoring  phase of the study is designed to  last 8 
weeks  but may take up to 12 weeks . At the end of this time , you may feel that this was enough to 
meet your needs or you may feel  that you need more treatment. If you feel that you need more 
treatment, you are welcome to pursue that either at the VA or in the community. We will give you a 
list of resources at the end of the treatment phase of the study as well as at the very end of study. However, the study cannot provide treatment beyond the treatment phase.  
 
Maintaining Contact with Participant s. Because the study takes place over 9 months’  time, it will 
be important for us to be able to keep in good contact with you. If the study is a good fit for you, we will need to know how to get in touch with you if yo ur phone is disconnected or if we are having 
trouble reaching you for some other reason. We will ask you for the name and contact information of at least one person who is likely to know where you are if we can’t reach you. We will also ask 
you to update your contact information while you are involved in the study.  If we are concerned 
about your whereabouts and safety, we may also access  your Electronic Medical Record for 
additional information.

 3. Description of any procedures that may result in discomfort  or inconvenience:  You may 
experience discomfort when answering questions that are sensitive for you, but you always have 
the option of not answering any question that you do not wish to answer.  For example, during the screening evaluation, you will be asked to describe stressful events you experienced, and this may 
be upsetting to you. Also, with any mental health treatment for PTSD, you may experience a temporary increase in the severity of PTSD symptoms during certain portions of the treatment program.  This may be especially true if you have tried very hard to avoid thinking about painful 
things from the past.  Please tell the study coach if this is happening so she can work with you to 
lessen this possibility  and help you get through it if it does occur. 
 If an emergency situation arises, you should not wait for a reply from the study coach . 
Instead, you should proceed immediately to your nearest emergency room, call 911, or call the Veterans Crisis Hotline at 1- 800-273-8255 ( TALK ), and press 1 . 
  
If you are randomized to the DESTRESS -WV condition, y ou will also be asked to complete 
treatment homework assignments and to log on to the website twice per week during the 8- week 
treatment program. This may be an inconvenience for you. If you have never access ed the 
Internet before and/or if you don’t know how to use a computer, you may experience some frustration with learning the study procedures.   
 Your participation in the study is completely voluntary and you may choose to not answer any question that you wish or discontinue your participation in the study at any time.  
 
4.  Potential risks of the study:  There is a possible risk of loss of confidentiality  (people not 
involved in the research study finding out personal information about you).  Although we w ill make 
every effort to keep your information confidential, no system for protecting your confidentiality can be completely secure.  It is still possible that someone could find out you were in this study and 
could find out information about you.   
 
We wil l audio -record the screening  interview  and the phone calls with the study coach. These calls 
will be audio- recorded to make sure that study personnel are saying things that are consistent with 
study goals. Please note that your voice is technically identifiable according to patient privacy rules, 
so we will do everything possible to protect your voice identity.  This recording may be transcribed 
(written down word for word) so that approved study staff members will be able to review your 
responses as part of  the data collected for the study.  
 
Additionally, recordings may be reviewed by approved study staff during data analysis to make sure 
that the transcript accurately captured what was said and how it was said. You will have the right to 
review and mark for erasure any portions of the audio- recording .  
 
The use of the website to store personal information is not without risks. It is important that you use the website in private so that people around you can’t access your information. This will help reduce the risk of accidental breaches of security by onlookers, family members, co- workers, and 
supervisors.

 When you visit a website on the computer, things  called “cookies” are usually left behind.  Cookies 
are little bits of information that can be used to trace back to your user ID or email address.  When 
you sign in on the study website, there might be a chance that cookies could be left behind and that 
could possibly lead back to you at your computer address.  There are two  ways that we will try to 
keep this from happening:  
 
• The web designers have used something called a “session variable” concept to remove 
cookies from your browser as an additional way to protect your confidentiality. A session variable is used so a website can recognize your log in and give you access to certain sections of the website.  Any time you log onto the study website, a unique session variable will be randomly generated. This session variable will expire and be automatically removed from your computer when you log out from the sit e. 
 
• The other way to help protect your privacy is for you to use a computer that no one else uses 
at a time that you will not be interrupted.  In addition, to be extra careful, we recommend that after each time you are on the study website, you delete the study site files and history from 
your browser. The study coach will explain to you how to do this during the initial phone call.   
 
You will be asked not to leave your computer unattended while logged on to the website. If , for 
whatever reason, you get cal led away, it is important that you remember to close the session and 
not leave it open for others to see. If you have to use a public computer, like at a library or clinic, be sure to allot enough time to complete the session. Do not leave the computer unattended while you 
are logged into the website, and remember to delete the cookies  and history from your browser  at 
the end  for extra security. If, for whatever reason, someone without permission views your 
responses, please notify the study coach .  
 If you  suspect that someone has logged on with your username and password, please notify the 
study coach immediately , so that she can assign you a new username and password.    
 
For details on the steps we will take to secure your privacy and confidentiality, please refer to 
Section 7.  
 
The particular treatments or procedures in this study may involve risks that are currently 
unforeseeable. We will contact you as soon as possible if new findings occur during this research 
that may pose a risk to you.  
 5. Potentia l benefits of study:  There may be no direct benefit to you from  participating in this 
research. However, you may benefit by learning more about yourself by being in the study . If you 
are in the DESTRESS condition, you may benefit from the treatment that y ou are provided and 
skills that you learn. The phone monitoring  condition may help you because you get a chance to 
track your PTS D symptoms over time. No benefit, however, can be guaranteed.  
 The findings from this study may benefit society by finding out if DESTRESS−WV is a good treatment option for women Veterans with PTSD.

 6.  Other treatment available:  If you choose not to participate in this study, you could receive 
other treatments for your PTSD  either at the VA or in the community.   We will provide  you with a list 
of information and resources if you wish.  
 
7.   Use of research results / Confidentiality:  The information obtained about you will be held 
confidential.  However, for purposes of this study, the following list of people or groups may know  
that you are in this study.  They will have access to your records, which may include your medical records:  
• Research team members  at the VA  
• Programming staff at Novus Origo , which programs and hosts DESTRESS -WV 
• Clinical Science Research & Development (CSR&D) under the Veterans Health Administration  
• Federal agencies including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP), the VA Office of Research Oversight (ORO), the VA Office of the Inspector  General (OIG), and the Government Accounting Office (GAO)  
• The VA committees that oversee research, including the Institutional Review Board that oversees the safety and ethics of VA studies  
• Transcriptionists  sanctioned by the VA Puget Sound IRB and Infor mation Security Officer  
• VA staff responsible for subject payments  will be provided with your full name, address , and 
social security number in order to authorize payment for your participation in this study   
 The purpose of this access is to review and administer the study and make sure that it meets all 
legal, compliance, and administrative requirements. If a review of this study takes place,  your 
records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your privacy.  
 Identifying information about you (such as  your name, mailing address, phone number, social 
security number) will be kept separately from other data. A link between identifying information and other information you provide as part of the study will be kept in a separate, secure location. Your information will be identified using a Study Identification (ID) Number randomly generated for 
research purposes. Your name will not be connected to your data. Your Study ID will be saved in a database along with study data, and your personal information will be stored in a separate file so that none of your answers will be stored with your identifying information. Only you and the researchers will know the Study ID . If you are assigned to the DESTRESS -WV condition, your 
Study ID  will be used as your username to access the website, and you will also be assigned a 
unique password in order to access the website.  
 All of your study data, meaning the information that you provide the researchers in the screening interview , online surveys, in coaching  calls, and on the website, will be saved at VA Puget Sound 
Health Care System using transmission and storage procedures that meet VA standards for information security.  
 
Your name and contact information will be accessible only to approved research staff for the purposes of contacting you to complete the study  and paying you for your participation. Please note 
that we will keep a list of names and completion status of all who participated in our research study.

 This is so that we can be sure that you have no problems in receiving payment for participating in 
our study.   
 
Once this study is completed, we will not use the study code linking you to your data for any 
additional research. The code linking you to your data will be held in a secure database until the VA receives authorization to destroy them in accordance with federal records regulations. It may be several years before the code linking you to your data is  actually destroyed. All coded data will be 
stored on secured computers or in file cabinets in locked offices. These coded data will be kept indefinitely.  
 Online Survey s. You will be using the website Survey Monkey to complete online surveys for this 
study (https://www.surveymonkey.com/). Survey Monkey is not a VA system and is not managed by 
the VA. It is a comme rcial site. We have purchased the Gold license package from Survey Monkey 
and this includes a level of data security and privacy that meets the VA standards. You w ill not be 
asked to provide your name in these online surveys; instead, your data w ill only be linked to your 
unique Study Identification Number, not to your name. Nonetheless, when going to the site for the first time, we recommend that you take the time to review the site and read the privacy policy of the site. Be sure you feel comfortable using and answering questions on the  site. 
 
Research staff will log into the administrator side of our survey s in Survey Monkey to extract the 
data that has been entered by our subjects. That extract will be collected via a secure internet 
connection and then saved to the secure VA network.  
 Audio -recordings. Audio -recordings will be stored either in a locked filing cabinet in a locked office 
of study personnel or in a password- protected computer file within the VA network. Only approved 
research staff will have access to them.  The recording will be labeled with a study code and will not be marked with your name or other identifying information. R ecording s may be transcribed into a 
secure, password- protected folder on the VA network. Recordings that have not yet been uploaded 
into the password- protected VA network folder will be stored in a locked file cabinet in an office that  
will be locked when unoccupied. Current VA regulations require us to keep recordings indefinitely. 
As stated in Section 4, you will have the right to review and mark for deletion any portions of the 
audio- recording.  
 
DESTRESS- WV Website. All web -based activities for the DESTRESS -WV condition will be 
completed through a website designed for the study using a secure server  that provides enc ryption 
protection that meets VA standards  to protect your confidentiality. The website is hosted and 
maintained by the commercial, web- based company Novus Origo . Researchers will need to have a 
special password to access your data. Only authorized study personnel will have this access to your data. We recognize that several homework assignments may involve personal information that is of a highly sensitive nature. Such information will be protected by encryption technology that meets VA 
information security standards. In the event that these security measures are compromised, we will notify you immediately and conduct a full investigation.

 Certificate of Confidentiality. To help us protect your privacy, we have a Certificate of 
Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. With this Certificate, the researchers cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained below.  
 Exceptions :  A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent researchers from disclosing certain 
information about you for legal or ethical reasons. A Certificate of Confidentiality will not be used to prevent disclosure to local authorities of child abuse and neglect, or harm to self or others. Also, a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research.  If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to receive research information, we cannot use the Certificate to withhold that information.    
 The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United States government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA).  
 There may be publications a bout this study in the future. In these publications, we may use de-
identified quotations from the individual interviews to illustrate specific points , but we will  not include 
identifying information. No personal information will be given in a publication without your approval in writing.   Your study information will be used only for research purposes and will not  be sold. Information

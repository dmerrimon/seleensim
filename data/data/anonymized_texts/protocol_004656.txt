 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
There are numerous transdermal  drug delivery systems (TDDS) that are currently available in 
the United States, the first of which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in 1979 [1]. Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) available in the form of 
patches  are convenient, attract ive, and easy to use systems. Fentanyl is a very popular TDDS 
available on the United States market today. Drug release from these TDDS varies 
significantly and is dependent on a number of factors including system design, 
physicochemical properties of the drug, excipients, occlusion, sweat, skin condition, skin type 
and temperature. Investigating the influence of these factors on drug release from reference 
and generic products that are often available in different forms is important to ensure that 
generic products are not less safe than the reference product.  Accurate determination of the 
rate and extent of drug release and absorption is crucial to ensure the safety of individuals 
using this and other types of TDDS.  
 
Positive outcome of this project will i dentify appropriate methods to determine the rate and 
extent of drug release and absorption from TDDS, and will help regulatory agencies in the 
development of Guidances for Industry regarding the characterization of drug release and 
absorption kinetics to ensure the safety of individuals utilizing these types of products.  
2.2 Rationale  
The rationale of this study is to determine the delivery rate and the extent of absorption of 
fentanyl drug release from FDA -approved TDDS products (reference e.g. Duragesic ®, versus 
Mylan transdermal patches) that have different inactive ingredients. can be determined in 
humans by accurately quantifying residual drug from TDDS post -wear, and the delivery rate 
can be determined in pharmacokinetic studies.  This study will comp are fentanyl levels by 
using in vitro skin flux permeation studies, as a predictor of in -vivo bioequivalence  and 
pharmacokinetics of Duragesic® and Mylan fentanyl TDDS . This will be done  through 
development of an appropriately controll ed and well -character ized in-vitro methodology to 
quantify the in-vivo exposure of healthy adults to fentanyl during TDDS wear, so that the rate 
of drug delivery can be defined in a manner that can help the regulatory agency (FDA) in 
developing Guidance for Industry regarding the characterization of drug release and 
absorption kinetics to ensure the safety of individuals utilizing these types of products.  
In the clinical study component, we will employ two types of evaluation to determine the rate 
and extent of drug release and  absorption from fentanyl TDDS, namely residual drug analysis 
post-wear and pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy adult Subject s. In addition, we will 
compare the serum drug concentrations following TDDS and intravenous administration, in 
Fentanyl Patches Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Adults  Version 13.0

 order to explore bi oequivalence  of these TDDSs. We will conduct residual drug analysis of 
TDDS following in vivo wear using highly sensitive validated quantification methods.

 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
The objectives of this open label, randomized, crossover study are to  
 To explore bioequivalence  of Duragesic® transdermal system and generic Mylan fentanyl 
TDDS, and compare bioavailability to direct IV infusion of fentanyl citrate.  
 To conduct release rate analysis  of generic fentanyl (Mylan) TDDS compared to Duragesic® 
TDDS.  
 To determine the residual drug content of the Duragesic® and generic fentanyl TDDS.  
 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
The main outcome measure of the study is the determination of the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of fentanyl in healthy adult Subject s (i.e., clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), elimination 
rate constant (Kel), maximum serum concentration (Cmax); time of maximum serum 
concentration (Tmax) of fentanyl and area under the serum concentration -time curve (AUC).  In 
addition, we will de termine residual drug content from worn Duragesic® and Mylan fentanyl 
TDDS to estimate total amount of absorbed fentanyl from each.

 4   STUDY DESIGN  
This is a  three treatment  open -label, randomized cross-over clinical study with a Run -In Study Session  I 
of intravenous fentanyl citrate , followed by randomization to Duragesic® and generic fentanyl in a 
sequen tial, 2-Session  fashion with at least a one week wash -out Session  between the sessions .  
 
The study design is shown below:  
 
Study Session  I 
(Run -in) Randomization   Study Session  II Study Session  III 
Intravenous -Fentanyl  Study Arm 1  Duragesic®  Mylan Fentanyl  
Study Arm 2  Mylan Fentanyl  Duragesic®  
 
 
The study will consist of a total of twenty -five Study Days (24 Subject s) within three Study Session s, 
with at least a one week washout Session  between successive  Study Session s. The half -life of fentanyl is 
approximately 24 hours. Hence, 5 days (i.e. 5 half-lives) will be sufficient for >95% of fentanyl to be 
eliminated from the body. Each of the 2 4 Subjects will be enrolled to complete all twenty -five study days 
(Run-In Study Session  I = 5 Study Days ; Study Session s II and III = 10 Study Days each) . The study is 
open label and not blinded, because PK assessment is not subject to participant and/or observer bias. After 
each Study Session  is completed, the available safety data will be reviewed by an Independent Safety 
Monitor (ISM) to determine wheth er or not to proceed to the next Study Session . 
Considering the objective of the study to explore bioequivalence  of Duragesic® and generic fentanyl and 
to conduct release rate analysis  of generic fentanyl to Duragesic®, the above study design would 
adequat ely address both questions.  The randomization to sequences [Reference (R) –Test (T), T -R] 
would appropriately take into account the sequence and the Session  effect for bioequivalence evaluations. 
Having all Subject s enter the intravenous Run -In Study Session I initially would also help in accurate 
determination of absolute bioavailability for Duragesic® and generic Mylan fentanyl in this study.    
Each Subject  will be his/her own control and each Subject  will sign an institutional review board –
approved cons ent form explaining the purpose, nature, risks, benefits, and duration of the study. The 
study will be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and with the ethical 
principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
The three Study Session s are as follows:

 Each of the  24 Subjects will start  the study  with the Run-In Session  of intravenous fentanyl citrate 
infusion by giving a single -dose of 100  µg fentanyl citrate infusion (2 mL over 2 minutes)  as described in 
the Manual of Procedures. Each Subject will receive a naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg oral tablet 12 -17 
hours ± 1 hour before and again shortly prior to intravenous  administration  and then as described below  
after intravenous administration for 7 additional doses, for a total of nine 50 mg oral doses of naltrexone 
hydrochloride tablets.  
 
Study Session  II:  
Twelve  Subject s will be randomized to  Study Arm 1 which will receive  the Duragesic® fentanyl TDDS 
(25 µg/h); and other 12 Subject s to Study Arm 2 which will receive the Mylan fentanyl TDDS (25 µg/h). 
The patches will be applied for 3 days on each Subject . The Subject ’s skin in the area of application 
(upper arm region) will be relatively free of hair before TDDS application. Each Subject  will receive a 
naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg oral tablet 12 -17 hours ± 1 hour before and again shortly prior to patch 
application and then as described below  after patch application for 16 additional doses, for a total of 
eighteen 50 mg oral doses of naltrexone hydrochloride tablets.  
 
Study Session  III:  
The 12 Subject s who were randomized to Study Arm 1 to receive the Duragesic® fentanyl TDDS (25 
µg/h) will cross -over to receive  the Mylan fentanyl TDDS (25 µg/h) applied; and the other 12 Subject s 
who were randomized to Study Arm 2 to receive  the Mylan fentanyl TDDS (25 µg/h) will now cross-over 
to receive  the Duragesic® fentanyl TDDS (25 µg/h). The patches will be applied for 3 days on each 
Subject . Each Subject will receive a naltrexone  hydrochloride 50 mg oral tablet 12 -17 hours ± 1 hour 
before and again shortly prior to patch application and then as described below after patch application for 
16 additional doses, for a total of eighteen 50 mg oral doses of naltrexone tablets.

 8 PHARMACOKINETICS AND  STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Study Hypotheses  
Given the fact that there are formulation differences between Duragesic® and Mylan fentanyl  
TDDS,  we hypothesize that:  
a. Bioequivalence exploration.  
b. Release rate analysis.  
These hypotheses will be tested by comparing the residual drug amounts in Duragesic® and 
Mylan fentanyl  TDDS and by assessing the pharmacokinetic parameters following their 
application, and comparing them to the pharmacokinetic parameters estimated after direct IV 
infusion of fentanyl citrate.  
8.2 Pharmacokinetics (PK) Analyses  
8.2.1 Pharmacokinetic endpoints  
 Area under the time curve from dosing time to last measurement time (AUC 0-t) and peak drug 
activity (C max) for Duragesic® TDDS and Mylan fentanyl TDDS will be used as the primary 
endpoint.  For intravenous fentanyl, AUC 0-∞ will be determined.  
 The time to maximu m concentrations (T max) and AUC 0-∞ for fentanyl from Duragesic® TDDS 
and Mylan fentanyl TDDS will also be determined.   
8.3 Final Analysis Plan  
The primary statistical analysis will be performed on the natural log transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-A and 
Cmax of Fentany l from the three Study Sessions using SAS V 9.3.  A linear mixed effects model will 
be used to assess the effects of treatment, Session, sequence and Subject within sequence on natural 
log transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-C and C max.  The treatment, Session, seque nce effect will be treated as 
fixed effects and assessed at a significance level of 0.05.  The Subject within sequence will be treated 
as a random effect.  Intra and inter individual variabilities will be obtained.  The least square mean 
estimates for the adjusted differences between treatment means (the log transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-C 
and C max) and the standard error associated with these differences will be obtained.  The geometric 
means for AUC 0-a will be obtained by exponentiating the log transformed AUC 0-i for all the three 
treatments to determine the absolute bioavailability.       
The absolute bioavailability  for Duragesic® TDDS and Mylan fentanyl TDDS will be calculated .

 The analyses for IV administration of fentanyl citrate will be as follows:  
Non compartmental and compartmental analyses will be conducted to estimate the PK parameters 
such as clearance, volume of distribution, elimination rate constant, maximum serum concentration; 
time of maximum serum concentration and area under the serum concent ration -time curve. All 
analyses will be conducted using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.3 (Pharsight, a Certara Company, CA). 
Absolute bioavailability will be calculated .   
The analyses for both TDDS applications (Duragesic® and Mylan fentanyl) will be as follows:   
The serum fentanyl concentrations will be determined and the PK parameters such as C max, T max, 
AUC, steady concentrations (C ss) of fentanyl in each Subject will be elucidated. The rate of fentanyl 
absorption in each Subject is calculated by dividing the Css by the clearance predicted from the IV 
bolus data . 
Cumulative amount of fentanyl released by Duragesic® at the end of study Session will be obtained 
by subtracting residual fentanyl still remaining in the TDDS at the end of the study Session from the 
total amount of the drug present in an unused TDDS.  
 
Similarly, cumulative amount of the drug released by the Mylan TDDS at the end of study Session is 
computed . 
 
The rate of drug release from Duragesic® and Mylan TDDS will be determined .    
The means of fentanyl release rates from Duragesic® TDDS, standard deviations from their mean, and 
95% confidence intervals will be determined and tabulated. The statistical significance of difference 
between the means will be evaluated by two -tailed Student’s t -test.

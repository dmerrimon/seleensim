Trial sites:Multi -centre trial
Clinical phase:IIIb
Objectives: The main objective is to compare a dual antithrombotic regimen of 110mg dabigatran 
etexilate b.i.d. plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor (110mg DE -DAT) and 150mg dabigatran 
etexilate b.i.d. plus c lopidogrel or ticagrelor (150mg DE -DAT) w ith a triple 
antithrombotic therapy ( TAT)ofwarfarin plus clopid ogrel or ticagrelor plus aspirin
(warfarin -TAT) inpatients with non valvular atrial fibrillation ( NVAF) that undergo a 
PCI w ith stenting .The study aims to show non -inferiority of each dose of DE -DAT 
when compared to Warfarin -TAT in terms of safety . Safety is determined by bleeding
events , assessed using the modified International Society of Thrombosis and 
Haem ostasis (ISTH) classification ofMajor Bleeding andClinically Relevant No n-
Major Bleeding Events (CRNMBE).
Methodology:This is a prospective, randomised, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), active 
comparator (w arfarin) trial. The study will employ a time to event analysis and all 
patients will remain on study treatment until the last patient entered has completed 
at leas t six months of treatment.
The patients will be stratified by age (<80 or ≥80 years old) and region (EU/ROW 
or USA).

Criteria for efficacy :The primary endpoint for this trial is a safety endpoint , please see below .
The secondary efficacy endpoints  (all time to first event) are:
A combined endpoint of thrombotic events or death (DTE: all death + MI + 
stroke/SE) and unplanned revascularisation by PCI/CABG
A combined endpoint of thrombotic events or death (DTE: all death + MI + 
stroke/SE)
Individual outcome events :
All death (Cardiovascular death , Non -cardiovascular death , 
Undetermined ), 
MI
Stroke
SE 
Stent Thrombosis
Com posite endpoint of death + MI + s troke
Unplanned revascularisation by PCI/CABG
Criteria for safety: Theprimary endpoint for this trial is time to first ISTH Major or Clinically Relevant 
Non-Major Bleeding Event .
Statistical m ethods: The stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used to analyse time-
to-event endpoints. To control the Type I error rate at a one -sided 0.025 level, a 
hierarchical procedure for multiple testing will be used to test the safety 
hypotheses. Additional t esting for safety and efficacy endpoints will also be included 
in this hierarchical procedure .

2End of treatment (EOT) procedures to be completed by all patients at the time of study drug discontinuation.  For patients wh o discontinue early, the EOT visit should be 
performed instead of the scheduled trial visit at time of dis continuation.
3For patients that complete all scheduled visits or discontinue treatment early, follow up visit to be conducted four weeks af ter EOT.  
4For patients that discontinue treatment early, the final visit will take place at the time trial conclusion is declared.
5To be conducted by telephone.
6This event driven trial is expected to take place over 30 months, however, the trial can conclude earlier if an adequate numb er of events is reported sooner.  It can conclude later 
(or enrol addit ional patients) if more time is needed to observe the minimum number of required events. If it continues beyond 30 months, fo llow-up visits (with same 
assessments as required at visits 9 and 11) will occur every 6 months with telephone visits (with the sam e assessments as required at visits 10 and 12) in between.  At the time of 
trial conclusion (when adequate number of events were reported), all patients would be notified of study conclusion and have an EOT and follow up visit (patients that complete 
all scheduled visits) or final visit (premature treatment discontinuation) scheduled. Patients who discontinue study treatment ear ly should continue to attend regularly scheduled 
visits.   Refer to (Section 6.2.2 ) for details on manag ement of patients that wish to reduce study participation for a
ny reason.  Collection of vital status and endpoints for all 
patients at the end of the trial is important and described in Section 6.2.3 .
7All patients must sign an informed consent form consistent with ICH -GCP guidelines prior to any trial -related procedures including screening tests.
8Includes height at Visit 1 .
9If Visit 1 and Visit 2 occur within 24 hours then vital signs do not need to be repeated at Visit 2.
10ECGs must be performed at baseline and every six months until EOT. If additional ECGs are performed during the course of the trial as part of patient normal care and 
demonstrate a change from baseline or a new pathology develops this should be documented in the eCRF. 
11Standard safety lab panel (haematology and chemistry, including renal function and liver function tests (LFTs)) and troponin will be performed by the central laboratory at the 
visits indicated, except the screening visit. 
12Will be performed locally, only those parameters required to verify eligibility are required at screening , standard of care local results taken within 7 days prior to screening can 
be used to verify eligibility.
13Renal function: creatinine clearance (CrCl) will be calculated based on serum creatinine using the Cockcroft -Gault equation.

In addition women of child bearing potential will be supplied with pregnancy tests and instructed t o 
perform pregnancy testing every 4 weeks. Pregnancy testing is one indicator of pregnancy. Changes in a patients menstrual cyc le, that may indicate pregnancy must also be 
considered and a further pregnancy test can be taken if the Investigator feels it to be appropriate.
15All patients will have a baseline INR. Follow -up INRs will be performed only in those patients randomised to warfarin. All INR measurements conducted locally.
16At least two -weekly INR measurements for the first three months in pati ents who are commencing warfarin for the first time and monthly subsequently – all other patients at least 
monthly. More frequently if required.
17Study drug should be administered  between 6 hours after sheath removal and preferably within 72 hours post PCI(refer to section 6.2.2 ), with haemostasis assured ,however up 
to 120 hours pos t PCI is allowed .
18Patients randomised to Warfarin only .
19Patients switching to a non -study VKA from dabigatran etexilate may continue on study medication (dabigatran etexilate) after this visit for 2 -3 days to assist bridging.
20Patients that complete all scheduled visits will conclude participation at the follow up visit, patients who discontinue trea tment early will conclude participati on at the final visit.

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
The current estimate of the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the developed world is 
approximately  1.5–2% of the general population. The arrh ythmia is associated with a five-
fold increase in the risk of stroke and a three
-fold increase in the i ncidence of congestive 
heart failure and higher mortality . This arrh ythmia is a major cardiovascular challenge in 
modern societ y and its medical, social and economic aspects are all set to worsen over the 
coming decades. Chronic anticoagulant treatment is mand atory  in the great majority  of the 
patients with AF [ P10-14910, P12-11192]. 
Twenty  to thirt y percent of non valvular AF (NVAF) patients have concomitant coronary  
artery  disease [ R13-4127, P10 -07397, P11 -09369]. Re vascularisation treatment by  primary  
percutaneous coronary  intervention (PCI) has reduced morbidity  and mortality  in patients 
with acute and chronic coronary  artery  disease [ R13-4128, P13 -11665, R13 -4138 ]. 
Worldwide over 1,000,000 anticoagulated patients are candidates for a PCI each year [P10-
07397 ].In patients undergoing PCI , the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin ( ASA )reduces 
death, my ocardial infarction ( MI)and stroke [ R13-4128, P13 -11665, R13 -4138 ]. Dual 
antiplatelet treatment with ASA and clopidogrel also reduces recurrences and the risk of stent 
thrombosis and is a routine treatment in patients undergoing PCI  with stent regardle ss of 
indica tion [R13-4128, P13 -11665, R13-4138]. Therefore, when patients with AF that are 
receiv inganticoagulant treatment have to undergo a PCI  with stenting ,there is an indication 
for concomitant treatment with ASA and clopidogrel ( triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT )) to 
prevent stent thrombosis [ R13-4127
, P10 -07397, P11-09369] . 
Rigorous antithrombotic treatment invariabl y raises the risk of bleeding, adding to a poorer 
prognosis with an estimated five -fold mortalit y increase following MI. Major bleeding in 
patients with acute coronary  syndromes (ACS) treated with an earl y invasiv e strategy  confers 
an increased risk for both short -term and mid -term mortality  [P11-09951, R13 -4129 , R13-
4130 ]. An acceptable bleeding risk while maintaining a lower ischaemic event rate is 
considered a must in the post- PCI setting [P10 -07397, P11 -09369, R13- 4128, P13-11665, 
R13-4138, P11-09951, R13 -4129].
In a large registry  of patients undergoing PCI  (CathPCI  Registry  -386 688 procedures 
performed in the United States between 2004 and 2011), post procedural bleeding events 
were associated with increased risk of in -hospital mortality , with an estimated 12. 1% of 
deaths related to bleeding complications [R13-4130 ]. It has been increasingl y recognised that 
the adverse consequences of peri -procedural bleeding extends bey ond the hospitalisation for 
the procedure and can continue for up to three years [P11-09951, R13-
4129 , R13-4130 ].
In patients with ACS or undergoing PCI ,the presence of AF raises a therapeutic challenge 
because treatment with both anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies is preferred to prevent 
stroke and further coronary events. In the absence of data derived from randomised clinical 
trials, the management of these patients remains unclear. An anal ysis of the patient 
subpopulation that was receiving warfarin at the time of hospital admission enrolled in

antithrombotic strategy  at time of hospital discharge [ R13-4132] . Existing recommendations 
are based on small, single- centre ,studies that mostly  includ epatients treated with PC I with 
stent implantation. Overall, i t has been concluded that further research is needed to guide 
patient care.  
Several retrospective analy ses using patients that participated in observational registries and 
patient populations enrolled in clinical tria ls have assessed outcomes andhave shown that 
there might be a potential benefit with the implementation of a dual antithrombotic therap y 
(DAT) regimen (anticoagulant plus clopidogrel) in comparison with a TAT regimen 
(anticoagulant plus clopidogrel plus ASA) in NVAF that have undergone PCI  [R13-4133, 
R13-4134 , P13-11669, P11 -01097, R13 -4135]. 
A nationwide registry  in Denmark that comprised a total of 12,165 AF patients hospitalised 
with MI  and/or undergoing PCI between 2001- 2009 assessed the risk of MI, coronary  death, 
ischaemic stroke andbleeding according to the antithrombotic treatment regimen. Within one 
year, MI or coronary  death, ischaemic stroke and bleeding events occurred in 18.5%, 5.6%
and6.3% ofpatients, respectivel y. Relative to triple therap y (oral anticoagulation (OAC) + 
ASA + clopidogrel), no i ncreased risk of recurrent coronary  events was seen for the dual 
regimens with OAC + clopidogrel, OAC + ASA, or ASA + clopidogrel. When compared to 
triple therapy, bleeding risk tends to be reduced (non- significantly  reduced for OAC + 
clopidogrel and signi ficantly  reduced for dual therapy  with OAC + ASA and ASA + 
clopidogrel) [ R13-4136].
Since blockade of P2Y12 receptor -mediated signal ling with clopidogrel is associated with 
greater platelet inhibitory effects than cy cloox ygenase-1 inhibition with ASA andthe 
established role that P2Y12 receptor blockade has on recurrent thrombotic events, clopidogrel 
might be expected to be more effecti ve at reducing stent thrombosis, but with increased 
bleeding [ P11-09369] . One small observational study  observed a lower incidence of stent 
thrombosis with clopidogrel plus warfarin as compared with ASA plus warfarin [ P11-09369].
Other r etrospective reports and c ase-control studies of patients after coronary  stenting with an 
indication for long -term OAC also found more favourable outcomes for clopidogrel than 
ASA in combination with OAC [R13 -
4136]. Significant differences in the rate of stent 
thrombosis have been reported between different antithrombotic drug combinations . The 
incidence of stent thrombosis has been reported to be highe rin patients receiving a 
combination of warfarin plus ASA in comparison to a dual antipla telet therapy (DAPT)
regimen
, a DAT regimen of war farin plus clopidogrel and a TAT regimen of warfarin plus 
clopidogrel plus ASA [ R13-
4136, P07 -06963]. The rate of stroke has been observed to be 
highe r in patients receiving a DAT regimen without anticoagulation [ P07-06963 ]. 
The observations from the retrospective and case -control studies reinforce a concept t hat is 
well known and validated in prospective clinical trials; anticoagulant therapies are more 
beneficial for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with AFandDAT regimens 
including a P2Y12 inhibitor are of greater benefit compared to dual antithrombotic regimens 
comprising warfarin plus ASA for the preventio n of ischaemic events, including stent 
thrombosis, in patients undergoing PCI  [P10-07397, P11 -09369]. Recommendation of the

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.European and North American Consensus of using triple therap y for patients with recent MI 
and/or PCI  and concurrent AF is established because of OAC being indicated for AF patients 
with stroke risk factors and DAT being indicated after ACS or PCI [ P10-07397, P11 -09369].
The WOEST results have been reflected in some of the recent guidelines for NVAF patients 
undergoing PCI  with stenting [ P14-05384, 
P14-12794, P16 -02545] which recommend to 
consider the use of DAT in certain patients. Non randomi sed studies on triple therap y showed 
a protection from ischaemic events with no clear excess bleeding, compared to other 
regimens, but the studies all have limitations of being potentiall y underpowered, performed in 
single cent resettings andonly including patients after stent implantation [ P10-07397, P11-
09369]. The main finding of the nationwide Danish registry was that in AF patients after 
MI/PCI, the combination of OAC plus clopidogrel is comparable with the recommended 
triple therap y in respect to the prevention of thromboembolic outcomes of MI /coronary  death 
and ischaemic stroke while the risk of bleeding was similar [R13-4136 ]. Notably , the risk of 
all-cause mortality  was similar between OAC plus clopidogrel and triple therapy  but 
markedl y increased for other therapies, namel y, OAC plus ASA and DAPT therap y. No 
beneficial effect was evident for adding ASA to OAC plus clopidogre l treatment, which 
challenges current recommendations that favo urs triple therap y for this population . The data 
from the nationwide Danish registry  is consistent with other retrospective reports and suggest 
that the favoured antiplatelet to be used in comb ination with OAC sh
ould be clopidogrel and
this combination may  well be used in AF patients after recent MI and/or PCI [R13 -4136, 
P07-06963]
.
A recently published small randomised controlled study  (WOEST) [ R13-4127], observed that 
bleeding and ischaemic event rates were lower in patients on DAT (warfarin + clopidogrel) 
compared to TAT (warfarin + clopidogrel + ASA). From previous experience it is also 
known that continued anticoag ulation with warfarin during PCI procedures is associated with 
an increased risk of bleeding [P07-09550]. The WOEST study  enrolled 573 patients
randomly  assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral anticoagulation  plus clopidogre l alone (DAT) 
or plus clopidogrel and aspirin (TAT). All patients were pretreated with a maintenance dose 
of
75mg clopidogrel per day  for at least 5 day s, a loading dose of 300mg  clopidogrel at least 
24 hours befor e PCI , or a loading dose of 600mg clopidog rel at least 4 h ours before PCI. A 
320
mg loading dose of ASA was also given to patients who had not been taking ASA before 
the study . Study  treatment was started promptl y after randomisation. All patients received 75 
mg clopidogrel daily , and those in the TAT group were also given 80 –100 mgASA daily.
One year follow up data were available for 279 (98 .2%) patients assigned to receive DAT and 
284 (98.3%) assigned to receive TAT
. Bleeding episodes were seen in 54 (19 .4%) patients 
receiving dual therapy  and in 126 (44
.4%) receiving triple therap yhazard ratio (HR) 0.36, 
95% Confidence Interval ( CI) 0.26–0.50, p<0·0001). In the d
ual-therapy  group, six (2 .2%) 
patients had multiple bleeding events, compared with 34 (12. 0%) in the triple -therap y group. 
Eleven pat ients (3.9%) receiving dual therap y required at least one blood transfusion, 
compared with 27 (9 .5%) patients in the triple -therapy  group (odds ratio 0.39, 95% CI  0.17–
0.
84, p=0.011). The combined secondary  endpoint of death, MI, stroke, target -vessel 
revascularisation andstent thrombosis was reported in 31 (11.1%) patients in the DAT group 
and in 50 (17.6%) in the TAT group. After correction for imbalance in baseline 
characteristics, the HR remained similar (0.56, 95% CI  0.35–0.91). Seven patients (2.5%) in 
the DAT group and 18 (6.3%) in the TAT had died from any  cause at 1 year[R13-4127]

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.This study ,however, was not powered for assessing efficacy  and can onl y be considered 
hypothesis -generating.
As newer OACs (e.g. dabigatran etexilate , rivaroxaban, apix aban) are likely  to replace 
vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in certain AF patients in the y ears to come, clinicians will soon 
face new tr eatment possibilities not explored in PCI  clinical trials. In a RE -LY sub anal ysis 
focused on patients receiving concom itant antiplatelet therap y, dabigatran etexilate 110mg 
twice dail y (b.i.d. )was non- inferior to warfarin in reducing stroke and s ystemic embolism
(SE), whether patients received antiplatelet therapy or not. There were fewer major bleeds 
than with warfarin in both dabigatran etexilate 110mg b.i.d. subgroups for patients who used 
antiplatelets and for patients who did not [ P13-00071] . In the same sub -analy sis, dabigatran 
etexilate 150mg b.i.d. reduced the primary  outcome of stroke and SE in comparison with 
warfarin [P13 -00071]. Dabigatran etexilate , would therefore be an attractive alternative to 
warfarin (as part of triple therap y), particularl y used at a lower dose since it appears to have 
less bleeding without loss of efficacy [P11-09369] . 
Prospective clinical data concerning the 
possibility  of implementing triple or DAT regimens with dabigatran etexilate and other new 
OAC saddressing their efficacy  and safety  in patients undergoing PCI are needed [P11-
09369].
Newer P2Y12 inhibitors (e.g. ticagrelor, prasugrel ) have also recently  become available. Data 
is still lacking about both the concomitant use of ticagrelor with VKA or novel oral 
anticoagulant treatments and the potential use of ticag relor as part of triple or dual 
antithrombotic therap y regimens [P11 -09369]. The use of prasugrel is generally  not 
recommended in patients ≥75 y ears of age because of the increased risk of fatal (1.0% 
prasugrel vs. 0.1% clopidogrel) and intracranial bleeding (0. 8% prasugrel vs. 0.3% 
clopidogrel) and uncertain added benefit [ P07-13246; R13-5262] .
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Dabigatran etexilate is the orally bioavailable prodrug of dabigatran, a novel, synthetic, d irect 
thrombin inhibitor. Following oral administration dabigatran etexilate (prodrug) is rapidl y 
converted to the active moiety  dabigatran, which is a non -peptidic, highly  potent, competitive 
and r eversible inhibitor of thrombin [ U06-1704, P08 -12388 ].
The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is characteri sed by  peak plasma concentrations of 
dabigatran that occur approximately  two hours after oral administration of the prodrug, a 
biexponential distribution phase and a terminal elimination half -life of 14-17 hours after 
multiple dose administration. Dabigatran maximum plasma concentrations and area under 
curve (AUC) increase in a dose proportional manner. PK stead y state is reached b y three days 
with b.i.d. dosing, pharmacod ynamic (PD) (anticoagulant) activit y is closely correlated with 
dabigatran plasma concentrations. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily  by the kidney s with 
urinary  excretion accounting for approximately  80% of the dose administere d intravenousl y. 
Dabigatran may  be conjugated to form acy lglucuronides, which are pharmacologicall y active. 
The absolute bioavailability  of the current capsule formulation of dabigatran etexilate is 
approximately  6.5%.

etexilate on the PK of atorvastatin, diclofenac or digoxin (P- glycoprotein (P -gp) substrate)
and the exposure of dabigatran was not significantly  altered by  these drugs. Dabigatran 
etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolis ed by the cy tochrome P450 s ystem and have no in 
vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzy mes. There was, however, an effect on 
dabigatran etexilate bioavailability  after co
-administration with some P -gp inhibitors or 
inducers. The max imum increase, approximately  2.5 fold, in dabigatran exposure was 
observed after ketoconazole single and multiple dose co- administration while chronic 
rifampicin reduced the dabigatran exposure to 1/3 of control values. 
In a phase I study in young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of 
dabigatran etexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary  bleeding 
times compared to clopidogrel monotherap y. In addition, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss 
and the coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation as 
measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combined treatment 
and the respective mono -treatme nts. With a loading dose of 300mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, 
dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss were increased by  about 30 -40 %. When comparing 
combined treatment and the respective mono -treatments, the coagulation measures for 
dabigatran’s effect ( Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT ),Ecarin Clotting Time 
(ECT )and Thrombin Time ( TT)) remained unchanged and inh ibition of platelet aggregation, 
a measurement of clopidogrel’s effect, remained unchanged.
The potential for a PKinteraction between ticagrelor and dabigatran was evaluated in a 
randomised, open -label, 2-period cross -over phase I study  in 12 healthy  male subjects (BI 
Trial No. 1160.141) [ U12-2002] . In order to limit the potential bleeding risk to hum an 
volunteers, a low dose of 75 mgdabigatran etexilate was administered eith er: alone in one 
trial period, or in combination with ticagrelor in a second period (i.e. one dabigatran etexilate
dose on D ay 1 at the same time as a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg) and the second time 
on D ay 4 at the same time as ticagrelor after it had been dosed at 90 mgb.i .d.over 3 
consecutive day s with a goal of reaching steady  state).
Co-administration of a loading dose of 180 mgof ticagrelor on Day 1 with single dose of 
75mg dabigatran etexilate in study  1160.141 [ U12-2002) resulted in a 1.73 -fold (90% CI 1.18 
to 2.52) and 1.95 -fold increase (90% CI1.26 to 3.00) in gMean AUC0 -∞ and Cmax of total 
dabigatran, respectivel y. After further treatment with 90 mgticagrelor b.i.d. the increase of 
dabigatran gMean AUC0 -∞ and Cmax after single oral administration of 75 mgdabigatran 
etexilate on Day 4 were 1.46 -fold (90% 
CI1.00 to 2.12) and 1.56 -fold (90% CI 1.02 to 2.38), 
respectivel y [U12 -2002].
The interaction was further assessed under dabigatran stead y state conditions in an open 
label, fixed sequence, multiple -dose, health y volunteer stud y (BI stud y 1160.142 [U13-
2049 ]). Multiple doses of 110mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d were given alone and in 
combination with ticagrelor (i.e. on D ay 4 the morning dose of the 110 mgdabigatran 
etexilate b.i.d treatment was given at the same time as a 180 mgloading dose of ticagrelor) 
and the second time on Day 7 at the same time as ticagrelor after it had been dosed at 90 mg
b.i.d. with a goal of reaching steady state (part 1). Furthe r, the second part of the study  
investigated the effect of staggered administration of ticagrelor loading dose on dabigatran

110mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d treatme nt.
Concomitant administration of the loading dose of 180 mgticagrelor at the same time as the 
morning dose of 110mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d. increased the gMean (adjusted for 
treatment) total dabigatran AUCτ,ss 1.49- fold (90% 
CI1.24 to 1.79) and C max, ss 1.65- fold (90% 
CI1.34 to 2.03) compared with dabigatran etexilate given alone. Concomitant administration 
of the morning dose of 90mg ticagrelor b.i.d with the morning dose 110 mgdabigatran 
etexilate increased the adjusted gMean total dabigatran AUC τ,ss 1.26- fold (90% 
CI1.07 to 
1.49) and C max,ss 1.29- fold (90% CI 1.06 to 1.55) compared with dabigatran etexilate given 
alone. When the loading dose of 180 mgticagrelor was given 2 hours after the morning dose 
of 110mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d gMean (adjusted for treatment) total dabigatran AUC τ,ss 
increased 1.27
-fold (90% CI1.08 to 1.49) and C max,ss 1.24- fold (90% CI 1.03 to 1.49) 
compared with dabigatran etexilate given alone [ U13-2049
].
The finding that ticagre lor increased dabigatran exposure is consistent with the hy pothesis of 
P-gp inhibition by  ticagrelor at the intestinal wall, which could have decreased the efflux of 
dabigatran etexilate into the gut and increased its absorption. With staggered intake of 
ticagrelor 2 hours after the intake of dabigatran etexilate the increase of dabigatran exposure 
observed after simultaneous administration of both drugs was reduced. This was most likely  
due to the fact that dabigatran absorption in the gut is complete afte r 2 hours. A similar 
reduction of PK interaction effects with staggered intake has also been observed for 
verapamil and dronedarone [U13 -2049].
Administration of dabigatran etexilate (single or multiple doses ) and the co -administration of 
dabigatran e texilate with the ticagrelor loading do se and the multiple -dose regimen of 
ticagrelor was safe, i.e. it did not cause ble eding in the healthy  subjects included in the trials
1160.141 and 1160.142 [U13-2049].
In summary , a PKinteraction between ticagrelor and d abigatran etexilate has been shown in 
drug-drug interaction trials examining a single- and multiple -dose applications of dabigatran 
etexilate (BI studies 1160.141, 1160.142) [ U12-2002, U13-2049]. Themagnitude of this PK
interaction under stead y state conditions of dabigatran (i.e. in a clinicall y more relevant 
scenario) was lower when compared to conditions when the single dose of dabigatran 
etexilate was administered. Further, the interaction was also lower under the mai ntenance 
dose of ticagrelor or after a staggered intake of the ticagrelor loading dose (given 2 hours 
after dabigatran etexilate). The relative increase in dabigatran exposure under the various 
conditions presented above is expected to be of comparable mag nitude when a dose of 150mg 
dabigatran etexilate is given, as dabigatran displays dose -proportional pharmacokinetics in 
healthy  subjects and patients in the range of doses from 10 to 400mg [U12 -2002, U13- 2049].
The magnitude of PKinteraction was dependent upon the dose administered. Under stead y 
state conditions of dabigatran and ticagrelor, the plasma level increase of dabigatran was in 
the range (approx. +26 -29%) of the P- gp inhibitor clarithromycin which is considered of no 
clinical safet y concern. Simi lar increases can be seen when the loading dose of ticagrelor is 
given 2 hours after dabigatran etexilate intake. When the loading dose of ticagrelor is given at 
the same time as dabigatran etexilate, the increase of dabigatran was in the range (approx.

Similar to the concomitant administration of dabigatran etexilate with amiodarone or 
quinidine, a dose adjustment of dabigatran e texilate is considered not necessary  when
ticagrelor treatment is initiated or given chronically [ U12-2002, 
U13-2049].
It was demonstrated in the Phase III study , RE-LY (1160.26), that co -administration of P- gp 
inhibitors (such as amiodarone, quinidine and verapamil) in a long- term clinical trial setting 
had much smaller effects than those observed in Phase I studies, which were designed to 
show maximal possible PK effects. The greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was 
observed for patients treated concomitantly  with verapamil, who had on average a trough 
dabigatran plasma concentration increase of 16%. Concomitant administration of amiodarone 
or quinidine and dabigatran etexilate led to even smaller increases of plasma concentra tions 
of dabigatran and did not appear to increase the relative risk of bleeding [ U09-3249-02].
The PK and PD of dabigatran in subjects with normal renal function in comparison to 
subjects with vary ing degrees of renal impa irment (mild, moderate, severe and dialy sis 
dependent end stage renal disease) have been studied in an open, group -comparison design 
trial of 36 subjects. In otherwise healthy  volunteers with mild ( Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl )
≥50and <80mL /min), moderate ( CrCl ≥30and <50mL /min) and severe (CrCl <30mL /min) 
renal impairment, the area under the curves (AUCs) of dabigatran were increased 1.8, 2.7 and 
6.8 fold respectively , compared to healthy  volunteers with normal renal function (CrCl 
>80mL /min) [U06-1704]. This is in accordance with the fact that dabigatran is mainly  renally  
excreted. 
No influence of hepatic impairment on the absorption and bioconversion of dabigatran 
etexilate to the active form dabigatran and its excretion was observed comparing healthy  
subjects and subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (category  B of the Child Pu gh 
classification s ystem) [P08-12388]. 
Dabigatran etexilate is registered for reducing the risk of stroke and SEin patients with 
NVAF . The RE -LY trial was a Phase III, prospective, randomis ed, open -label, multinational 
trial of stroke prevention in subjects with NVAF at risk of stroke. A total of 18,113 subjects 
were randomi sed to one of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate (110mg b.i.d. or 150mg 
b.i.d.) or to warfarin (target Internati onal Normalised Ratio (INR)
2.0-3.0) [ U09-3249 -02]. 
RE-LY demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate, 150mg b.i.d., was superior to warfarin for the 
prevention of stroke and SEin subjects with NVAF and at least one risk factor for stroke. 
Dabigatran 150mg al so resulted in reductions of intracranial haem orrhage, total bleeding and 
vascular mortalit y. Dabigatran etexilate 110mg b.i.d. was non -inferior to warfarin for the 
primary endpoint of stroke and SEand reduced intracranial haem orrhage, major bleeding and 
total bleeding. 
Antiplatelet agents (ASA or clopidogrel) are known to increase bleeding. In RE -LY 
[U09-
3249-02], the y early  major bleeding events (MBE) were about twice a s high in subjects 
receiving additional ASA or clopidogrel, but this effect was simil ar to that observed when 
ASA or clopidogrel was administered with warfarin.

almost all patients (99.2%) received DAPT therapy  with ASA and either clopidogrel or 
ticlopidine at baseline. Primary  outcome was the composite of maj or or clinically  relevant 
minor bleeding during the 6 -month treatment period. Dabigatran etexilate, in addition to 
DAPT , was associated with a dose -dependent increase in bleeding events in patients with a 
recent MI. In addition, dabigatran etexilate 110mg b.i.d. and dabigatran etexilate 150mg b.i.d. 
were the doses associated with the lowest rate of the secondary  composite ischaemic outcome

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
There is uncertaint y over the optimal antithrombotic management strategy  for patients with 
NVAF undergoing PCI. The current treatment recommendations of TAT, comprising, VKA, 
clopidogrel and ASA [ P10-07397, P11 -09369] are based on limited data. The re is increasing 
research to suggest that there might be a potential benefit with the implementation of a DAT 
regimen.
Dabigatran etexilate has been shown in the RE -LY trial in a NVAF setting at risk of stroke to 
be more effective than warfarin in the prevention of stroke and SE at a dose of 150mg b.i.d. 
and non- inferior to warfarin at a dose of 110mg b.i.d. With respect to bleeding risk, the 
150mg b.i.d. dabigatran etexilate dose was equivalent to warfarin, whilst the 110mg b.i.d 
dabigatran etexilate was seen to significantly reduce the risk of intracranial haemorrhage, 
major bleeding and total bleeding. 
Therefore t he imple mentation of a DAT regimen with dabigatran etexilate (110mg b.i.d. or 
150mg b.i.d.) plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor is likely  to provide clinical benefits compared 
with awarfarin TAT regimen that is considered the current standard of care .
The concomitant evaluation of the dabigatran etexilate 110mg b.i.d. and 150mg b.i.d. doses 
will define the benefit/risk of each dose compared with warfarin in this particular NVAF
patient subpopulation that have undergone PCI ,thatwas not assessed in the RE-LY orRE-
DEEM trials ,and will provide treatment guidance on the optimal antithrombotic therapy  in 
these patients
.
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this study is to compare a DAT regimen of 110mg dabigatran etexilate 
b.i.d. plus clopidogrel orticagrelor (110mg DE -DAT) and 150mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d. 
plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor (150mg DE -DAT) with a TAT combination of warfarin plus 
clopidogrel or ticagrelor plus ASA ≤ 100mg once daily  (
q.d.) (warfarin- TAT ) inpatients with 
NVAF that undergo a PCI with stenting (elective or due to an ACS). 
The study  aims to show non -inferiorit y of each dose of DE- DAT when compared to 
Warfarin
-TAT in terms of safet y. Safet ywill be determined by  comparing the rates of 
bleeding events , assessed using the modified International Society  of Thrombosis and 
Haemostasis (ISTH) classification of Major Bleeding and CRNMBE .

Anticoagulant therapies are more beneficial for prevention of thromboembolism in patients 
with AFand dual anti -platelet therap y regimens are of greater benefit compared to dual 
antithrombotic regimens comprising warfarin plus ASA for the prevention of ischaemic
events, including stent thrombosis, in patients undergoing PCI [ P10-07397
, P11 -09369]. An 
acceptable bleeding risk while maintaining a lower ischaemic event rate is considered a must 
in the post -PCI setting [P10 -07397, P11-09369, R13 -4128, P13 -11665, R13 -4138 , 
P11-09951 ]. 
The incidence of stent thrombosis averages 1 –2% over the first y ear but is greatest in the first 
month regardless of the type of stent used. The rate slowly  declines to less than 0.1%/ y ear 
after the first y ear for Bare Metals Stents ( BMS )and 0.4 –0.6%/y ear after the first y ear for the 
first generation Drug Eluting Stents ( DES ). Stent thrombosis is associated with a mortality  of 
10–20% and a MI rate of 30 –70% in those with early  or late stent thrombosis. In the first 
year, however, meta -analy ses of randomis ed trials have not shown an y difference in stent 
thrombosis between BMS and DES with an incidence of 1.1% for DES versus 1.3% for 
BMS. The duration of DAPT, however, was shorter in these earl y studies and often only one 
month for BMS and less than six mont hs for DES [ P11-09369]. A number of studies in the 
1990s demonstrated that the most effective antithrombotic regimen to prevent stent 
thrombosis was DAPT with ASA and a thienopy ridine. 
Therefore, a general principle guiding the use of TAT specified in the current guidelines is to 
choose a treatment strategy  that is tailored to the individual patient, taking into consideration 
the anticipated risk of an adverse event (AE) particularl y major bleeding. Although triple 
therap y including OAC, ASA and clopidogrel is recommended for AF patients with ACS 
and/or PCI , evidence stems from small observational studies of mostly  single centre origin 
and American and European position documents categori se recommendations as Level of 
Evidence “
C” [P10-07397, P11 -09369] . Consequently , guidelines emphasi se the need for 
individuali sation of treatment in respect to careful assessment of each patient’s risk of 
thrombosis and bleeding to find the optimal balance between risk and benefit of treatment. A 
recent stud y showed that initiation of triple therapy  is immediatel y associated with increased 
and persistent bleeding risk compared to OAC plus a single antiplatelet agent [R13-4135 ]. A 
recentl y communicated small randomised controlled st udy (WOEST) [R13-4127] , observed 
that bleeding and ischaemic event rates were lower in patients on a DAT (warfarin + 
clopidogrel) compared to TAT (warfarin + clopidogrel + ASA). This study  however, was not 
powered for assessin g efficacy  and can onl y be considered h ypothesis -generating. The 
WOEST result shave nevertheless been reflected in some of the recent guideline s for NVAF 
patients undergoing PCI  with stenting [ P14-05384, P14 -12794, P16-02545] which 
recommend to consider the use of DAT in certain patients. However, data from clinical trials 
concerning the possibility of implementing DAT regimens with dabigatran etexilate and other 
new NOACs in this setting are needed.
Because man y new agents have come on the market recently , there is a wide variet y of 
possible strategies with regard to not only  the number and t ype of agents but also the intensity  
of anticoagulation and duration of the combination treatment [P13-00072]. The new oral 
anticoagulants (dabigatran etexilate , rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) so far tested in clinical

of intracranial haem orrhage (RR 0.48 [0.39 -0.59]; p < 0.001) [ P13-16211, R13 -5082 ]. On 
this basis, the European Society  of Cardiology guideline now recommends them as broadl y 
preferable to VKA in the vast majority  of patients with NVAF , when used as studied in the 
clinical trials performed so far [P12-11192].
In RE -LY, there was a 60% reduction in intracranial haem orrhage with both doses of 
dabigatran etexilate [U09-3249-02]. In a RE -LY sub anal ysis focused on patients receiving 
concomitant antiplatelet therap y(mandatory  concomitant treatment in patients that underwent 
a PCI ), dabigatran etexilate 110mg b.i.d. was non inferior to warfarin in reducing stroke and 
SE, whether patients received antiplatelet therap y or not. There were fewer major bleeds than 
with warfarin in both dabigatran etexilate 110mg b.i.d. subgroups for patients who used 
antiplatelets and for patients who did not [P13-00071] . In the same sub -analy sis, dabigatran 
etexilate 150mg b.i.d. reduced the primary  outcome of stroke and SEin comparison with 
warfarin. Major bleeding with dabigatran etexilate 150mg b.i.d. was similar to warfarin 
regardless of antiplatelet use. 
Because the absolute bleeding risk on antiplatelet therap y was the lowest with the 110mg 
dose of da bigatran, regardless of the number of antiplatelet agents used, decreasing the dose 
of dabigatran from 150 to 110 mgfor the duration of additional antiplatelet therapy , especiall y 
in patients at high bleeding risk, seems to be reasonable. Because both dose s are still 
associated with a lower risk of intracranial haem orrhage, however, continuing the 150mg 
twice -daily dose remains a defendable option, particularly in patients with relatively low 
bleeding risk and a high CHA2DS2 -VASc score [ P13-00072].
The implementation of a DAT regimen with dabigatran etexilate plus clopidogrel or 
ticagrelor is likel y to provide clinical benefits compared with the warfarin TAT regimen that 
is considered the current standard of care for the prevention of thromboembolic and bleeding 
(ICH) complications in patients with NVAF following PCI. The potential benefit of 
dabigatran etexilate over warfarin is based on its more rapid onset and offset of action, the 
absence of a need for routine laboratory  monitoring, its lack of drug -food interactions, its low 
drug-drug interaction potential and the superiorit y compared to warfarin demonstrated in 
patients with NVAF for the reduction of stroke and SE.A dual antithrombotic regimen with a 
NOAC is particularl y appealing due to the potential benefit in terms of reduced risk of 
intracranial bleeding as well as due to thepotential benefit of a reduced r isk of major 
bleeding events in a post -PCI setting .
Dabigatran is eliminated primarily  by the kidney s with urinary  excretion accounting for 
approximately  80% of the dose administered intravenously . Treatment with dabigatran in 
patients with severe renal impairment (CrC l< 30 mL /min) is contraindicated and these 
patients will be excluded from participatin g in this trial . No dose adjustment is necessary  in 
patients with mild renal impairment (CrC
l 50 
≤ 80 mL /min) ormoderate renal impairment 
(CrC l 30-50 mL /min). Close clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with renal 
impairment and Cr Clwill be monitored at every  visit and follow edup closely .

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.In all patients renal function will be assessed as follows:
Calculating the creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) prior to initiation of treatment with
dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment (i.e. CrCl < 30 
mL/min)
Renal function willalso be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected 
during treatment and as part of the routine follow up measures .
The method used to estimate renal function ( CrCl in mL /min) during t he clinical 
development of dabigatran etexilate was the Cockc roft-Gault method. This method is 
recommended , as indicated in the label, when assessing patients’ CrCl prior to and during 
dabigatran etexilate treatment.
Guidance on the management of patients who experience a haemorrhagic complication is 
provided in Section 4.2.1. A specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) has been developed and is 
currentl y being reviewed for registration in vario us countries. When clinically  indicated and 
available, it can be given to a patient in the context of a clinical trial (e.g. BI trial 1321.3) or 
from commercial supply  when it becomes approved. See Section 4.2.1 .7Overdose, for more 
information regarding the specific reversal agent for dabigatran.
It should be mentioned that no reliable clinical data are available in NVAF patients on the 
combined use of an oralanticoagulant with the new P2Y12 antagonists (prasugrel and
ticagrelor) either alone or with ASA . Therefore, dedicated prospective trials on this important 
clinical problem are definitely  needed [ P13-00072]. The proposed clinic al trial will generate 
prospective data to evaluate or ex plore this important data gap.
The study  will be conducted under the guidance of a Steering Committee and d ata will be 
scrutinised on an ongoing basis b y an independent external data monitoring committee 
(DM C). The use of electronic data capture and a cen tral laboratory  should ensure quick 
turnaround times and up to date data for the independent DMC to provide an unbiased review 
of data. Additionally , all bleeds and thromboembolic events will be reviewed by  an 
Independent Adjudication Committee (I AC); data will be provided in discrete patient packets, 
removing data which could potentially  provide information on the patients drug assignment 
(INR values for example) in order to ensure the IAC review is conducted in a blinded 
fashion. For further details regar ding the relevant committees please refer to Section 3.1.1.
For further details regarding the relevant considerations for the DMC please refer to Section 
7.3.4 .
Based on the findings on the nonclinical studies with dabigatran etexilate conducted to date 
and in accordance with international regulatory  guidelines, the inclusion of women of child
bearing potential in thi s study  is justified. To minimise the risk of u nintentional exposure of 
an embry o or foetus to the investigational drug , woman of child bearing potential must agree 
to the requirements for pregnancy  testing and contraceptive methods described in this 
protocol.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a prospective, randomised, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), active compara tor 
trial and the clinical endpoints are being adjudicated by an IAC in a blinded fashion.
This trial is designed to test the safet y in NVAF patients that have undergone a successful 
PCI (elective or du e to ACS) with stenting and were treatment naïve or were receiving oral 
anticoagulant treatment (either with warfarin, another VKA or other novel oral anticoagulant)
before the procedure.
Patients will be consented and screened after undergoing a successful PCI . Randomisation 
will occur on local laboratory results taken at the screening visit or on standard of care local 
laboratory  results taken within 7 days prior to screening ;central laboratory samples must be 
taken at randomisation prior to first intake of study drug. Randomisation can occur up to 120
hours post PCI , however within 72 hours is preferable .Study  drug should be administered
between 6 hours after sheath removal and preferably  within 72 hours post PCI, with 
haemostasis assured , however up to 120 hours post PCI  is allowed.
Patients aged < 8 0 years will be randomly  assigned to 110mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d. , 
150mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d. or warfarin in a 1:1:1 ratio for the duration of the trial
. 
Patients aged ≥80 y ears will be randomly  assigned depending on their geographical locatio n: 
Patients aged ≥80 y ears in the USA will be assigned to 110mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d. , 
150mg dabigatran etexilate b.i.d. or warfarin in a 1:1:1 ratio
All other patients aged ≥80 y earsoutside of the USA will be assigned to 110mg 
dabigatran etexilate or warfarin in a 1:1 ratio .
In addition to their randomised treatment :
All patients will receive either clopidogrel (75mgq.d.) or ticagrelor (90mgb.i.d), 
according to the local label, forat least 12 months after randomisation . Discontinuation of
clopidogrel or ticagrelor or switching to ASA ( ≤ 100mg q.d.) after 12 months of treatment 
is at the discretion of the Investigator
Patients randomised to receive w arfarin will receive ASA ( ≤ 100mg q.d.) for either one 
month in patients with a bare metal stent BMS and for three months in patients with a 
DES .
For details of drug administration see Section 4.1.4.
The study  plan is detailed in Figure 3.1: 1.

Prior to consent , the patient’s antithrombotic treatment ( i.e.ASA and anticoagulant use 
before and during PCI, use of clopidogrel or ticagrelor loading dose) should be managed as 
per local standard of care. Thescreening period will consist of onevisit (Visit 1) . The 
patients will be randomised at Visit 2. Screening and randomisation can be conducted on the 
same day .  The treatment period will consist of between three and 10visits (Visits 3-12 ). The 
trial is event driven and is designed to continue until approximately  500 patients with at least 
one MBE or CRNMBE (in total) occur. The last patient randomised will receive at least six 
months of treatment and patients recruited earlier remain in the study  until the time point at 
which this last patient has reached at least six months. Any ongoing patient, at the time the 
required number of events is reached will be discontinued . Following completion of the 
treatment period, the patients will have a follow-up visit four weeks later. 
The visits scheduled at 15, 21 and27months (Visits8, 10 and12
) are to be conducted b y 
telephone. Collection of AEs, outcome events (OE) (including bleeding) and use of 
concomitant medication will be made.
Blood sampling fora standard 
chemistry  safety panel (including renal function and L iver 
Function Tests (LFTs) )will be collected at Visits 1, 2, 3, 5, 7andEnd of treatment ( EOT ).In 
addition, samples for standard haematology  safety  panel will be taken at all clinic v isits. All Screening Study T reatment Follow up

The end of the trial is defined as “last patient out”, i.e. last visit completed by  the last patient.
3.1.1 Administrative structure of the trial
An Executive Steering Committee , consisting of a small group of external experts and 
representatives from the Sponsor, will provide scientific leadership for the planning and 
conduct of the trial . A Steering Committee will also be formed, where in addition to these 
members ,there will be representatives from every  country  participating in the trial. These 
committees will be chaired by  the Coordinating Investigator. A charter describing the tasks 
and responsibilit iesof the Executive Steering Committee and Steering Committee will be 
developed. 
Overall organisation will be overseen b y an Opera tions Committee, consisting of 
representatives of the Sponsor and Harvard Clinical Research Institute . The Operations 
Committee will oversee the conduct and execution of the trial, coordinate the agenda for the
Steering Committee sandwill be responsible for the day -to-day operations of the trial .
An independent DMC will monitor patient safety  and the trial conduct. A detailed DMC 
charter will be written to govern the activities of this committee. The DMC analyses and 
operations will be formally  separated from the S ponsor, the Investigators, the Steering 
Committees and the Operations Committee . All data (for both dabigatran etexilate and 
warfarin patients), both adjudicated and non -adjudicated will be reviewed by the DMC in an 
ongoing fashion .
An IAC will be established for the b linded adjudication of efficacy  outcomes (e.g. death, 
stroke, MI, SE) as well as bleeding. An Adjudication Committee Charter, under which the 
principles of the PROBE design can be carried out, will govern their activities. The charter 
will provide detailed definitions of each endpoint and the processes by which adjudication 
will occur, including how blinding will be preserved.
The Coordinating Investigator is selected based on expertise in this therapeutic area and 
reputation for being a  in field.   will review and sign the clinical trial protocol 
(CTP) and relevant clinical trial report (CTR) . 
Physicians (e.g. cardiologists, interventionalists) managing anticoagulation may  be 
Investigators for this trial.
An Interactive Response Technology (IRT)will perform the randomisation of patients and 
ensure appropriate distribution of trial medication to trial sites during the course of the trial.
A central laboratory  will perform all protocol specified blood anal yses with the exception of 
INR and screening measurements .

procedures. 
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
TAT , comprising ofVKA, clopidogrel and ASA ,is the current standard treatment to prevent
post-PCIstent thrombosis and the recommendation by  multiple international guidelines 
(consensus document of the European Societ y of Cardiology Working Group on Thrombosis 
that was endorsed b y the Eur opean Heart Rh ythm Association ( EHRA) and the European 
Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI ) [P10- 07397 ]; and the 
North American Consensus Document on Antithrombotic therap y in patients with AF
undergoing coronary  stenting [P11-09369 ]).The WOEST results have been reflected in some 
of the recent guidelines for NVAF patients undergoing PCI with stenting [ P14-05384 , P14-
12794 , P16-02545 ] which recommend to consider the use of DAT in certain patients. 
However, data from clinical trials concerning t he possibility  of implementing DAT regimens 
with dabigatran etexilate and other new NOACs in this setting are needed . 
Therefore, an active control group is required for any  study  in patients who have undergone
PCI with stenting. Warfarin , the most widely  used VKA ,was chosen as the active control in 
this study .
The trial is event driven; therefore all patients will remain in the trial until the required 
number of events have occurred. Individual patient participation will vary  from 
approx imately  6 months to 2.5 y ears or longer (estimated average duration 18 months).
Double- blind, double -dummy  trials in anticoagulation have limitations due to potential 
unavoidable deviations from routine clinical procedures [ R08-4453 ]. This trial will use the 
PROBE design. The PROBE approach has been used in several trials of anticoagulation 
comparing against VKAs, e.g. in patients with AF. 
The following procedures will be implemented to reduce the potential for bias in the 
reporting and assessment of primary  and secondary  events.
1.Clearly  defined objective outcomes :
The primary  and secondary  outcomes of the study  are clinically  relevant events for which 
objective documentation will be obtained. Standard, widely  accepted definit ions are to be 
used that rel y on objective documentation.
2.Blinded IAC:
All OEs will be adjudicated by  blinded adjudication experts.  Blinding of all event 
documentation will be performed b y trained specialists.  The role of the IAC will be to 
oversee and perform the blinded adjudication of all outcome events.  This Committee will 
report to the Executive Steering Committee and DMC .  
3.Bleeding Questionnaire:
Boehringer Ingelheim                                                                                                         21Jul 2016

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.A questionnaire query ing patients for signs and s ymptoms of bleeding will be 
administered at ea ch visit.  The goal is to reduce the possibility of under -reporting of 
events.  All sy mptoms will be evaluated and if potentially  consistent with a noutcome 
event will be referred to the IAC.
4.Review of Data for Clinical Events:
Any AE that indicates poten tial loss of neurological function, such as unilateral weakness, 
loss of vision or sensory  disturbance will trigger a request for more information from the 
centre for event adjudication if potentially  consistent with a n outcome event. Any  
decrease in haemo globin of >2g/dL will be similarly  investigated.
5.Data Handling:
Patients will be randomly  allocated to the treatment arm svia IRT. Wherever feasible, 
data management will be undertaken without knowledge of patient treatment allocation. 
Special procedures to handle data with the potential for unblinding , such as INRs, will be 
specified.  By  treatment data tabulations will not be reviewed during the course of the 
trial and the data management personnel will not have access to the randomi sation code.
By imple menting these appropriate measures to avoid bias , the PROBE design is an 
acceptable [R14-0530 ]and preferred approach for this study .
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
In order to test the two combined efficacy -safet y hypotheses in NVAF patients that have 
undergone a successful PCI ,at least 834patients per treatment group are estimated to be 
required (see Section 7.6 ).
Approximately  550 trial centres worldwide will participate in the trial. The enrolment target 
for each site is a minimum of one patient every  two months . Enrolment will be competitive 
and the trial will be terminated when the total number of events has been observed , regardless 
of enrolment at in dividual centres . If enrolment is delay ed, additional study centres may  be 
recruited.
A log of all patients included into the study (i.e. having given informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) at the investigational site irre spective of 
whether they  have been treated with investigational drug or not.

Patients on dabigatran etexilate who are found to have a CrCl <30mL/min during t he 
course of the trial, should have stud y medication stopped and a parenteral 
anticoagulant can be started according to local practice (see Appendix 10.1 for 
switching to a parenteral anticoagulant). CrCl laboratory  testing should be repeated as 
soon as feasible, ideally  within 48 hours. If this second measurement confirms a CrCl 
<30mL  the patient should be permanently  discontinued from dabigatran etexilate, 
unless the concomitant clinical condition is expected to allow recovery  of the renal 
function within 7 day s from the initial CrCl reduction. A patient should also be 
permanentl y discontinued from study drug, if CrCl drops to <30mL /min at two 
differe nt occasions during the trial
In the opinion of the Investigator, cont inuation on the study  drug is not in the patient’s 
best interest, if eligibility  criteria are being violated, or if the patient fails to comply

resume stud y drug per the protocol) .
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurel y will be followed up until the end of the stud y 
(for further details please see Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 ).
Patients who drop out during the screening phase prior to randomisation (Visit 2) will be 
considered a screen failu re. They  have to be recorded as screen failure sin the electronic Case 
Report Forms (eCRFs) , along with the reason for failing screening, and no further follow -up 
is required. 
Patients who discontinue or withdraw from the study  after randomisation (Visit 2) will be 
considered as “earl y discontinuations” and the reason for premature discontinuation must be

feasible)
Route ofadministration: p.o.
For eas y identification warfarin tablet strengths will have a different colour label.
The warfarin sodium tablets are composed of lactose monohy drate, starch (pregelatinised, 
maize), dispersed erythrosine lake, sodium starch gl ycolate and magnesium stearate.
Patients will take the warfarin q.d.. The individual doses will be titrated without splitting of 
the tablet as needed to maintain a target INR of 2.0 - 3.0. If feasible, an INR of between 2. 0 –
2.5 should be targeted. INR will be measured at least every  two weeks for the first three 
months in patients newly commencing warfarin , otherwise at least every  month throughout 
the study  (more frequently  immediatel y after initiation of warfarin therap y or if required, 
according to clinical judgement ). 
All patients will also take clopidogrel (75mgq.d.) or ticagrelor (90mgb.i.d.) according to the 
local label for at least 12 months after randomisation (in addition to either dabigatran 
etexilate or warfarin). After 12 months of treatment the clopidogrel or ticagrelor can be 
discontinued or switched to ASA ( ≤ 100mg q.d.) at the discretion of the Investigator.
For patients randomised to receive warfarin:
Patients randomised to receive warfarin will receive ASA ( ≤ 100mg q.d.) for either one 
month in patients with a BMS and for three months in patients with a DES.
Warfarin and dabigatran e texilate supplies will be managed using the IRTsystem.
4.1.2 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
Inclusion and exclusion criteria should be assessed at screening to ensure inclusion of eligible 
patients. After having signed the informed consent form, patients should complete the 
screening visit includin g specified procedures (see the Flow Chart ).  
Eligible patients who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at Visit 2 will be 
randomised to receive either dabigatran etexilate 110mg, dabigatran etexilate 150mg o r 
warfari n (see S ection 3.1). In addition, patients will be stratified by age (<80 or ≥80 y ears

performed d ynamicall y by the IRT.
The dose of war farin for the patient will be adjusted to ensure the INR for the patient is 
maintained at a level of 2.0 – 3.0. If feasible, an INR of between 2.0 – 2.5 should be targeted.
Patient assignment to the treatment groups will be determined b y IRT. Access to the 
randomisation code will be controlled and documented. All necessary  instructions for using 
the IRTwill be described in a user guide/manual, a cop y of which will be available in the 
ISF.
The IRTwill assign the correct kit number for dabig atran etexilate forthe patients at each 
time point, but for the warfarin patients, individual management will be by  the Investigator. 
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
The doses of dabigatran etexilate selected for this trial are the same as those us ed in RE -LY, 
the Phase III trial for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation ( SPAF ).  In RE- LY, a dose of 
dabigatran etexilate 110 mgb.i.d. was shown to be comparable to warfarin (INR level 2.0–
3.0) for preventing strokes and SEand superior (relative ris k reduction of 20%) when 
considering major bleeding risk [ U09-3249-02 ]. Moreover, there was an approximate 60% 
reduction in intracranial haem orrhage with both dosages of dabigatran etexilate. 
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Each patient will be randomised at Visit 2 to receive either dabigatran etexilate (110mg or 
150mg b.i.d.) or warfarin. The first dose of trial medication will be taken, between 6 hours 
after sheath removal and prefe rably within 72 hours post PCI , with haemostasis assured,
however up to 120 hours post PCI  is allowed .
Patient randomised to receive dabigatran etexilate:
It is permitted for patients to receive bridging therapy  with a parenteral anticoagulant 
according to local practice before switching to dabigatran etexilate. Dabigatran etexilate 
should be given 0 -2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of parenteral anticoagulant 
would be due, or at the time of discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g . 
intravenous (i.v.) unfractionated heparin (UFH )). See Appendix 10. 1for guidance how to 
switch from ananticoagulant to dabigatran etexilate .
Dabigatran etexilate capsules should be taken in the morning and in the evening (one at each 
timepoint), at the same time every  day with a full glass of water . The capsules must not be 
crushed, no ropened and can be taken with or without food. If dyspeptic s ymptoms occur, the 
Investigator should consider adding a proton pump- inhibito r(PPI)or H2 -blocker to the 
concomitant therap y of the patients. 
The interval between doses should be as close to 12 hours as possible. 
If a dose of dabigatran etexilate is missed for any  reason, the forgotten dose may  still be taken 
up to six hours pr ior to the next scheduled dose. From six hours prior to the next scheduled

individual doses must not be taken.
Any patient that decides to discontinue study medication should be considered for a switch to 
an appropriate (non -study ) anticoagulant according to local practice. For patients receiving 
dabigatran etexilate, continuation of study  drug for 2 -3 day s to assist bridging may  be 
appropriate. For recommendations on how to s witch from dabigatran etexilate to other 
anticoagulants see Appendix 10. 2).
Patient randomised to receive warfarin:
Anticoagulant bridging therap y (according to local practice) is at the discretion of the 
Investigator (see Appendix 10. 1).
Warfarin compliance will be monitored by  means of the INR rather than by pill counts as it is 
a more accurate and biologic measure of pharmacody namic effect than pill counts. Warfarin 
patients will usually  be managed b y their Investigator. However, Investigators will also be 
able to assign INR monitoring to a local anticoagulation clinic. All dose adjustment will be 
done according to usual clinical practice. The Investigator will be responsible for reporting 
INR results and the dose of warfarin prescribed. 
For patients initiating warfarin, INR should be measured at least every  two weeks for the first 
three months to obtain target INR as soon as possible and to avoid over -or under -dosing .
Thereafter, minimum acceptable intervals for INR m easurements are every  month . More 
frequent INR measurements will be done as necessary  at the discretion of each I nvestigator or 
anticoagulation clinic. 
To aid Investigators, a validated normogram, will be provided w hich will indicate 
recommended dose changes and INR re -testing times for different INR values. This 
normogram requires more frequent INR monitoring after out -of-range INR values have 
occurred. 
Numerous factors, alone or in combination, may  influence the p atient’s response to 
anticoagulants. Thus to ensure adequate control it is recommended that additional I NR 
measures are done when other medications are initiated, discontinued or taken irregularly  
and/or diet changes. All patients should be educated about potential interactions with other 
medications, herbal preparations and foods andabout the importance of monitoring. INR 
measurements can be performed independently  from the scheduled study  visits (see Flow 
Chart and Section 6 ), however all available INR values should be entered into the eCRF. I t is 
critical to obtain the best possible level of INR control.
Regular study  treatment will be completed with the last dose of trial medication being taken
on the evening before or the morning of the EOT visit. I f the trial medication is to be 
terminated the patient should switch to an appropriate (non study ) anticoagulant according to 
the local practices. 
For recommendations on switch from dabigatran etexi late and study  warfarin to other 
anticoagulants see Appendix 10. 2.

4.2 CONCOMITANT THERAPY, RESTRICTIONS , AND RESCUE 
TREATMENT
Any additional drugs considered necessary  for the patient’s welfare may be given at the 
discretion of the Investigator and with due cons ideration of the information provided below.
Comprehensive details of concomitant medication of special interest (e.g. a ntiplatelet 
medication, parenteral anticoagulant, thromboly tic agent, GPIIb/IIIa antagonist, VKA , 
therapies for bleeding management , novel direct oral anticoagulant) administered to the 
patient from 30 day s prior to Informed Consent until the patient completes follow -up should 
be recorded in the eCRF. Abbreviated information will be collected for any  other 
concomitant therap y.
Certain c oncomitant therapies (e.g. fibrinoly tics, anticoagulants other than warfarin/ 
dabigatran etexilate) or surgery /intervention may  require the temporary  discontinuation of 
warfarin or dabigatran etexilate. Study  medication should be restarted as soon as safel y 
possible. I n case of a temporary  interruption, bridging therap y with a parenteral anticoagulant 
is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator (see Appendix 10.1 for guidance on bridging 
therap y).Following study  drug d iscontinuation due to AEs (e.g. bleeds) the patient should be 
treated according to local clinical practice. After resolution of an AE, consideration should be 
given to resuming stud y medication at the assigned dose.
The concomitant administration of PPI s isstrongly recommended in patients without clinical 
contraindications for those agents, to reduce the risk of GI bleeding. In pat ients receiving
clopidogrel ,PPIs that do not interact with the CYP2C19 (lanzoprazole, pantoprazole, etc.)
should be used.
4.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additi onal treatment s
In this trial clopidogrel, ticagrelor and ASA are considered a NIMP. This means that in the 
event of a serious adverse event (SAE), the Investigator will assess the causal relationshi p of 
the SAE to the NIMP. Further details regarding SAE reporting can be found in Section 
5.2.2.3.
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are available to 
cope with medical emergencies that m ay occur during the study .

Dabigatran Etexilate Treated Group:
If a patient experiences  major bleed ing, the study medication should be temporarily  stopped 
and the source of bleeding investigated and treated. This will generally  involv e coagulation 
testing (e.g. aPTT, TT, ECT ), platelet count ,and possibly  transfusion, diagnostic procedures
and/or surgical haemostasis.
The recommendations given below are derived from guidelines to manage bleeding with 
dabigatran etexilate. See Section 4.2.1.7 Overdose, for more information regarding the 
specific reversal agent for dabigatran.
Since dabigatran is excreted predominantly  by the renal route adequate diuresis must be 
maintained. Appropriate standard treatm ent, e.g. surgical haemostasis as indicated and 
volume replacement should be undertaken as appropriate. In addition, consideration may  be 
given to the use of fresh frozen plasma [ P10-03790 , P13-06400 ]. As protein binding is low, 
dabigatran is dial ysable, however there is limited clinical experience in using dial ysis in this 
setting. Clearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in patients with end -stage 
renal disease. Dial ysis was co nducted with 700mL/min dialy sate flow rate, four hour 
duration, a blood flow rate of either 200mL/min or 350 - 390mL /min. This resulted in a 
removal of 50% or 60% of free or total dabigatran concentrations, respectively . The amount 
of drug cleared b y dial ysis is proportional to the blood flow rate. There is some experimental 
evidence to support the role of agents such as activated prothrombin complex concentrates 
(APCC, e.g. FEIBA), recombinant Factor VIIa and three -or four -factor concentrates (F actors 
II,IX and X with or without Factor VII) in reversing the anticoagulant activity  of dabigatran. 
The usefulness in clinical settings has not yet been sy stematically  demonstrated. 
Consideration should also be given to administration of platelet concentrates in cases where 
thrombocy topenia is present or long acting antiplatelet drugs have been used. All 
symptomatic treatment will be given according to the treating physician's judgement. 
Re-administration of study  medication (at the same dose as before) after the bleeding has 
resolved and haemostasis has been achieved, is at the discretion of the Investigator. In the 
case of a temporary  stop of dabigatran etexilate bridging therap y with a parenteral 
anticoagulant with e.g. UFH or LMWH (according to local practice) is at the discretion of the 
Investigator. See Appendix 10. 1for additional information related to bridging.

Warfarin Treated Group:
If a patient experiences a major bleed warfarin should be temporaril y stopped. The 
anticoagulant effect of VKAs can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex 
concentrates and/or fresh frozen plasma. Re-administration of warfarin after the bleeding ha s 
resolved and haemostasis has been achieved is at the discretion of the Investigator. Bridging 
therap y, e.g. UFH until the INR has returned back to the target range, is at the discretion of 
the Investigator (see Appendix 1 0.1).

Dabigatran Etexilate Treated Group:
Preoperative Phase:
Emergency Surgery
In the case of emergency surgery , study  medication should be discontinued.  If possible, 
surgery  should be postponed until 12 hours , or longer in case of renal failure, after the last 
oral intake of stud y drug.
In an emergency event, a measure of anticoagulation may  become necessary  to manage the 
situation. A phy sician may consider using the TT or diluted TT (where available) , activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or the ECT.  For further details on results of coagulation 
times expected with dabigatran, see section on elective surgery  below .
See Section 4.2.1.7 Overdose, for more information regarding the specific reversal agent for
dabigatran .
Elective Surgery
Physicians may  consider the following information regarding dabigatran etexilate when 
patients need to undergo surgery  or elective procedures. Providing the patient has normal 
renal functi on, the onset of effect of dabigatran is within 1 hour of dosing and dabigatran has 
peak concentrations 2 -3 hours after an oral dose. Steady  state is reached within 2 -3 day s. 
Plasma levels of dabigatran in stead y state will vary across the population and a re particularl y 
affected b y renal function. Patients with renal dysfunction may have elevated concentrations 
of dabigatran due to longer half -lives of active drug [see Table 4.2.1.3: 1 ]. Serum creatinine 
should normally  be checked 1- 2 weeks before surgery  and the CrCl should be calculated 
using the Cock croft-Gault formula ( Section 5.2.3 ). Patients with a CrCl <30mL /min during 
the course of this stud y should not be receiving study  medication ( see Section 3.3.4.1 ). 
The following is a guide to the discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate (under special 
consideration of the half -life of dabigatran depending on renal function) before surgery  taking 
renal function and additional risk factors into account. I n patients with normal renal function, 
discontinuation of two doses of dabigatran etexilate will decrease plasma levels to 
approximately  25% of stead y state trough levels and discontinuation of four doses will 
decreas e dabigatran plasma levels to approximately  5-10% of steady- state trough levels.

1CrCl can be estimated using serum creatinine by the Cockc roft-Gault formula (see Section 5.2.3 ). Patients who develop 
CrCl < 30mL/min during the course of the trial should have study medication stopped (see Section 3.3.4.1 ). 
2In addition to renal function, high risk determinants of bleeding risk include type of surgery, advancing age, comorbidit ies 
(e.g. major cardiac, respiratory or liver disease) andconcomitant use of antiplatelet therapy. The type of surgery 
associated with a high risk of bleeding includes but is not limited to cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, abdominal surgery or 
those involving a major organ. Other procedures such as spinal anaesthe sia may also require complete haemostatic 
function.  
In patients at high risk of bleeding, including those in whom severe renal dysfunction may  
occur in the course of the trial (<30mL /min CrCl), an elevated thrombin clotting time (TT) or 
diluted thrombin time ( (dTT ); only  in countries where this assay  is approved) )should lead the 
clinician to consider delaying surgery . If the TT/dTT test is not available, an aPTT, though 
less precise than the TT, can be used. A TT/dTT should be performed 6 -12 hours befor e 
elective surgery and a normal result as defined by  the local lab should be obtained before a 
patient undergoes surgery. A persistently prolonged thrombin time (TT or dTT) in the 
absence of heparin, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (e.g. with dissem inated 
coagulation activation, sepsis, severe inflammation andother conditions) or high 
concentrations of serum proteins (e.g. m yeloma) suggests persistently elevated levels of 
dabigatran in the blood.
In patients receiving chronic therap y with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg b.i.d., the median pea k 
aPTT is approximately  57 sec [ U09-3249-02 ]. Assuming the baseline range of normal is 
between 22 to 40 sec ( aPTT assay  as used in RE- LY) this peak aPTT prolongation 
corresponds to app roximate ly 2 times control [ U11-1855-01 ]. Twelve hours after the last 
dose, the median aPTT is approx. 1.7 times control [ U09-3249-02], ( median trough aPTT 
prolongation for patients receiving 110mg BID in RE -LY: 48 sec) giv en adequate renal 
function, with less than 10% of patients exceeding 2.4 ti mes control [U11 -1855-01, U09-
3249-02], ( 90th percentile trough aPTT prolonga tion for patients receiving 110 mg b.i.d. in 
RE-LY: 69 sec). ECT shows a close linear correlation with the plasma concentrations of 
direct thrombin inhibitors, including dabigatran. Median ECT ratios over baseline of 
approx.1.8 at trough and 2.5 [U11-1855-01] at peak, have been observed after int ake of 
dabigatran etexilate 110 mg b.i.d. Coagulation times should be interpreted in relation to the 
timing of last drug intake of study  medication (peak versus trough dabigatran levels). The

etexilate.
Post Procedural Period:
With the exception of cardiac surgery , dabigatran etexilate will be initiated as soon as the 
patient is haemody namically  stable and haemostasis is achieved. If oral medication is not 
feasible, bridging therapy  with i.v.or subcutaneous (s.c. )UFH or s.c. Low Molecular Weight 
Heparin ( LMWH ) should be considered at the discretion of the Investigator (see Appendix 
10.1).
Note:  I n patients where renal function is impaired or procedures undertaken which may
temporaril y compromis e renal function, a serum creatinine should be performed and CrCl 
calculated based on the Cock croft-Gault formula. In patients receiving dabigatran etexilate, if 
CrCl drops to <30mL /min during the course of the study , study  medication should be stopped 
andbridging therap y may be considered. Study drug dabigatran etexilate can be re -started if 
CrCl recovers to 30mL/min within seven day s; otherwise it should be permanently  
discontinued for the duration of the trial and the patient followed until the trial c ompletes. A 
patient should also be permanently  discontinued from study  drug, if CrCl drops to 
<30mL /min at two different occasions during the trial. See Section 3.3.4.1 .   
WarfarinTreated Group:
Preoperative Phase:
Bridging therap y with a parenteral anticoagulant should be considered depending on the 
length of stud y drug interruption. Bridging therap y is at the discretion of the I nvestigator and 
can be performed according to local practice (see Appendix 10. 1for guidance). 
Post Procedural Period:
Anticoagulation can be started as soon as clinically  feasible with i.v. (unfractionated) or s.c. 
LMWH and simultaneously  with study  warfarin until the I NR is ≥2.0. Parenteral bridging 
therap yshould be stopped when target INR is achieved (see Appendix 10. 1for guidance). 
Spinal An aesthesia/Epidural An aesthesia/Lumbar Puncture
Dabigatran and Warfarin Treated Group:
Procedures such as spinal ana esthesia may  require complete haemostatic function. See Table 
4.2.1.3: 1 for recommendations on when to stop dabigatran before spinal/epidural 
anaesthesia. For patients randomised to Warfarin, INR measurements should be performed to 
ensure that coagulation is u nder control.
The risk of spinal or epidural h aematoma may  be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated 
puncture and b y the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, resume 
treatment with study  medication after complete haemostasi s is achieved, but at m inimum an 
interval of at least one hour should elapse for all patients. These patients require frequent 
observation for neurological signs and s ymptoms of spinal or epidural h aematoma.

Patients with documented or suspe cted stroke should be managed according to usual clinical 
practice. It is anticipated that in most cases study  drug will be withheld until a computed 
tomograph y (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scan has been obtained. 
Ischaemic stroke:
For ischaem ic stroke, ASA and/or clopidogrel, or ASA/dipy ridamole (the latter in lieu of 
clopidogrel) may  be administered as indicated according to usual clinical practice. 
Anticoagulation with the study  drug can be continued at the discretion of the local 
Investigat or, in the absence of evidence of bleeding [ P13-06400 ].
Fibrinoly tics may  be considered for ischaemic stroke, if a normal aPTT, ECT or TT test is 
obtained for patients receiving dabigatran etexilate, or if the INR is ≤ 1.7 in patients rec eiving 
warfarin .
Haemorrhagic stroke:
For haemorrhagic stroke or other intracranial bleeding, consultation with a coagulation expert 
and a neurosurgeon is recommended.

discretion of th e Investigator.
4.2.1.5 Acute Coronary  Syndrome
In patients with documented or suspected ACS, study  drug should be temporaril y 
discontinued if other anticoagulants (e.g. UFH) are deemed necessary . ASA, clopidogrel and 
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may b e administered according to usual clinical practice.
Dabigatran Etexilate Treated Group:
In patients receiving dabigatran etexilate, unfractionated or low -molecular -weight heparin 
should be withheld until at least 12 hours have passed since the last dose of dabigatran 
etexilate or the aPTT is less than 1.5 x UL N.
If the aPTT is between 1.2 and 1.5 x UL N, UFH may be commenced with or without 
a loading dose at the discretion of the ph ysician and L MWH may  be commenced at 
the usual therapeutic dose (without an i.v.loading dose)
If the aPTT is above 1.5 times the ULN, it should be repeated every  four hours until it 
falls below this level, after which heparin or other anticoagulation can be commenced.

Unfractionated or low -molecular -weig ht heparin (or other anticoagulants) may  be 
administered in warfarin treated patients according to usual clinical practice.
4.2.1.6 Other Medical Intervention
Percutaneous Coronary  Intervention (PCI): 
Dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued in advance and bridging anticoagulation 
administered according to local practice. ASA , clopidogrel or ticagrelor use is permitted 
according to usual clinical practice.
For patients randomised to Warfarin, refer to Section 4.2.1.3 .
Study  medication can be reintroduced between 6 hours after sheath removal with haemostasis 
assured ,as considered appropriate by  the Investigator .
Coronary  Artery  Bypass Graft ( CABG )Surgery :
Dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued in advance and bridging anticoagulation 
administered according to local practice. Usual priming therapies for cardiovascular surgical 
procedures are allowed.  Patients with renal dy sfunction may  have elevated con centrations of 
dabigatran due to longer half-lives of active drug (see Table 4.2.1.3: 1). If bypass surgery  is 
to start during elevated plasma concentrations of dabigatran etexilate there is an increased 
risk of bleeding. When preparing the patient for cardiopulmonary  bypass, this should be 
taken into account. The procedure may  be performed as usual, including the control of the 
anticoagulation levels using e.g. aPTT, ACT or dTT/TT measurements. For further advice on

Reintroduction following medical intervention:
Dabigatran etexilate can be re-commenced at the cessation of parenteral anticoagulant 
treatment according to the same regimen as at randomisation, provided clinically  indicated 
and in accordance with the recommendations in Appendix 10. 1.
For patients randomised to Warf arin, refer to Section 4.2.1.3 .
4.2.1.7 Overdose
Overdose following administration of dabigatran etexilate may lead to haemorrhagic 
complications due to its pharmacod ynamic properties. I n cases of suspected overdose it may  
be advisable to assess the anticoagulation status of a patient. A TT measure with the 
calibrated Hemoclot®thrombin inhibitor assay  indicating a dabigatran plasma concentration 
of >200ng/mL  (approximately  >65 seconds) prior to the next drug intake after 150mg twice-
daily  dosing (trough measure, i.e. 10 -16 hours after the last drug intake) may be associated 
with an increased risk of bleeding. An aPTT test may  be useful to assist in determining an 
excess of anticoagulant activity , despite its limited sensitivity . An aPTT > 2-fold ULN at 
trough, i.e. when the next dose is due, may be associated with a higher risk of bleeding.
For a summary  how to manage bleeding events on dabigatran etexilate see also Section 
4.2.1.1 and corresponding Figure 4.2.1.1: 1 .
Specific reversal agent to dabigatran
A specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) has been developed and is currently  available in 
many  countries and being reviewed for registration in various other countries. When 
clinically  indicated and available, it can be given to a patient in the context of a clinical trial 
(e.g. BI trial 1321.3) or from commercial suppl y when it becomes approved. If the specific 
reversal agent for d abigatran is given, information surrounding the cl inical circumstances, 
treatment and clinical outcome will be collected on the eCRF of the appropriate trials.

4.2.2.1 Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Corticosteroids or NSAIDs may  be used if clinically  indicated according to current treatment 
guidelines but it is strongly  recommended to avoid these if possible . It should be noted that 
the use of an y of these agents with warfarin or dabigatran etexilate is l ikely  to increase the 
risk of bleeding. 
The following treatments should not be taken during the active treatment phase of the trial:
1.Treatment with ticlopidine or prasugrel
2.Fibrinoly tic agents (see Section 4.2.1.4 for exception)
3.GPIIb/ IIIa antagonists (e.g. abciximab, tirofiban)
4.Treatment with s ystemic ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, cy closporine, 
tacrolimus ,dronedarone and rifampicin, phen ytoin, carbamazepine or St. John’s Wort
5.Diypyridamole , rivaroxaba n, apixaban andedoxaban, or other oral anticoagulants (e.g. 
VKAs)
6.ASA - except where specified in the protocol for patients randomised to the w arfarin arm
or in both treatment arms after 12 months of treatment if clopidogrel or ticagrelor i s
switch edto ASA (≤ 100mg q.d.) at Investigator discretion . The patients should be 
advised to not use additional ASA- containing over -the-counter medications.
The Investigator is alerted to the use of concomitant administration of moderate to strong P -
gp inhibitors (e.g. such as amiodarone, verapami l, quinidine, nelfinavir, posaconazole, 
ritonavir, saquinavir and tipranavir+ritonavir or lopinavir+ritonavir) or P -gp inducers in this 
study  due to a potential risk of higher or lower plasma levels of dabigatran and consequent 
exaggerated or reduced pharm acod ynamic effect of dabigatran etexilate (notably  bleeding 
risk). Concomitant use of such drugs is not prohibited in this study  per se (except for 
treatment with ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, cy closporine, tacrolimus 
dronedarone, rifampicin, p heny toin, carbamazepine or St. John’s Wort), but should be used 
with caution or, at Investigator discretion, switched to a suitable alternative. 
In the RE -LY stud y, patients treated concomitantly with verapamil had on average at trough 
and two hours post -dose dabigatran plasma concentrations increased by  only  16% and 20%, 
respectivel y. Accordingly, the annualised bleeding rates in patients who had used verapamil 
at least once together with warfarin, dabigatran etexilate 110mg b.i.d. or 150mg b.i.d. were 
3.33%, 3.09% and 3.92%, respectivel y. If verapamil is initiated during the course of this trial
in a patient randomised to receive dabigatran etexilate 150mg b.i.d , consideration to separate 
the timing of administration of dabigatran etexilate and verapamil should be given . 
Boehringer Ingelheim                                                                                                         21Jul 2016

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.If dabigatran etexilate is given at least two hours before verapamil for the first three day s, the 
increase of dabigatran exposure will be reduced compared to taking verapamil and dabigatran 
etexilate at the same time- point.
In the RE -LY study , concomitant administration of amiodarone or quinidine and dabigatran 
etexilate did not increase the relative risk of bleeding compared to patients on warfarin and 
amiodarone or quinidine. Therefore ,no dose adjustment of dabigatran etexilate is cons idered 
necessary  in this study  for patients receiving amiodarone or quinidine as co -medications.
The strong P -gp inducer rifampicin (and potentially  also carbamazepine, pheny toin or St. 
John’s Wort) is associated with a potential risk of lower plasma level s of dabigatran (in a 
Phase I  trial rifampicin decreased total dabigatran peak plasma concentration and total 
exposure (AUC) b y 65.5% and 67%, respectivel y) and consequent reduced 
pharm acodynamic effect of dabigatran etexilate (notably  increased thromboemb olic risk) and 
should therefore not be taken during the course of this trial.
A list of common P -gp inhibitors will be provided in the I SF.
The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the following treatments has not been 
studied and may  increase the risk of bleeding: UFHs (except at doses necessary  to maintain 
patency  of central venous or arterial catheter) and heparin derivatives, low molecular weight 
heparins (LMWH), fondaparinux, desirudin, thromboly tic agents, GPIIb/ IIIa receptor 
antagonists, ticl opidine, dextran, sulfinpy razone, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, prasugrel, 
direct thrombin inhibitors, VKAs andthe P -gp inhibitors itraconazole, tacrolismus, 
cyclosporine, ritonavir, tipranavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir.
Bleeding risk may  be increased in patients concomitantly  treated with selective serotonin re -
uptake inhibitors (U11 -1642 -01) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re- uptake inhibitors 
(U12 -1072- 01).
Co-administration of oral anti -platelet (including ASA) and NSAID therapies increase the 
risk of bleeding (U09 -3249 -02).Specifically , with concomitant intake of antiplatelets or 
strong P -gp inhibitors in pat ients aged ≥75 y ears, the risk of major bleeding, including GI
bleeding, increases. 
If bleeding is clinicall y suspected, appropriate measures such as testing for occult blood in 
stool, or testing for a drop in h aemoglobin is suggested ( U12-1072-01 ).  Inve stigators should 
assess the benefit -risk of the concomitant use of drugs that can promote bleeding, e.g., 
NSAIDs , corticosteroids andASA, other anticoagulants and use them only when the benefits 
are thought to outweigh the risks.
4.2.2.2 Restrictions on d iet and life sty le
Dabigatran etexilate can be taken with or without food. There are no specific dietary  
restrictions with dabigatran etexilate, whereas patients randomised to VKA need to follow 
dietary  instructions regarding their vitamin K intake. They  must also be aware of the potential 
risk of over- or under dosing with changes of co-medications (e.g. use of antibiotics) or 
concomitant diseases (e.g. diarrhoea).

Patients are requested to bring all remaining trial medication incl uding empty  package 
material with them when attending visits.
Dabigatran Etexilate:
Based on capsule counts, treatment compliance will be calculated as the number of capsules 
taken, divided by the number of capsules which should have been taken according to the 
scheduled period, multiplied by  100. 
Doses taken on the current visit day  will be excluded from the count anddoses taken on the 
previous visit day  will be included in the count.
Treatment compliance (%) = Number of tablets actually  taken 100
     Number of tablets which should have been taken1
A patient will be considered as non -compliant if the number of doses taken is not between 
80-120% of the expected number of doses. If compliance does not meet this range the patient 
should be asked to provide an explanation and re -informed about the purpose and conduct of 
the trial. Non -compliance should be discussed with BI.
General principles regarding the evaluability  of non -compliant patients are outlined in 
Section 7.3 . Dec isions about evaluability  of patients will be made at the Blinded2Report 
Planning Meeting (BRPM) and at the latest prior to database lock. 
Warfarin:
Warfarin compliance will be monitored by  means of the INR rather than by pill counts as it is
a more accu rate and biologic measure of pharmacody namic effect than pill counts. 
Investigators will be able to assign INR monitoring to a clinic outside the investigational site 
and dose adjustments will be made according to usual clinical practice. However, the 
Investigator will be responsible for reporting INR results, dose management of the patient 
and drug accountability  of the warfarin prescribed. Patients must have the INR measured at 
least every  two weeks for first three months , when commencing warfarin for the first time, 
otherwise at least month ly measurement are required . More frequent INR measurements may
be done as necessary  at the discretion of each Investigator or anticoagulation clinic. To aid 
Investigators, a validated nomogram, will be provided in the I SF, which will indicate 
recommended dose changes and INR re -testing times for different INR values. This 
nomogram requires more frequent INR monitoring after out -of-range INR values have 
occurred.
The quality  of warfarin therapy  for each patient will be assessed b y reporting the number of 
INR values within the indicated therapeutic target range (2.0 – 3.0 and 2.0 – 2.5 ) as well as 
those above and below this range. The Rosendaal method [ R08-1695 ] will be used to 
evaluate the percentage of time that a patient’s INR is in range (i.e. time in therapeutic range
                                                          
1The number of tablets which should have been taken should take into account any temporary interruptions in study drug
2Despite the trial being open label, the trial team will be blinded during medical quality review.

calculated for each patient, for each centre, for each country  and for the whole study . The 
mean percentage of time of INR in range will be calculated for each centre and each country  
during the trial conduct to monitor the I NR control. The percentage of time of INR in range 
for each country  and for the trial will be reported at study  end. 
Analy ses from clinical trial data for SPAF have identified a minimum threshold of TTR of at 
least 60%, below which warfarin may be considered as no more effective than DAPT [P07-
02268 ]. The goal for the study  is that th e INR control should be at least as good as that 
achieved for anticoagulation in the historical control studies. The mean TTR [INR 2.0 -3.0] 
for warfarin in RE -LY was 64% (median 67%) [ U09-3249-02 ].

Undetermined Cause of Deat h
Undetermined cause of d eath refers to a death not attributable to one of the above categories
of CV death or to a non -CV cause. Inability  to classify  the cause of death may  be due to lack
ofinformation (e.g., the only  available information is “patient died”) or when there is 
insufficient supporting information or detail to assign the cause of death. In general, most 
deaths should be classifiable as CV or non -CVandtherefore the use of this category  of 
undetermined cause of death should apply  to few patients only.
Further details on death classification will be specified in the adjudication charter.
5.1.2.2 Myocardial infarction
Criteria for acute MI[R13-4872 ]:
The term acute MI should be used when there is evidence of m yocardial necrosis in a clinical 
setting consistent with acute my ocardial ischaem ia.
Under these conditions any  one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for MI:

Fatal stroke is defined as death from an y cause within 30 day s of stroke.
Severity  of recurrent stroke 
Severity  of recurrent stroke will be assessed b y modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at the onset of 
stroke and at 3 months after recurrent stroke, if this time frame falls anytime within the study  
participation . Disabling stroke is d efined as a stroke with mRS ≥4 at 3 months (seeAppendix 
10.3 for definition of mRS ). 
5.1.2.4 Systemic embolism 
SEis an acute vascular occlusion of the extremities or an y organ (kidneys, mesenteric 
arteries, spleen, retina or grafts) and must be documented by  angiography , surgery , 
scintigraph y or autops y.
5.1.2.5 Stent Thrombosis
There will be three categories of evi dence to define stent thrombosis:
1. Definite Stent Thrombosis
A definite stent thrombosis is considered to have occurred b y either angiographic or 
pathological confirmation [ R13-4874 , R15-0010 ]:
Angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis1
The presence of a thrombus2that originates in the stent or in the segment 5 mm
proximal or distal to the stent and presence of at least 1 of the following criteria
within a 48- hour time window:
oAcute onset of ischaemic sy mptoms at rest
oNew ischaemic ECG changes that suggest acute isc haem ia
oTypical rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers (refer to definition of 
spontaneous MI)
oNon-occlusive thrombus
Intracoronary  thrombus is defined as a (spheric, ovoid, or irregular) non -
calcified filling defect or lucency  surrounded by  contrast material (on 3 sides 
or within a coronary  stenosis) seen in multiple projections, or persistence of 
                                                          
1The incidental angiographic documentation of stent occlusion in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms is not 
considered a confirmed stent thrombosis (silent occlusion).

oOcclusive thrombus
Thromboly sis In M yocardial I nfarction (TIMI)0 or TIMI 1 intrastent or 
proximal to a stent up to the most adjacent proximal side branch or main 
branch (if originates from the side branch). 
Pathological Confirmation of St ent Thrombosis
Evidence of recent thrombus within the stent determined at autopsy  or via examination of
tissue retrieved following thrombectomy .
2. Probable Stent Thrombosis
Clinical definition of probable stent thrombosis is considered to have occurred after
intracoronary  stenting in the following cases:
Any unexplained death within the first 30 day s
Irrespective of the time after the index procedure, any  MI that is related to 
documented acute ischaem ia in the territory  of the implanted stent without 
angiogra phic confirmation of stent thrombosis and in the absence of any  other 
obvious cause
3. Possible Stent Thrombosis
Clinical definition of possible stent thrombosis is considered to have occurred with any  
unexplained death from 30 day s after intracoronary  stenti ng until end of trial follow -up.
5.1.2.6 Repeated revascularisation by  PCI/CABG
Repeated revascularisation due to objectivel y documented recurrent ischaemia, stent 
thrombosis or ACS .Unplanned revascular isation is any  repeated revascularisation not 
planned prior to informed consent. These cases will undergo adjudication for con firmation of 
whether the event was unplanned, the type of procedure, the indication and if it is a target 
lesion revascularisation .
All details of documen tation required for adjudication will be provided in the I SF.

5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.2.1 Assessment of Bleeding events
Patients should be carefully  assessed for signs and sy mptoms of bleeding. Bleeding will be 
classified as major, Clinically  Relevant Non Major Bleeding Event (CRNMBE )or minor. 
Major bleeds will be further sub classified as life -threatening and other major bleeds. The 
location of the bleeding including the specific critical area or organ into which the bleeding 
occurred and whether or not it prolongs hospitali sation will be recorded. The following 
definitions are specified for bleeds :
Definition of a major b leed
Major bleeds will be defined according to the ISTH definition of a major bleed, as follows 
[R05-0344 ].
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with 
compartment s yndrome
and/or
Bleeding associated with a reduction in haem oglobin of at least 2g/dL  (1.24mmol/L), or 
leading to transfusion of two or more units of blood or packed cells1
and/or
Fatal ble ed
Definition of a CRNMBE
A clinically  relevant non -major bleeding event is a clinically overt bleed that does not meet

the following: 
A hospital admission for bleeding
or
A phy sician guided medical or surgical treatment for bleedin g
or
A phy sician guided change, interruption1or discontinuation of study  drug.
Definition of a minor bleed
Minor bleeds are clinical bleeds that do not fulfil the criteria for ma jor bleeds. Minor bleeds 
will be further divided to those that are CRNMBE, (see above) and those that are not. 
Definition of a life -threatening bleed
Major bleeds are to be classified as life -threatening if they  meet one or more of the following 
criteria:
Fatal, or s ymptomatic intracranial bleed; reduction in haem oglobin of at least 5g/dL ; 
transfusion of at least four units of blood or packed cells, associated with hypotension 
requiring the use of i.v.inotropic agents; necessitated surgical intervention.
Definition of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH)
Intracranial haem orrhage (I CH) comprises the subty pes of intracerebral bleeds, subdural 
bleeds, epidural bleeds and subarachnoid bleed s and will be recorded.
Definition of a fatal bleeding
Fatal bleeding is defi ned as a bleeding event that the IAC determines is the primary  cause of 
death or contributes directly  to death.
Total bleeds
This is the sum of all major and minor bleeds. 
In addition to the specified primary  definition to be used for major bleeds in this trial 
(according to ISTH criteria, see above), components of the further bleeding definitions will 
be prospectivel y collected.  I t will be the responsibility  of the IAC to categoris e investigator-
reported bleeding events according to the following pre -specified secondary classifications:

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.The TIMI definition of bleeding uses four categories: major, minor, minimal and none, with 
definitions of the first three as follows:
Major
Intracranial haem orrhage or a ≥ 5g/dL  decrease in haem oglobin concentration or a ≥15% 
absolute decrease in haem atocrit
Minor
Observed blood loss: ≥ 3g/dL decrease in haemoglobin concentration or ≥ 10% decrease 
in haem atocrit. 
No observed blood loss: ≥ 4g/dL decrease in haem oglobin concentration or a ≥ 12% 
decrease in haem atocrit
Minimal
Any clinically  overt sign of haem orrhage (including imaging) associated with a < 3g/dL 
decrease in haem oglobin concentration or < 9% decrease in haem atocrit.
BARC Definition for Bleeding1
Type 0: no bleeding
Type 1: bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek unscheduled 
performance of studies, hospitalis ation, or treatment by  a healthcare professional; may  
include episodes leading to self- discontinuation of medical therap y by the patient without 
consulting a healthcare professional
Type 2: any  overt, actionable sign of haem orrhage (e.g., more bleeding than woul d be 
expected for a clinical circumstance, including bleeding found b y imaging alone) that does 
not fit the criteria for ty pe 3, 4, or 5 but does meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) 
requiring nonsurgical, medical intervention b y a healthcare p rofessional, (2) leading to 
hospitali sation or increased level of care, or (3) prompting evaluation
Type 3:
Type 3a
-Overt bleeding plus haem oglobin drop of 3 to < 5 g/dL* (provided haem oglobin 
drop is related to bleed)
-Any transfusion with overt bleeding

CABG indicates coronary artery bypass graft. Platelet transfusions should be recorded and reported but are not included in 
these definitions until further information is obtained about the relationship to outcomes. If a CABG -related bleed is not 
adjudicated as at least a type 3 severity event, it will be classified as not a bleeding event. If a bleeding event occurs with a 
clear temporal relationship to CABG (i.e., within a 48 -h time frame) but does not meet type 4 severity criteria, it will be 
classified as not a bleeding event.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence, including an exacerbatio n of a pre -
existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a pharmaceutical 
product. The event does not necessaril y have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
SAE
An SAE is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately  life-threatening, results 
in persistent or significant disability  / incapacit y, requires or prolongs patient hospitalisation, 
is a congenital anomal y / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is 
an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical judgement which may  
jeopardise the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definitions.
Intensit y of AE
The intensity  of the AE should be j udged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) which is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms.  
For Japan: The reason for the decision on causal relationship needs to be provided in the 
eCRF.
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
Outcome Events
Since efficacy and safety endpoints can also be SAEs, they  can be treated as disease -related. 
These events will not be reported as SAEs on the SAE form and consequently  will not be 
reported in an expedited manner to the Competent Authorities.  For handling of OEs, please 
see Appendix 10.4 .
A key  remit of the independent DMC is to protect patient safet y by monitoring the incidence 
and clinical relevance of safet y data collected throughout the conduct of this study .

in the standard expedited fashion as an SAE ; however, if the patient has been randomised, 
these events will not be reported as SAEs, but entered in the eCRF as OEs.  
OEs are therefore defined as follows:

5.2.2.3 Adverse event and serious adverse event reporting
Except where noted in Section 5.2.2.2 ,all AEs,serious and non -serious, occurring during the 
course of the clinical trial (i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the 
observational phase) will be collected, documented and reported to the sponsor by the 
Investigator on the app ropriate eCRFs / SAE reporting forms. Reporting will be done 
according to the specific definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘Adverse Event 
Reporting’ section of the ISF. 
For each AE, the Investigator will provide at least the onset date, end date, intensity , 
treatment required, outcome, seriousness andaction taken with the investigational drug. The 
Investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational drug to all AEs as defined 
in Section 5.2.2.2. All events , irrespective of their seriousness, must include a causal 
relationship assessment made by  the Investigator.
The Investigator also has the responsibility  to report any AEs occurring in the four weeks
after a patient completes the trial. Any  AEs reported to the sponso r during this phase must be 
documented in the safet y database.
The Investigator does not need to activel y monitor patients for AEs once the clinical trial has 
ended. However, if the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurred after the patient 
has completed the clinical trial (including the REP and follow-up period), the Investigator
should report it to the sponsor if the Investigator considers it relevant to BI investigational 
produ ct.
The Investigator must report the following events via fax immediately  (within 24 hours or the 
next business day ,whichever is shorter) to the sponsor: SAEs and non -serious AEs rel evant
to the SAE .
BI has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alw ays serious. In order to support the 
Investigator with the identification of these “alway s serious AEs”, if a non -serious AE is 
identified to be serious per BI definition and does not meet the definition of an OE, a query  
will be raised. The Investigator must verify  the description and seriousness of the event.  If 
the event description is correct, the item “serious” needs to be ticked and an SAE has to be 
reported in expedited fashion following the same procedure as above. In Japan , this 
information must b e also reported immediatel y to the head of the trial site.
The list of these AEs can be found via the remote data capture ( RDC )system.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE report has to be 
provided. All AEs, including t hose persisting after trial completion ,must be followed up until 
resolution or the site confirms that no further information can be obtained.
The SAE form is to be forwarded to the defined unique entry  point identified for the BI OPU 
(country -specific contact details will be provided in the ISF). This immediate report is

In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in clinical trials. Once a female subjec t has been 
enrolled into the clinical trial, after having taken study medication, the Investigator must 
report immediatel y any drug exposure during pregnancy  to the sponsor. Drug exposure 
during pregnancy  has to be reported immediately  (within 24 hours or next business day  
whichever is shorter) to the defined unique entry  point for SAE forms of the respective BI 
OPU (country -specific contact details will be provided in the ISF).
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up. In the absence of an (S)AE, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical 
Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  
Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and Part B). Congenital anomali es are always 
considered to be SAEs.
5.2.3 Assessment of safety laboratory parameters
Blood samples will be taken at the screening visit for those parameters required to verify  
eligibility (haemoglobin, platelets, ALT and / or AST, AP and creatinine ( the latter to 
calculate CrCl according to the Cockcroft -Gault formula)) and will be anal ysed by alocal 
laboratory . If standard of care local blood results are available , taken within 7 day s prior to 
screening ,these can be used to verify  eligibility .From Vis it 2 (randomisation) onwards, an 
abbreviated haematology panel and chemistry  panel including liver and renal function testing 
(defined in Table 5.2.3:1 ) will be anal ysed by the central laboratory  at the specific time points 
indicated in the flowchart. C entral laboratory  samples must be taken at the randomisation
visit, prior to first intake of study  medication .
The central laboratory  will provide the required materials for processing the samples (except 
INRs and local testing at screening ) and will also provide instructions regarding 
centrifugation, processing, storage and shipment of samples (as outlined in a Laboratory  
Manual). Results of the central laboratory  anal yses will be uploaded directly  into the trial 
database. In addition, the I nvestigator will receive a laboratory  report for information on a per 
visit basis. 
If any of the results are judged as being clinicall y significant b y the Investigator, the
Investigator should consider whether the result should be recorded a s an AE. If deemed
necessary , laboratory  parameters may  be retested or followed as unscheduled tests.
Unscheduled tests should be performed b y the Central Laboratory  unless immediate results
are required for the patient’s safet y.
All blood samples can be t aken in a non -fasting condition.

All ECGs will be collected on standardised devices and stored at a central digital database
provided b y a central ECG service. At each visit as indicated in the Flow Chart a 12- lead 
ECGs (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 -V6) will be recorded. The ECGs will be evaluated b y 
the Investigator or a designate for immediate investigation or treatment. In addition, the 
central ECG vendor will provide manual reading results which will be communicated to the 
Investigator for  further judgment and will be stored in the central database of the vendor. 
Additional ECGs recorded outside the Investigator 's facilities may  be collected by  the 
Investigator and transferred to the central database for safety  reasons.
Upon receipt of an alert from the ECG vendor, the Investigator or designate is expected to 
review , sign and date the findings, record their clinical judgement in the source documents. 
Agreement with the findings should result in a reported OEor (S)AE, if judged to be 
clinically  relevant. If the Investigator does not agree with the ECG reviewer’s find ings, a note 
should be made in the source regarding the review of the alert. Clinically  relevant changes in 
the ECG will be reported as AEs. 
5.2.5 Assessment of other safety pa rameters
5.2.5.1 Physical Examination
A cardiovascular focused physical examination will be performed by  medical qualified 
personnel according to the flowchart . Documentation of andfindings from the phy sical 
examination, must be part of the source documents available at the site. All abn ormal 
findings at the screening visit will be recorded on the Medical History /Baseline Conditions 
eCRF page. New abnormal findings or worsening of baseline conditions detected at the EOT 
physical examinations will be recorded as AEs on the appropriate eCRF page , if judged 
clinically  relevant by  the investigator . In the event that clinically  relevant findings are 
observed in the ph ysical examination at the end of treatment , the patient should be followed 
by the Investigator until resolution of the event, or an agreement has been made with the 
Sponsor that follow -up is sufficient on that patient.
5.2.5.2 Vital Signs and Weight
BP and PR will be performed at every  visit after resting for at least five minutes. For each 
patient, all BP recordings shall be made using the same ty pe of instrument (i.e. manual BP 
recording vs. automatic digital vital signs monitor) on the same arm. Weight will be 
measured at the visits indicated in the flow chart in order to calculate CrCl according to 
Cockcroft -Gault. Any new clin ically  relevant findings that are identified will be reported as 
AEs.

5.3.1 Other endpoint (s)
Transient Ischaemic Attack swill be collected and adjudicated . TIA is defined as a transient 
episode of focal neurological dysfunction caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal isch aemia, 
without acute infarction [ R13-4874 ,R15-0010 ].All details of documentation required will be 
provided in the I SF. 
5.4 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS
The primary  endpoint for this study  is asafet y endpoint using the I STH definition for major 
bleeding and CRNMBEs which are similar endpoints to those used in other contemporary  
clinical trials in the same setting ( ClinicalTrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and NCT02 415400).
In order to allow bleeding incidence in this trial, to be compared to published data with other 
antithrombotic combinations, key components of the BA RC bleeding classifications will be 
prospectivel y collected. Classifications of bleeding events (t o various different scales and 
major/minor) will be confirmed b y the IAC and provided on an on -going basis to the DMC.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
The study  will consist of three sequential periods, Screen ing/Baseline Period of up to 5days, 
a Treatment Period of up to approximately  30months anda Follow up Period of four weeks. 
The maximum treatment duration is expected to be 30 months, however, the trial can 
conclude earlier, if adequate nu mber of events are reported sooner or i t can conc lude later (or 
enrol additional patients) if more time is needed to observe the minimum number of required 
events. 
The schedule for trial visits is summarised in the study  Flow Chart including time windows 
for study  visits. Al l visit dates are calculated from the date of randomisation (Day  1). In the 
event that visits are missed or out of sequence, subsequent visits will be planned according to 
the date of randomisation . 
No protocol waivers will be given (i.e. no permission ca n be granted b y the Sponsor to 
include a known ineligible patient). In the case of medical emergencies, prior approval from 
the Sponsor for protocol deviations (e.g. v isit schedule) will not be required, but BI should be 
notified as soon as possible. The r elevance of an y such protocol deviation (i.e. constituting a 
protocol violation) will be assessed prior to anal ysing the data.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISIT S
No study  procedures may  be initiated prior to the patient signing the informed consent in 
compliance with ICH -GCP and local legislation.
6.2.1 Screening and run- in period(s)
6.2.1.1 Screening Visit (Visit 1)
Screening will be performed after successful PCI . All tests as detailed in the Flow Chart must 
be performed. 
Screened patients should be registered in I RT.Only  patients meeting the study  criteria will be 
randomised. Patients who fail screening will not be followed up. Patients who fail screening 
should be registered as a screen failure in IRT.
6.2.2 Treatment period (s)
All tests for the visits in the treatment phase are detailed in the Flow Chart . 
After eligibility  has been confirmed and all Visit 1 procedures done, Visit 2 can be conducted 
including randomisation via I RT.Screening and ran domisation can be on the same day , 
depending on the availability of the screening laboratory  results.
Randomisation can occur immediately  after successful screening and up to 120 hours post 
PCI, however, randomi sation within 72 hours is preferable .The first dose of trial medication

(end of intervention i.e. when the last catheter used for PCI is removed ), with haemostasis 
assured ,however randomisation up to 1 20 hours post PCI  is allowed .
Treatment visits will take place approximately  every  three months for the first 12months of 
treatment and every  six months thereafter.  After month 12, phone calls will be conducted in 
between regular clinic visits.  These ca lls are designed to encourage accurate and timely  
event reporting and continued engagement of patients.  
As this is an OEdriven trial, patients will remain in the treatment period until the necessary  
number of OEs is reached. Permanent study  drug discontinuation is only  justified when clear, 
persistent contraindications arise or when the patient requests to be withdrawn from study  
drug, see Section 3.3.4.1 .
All pati ents who discontinue treatment must be followed up until the end of the study . 
Patients who discontinue treatment must continue to be followed up according to the visit 
schedule until the end of the study . At these visits (as indicated in the Flow Chart ) ECG s will 
be performed and the collection of AEs, OEs (including completion of the bleeding
questionnaire ) and use of concomitant medication will be made.
Patients that are not actively  taking study  drug may  be less motivated to adhere to the study  
visit schedule.  I nvestigator and site staff should work to detect earl y signs of losing interest 
and readil y present such patients (not activel y taking stud y drug) with the following 
opportunities to encourage continued participation:
continue to attend regularly  scheduled study  visits until the trial ends
conduct only  the final visit in person.  All other visits would be done over the phone.  
conduct all remaining study  visits over the phone 
discontinue participation in remaining trial activities but permit coll ection of vital 
status and OEs at the end of the trial.
discontinue participation in remaining trial activities but permit collection of vital 
status at the end of the trial.
The patient will be asked to choose the most rigorous follow- up they  are willing to comply  
with.
For patients who withdraw consent no more data on their medical information will be 
requested, see Section 3.3.4.1 . 
The site must make periodic documented attempts (approximately  every  three months) to 
locate patients who are lost to follo w up.

6.2.3.1 End of treatment
All patients will remain on study  treatment until the last patient entered has completed at least 
six months of treatment.  Based on the number of OEs, the operations committee will declare 
the end of the trial date and ask that all patients be brought in for their end of trial visit within 
a certain time period, which will be communicated by the trial team.
The EOT visit should take place for all patients when they  discontinue study  drug.
Patients who discontinue the study  medication early  should be registered as “withdrawn” and 
patients who complete the full treatment period should be registered as completed in the I RT.
After termination of study drug the patient should be switched t o an appropriate non study  
anticoagulant and antiplatelet regimen (if required) according to the local practices. See 
Appendix 10. 2.
Assessments should be performed as mentioned in the Flow Chart .
6.2.3.2 Follow up visit
All patients should have a follow -up visit performed four weeks after EOT .During this visit, 
concomitant medications, AEs, SAEs and OEs (including signs and s ymptoms of bleeding)
during the 4 week period after last dose of stud y drug will be collected . 
Patients who discontinue the study  medication early  should return to their original visit 
schedule after this follow up visit (see Section 6.2.2 ).
6.2.3.3 Final Visit 
The final visit will be conducted in all patients who discontinue study  treatment earl y at the 
time the trial conclusion is declared. Assessments will be done according to the flowchart. 
6.2.3.4 Vital Status and Outcome Event Collection
It is important to record the vital status and OEsof all randomis ed patients at the end of the 
trial. 
If a site has difficulty  contacting a patient at the end of the trial, site staff should make a 
minimum of three documented attempts to contact the pat ient using different methods (i.e. 
phone, email, certified letter, other).  In the absence of reaching the patient directly , 
alternative approaches which are allowable via local regulations and IRB/IEC should be used 
to establish vital status (at minimum) and incidence of thrombotic events and major bleeds 
(where possible).

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This is a prospective, randomised, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), active comparator 
trial and the clinical endpoints are being adjudicated by an IAC in a blinded fashion. The 
study  will employ  a time to firs t event anal ysis (using a stratified Cox proportional hazards 
regression model) and it is assumed that all patients will remain on study  treatment until the 
last patient entered has completed at least six months of treatment (up to an anticipated 
maximum d uration of approximately  30 months for the first patient entered).  The trial will be 
monitored by  an independent DMC.
This study  is designed to test a safet y hypothesis in NVAF patients that have undergone a 
successful PCI (elective or due to ACS) with st enting and were treatment naïve or were 
receiving oral anticoagulant treatment (either with warfarin, another VKA or other novel oral 
anticoagulant) before the procedure.
The primary  outcome is stated in Section 5.2.1 .
1.ISTH MBE and CRNMBE
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
Two safet y hypotheses (110mg Dabigatran Etexilate (DE -DAT) vs. warfarin -TAT and 
150mg DE -DAT vs. warfarin-TAT) will be tested:
1.110mg DE -DAT is non -inferior to warfarin -TAT with respect to MBE/CRNMBE 
over the duration of the trial
2.150mg DE -DAT is non -inferior to warfarin -TAT with respect to MBE/CRNMBE 
over the duration of the trial.
To control the Ty pe I error ra te at a one -sided 0.025 level, a hierarchical procedure for 
multiple testing will be used to test th e above h ypotheses .Additional testing for safety  and 
efficacy  endpoints will also be included in this hierarchical procedure. The following 
hierarchical procedure will be applied :
Step 1 –Non-inferiorit y of 110mg DE -DAT to warfarin- TAT in MBE/CRNMBE is m et at 
the one -sided 0.025 level of significance
Step 2 –Non-inferiorit y of 150mg DE -DAT to warfarin-TAT in MBE/CRNMBE is met at 
the one -sided 0.025 level of significance
Step 3 –Non inferiority  of 150mg DE -DAT and 110mg DE- DAT combined to warfarin -TAT 
inDTE and unplanned revascularisation by PCI/CABG is met at the one -sided 0.025 level of 
significance

one-sided 0.025 level of significance
Step 5 –Non inferiority  of 150mg DE-DAT and 110mg DE- DAT combined to warfarin -TAT 
in DTE is met at the one- sided 0.025 level of significance
Step 6 –Superiority  of 150mg DE -DAT to warfarin -TAT in MBE/CRNMBE is met at the 
one-sided 0.025 level of significance
If any of the steps above f ail to meet statistical significance, the testing procedure will stop at 
that step and subsequent tests will not be performed.
The Non -Inferiorit y (NI) margin used for MBE/CRNMBE will be 1.38 (on the relative HR 
scale).  See Section 7.6 for a clinical justification of this margin.  The upper bound of the 
Wald confidence interval (CI) of the HR of DE-DAT vs. warfarin- TAT (one -sided 97.5%) 
will be compared to this NI margin for the NI testing.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.3.1 Primary analys es
The primary  endpoint (measured from date of randomisation to end of observation period) is:
Time to first MBE/CRNMBE
as determined b y the IAC.  It will be analy sed using the stratified Cox proportional hazards 
regression model including factors for age (<80 or ≥80 y ears old) and treatment arm (110mg 
DE-DAT vs warfarin -TAT and 150mg DE -DAT vs warfarin -TAT). Models will be fitted for 
each comparison separately .
The primary  anal ysis will be performed under the intention -to-treat framework on the full 
analysis set of patients (FAS) that includes all randomised patients (regardless of whether 
they have received treatment).  Patients who discontinue study  medication will be followed 
until the end of the trial.  Patients who are lost to follow- up for vital statu s will be censored 
for the primary  endpoint at the time of their last known vital status.  All patients will be 
analysed according to the treatment arm to which they  were randomised.
For the comparison of 110mg DE -DAT vs warfarin -TAT, patients of all ages and 
geographical regions will be included.  For the comparison of 150mg DE -DAT vs warfarin -
TAT, patients from the EU/ROW who are ≥80 y ears old will be excluded from the warfarin-
TAT arm (as patients who are ≥80 y ears old from the EU/ROW are not randomised to 150mg 
DE-DAT).
The robustness of the primary  anal ysis will be assessed by  an on -treatment anal ysis.  This on -
treatment anal ysis will only  count events that occur while a patient is taking study  medication 
(including the REP of 6 day s –see Section 5.2.2.2 ).  It will also anal yse patients by  the actual 
treatment that was being taken while the event occurred.

dabigatran to non -study  warf arin or from study  warfarin to non -study  NOAC, at the time of 
the switch. The proportional hazards assumption will be investigated.
Kaplan -Meier curves will also be presented.
Subgroup anal yses are planned and will be specified in the Trial Statistical Ana lysis Plan 
(TSAP).
7.3.2 Secondary analyses
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints (all time to first event, measured from date of randomisation to 
end of observation period) are:
A combined endpoint of thrombotic events or death (DTE: all death + M I + stroke/SE)
and unplanned revascularisation by PCI /CABG
A combined endpoint of thrombotic events or death (DTE: all death + M I + stroke/SE)
All death 
oCardiovascular death
oNon-cardiovascular death
oUndetermined
MI
Stroke
SE
Stent thrombosis
Composite of death + MI + stroke
Unplanned revascularisation by  PCI /CABG
Time to first event endpoints will be analy sed using the same methods as for the primary  
endpoint.  No multiplicity  adjustments are planned for secondary  endpoints (apart from those 
mentioned in the hierarch y, see S ection 7.2 ).  Nominal one -sided p -values will be reported 
for descriptive purposes.
All secondary  analyses will be performed on the FAS. The robustness of these anal yses will 
be assessed b y on-treatment anal yses (see Section 7.3.1 ). 
TIA (further endpoint, see Section 5.3.1 ) will be analy sed using the same approaches as 
above.
7.3.3 Safety analyses
Safety  endpoints are defined in Section 5.2.1.
These endpoints will be analy sed using the same methods as the primary  endpoints.  No 
multiplicity  adjustments are planned for safet y endpoints (apart from those mentioned in the 
hierarch y, see Section 7.2) .

7.3.4 Interim analyses
No interim anal ysis is planned, but blinded sample size re- calculations may  be performed.  
The conduct of the trial will be monitored by  a DMC. The DMC will hold regular meetings to 
monitor imbala nce in endpoints, with the focus on MBE/CRNMBE. The DMC’s objectives 
and working practices are document edin the DMC charter. 
The DMC may  recommend terminating the study  at any  time for DE -DAT safet y concerns.  
Further details will be included in the DMC charter.
The DMC will have unblinded safet y reviews every 2 months.

7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
A major goal of the trial is to obtain virtually  complete follow -up of vital status.  As 
mentioned in Section 7.3.1 , all patients lost to follow-up will be treated as censored at the 
time of last known vital status.
The CTR will contain a summary  of the number and proportion of patients with (and without) 
complete follow -up of vital status in each treatment group.
Partial dates will be imputed for the primary  and secondary  endpoints.  Specific imputation 
rules will be documented i n the TSAP.
7.5 RANDOMISATION
Patients aged <80 years old will be randomly  assigned to 110mg DE -DAT, 150mg DE -DAT 
or warfarin -TAT in a 1:1:1 ratio for the duration of the trial.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.Patients aged ≥80 y ears old will be randomly  assigned depending on their geog raphical 
region: 
Patients aged ≥80 y ears old in the USA will be assigned to 110mg DE- DAT, 150mg DE -
DAT or warfarin -TAT in a 1:1:1 ratio
All other patients aged ≥80 y ears old (i.e. EU/ROW) will be assigned to 110mg DE- DAT 
or warfarin -TAT in a 1:1 ratio.
Patients will be randomised in permuted blocks, dy namically  stratified by  age (<80 or ≥80 
years old) and region (EU/ROW or USA) using an I RT.  Dy namic stratification allocates 
blocks of randomisation numbers according to the strata of the first randomised pa tient within 
that block.  For example, if the first patient randomised to the first block is <80 y ears old and 
from the USA, other randomisation numbers within this block will only  be allocated to 
patients <80 y ears old from the USA (until there are no mor e randomisation numbers left to 
allocate within this block).  BI will arrange for the packaging and labelling of study 
medication. The randomisation list will be generated using a validated s ystem and a pseudo-
random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non -
predictable.  The block size will be documented in the CTR. Access to the codes will be 
controlled and documented.  
7.6 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
This is an event -driven trial where it is assumed that the fir st patient recruited into the study  
will be followed up for a maximum of approximately 30 months and the last patient recruited 
into the trial will be followed up for a minimum of 6 months. It is assumed that patient 
accrual will be approximately  uniform o ver the 24 month recruiting period.
The proportion of patients with at least one MBE/CRNMBE at one year is estimated to be 
14% based on current blinded trial data.
A relative NI margin for the original co -primary  endpoint (DTE) was chosen in analogy  to 
recent SPAF trials with primary  endpoints of stroke/SE, where 1.38 was used by  the FDA for 
ximelagatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran to preserve at least 50% of the relative 
reduction (on the log scale) in the risk associated with warfarin in six previous (historical), 
randomised, controlled trials. See publication by  Jackson K, Gersh BJ, Stockbridge N, et al. 
[R08-2662 ]. The same NI margin has been applied to MBE/CRNMBE as it was considered 
the most clinically  relevan t available reference in the absence of an y other type of data.
The overall sample size is driven by  the non -inferiority  comparison of  MBE/CRNMBE 
between 110mg DE -DAT or 150mg DE -DAT and warfarin -TAT.  With alpha=0.025 (one -
sided) and 14% of patients with at least one event at one year, 334 patients with at least one 
MBE/CRNMBE in each pairof treatment groups (i.e. 167 patients with MBE/CRNMBE per 
treatment group) are required to achieve 83.6% power for this endpoint, y ielding a final 
sample size estimate d at 834 patients in each treatment group (i.e. 2502 randomised patients 
in total). Therefore approximately  500 patients with at least one MBE/CRNMBE are required 
in total across the three treatment groups.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.As described in Section 7.3.1 , for the comparison of 150mg DE -DAT vs warfarin -TAT, 
patients from the EU/ROW who are ≥80 y ears old will be excluded from the warfarin -TAT 
arm (as patients who are ≥80 y ears old from the EU/ROW are not randomised to 150mg DE -
DAT).  The actual numbe r of patients entered may  increase or decrease based upon actual 
event rates. As this is an event -driven trial, the trial can conclude earlier, if an adequate 
number of events are reported sooner or later, if more events are needed. Because the last 
patien t entered must be followed up for a minimum of 6 months and to avoid accruing too 
many  events, recruitment will need to be stopped before the required number of events are 
observed.  Blinded event rates will be monitored closely  by BI (and the Executive St eering 
Committee) to predict the time at which recruitment should be stopped.  Sites will be notified 
when recruitment ends.

8.4.1 Listedness
To fulf il the regulatory  requirements for expedited safet y reporting, the sponsor evaluates 
whether a particular AEis "listed", i.e. is a known side effect of the drug or not .Therefore a 
unique reference document for the evaluation of listedness needs to be provided. For
dabigatran etexilate this is the current version of the IB(U98-3208 ).For the comparator
(Warfarin) this is thecurrent UKSummary  of Product Characteristics ( SmPC). The current 
versions of these referenc e documents are to be provided in the I SF.For the NIMPs the 
reference documents are the UK SmPC for ticagrelor, the UKSmPC for clopidogrel and the 
US Package Insert for A SA. No AEs are classified as listed for study  design or invasive 
procedure s.
8.4.2 Expedited reporting to health authorities andIECs/IRBs
Expedited reporting of serious adverse events, e.g. suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) to health authorities andIECs/I RBs, will be done according to local 
regulatory  requirements . Further details regarding this reporting procedure are provided in the 
ISF.
8.5 STATEMENT OF CONFIDE NTIALITY
Individual patient medical information obtained as a result of this trial is considered 
confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibite d with the exceptions noted below. 
Patient confidentiality  will be ensured by  using patient identification code numbers.
Treatment data may be given to the patient ’s personal phy sician or to other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient ’swelfare. Data generated as a result of the trial 
need to be available for inspection on request b y the participating ph ysicians, the sponsor ’s 
representatives, b y the IRB / IEC and the regulatory  authorities , i.e. the CA.
8.6 COMPLETION OF TRIAL

APPENDIX 10. 1 STUDY DRUG START AND BRIDGING RULES
10.1.1 When to start dabigatran etexilate following treatment by other anticoagulants
Heparins
UFH or LMWH/injectable anticoagulant (if given) should be stopped prior to the first dose of 
dabigatran etexilate. Dabigatran etexilate should be initiated with the following suggested 
time windows:
UFH/other continuous i.v. anticoagulants: initiate dabigatran etexilate at the time the 
UFH/other continu ous i.v. anticoagulant is stopped 
LMWH/other s.c. injectable anticoagulants: initiate dabigatran etexilate 0 -2 hours 
prior to the time that the next dose of the L MWH/other s.c. injectable anticoagulant 
would be due.
Vitamin K antagonists
Patients alrea dy on VKA, should start dabigatran etexilate once the INR is <2.0. If the INR is 
≥2.0, study  medication can be dispensed but the patient will be instructed not to start it until 
notified. Follow -up INR testing will be performed in 1 -2 day  intervals until INR falls below 
2.0, at which time the patient will be instructed to start taking the stud y medication.
Novel Oral Antiocagulants
Patients taking apixaban, edoxaban,rivaroxaban ordabigatran etexilate can be initiated at the 
time the next dose of the novel oral anticoagulant would have been due. As there is no 
clinical experience for switching from other novel oral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate, 
the decision must be taken based on clinical considerations and recommendations [P13 -
06400].
10.1.2 When to start warfarin following treatment by other anticoagulants or VKAs 
Parenteral anticoagulants
Warfarin can be initiated at the same time as the patient is taking parenteral anticoagulants 
(for recommendations on how to dose warfarin see t he nomogra m provided in the I SF). 
Parenteral bridging therapy  (e.g. UFH, LMWH) should be stop ped when target INR is 
achieved .
Vitamin K antagonists
For recommendations on how to switch a patient from another VKA to warfarin and for 
maintenance of warfarin therap y see the nomogram provided in the I SF.
Novel Oral Antic oagulants
An overlapping therap y with both novel oral anticoagulant and warfarin should not be 
performed for patients randomi sed to warfarin. I t is recommended to use b ridging therap y 
with a parenteral an ticoagulant instead while initiating warfarin .

be started at the time of the next scheduled dose of the novel oral anticoagulant (in line with
therespective novel oral anticoagulant label) . 
10.1.3 Bridging Therapy (e.g. for temporary interruptions of study drug due to 
interventions)
The use of bridging therapy  depends on the thomboembolic risk status of the patient and the 
length of the planned interruption. I t isat the discretion of the investigator whether to use a 
parenteral anticoagulant for bridging purposes or not. 
Due to the short off -and onset of action, the majority  of interventions in patients receiving 
dabigatran etexilate may  not require the use of b ridging therapy . If bridging therap y is 
deemed necessary  for patients in the dabigatran etexilate arm, it is recommended to wait 12 
hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a parenteral 
anticoagulant .
Patients in the warfarin arm should be treated at the discretion of the investigator. In general, 
a parenteral anticoagulant may  be considered when the INR is below the target INR. For 
recommendations how to switch back to study  drug (dabigatran etexilate or warfarin) see 
Section s 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 .

At the end of the stud y or if a patient discontinues earl y, continued anticoagulant therap y will 
usually  be required because the patients has NVAF. 
Investigators should plan for each subject’s transition to standard of care taking into 
consideration the i ndividual patient’s risk profile and previous experience with non -study  
VKA. 
As patients have different risk profiles, optimal approaches might differ between patients and 
not all possible approaches are described below. 
OPTION 1: STARTING WARFARIN PRIO R TO DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE 
DISCONTINUATION
Start warfarin at the EOT visit and continue on dabigatran etexilate for 2 -3 day s after the 
EOT visit1. In patients with CrCl >50mL /min who discontinue dabigatran but still require 
anticoagulation, dabigatran sho uld be continued for three more day s. For patients with 
moderate renal d ysfunction (CrCl ≥30 to <50mL /min), as measured in the visit before EOT, 
dabigatran can be stopped after two day s of concomitant VKA.
Many  physicians will want to see warfarin naïve pa tients before starting warfarin. There is no 
special need to measure the CrCl before starting warfarin. If the INR is checked on the day of 
the EOT visit, I nvestigators should recognise that the presence of dabigatran could elevate the 
INR. Because dabigat ran etexilate can increase the INR, the INR will better reflect warfarin’s 
effect only  after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 24 hours.
OPTION 2: BRIDGING WITH LMWH
Patient comes in on the day  of the EOT visit , dabigatran etexilate is s topped and non -study  
VKA is started. LMWH can be used to bridge the patient until the I NR becomes therapeutic. 
The L MWH can be started 12 hours after the last dose of dabigatran etexilate . This approach 
is an alternative to Option 1 described above. 
The decision to use bridging therap y is at the discretion of the investigator (see Appendix 
10.1).
Please consult local guidelines for the starting dose of the respective VKA. 
Although there are large differences in the pl asma half -lives of the various VKAs in clinical 
use, apart from the selection of the starting dose, the half -life of the VKA will have no impact 
on the transition from dabigatran etexilate. 
                                                          
1The date of final intake of dabigatran etexilate must be documented in the eCRF.

Section to be changed 1.1 Medical Background
Description of change The bold text below has been added:
A recently  published small randomised controlled 
study  (WOEST) [ R13-4127 ], observed that bleeding 
and ischaemic event rates were lower in patients on 
DAT (warfarin + clopidogrel) compared to TAT 
(warfarin + clopidogrel + ASA). F rom previous 
experience it is also known that continued 
anticoagulation with warfarin during PCI procedures 
is associated with an increased risk of bleeding 
[P07-09550 ]. The WOEST study  enrolled 573 
patients randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive oral anticoagulation plus clopidogrel 
alone (DAT) or plus clopidogrel and aspirin 
(TAT). All patients were pretreate d with a 
maintenance dose of 75 mg clopidogrel per day 
for at leas t 5 days, a loading dose of 300 mg 
clopidogrel at least 24 h ours befor e PCI, or a 
loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel at least 4 
hours before PCI. A 320mg loading dose of ASA 
was also given to patients who had not been 
taking ASA before the study. Study treatment 
was started promptly after randomisa tion.  All 
patients received 75 mg clopidogrel daily, and 
those in the TAT group were also given 80
–100 
mgASA daily.

Rationale for change DILI monitoring is no longer considered necessary  
for dabigatran etexilate at this advanced stage of 
development for the following reasons:
During the clinical development of the product, 
extensive DILI monitoring had been conducted. 
Extensive data available from clinical trials 
condu cted so far in different indications with 
close to 30 ,000 patients exposed to dabigatran in 
clinical trials has not evidenced risk of 
hepatoxicity  (U98 -3208). I n fact, data of liver 
enzymes from the pivotal trials during and post -

treatment did not indicate that administration of 
dabigatran etexilate is associated with 
hepatotoxicity . Independent of the indication ,
there does not appear to be an y dose response 
effect in the frequency  of occurrence of liver 
enzyme (ALT/AST) elevations with dabigatran 
etexilat e . Also, a recently published s ystematic 
review and meta -analysis concluded that the 
NOACs (dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, 
apixaban, darexaban, edoxaban) were not 
associated with an increased risk of DILI ( P14-
02938 ).
Post-marketing experience from ov er 4 million 
patient -years over a period of more than 6 y ears 
has not evidenced signs of hepatotoxicity . The 
evaluation of BI cumulative data collected since 
market introduction has not evidenced an y risk of 
severe liver injury /hepatotoxicity  associated wi th 
the use of dabigatran etexilate.
Removal of DILI monitoring is not contradicting 
FDA requirements for assessing the potential for 
a drug to cause severe liver injury , which in 
general applies to premarketing clinical 
evaluation (FDA Guidance for Industry : “Drug -
Induced Liver Injury ) and this assessment has 
alread y been extensivel y done for dabigatran.

Has been changed to
Blood samples will be taken at the screening visit 
for those parameters required to verify  eligibility  
(haemoglobin, platelets, ALT and / or AST, AP 
and creatinine (the latter to calculate CrCl
according to the Cockcroft -Gaul t formula)) and 
will be anal ysed by a local laboratory. If standard 
of care laboratory blood results are available, 
taken within 7 days prior to screening, these can 
be used to verify eligibility.
Rationale for change Toprovide clarification of laboratory  parameters 
needed to verify  eligibility  and to minimise blood 
samples that need to be taken from patient. The use 
of standard of care local laboratory  results taken 
within 7 days prior to screening is considered 
accepta ble.

Section to be changed Clinical Trial Protocol Synopsis Objectives
Description of change The study  aims to show non -inferiorit y of both 
doses of DE -DAT when compared to Warfarin- TAT 
in efficacy  and safety. Efficacy will be determined 
by comparing a composite event rate of death, MI, 
stroke and s ystemic embolism (SE). Safety  will be 
determined by comparing the rates of clinically  
relevant bleeding, assessed using the modified 
International Societ y of Thrombosis and

terms of safety . Safety isdetermined b y bleeding 
events , assessed using the modified International 
Society  of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) 
classification of Major Bleeding and Clinically 
Relevant Non -Major Bleeding Events 
(CRNMBE).
Rationale for change The study  has been progressing behind schedule due 
to many  reasons (e.g. patients previously  treated 
with NOACs not willing to be randomised to 
warfarin, patients with co -morbidities not qualify ing 
for the stud y). Although, a recent protocol 
amendment 1 (dated 16 -Sep- 2015) included some 
measures to facilitate recruitment (e.g. expanding 
the time-windo w for study  drug administration, 
simplify ing laboratory  requirements for selection of 
patients ), these changes alone are not cons idered to 
be  sufficient to achieve the ori ginal required 
number of patients (8,520) in the planned timeline. 
Thus, the study  design needed to be revised and will 
now focus on safet y. It will be powered to test the 
non-inferiorit y of each of the dabigatran etexilate 
doses ( 110mg and 150 mg bid) in a dual 
antithrombotic regimen versus warfarin in a triple 
antithrombotic regimen in respect to bleeding events 
(time to first I STH major bleeding or clinicall y 
relevant non -major bleeding event). Efficacy  
parameters (e.g. all death, myocardial infarction , 
stroke/ systemic embolism ), including the orig inal 
co-primary  endpoints (DTE), will now be evaluated 
as secondary  endpoints. The adoption of a safet y 
primary  endpoint is similar to other contemporary  
clinical trials in the same setting.

Section to be changed 7.3.1 Primary  Anal yses
Description of change The dual primary  endpoints (both measured from 
date of randomisation to end of observation period) 
are: 
Time to first DTE ( composite efficacy  
outcome)
Time to first MBE (safety  outcome)
as determined by the IAC.  They  will be anal ysed 
using the stratified Cox proportional hazards 
regression model including factors for age (<80 or 
≥80 y ears old) and treatment arm (110mg DE- DAT 
vs warfarin -TAT and 150mg DE -DAT vs warfarin -
TAT)
…. 
Patients who discontin ue study  medication will be 
followed until the end of the trial for vital status 
(DTE and MBE).  Patients who are lost to follow -up 
for vital status will be censored for the primary  
endpoints at the time of their last known vital status.  
………..
The robust ness of the primary  anal yses will be 
assessed b y an on -treatment anal ysis.  This on -
treatment anal ysis will only  count events that occur 
while a patient is taking study  medication (including 
the REP of 6 day s –see Section 5.2.2.2 ).

Rationale for change Removal of unblinded interim anal ysesdue to study  
design changes .The DMC will continue with the 
tasks specified in the DMC charter.
Section to be changed 7.6 Determination Of Sample Size
Description of change Has been updated to say :
This is an event -driven trial where it is assumed that 
the first patient recruited into the study  will be 
followed up for a maximum of approximately  30 
months and the last patien t recruited into the trial 
will be followed up for a minimum of 6 months. I t is 
assumed that patient accrual will be approximately 
uniform over the 24 month recruiting period.
The proportion of patients with at least one
MBE/CRNMBE at one year is estimated to be 
14% based on current blinded trial data.
A relative NI margin for the original co -primary 
endpoint (DTE) was chosen in analogy  to recent 
SPAF trials with primary endpoints of stroke/SE, 
where 1.38 was used b y the FDA for ximelagatran, 
apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran to preserve at 
least 50% of the relative reduction (on the log scale) 
in the risk associated with warfarin in six previous 
(historical), randomised, controlled trials. See 
publication by  Jackson K, Gersh BJ, Stockbridge N, 
et al. [ R08-2662 ]. The same NI margin has been 
applied to MBE/CRNMBE as it was considered 
the most clinically  relevant available reference in 
the absence of an y other ty pe of data.
The overall sample size is driven by  the non -
inferiority  comparison of  MBE/CRNMBE between 
110mg DE -DAT or 150mg DE -DAT and warfarin -
TAT.  With alpha= 0.025 (one-sided) and 14% of
patients with at least one event at one year, 334 
patients with at least one MBE/CRNMBE in each 
pairof treatment groups (i.e. 167patients with 
MBE/CRNMBE per treatment group) are required 
to achieve 83.6% power for this endpoint, y ielding 
a final sample size estimated at 834patients in each 
treatment group (i.e. 2502 randomised patients in 
Boehringer Ingelheim                                                                                                         21Jul 2016

total). Therefore approximately 500patients with at 
least one MBE/CRNMBE are required in total 
across the three treatment groups.
As described in Section 7.3.1 , for the comparison of 
150mg DE -DAT vs warfarin -TAT, patients from the 
EU/ROW who are ≥80 years old will be excluded 
from the warfarin -TAT arm (as patients who are ≥80 
years old from the EU/ROW are not randomised to 
150mg DE -DAT).  The actual number of pa tients 
entered may  increase or decrease based upon actual 
event rates. As this is an event -driven trial, the trial 
can conclude earlier, if an adequate number of 
events are reported sooner or later, if more events 
are needed. Because the last patient enter ed must be 
followed up for a minimum of 6 months and to 
avoid accruing too man y events, recruitment will 
need to be stopped before the required number of 
events are observed.  Blinded event rates will be 
monitored closely  by BI(and the Executive Steering 
Committee) to predict the time at which recruitment 
should be stopped.  Sites will be notified when 
recruitment ends.

calculations now based on revised study  design 
focussing on safet y.

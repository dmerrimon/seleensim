Page 4 Study Design:  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, open -label, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of the 
Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in subjects with Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia (WM) who require therapy according t o the consensus panel criteria from the Seventh 
International Workshop on Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (Seventh IWWM, Dimopoulos et al 2014 ). 
The study is composed of an initial Screening Phase (up to 35 days), a  Treatment Phase, and a Follow -up 
Phase.  
Approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled on the study. All subjects enrolled on the study will have 
baseline bone marrow samples (bone marrow aspirate and biopsy) collected and assayed at a central 
laboratory fo r sequencing of the MYD88  gene. Approximately one hundred eighty -eight WM subjects 
(Approximately 150  relapsed/refractory and approximately 38  treatment -naïve  subjects) with the MYD88  
mutation ( MYD88MUT), which is characteristic of WM and present in approx imately 90% of cases, will be 
enrolled onto Cohort 1 and randomized to one of two treatment arms (Cohort 1: zanubrutinib treatment 
[Arm A] or ibrutinib treatment [Arm B]) in a 1:1 ratio and stratified using CXC -chemokine receptor 4 
(CXCR4 ) gene sequencing status ( CXCR4WHIM vs CXCR4WT vs missing ) and prior line of therapy for WM 
(0 vs 1 -3 vs >3 lines of therapy).  
Subjects found to have MYD88 wild-type ( MYD88WT) by gene sequencing, which is estimated to be 
present in approximately 10% of enrolled subjects, will be enrolled to Cohort 2 and will receive 
zanubrutinib treatment on a third, non -randomized, study arm (Arm C).  In addition, those subjects whose 
MYD88 mutational status is missing or inconclusive will be assigned to Cohort 2, Arm C.  Approximately 
22 total subjects (including relapsed/refractory and treatment -naïve subjects) are anticipated to be enrolled 
in this cohort.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted approximately 12 months after the last relapsed/refractory 
subject is randomized.   
 Response will be assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) according to an adaptation 
of the response criteria updated at the Sixth International Workshop on Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia (Sixth IWWM, Owen et al 2013  and National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network [NCCN] Guidelines, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia 2015: v2 ). Response assessments will occur at the beginning of every cycle 
(i.e., every 4 we eks starting from C2D1) for the first 48 weeks and then every 3 cycles thereafter 
until PD.  
 Serum IgM and M -protein levels will be measured at Screening, on Day 1 of every cycle for the 
first 48 weeks, then every 3 cycles thereafter (each cycle is 28 days) . 
 For subjects with evidence of extramedullary disease (defined as lymphadenopathy [lymph nodes 
having a long axis of > 1.5 cm] and/or splenomegaly) detected by computed tomography (CT) 
scan at baseline:  
o Response assessment by CT scan will occur every 12 w eeks during the first 48 weeks 
beginning on Day 1, Cycle 4, and then every 24 weeks until PD or complete resolution of 
extramedullary disease.  Additionally, a CT scan is also required at the safety follow -up 
visit.  
For response assessments that occur duri ng cycles when a CT scan is not required, the 
results of the most recent CT scan may be used for the response assessment only if the

Page 5 prior scan date is within 12 weeks of the response assessment date during the first 
48 weeks of the study and within 24 wee ks of the response assessment date thereafter.  
 QOL will be measured every 12 weeks during the first 48 weeks, and then every 24 weeks 
thereafter by the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ -5D in  MYD88MUT WM subjects.  
 Bone marrow involvement by WM will be assessed by aspir ate and biopsy at Screening, at the end 
of Cycle 12 (Week 48), at time of suspected complete response (CR), and as clinically indicated.  
 All subjects will be followed for adverse events (AEs) until 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug. All treatment -related AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization. Efficacy evaluations will continue until documented PD for subjects who 
discontinued for reasons other than PD.  
Planned Number of Subjects:  Approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled. This includes 
approximately 188  subjects (approximately 150  subjects with 
relapsed/refractory WM and approximately 38  subjects with treatment -
naïve WM) with MYD88MUT enrolled in Cohort 1 and randomized 1:1 to 
either Arm A or Arm B, and approximately 22 total subjects (both 
relapsed/refractory and treatment -naïve) who are MYD88  wild-type 
(MYT88WT) enrolled in Cohort 2, Arm  C.

Study Drug:  Zanubrutinib 160 mg (80 mg x 2 capsules) twice daily (BID), 
administered orally (PO)  
Comparator:  Ibrutinib 420 mg (140 mg x 3 capsules  or in other applicable dose 
forms ) once daily (QD), administered PO  
Study Treatment:  
Subjects will be divided into two cohorts according to MYD88  sequencing at Screening.   
Subjects in Cohort 1 (subjects with MYD88 MUT by gene sequencing) will be randomized 1:1 to receive:  
Arm A  
Zanubrutinib 160 mg (80 mg x 2  capsules ) administered PO BID at approximately the same time 
each day with at least 8 hours’ interval. A treatment cycle consists of 28 days.  
Arm B  
Ibrutinib 420 mg (140 mg x 3  capsules  or in other applicable dose forms ) administered PO QD at 
approximately the same time each day. A treatment cycle consists of 28 days.  
Dose Modifications:  
The guidelines set forth in the table below should be followed for dose interruption or modification of 
zanubrutinib or ibrutinib for hematologic or non -hematologic toxicities noted on investigator assessment 
of study drug relatedness.   
Study drug (zanubr utinib or ibrutinib) may be held for a maximum of 2 consecutive cycles and restarted 
upon resolution of toxicity and per investigator discretion.  If, in the investigator’s opinion, it is in the 
subject’s best interest to restart study drug after dose has been held for more than 2 consecutive cycles, 
then written approval must be obtained from the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee.  More than one

BID=twice daily; QD=once daily  
Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity for Zanubrutinib  
For zanubrutinib, dosing will be held for hematologic toxicity suspected to be related to study drug 
treatment under any of the following conditions:  
 Grade 4 neutropenia (lasting >10 days despite the use of growth factors)  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (lastin g > 10 days)  
 ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia  
 ≥ Grade  3 thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding  
For the first occurrence of hematologic toxicity, treatment may restart at full dose upon recovery of the 
toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. If the same event reoccurs, subjects will restart at one dose level lower 
upon recovery of the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. A maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed.  
Dose Modifications for Non -Hematologic Toxicity for Zanubrutinib  
For non -hematological toxicities ≥ Grade 3, other than hypertension that is adequately controlled with oral 
medication  or asymp tomatic laboratory events (laboratory events indicating liver or renal dysfunction will 
not be considered asymptomatic laboratory events) suspected to be related to study drug treatment, study 
drug will be held until recovery to ≤  Grade 1 or baseline, and then restarted at the original dose level. If the 
event recurs at ≥ Grade 3, drug will be held until recovery to ≤ Grade 1or baseline and restarted at Dose 
Level -1.  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3, drug will be held until recovery to ≤ Grade 1or baselin e and 
restarted at Dose Level -2.  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3 at Dose Level -2, the subject will be 
discontinued from study treatment. For subjects experiencing atrial fibrillation that is symptomatic and/or 
incompletely controlled: after atrial fibr illation is adequately controlled the study drug may be restarted at 
either the original dose or Dose Level -1, per discretion of the treating investigator.   
Zanubrutinib should be held for any ≥ Grade 3 bleeding.  The drug should be permanently discontinu ed for 
any related ≥ Grade 3 hemorrhage with the exception of those where the underlying condition can be fully 
treated (e.g. gastric ulcer resulting in gastrointestinal [GI] bleed) and the risk of a re -bleed is deemed 
acceptable.  For any intracranial hemo rrhage, regardless of grade  or relationship to the study drug , the 
study drug should be held and the risk of rebleeding should be assessed. If the risk of rebleeding is deemed 
unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of cases, the study drug should be permanently 
discontinued. Study drug should not be  resumed  unless event resolution has been demonstrated by CT 
scans or MRI, the risk of rebleeding is deemed low, and the patient does not have a need for concurrent 
anti-coagulation or anti -platelet medications  (except low dose aspirin or low molecular weight hepa rin

Page 10 used to prevent venous thromboembolism) .  Study drug resumption can only occur after a discussion and 
approval by the study medical monitor.  
Dose Modifications for Ibrutinib  
For dose modification of ibrutinib, local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or Summary of 
Product Characteristics) should be followed throughout the study.  The major dose modifications for 
ibrutinib are described below:   
Ibrutinib should be interrupted for any new onset or worsening of ≥  Grade  3 non -hematologic toxic ities, 
≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with infection or fever, or Grade 4 hematologic toxicities.  Once the symptoms of 
the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline, ibrutinib therapy may be re -initiated at the starting dose.  
If the toxicity recurs, drug dose  will be reduced to Dose Level -1 (280 mg orally QD).  A second dose 
reduction to Dose Level -2 (140 mg orally QD) may be considered as needed.  If these toxicities persist or 
recur following 2 dose reductions, the subject will be discontinued for study tr eatment.   
As with zanubrutinib, ibrutinib should be interrupted for any Grade ≥ 3 bleeding.  The drug should be 
permanently discontinued for any related Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhage with the exception of those where the 
underlying condition can be fully treated ( e.g. gastric ulcer resulting in GI bleed) and the risk of a re -bleed 
is deemed acceptable.  For any intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of grade  or relationship to the study 
drug, the study drug should be held and the risk of rebleeding should be assessed. If the risk of rebleeding 
is deemed unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of cases, the study drug should be permanently 
discontinued. Study drug should not be  resumed unless event resolution has been demonstrated by CT 
scans or MRI, the risk of rebleeding is deemed low, and the patient does not have a need for concurrent 
anti-coagulation or anti -platelet medications  (except low dose aspirin or low molecular weight heparin 
used to prevent venous thromboembolism) .  Study drug resumption can only oc cur after a discussion and 
approval by the study medical monitor.  
Use of ibrutinib in patients requiring other anticoagulants or medicinal products that inhibit platelet 
function may increase the risk of bleeding, and particular care should be taken if ant icoagulant therapy is 
used.  
Concomitant use of ibrutinib with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.  If the 
benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used, ibrutinib dose must be reduced or 
withheld temporarily (7 days or less).  Ibrutinib do se must be reduced when administered with moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors.  Refer to the local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or Summary of 
Product Characteristics) for specific instructions on dose modifications with these inhibitors.  
For pati ents with mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A) and patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh Class B), refer to the local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or 
Summary of Product Characteristics) for specific instructions o n dose modifications for ibrutinib. It is not 
recommended to administer ibrutinib to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class C).  
Concomitant Therapy and Clinical Practice:  
Permitted Concomitant Therapy  
Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2 weeks or less) are permitted, if used to treat a concomitant 
(non-cancer) medical condition.  
Bisphosphonates can be coadministered with zanubrutinib.  
Infection prophylaxis should be as per institutional standa rds. 
Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
Any anticancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy, corticosteroids given with antineoplastic intent, 

 
Zanubrutinib  
BGB -3111 -302 Amendment 5.0  BeiGene  
26 August 2019  
 
                          
Page 11 experimental therapy, and radiotherapy are prohibited.  Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2 weeks 
or less) are permi tted, if used to treat a concomitant (non -cancer) medical condition. The chronic use of 
corticosteroids at doses equivalent to adrenal replacement (2.5 mg to 7.5 mg prednisone) is prohibited 
without previous discussion and approval from the Medical Monitor  or designee.  
Use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib.  
Supplements such as fish oil or supplements and vitamin E preparations should be avoided.   
Use of preparations containing St. John’s Wo rt should be avoided.  
Concomitant Use of CYP Inhibiting /Inducing  Drugs  
The primary metabolic pathway for both zanubrutinib and ibrutinib involve the cytochrome P450, family 
3, subfamily A  (CYP3A) isoform.  Administration of zanubrutinib with strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
or CYP3A inducers (refer to  Appendix 3  and Table 2 for a list of these medications) and grapefruit juice 
and Seville oranges should be used with caution as they may affect the metabolis m of zanubrutinib / 
ibrutinib .  If at all possible, patients are encouraged not to use strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors and 
inducers and consider using alternative agents. If these agents will be used, follow the dose modification 
guidelines for zanubrutini b in Table 2  and refer to the ibrutinib  local prescribing information .  The medical 
monitor should be consulted in these situations.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Response will be evaluated using an IRC based on an adaptation of the response criteria updated a t the 
Sixth IWWM ( Owen et al. 2013  and NCCN Guidelines, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulinemia 2015:v2 ). The modified criteria are listed in Appendix 2  with guidelines for special 
clinical or laboratory circumstances including response assessment in the case of drug hold or missing CT 
scans.  
All enrolled subjects will be evaluated clinically and with st andard laboratory tests during their 
participation in this study. Safety evaluations will consist of medical interviews, recording of AEs, 
physical examinations, and laboratory measurements (i.e., complete blood count, chemistry, and 
urinalysis).  
Subjects  will be evaluated for AEs (all grades, according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 [ NCI-CTCAE v4.03 ]) and SAEs. Subjects who, at 
time of progression, have an ongoin g AE that leads to treatment discontinuation will be followed until the 
event resolves, the investigator assesses the event as stable, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject 
starts a different antitumor therapy.  
An independent data monitoring com mittee (DMC) will monitor safety and efficacy data periodically 
throughout the study. One interim analysis is planned, and will occur approximately 6 months after the 
first 50 relapsed/refractory subjects in Cohort 1 are randomized to Arms A or B. This ana lysis is for 
futility only. A stop in recruitment is not planned for this interim analysis.  At regular safety reviews, data 
review will include but not be limited to deaths, SAEs, adverse events leading to dose reduction, dose 
interruption, or drug discon tinuation. The DMC may recommend study modification, including 
termination of the study due to efficacy and safety concerns.  Details of safety data review will be outlined 
in DMC charter.

Page 13 Statistical Methods:  
All inferential statistics described in this Section refer to the efficacy comparisons of Arms A and B in 
Cohort 1, which represent the primary/secondary objectives of the study. Separate descriptive statistics in 
Cohort 2 will be used to report the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib in Arm C.  
Analysis Sets : 
The Intent to Treat analysis set (ITT) includes all enrolled subjects who are assigned to a treatment arm. 
The Relapsed/Refractory  analysis set  (a subset of the ITT analysis set ) includes all randomized subjects 
with at least 1 prior line of therapy as determined by the Interactive Response Tec hnology system. The 
Relapsed/Refractory analysis set for Cohort  1 will be the primary analysis set  used for efficacy analyses.  
The Safety analysis set  includes all subjects who received any dose of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib. Subjects 
will be assigned to the treatment arms as treated. The S afety analysis set  will be used for all safety 
analyses.  
The Per -Protocol analysis set (PP) includes subjects who re ceived any dose of study medication and had 
no major protocol deviations. Criteria for exclusion from the PP analysis set will be determined and 
documented before the database lock for the primary analysis. The PP analysis set will be the secondary 
analysi s set for efficacy analyses.   
The PK analysis set  includes all subjects who have at least one post -dose zanubrutinib concentration.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
The primary endpoint of CR/VGPR rate will be assessed by an IRC, based upon the best overall re sponse  
(BOR) , defined as the best response recorded from the cohort assignment date until data cut or start of new 
antineoplastic treatment, and will be analyzed in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set and ITT analysis set 
of Cohort 1.  
Comparison of the pr imary endpoint between Arm A and Arm B in Cohort 1 will be tested using 
hierarchical fixed -sequence procedure under the null and alternative hypotheses as follows:  
H0: RR A=RR B 
Ha: RR A> RR B 
where RR A is the CR/VGPR rate in relapsed/refractory subjects in Ar m A (zanubrutinib) and RR B is the 
CR/VGPR rate in relapsed/refractory subjects in Arm B (ibrutinib).  
Testing for above hypotheses will be performed in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set first at 1 -sided 
alpha of 0.025. If the result is in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set is statistically significant, the 
primary objective has been met and further testing will be performed in the ITT analysis set at 1-sided 
alpha of 0.025.  
A Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test of rate difference adjusting for stratification factors (CXCR4 

 
Zanubrutinib  
BGB -3111 -302 Amendment 5.0  BeiGene  
26 August 2019  
 
                          
Page 14 status [WHIM vs WT/missing] and prior line of therapy [1 -3 vs >3 for Relapsed/Refractory analysis set 
analysis and 0 vs 1 -2 vs >3 in ITT  analysis set  analysis]) will be  performed for hypothesis testing at the 
level of 0.025 (1 -sided) in corresponding analysis sets .  
A CMH 95% stratified confidence interval (CI) of rate difference (RR A-RR B) with each rate weighted by 
the number of subjects in each stratification factor co mbination will be constructed. A Clopper -Pearson 
95% CI of CR/VGPR rate within each arm will be constructed.  
The primary efficacy analysis in Cohort 1 will be conducted approximately 12 months after the cohort 
assignment of the last relapsed/refractory sub ject.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses:  
If the primary efficacy analysis is significant in Cohort 1, secondary endpoints will be tested in the 
analysis set where the null hypothesis for primary efficacy endpoint is rejected.  
MRR will be tested for non-inferiority (NI) (Arm A vs Arm B). The null and alternative hypotheses of 
MRR are set as follows:  
H0: MRR A-MRR B≤-8% 
Ha: MRR A- MRR B>-8% 
where MRR A is the major response rate in Arm A (zanubrutinib) and MRR B is the major response rate in 
Arm B (ibrutinib ).  
MRR assessed by IRC will be compared between Arms A and B.  It will be analyzed using the same 
methods as described for the primary endpoint, based upon the best overall response, defined as the best 
response recorded from the date of cohort assignment  until data cut or start of new antineoplastic 
treatment.  Subjects with no post -baseline response assessment (regardless of reason) will be considered 
non-responders for best overall response.   
A CMH test of rate difference adjusting for stratification f actors ( CXCR4  status [WHIM vs WT/missing] 
and prior line of therapy [1 -3 vs >3 for Relapsed/Refractory analysis set and 0 vs 1 -2 vs >3 in ITT analysis  
set]) will be performed for hypothesis testing.  Non -inferiority will be concluded when the one -sided p -
value is less than or equal to 0.025, or equivalently, when the 2 -sided 95% CI for the weighted rate 
difference (weighted by the number of subjects in each stratification factor combination) excludes -8%. 
Furthermore, superiority can be claimed if the lower  limit excludes 0.    
Justification of non -inferiority margin  
Since no randomized trial has been conducted in WM, the ibrutinib treatment benefit over placebo can 
only be estimated from the single -arm ibrutinib Phase 2 trial in which the MRR is 0.73 with 95% CI (0.60, 
0.83). As a ≥ 50% reduction of IgM is impossible without treatment, MRR can be considered 0% in the 
placebo treated subject. Therefore, the lower bound of 95% CI (i.e., 60%) can be used as the treatment 
effect of ibrutinib over placebo (M1). A NI margin of 8% (M2) is proposed assuming 86.7% of the 
ibrutinib benefit over a placebo is retained. With close to 90% of the ibrutinib effect preserved, the 8% NI 
margin in MRR is clinically justified.  The loss of the ibrutinib treatment benefit is well  within the 
clinically acceptable range.   It is worth noting that the NI of MRR will only be performed after the 
superiority of zanubrutinib over ibrutinib in CR/VGPR rate, which is closely correlated with MRR, has 
been demonstrated. Hence, a numerically h igher MRR in zanubrutinib is certainly expected if the NI test 
of MRR is to be performed. The inclusion of the NI test of MRR is mainly based on the sample size 
consideration in a rare disease setting where statistical significance might not be shown in a superiority test 
with a clinically meaningful MRR difference (e.g., 12% higher MRR in zanubrutinib over ibrutinib) in 150 
randomized relapsed/refractory subjects.

Page 15 The proportion and its corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for each of the response categori es (CR, 
VGPR, PR, Minor Response, stable disease [SD], and PD) by both independent review and investigator 
assessment will be presented.  
Progression -free survival (PFS) will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) method. PFS censoring 
rule will follow FDA Guidance for Industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs 
and Biologics (2007) . 
A stratified log -rank test with CXCR4  mutational status and number of prior lines of therapy as strata will 
be used to test the PFS differences between Arms A and B. The Cox regression will be used to estimate 
the hazard ratio (HR) of PFS A vs PFS B. A 95% CI of HR in PFS will be constructed.   
Median PFS, if estimable, will be estimated using the KM method. Its 2 -sided 95% CI, if estimable, will 
be constructed with a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method.  KM estimates of PFS will be plotted 
over time.  The PFS at 12 and 18 months, defined a s the percentages of subjects in the analysis set who 
remain alive and progression -free at the specified time points, will be estimated using KM method along 
with the corresponding 95% CI constructed using Greenwood’s formula.  
The duration of CR/VGPR/PR w ithin subjects who have achieved a major response will be analyzed 
similarly as PFS.  
Indications for initiation of therapy (see Table 4) will be documented for all sub jects at baseline visit.  
Symptoms that triggered treatment will be followed at, during, and end of treatment visits until resolution. 
Percentages of subjects with resolution of each and all baseline symptom(s) will be summarized; and 
compared between Arms  A and B using Fisher’s Exact test.  
Maximum decrease in percentage of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes by bone marrow studies will be 
compared using analysis of variance model with treatment arm (A vs. B) as group variable. Percentage of 
subjects with decreased percentage of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes after the start of study medication 
will also be compared using Fisher’s Exact test. Percentages of subjects with resolution and/or reduction of 
pretreatment lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly accordi ng to CT scan will be summarized separately; 
and compared using Fisher’s Exact test.

Page 16 Safety Analysis:  
Safety analysis will be  performed by treatment arm, as well as by combining Arms A and C.  
Drug exposure will be summarized by treatment arm, including duration, dosage, and dose intensity.   
Verbatim description of AEs will be mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Acti vities 
(MedDRA®) terms and graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 . All treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
will be summarized.  A TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date on or after the first dose of study 
drug up to 30 days following study drug discontinuation or was worsening in severity from baseline 
(pretreatment) or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes  first.  SAEs, deaths, TEAEs with 
Grade 3 or above, related TEAEs and TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or dose 
interruption will be summarized.  
Multiple occurrences of the same event will be counted once at the maximum severity w ithin a system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
Clinical laboratory data with values outside of the normal ranges will be identified.  Select laboratory data 
will be summarized by grade. Vital signs will also be summarized by visit.  
Correlation between trough plasma zanubrutinib concentration and safety endpoints may be explored.  
Sample Size:  
The sample size calculation is based on the comparison of the primary endpoint CR/VGPR rate in 
relapsed/refractory subjects in Cohort  1. Assuming RR A=0.35 and RR B=0.15, seventy -five subjects per 
arm (approximately 150 total) provide a power of 0.814 in testing RR A versus RR B in the 
Relapsed/Refractory analysis set in Cohort 1 using a normal approximation to binomial test with a two -
sided significance of 0.05 . Assuming MRR A=0.90 and MRR B=0.80, the power of demonstrating NI of 
zanubrutinib in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set is 85.5% when a NI margin of 0.08 is used.  
In addition to 150 replased/refractory subjects, approximately 20% (38) treatment -naïve su bjects with 
MYD88MUT will be enrolled in Cohort 1.  
Assuming MYD88MUT  mutation is present in 90% of the enrolled subjects, approximately a total of 
210 subjects will be enrolled in this study.

Page 27 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Current Status of Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia  
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare B -cell malignancy, characterized by bone 
marrow infiltration with monoclonal immunoglobulin M secreting lymphoplasmacytic cells.  The 
incidence is 5 -8 cases per millio n, with about 1000 -1500 new patients diagnosed in the USA 
annually.  Incidence increases with age with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years for Caucasians, 
and slightly lower in other ethnic groups. There is a male to female preponderance, and an incidenc e 
higher in Caucasians than Africans or Asians ( Gertz et al 2000 ; Gertz et al 2015 ).  Activating 
mutations in the MYD88  gene ( MYD88MUT), which trigger downstream interleukin -1-receptor 
associated kinase ( IRAK )-mediated nuclear factor -kappa B ( NF-κB) signaling ( Treon et al 2012 ), 
are seen in approximately 90% of cases.  A second set of mutations with prognostic significance is 
found at CXC -chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4 ), the receptor for stromal -derived factor 1a ( SDF-1a), 
which are either frameshift or nonsense mutations, are similar to those seen in the 
immunodeficiency syndrome WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and 
myelokathexis), and also lead to constitu tive activation. Either or both of these mutations can be 
found in patients and lead to different clinical pictures, outcomes, and response to therapy  with best 
response to the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib found in MYD88MUT CXCR4WT(Treon et al 2015 a).  
According to the International Prognostic scoring system for WM (ISSWM), patients are stratified 
into low, intermediate, and high risk groups with respective 5 -year survival rates of 87%, 68%, and 
36%, base d upon age, IgM level, β2 -microglobulin level, hemoglobin, and platelet count. ( Morel et 
al 2009 ). 
About 75% of initially asymptomatic WM patients will require therapy within 15 years of follow -
up, with a median time to initia tion of therapy of over 7 years; a lower hemoglobin ( Hgb), extensive 
bone marrow infiltration, serum M -spike, and β2 -microglobulin levels are significant predictors of 
an eventual need for therapy ( Gertz et al 2015 ). Indicatio ns for treatment as per the IWWM -7 
consensus meeting are either clinical symptoms or laboratory findings. Clinical indications for 
treatment include any of the following: fever, night sweats, weight loss and fatigue, hyperviscosity 
syndrome, bulky/symptoma tic lymphadenopathy, significant hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, other 
symptomatic organomegaly, or peripheral neuropathy.  Laboratory indications for therapy include 
symptomatic cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin anemia, immune hemolytic cytopenias, 
nephropa thy, amyloidosis, or significant anemia/thrombocytopenia due to marrow replacement.  
Current treatment strategies include single agent rituximab or rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R -CHOP ) (Jacobson et al 2013 ).  Bendamustine plus 
rituximab has been shown to be an active agent with similar overall response rates to R -CHOP  but 
with enhanced progression -free survival and better tolerability ( Rummel et al 2013 ). Experimental 
agents studied in WM include bortezomib, lenalidomide, everolimus, enzastaurin, and panobinostat.

Page 28 Recently, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib was approved for the treatment of patients with WM by the 
FDA and by the European Medicines Agency ( EMA) in adults who have received prior treatment 
for their disease, or in previously untreated patients for whom treatment with chemoimmunotherapy 
is not suitable .  
1.2 Ibrutinib  
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a signaling molecule within the B -cell antigen  receptor (BCR) 
and cytokine receptor pathways. BTK’s role in signaling through the B -cell surface receptors results 
in activation of pathways necessary for B -cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical 
studies show that ibrutinib inhibits mali gnant B -cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell 
migration and substrate adhesion in vitro.  
Ibrutinib is a first -generation small -molecule BTK inhibitor that forms a covalent bond to cysteine 
at position 481 in the BTK active site, leading t o inhibition of BTK phosphorylation at Tyr223 and 
thus inhibiting enzymatic activity.  
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interactions  
Ibrutinib is absorbed after oral administration with a median time to maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Tmax) of 1 to 2 hours. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The 
steady -state area under the plasma concentration time curve  (AUC ) (mean ± standard deviation) 
observed in patients at 560 mg is 953 ± 705 ng ⋅h/mL and in patients at 420 mg is 680 ± 517 
ng⋅h/mL.   Administration with food increased ibrutinib maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and AUC by approximately 2 - to 4- and 2 -fold, respectively, compared with administration 
of ibrutinib after overnight fasting. The oral clearance is app roximately 2000 and 1000 L/h in fasted 
and fed condition. The half -life of ibrutinib is 4 to 6 hours. The 420 mg dosage was selected to treat 
WM.  
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver. In a hepatic impairment trial, a single dose of 140 mg of 
ibrutinib wa s administered in non -cancer subjects, ibrutinib C max increased 5.2 -, 8.8- and 7.0 -fold, 
respectively, in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment relative to subjects with 
normal liver function. Thus , subjects with moderate and severe li ver impairment should avoid using 
ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib is not significantly cleared renally, the exposure of ibrutinib is not altered in 
patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) >25  mL/min.  Ibrutinib can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman ; it must not be taken during pregnancy and  pregnancy should be 
avoided  for 1 month after cessation of therapy.   
Ibrutinib is metabolized to several metabolites primarily by cytochrome P450  (CYP) , CYP3A, and 
to a minor extent by CYP2D6. Refer to upda ted Imbruvica® (Ibrutinib) Prescribing Information, 
August  2018 , as well as Section 6.6.2  for further discussion of drug -drug interactions with ibrutinib.

Page 29 1.3 Zanubrutinib (BGB -3111)  
Zanubrutinib (also known as BGB -3111 ) is a novel second -generation small -molecule oral BTK 
inhibitor,  which forms an irreversible covalent bond at Cys481 within the adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) binding pocket of the BTK protein.  Zanubrutinib is highly potent against BTK; however, as 
opposed to ibrutinib, zanubrutinib has significantly less epithelial gro wth factor receptor 
(EGFR)/Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)/tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(TEC)/interleukin -2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) inhibitory activity.  
1.3.1 Non-Clinical Data  
Zanubrutinib inhibits BTK with a 50% maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 0.3 nanomolar 
(nM) in biochemical assays.  Cellular assays confirmed that zanubrutinib inhibited  BCR  
aggregation -triggered BTK autophosphorylation, and blocked downstream phospholipase C -beta-2 
(PLCβ2) signaling in mantle cell lymph oma ( MCL ) cell lines. Zanubrutinib potently and selectively 
inhibited cellular growth of several MCL cell lines (REC -1, Mino, and JeKo -1) and activated B -cell 
(ABC) type of diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell line transmembrane domain 8 
(TMD -8), wit h IC 50s from 0.36 nM to 20 nM, while inactive in many other hematologic cancer cell 
lines.   
In vivo studies showed that zanubrutinib induced dose -dependent antitumor effects against REC -1 
MCL xenografts engrafted either subcutaneously or systemically in m ice.  Zanubrutinib was more 
selective than ibrutinib for inhibition of kinase activity of BTK vs. EGFR, Garden -Rasheed feline 
sarcoma viral (v -fgr) oncogene homolog (FGR), fyn -related kinase (FRK), human epidermal growth 
factor receptor (HER)2, HER4, ITK, JAK3, lymphocyte -specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), and 
TEC.  Cellular assays also confirmed that zanubrutinib is significantly less active than ibrutinib in 
inhibiting ITK (10 -fold) and EGFR (> 6 -fold). Inhibition of ITK has been reported to reduce 
rituximab -induced antigen -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  Zanubrutinib was shown 
to be at least 10 -fold weaker than ibrutinib in inhibiting rituximab -induced ADCC, consistent with 
zanubrutinib being a more selective BTK inhibitor, with much we aker ITK inhibition activity than 
ibrutinib in both biochemical and cellular assays, thus preventing the potential for antagonism with 
rituximab that has been seen preclinically with other BTK inhibitors. Refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB)  for more detailed information o n zanubrutinib.  
1.3.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interactions  
In the Phase 1 study, PK was linear between 40 mg and 320 mg daily.  The absorption of 
zanubrutinib is rapid with median time to maximum plasma  concentration  (Cmax) of 2 hours.  
Preliminary results from the food effect study revealed that zanubrutinib exposure was not altered 
by high -fat breakfast, and was increased by 30 -60% with standard breakfast when compared to 
fasting. The magnitude of incr ease in exposure with food was well within doubling of exposure 
associated with 320 mg QD administered in the ongoing Phase 1  study , which did not lead to

Page 30 additional safety findings. The terminal elimination half -life is approximately 4 hours at 320 mg 
daily. 
Full occupancy of BTK in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was achieved in all subjects in the 
study, while occupancy in lymph node tissue was assessed only at 160 mg BID and 320 mg daily.  
At the 160 mg BID dose, full BTK occupancy was observed at trough, suggesting that sustained 
target occupancy could be achieved in disease -originating tissues, thus more efficiently inhibiting 
BTK on a continuous basis, further preventi ng breakthrough signaling despite cycles of new BTK 
synthesis.  Activity has been observed across indications at all tested dose levels; thus, a minimum 
effective dose cannot be established at this time.  Conversely, there is now extensive experience at 
the 160 mg BID and 320 mg daily dose; both schedules show a high level of activity without 
compromise of the tolerability profile as compared to lower doses of zanubrutinib.   
Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A  (CYP3A) was the major CYP isoform responsib le for 
zanubrutinib metabolism.  Based on in vitro  data, z anubrutinib is a moderate inhibitor for CYP2C8 
(IC 50 = 4.03 µM) .  Zanubrutinib is not a time -dependent CYP inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A.    Zanubrutinib is  not an inducer of human 
CYP1A2  or CYP2B6 but has weak CYP3A induction potential at a concentration equal to or higher 
than 3 µM in primary human hepatocytes.   
1.3.3 Safety Pharmacology  
The potential risk of zanubrutinib on QT interval prolongation was assessed  using a battery of 
preclinical studies. A GLP compliant hERG assay was conducted.  Based on the clinical steady -
state, unbound Cmax of 0.042 μM (total Cmax 346 ng/mL; plasma protein binding 94.2%) observed 
at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 160 mg BID, there is more than a 200 -fold exposure 
margin compared with the hERG IC50 of 9.11 μM.   
No effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, including QT and 
QTc intervals, were noted in telemetry -instrumented conscious dogs following single doses of 
zanubrutinib up to 100 mg/kg.  In addition, no abnormal changes in ECG or cardiovascular function 
were noted in 28 - and 91 -day repeat -dose toxicity studies in dogs at doses up to 100 mg/kg.  In 
these studies, the systemic exposure  of zanubrutinib was 10 -fold higher than that observed at the 
human therapeutic dose.   
1.3.4 Clinical Pharmacology  
The QT interval prolongation potential of zanubrutinib was evaluated in healthy subjects in a 
thorough QT study (BGB -3111 -106).  Results from this  study demonstrated that single oral doses of 
zanubrutinib at a therapeutic dose of 160 mg and a supratherapeutic dose of 480 mg did not have a 
clinically relevant effect on ECG parameters, including QTc intervals and other ECG intervals.

Page 31 Because of the s hort half -life and no accumulation seen upon multiple -dosing, these results are also 
applicable for steady -state conditions.  
Results from a dedicated clnical drug-drug interaction study (BGB -3111 -104) indicate that 
coadministration of zanubrutinib with the  strong CYP3A inducer rifampin (600 mg every day for 8 
days) decreased exposure of zanubrutinib by 13.5 -fold for AUC 0-∞, and 12.6 -fold for maximum 
observed plasma concentration  (Cmax), in healthy subjects.  Coadministration of zanubrutinib with 
the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg every day for 4 days) increased exposure of 
zanubrutinib by 3.8 -fold for AUC 0-∞, and 2.6 -fold for C max.  These results are consistent with the 
role for CYP3A isoenzymes as the principal metabolic pathway for zanubrutini b. Additionally, 
preliminary simulations from a physiologically -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model suggest that 
coadministration of multiple doses of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (eg, diltiazem, erythromycin, 
and fluconazole) may increase the C max and AUC of  zanubrutinib by approximately 2 -fold.  For 
coadministration with a moderate CYP3A inducer (eg, efavirenz), PBPK simulations suggest that 
the C max and AUC of zanubrutinib may decrease by approximately 2 - to 3-fold. 
A clinical drug -drug interaction study (BGB -3111 -108) was conducted to assess the effect of 
zanubrutinib on the PK of substrates of CYP3A (midazolam), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 
(omeprazole), P -gp (digoxin), and BCRP (rosuvastatin) using a cocktail approach .  The results show 
that zanubrutinib does not significantly affect drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 (warfarin) or 
transported by BCRP (statins).   Zanubrutinib has a mild induction effect on CYP3A and CYP2C19 
enzymes , but not an inhibitor of CYP2C19 .  AUC 0-t and C max values were approximately 47% and 
30% lower, respectively, when midazolam was coadministered with zanubrutinib.   AUC 0-t and C max 
values w ere approximately 36% and 20% lower, respectively, when omeprazole was coadministered 
with zanubrutinib.  Repeat ed dosing of zanubrutinib increased exposure of digoxin (P -gp substrate) 
with a mean increase of 11% for AUC 0-t and 34% for C max.  
Based a validated PBPK model to simulate the effect of zanubrutinib on the pharmacokinetics of 
CYP2B6 sensitive substrate , the potential for  zanubrutinib to induce CYP2B6 is considered low.  
Based on resu lts of two clinical DDI studies above, a validated PBPK model was developed and 
was employed to simulate the effect of zanubrutinib on the pharmacokinetics of sensitive CYP2C8, 
and CYP2B6 substrates.  The simulation findings show that concomitant use of zanubrutinib has a 
minimal or no effect on the exposure of CYP2C8 substrate (eg, rosiglitazone) or CYP2B6 substrate 
(eg, bupropion).  The predicted AUC ratios of  repaglinide and bupropion (with versus without 
zanubrutinib coadministration) are predicted to be close to 1.

Page 32 1.4 BTK Inhibitors in the Treatment of Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia 
Study Rationale and Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, a member of the TEC family kinases, is a critical component of BCR 
signaling cascade.  Inhibition of BTK has emerged as a promising strat egy for targeting B -cell 
malignancies.  
Ibrutinib, given at a dose of 420  mg PO daily, was evaluated in a 63 -patient single -arm Phase 2 
study. The responses were assessed by reduction in serum IgM levels from baseline according to a 
modification of the Sixt h IWWM response criteria. (IWWM,  Owen et al 2013  and NCCN Guidance 
Insights, 2012 ). The MRR (defined as achieving partial response or better at any time over the 
course of study treatment) was 61.9% . No patients achieved a CR. A very good partial response 
(VGPR; a > 90% reduction in IgM) occurred in  11.1% of patients and a partial response (PR; 50 -
89% reduction in IgM) in 50.8%. The median time to response was 1.2  months (range 0.7 -13.4 
months). In this trial, the median reduction in IgM level was from 3520  mg/dl to 880 mg/dl, and 
median improvement in hemoglobin was from 10.5 g/dl to 13.8 g/dl. However, there are limitations 
to ibrutinib in the treatment of WM. By IgM criteria, 27% of subjects failed  to achieve a response, 
and the nadir IgM level exceeded 3000  mg/dl in 10% of responding subjects. Only 25/35 (71%) 
subjects presenting with adenopathy had reduction in adenopathy by CT, 4/7 (57%) subjects 
presenting with splenomegaly had reduction in spleen size, and the bone marrow response was 
usually incomplete ( median reduction in bone marrow lymphoplasmacytoid cell percentage from 
60% to 25%). In the initial report of this study, 2 of 7 (29%) of subjects with wild -type MYD88  
(MYD88WT) by, were reported to have achieved a major response to ibrutinib; however, a 
subsequent report ( Treon et al 2015 b) noted that activating non -MUT mutations were found in both 
responding patients. Therefore, to date, major responses have not been reported in patients with 
wild-type MYD88  WM. Of adverse e vents  (AEs)  potentially associated with ibrutinib treatment, 
Grade 2 or greater bleeding occurred in 6% of patients and atrial fibrillation was reported in 5% of 
patients. Six percent of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events and dose reduct ion 
due to adverse events occurred in 11% of patients.   In addition, 52 cases of ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia were reported in post -marketing settings of which the role of ibrutinib could not be 
ruled out in 2 cases. ( EMA CHMP scientific conclusions for ibrutinib, 2017 ). 
Zanubrutinib is a novel second -generation, potent, specific and irreversible BTK inhibitor.  In the 
ongoing first -in-human Phase 1 study of zanubrutinib  (BGB -3111 -AU-003) in subjects with 
advanced B -cell malignancies, as of 03 November  2017, a total of 67 subjects with WM were 
enrolled in the study. All 67  subjects with WM were fully evaluable for safety and 51 subjects were 
evaluable for efficacy.  The median follow -up in these patients was 15.5 months ( 0.1 to 
37.6 months).  No subjects had CR, 43% had very good PR (VGPR), and 37% had PR, for a major 
response rate (CR+VGPR+PR) of 80%.  Preliminary gene sequencing data was available for all 51

MYD88MUT WM, with 16 of 30 (53%) MYD88MUT  WM patients achieving VGPR  (Tam et al 2018 ). 
Zanubrutinib was well tolerated across histologies and dosages.  As of 15 September 2017, t he most 
common (≥  10%) treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) for 58 subjects with WM  were upper 
respiratory tract infection  (39.7%);  contusion (32.8%); constipation (20.7%); diarrhea (19.0%); 
cough (15.5%); nausea, back pain, headache, anemia, urinary tract in fection  (13.8% each), and rash 
(12.1%) .  Of the 58 evaluable subjects with WM , 6 subjects  (10.3%) discontinued BGB - 3111 due 
to adverse events ( AEs).  No deaths were considered related to treatment.   Refer to the 
Investi gator’s Brochure (IB)  for more detailed information o n zanubrutinib.  
Zanubrutinib was designed to be a more specific inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase than 
ibrutinib.  Preclinical data in cell lines and primary patient samples show specific BTK inhibition 
with less inhibition of off -target kinases such as EGFR, ITK, JAK3, HER2 and TEC than the 
first-generation BTK inhibitor ibrutinib.  We hypothesize that this improved selectivity may result 
in a better safety profile than ibrutinib.  Based on sa fety data of zanubrutinib above we perceive the 
risk of taking zanubrutinib to be similar or superior to those of ibrutinib and the benefit to be 
potentially greater.  However, to minimize the risks associated with BTK inhibitors we have put 
rules in place .  To minimize the risk of bleeding, subjects will hold study drug for 3 to 7 days pre - 
and post - surgery depending on the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.  Subjects will be 
closely monitored for infection and drug will be held and may be subseque ntly reduced, depending 
on recurrence, in the event of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenias associated with significant bleeding as 
well as grade 4 thrombocytopenias lasting >  10 days, Grade 4 neutropenia (lasting > 10 days despite 
use of growth factors), and ≥ Grade 3 feb rile neutropenia.  Furthermore, study drug will be held for 
any ≥ Grade 3 bleeding, and permanently discontinued for any related ≥ Grade  3 hemorrhage with 
the exception of those where the underlying condition can be fully treated (e.g. gastric ulce r 
resulting in gastrointestinal [GI] bleed) and the risk of a re -bleed is deemed acceptable. For any 
intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of grade  or relationship to the study drug , the study drug should 
be held and the risk of rebleeding should be assessed . If the risk of rebleeding is deemed 
unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of cases, the study drug should be permanently 
discontinued. Study drug should not be  resumed unless event resolution has been demo nstrated by 
CT scans or MRI, the risk o f rebleeding is deemed low, and the patient does not have a need for 
concurrent anti -coagulation or anti -platelet medications  (except low dose aspirin or low molecular 
weight heparin used to prevent venous thromboembolism ).  Study drug resumption can only occur 
after a discussion and approval by the study medical monitor. Subjects will be monitored for these 
adverse events.  
We hypothesize that zanubrutinib will have sustained tissue penetration that may result in a deeper 
response than ibrutinib.  Twice -daily zanubrutinib dosing results in high plasma exposure of 
zanubrutinib.  Close to 100% sustained BTK occupancy was found in studies where paired patient

Page 34 lymph node biopsies and blood samples were examined suggesting a deep tissue penetration of the 
drug.  Phase 1 clinical data presented at the European Hematology Association meeting support this 
hypothesis.  With a median fo llow up of 15.5 months (range, 0.1 -37.6), an overall response rate of 
92% (47 of 51), a major response rate of 81% (41 of 51), and a VGPR in 43% (22 of 51) of subjects 
with WM (Tam et al, 2018).  To test these hypotheses more formally we have designed this  head to 
head Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib.

Page 38 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, open -label, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
the Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in subjects with 
Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (WM) who require therapy according to the consensus panel 
criteria from the Sev enth International Workshop on Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia 
(Dimopoulos et al 2014 ).  Subjects may be treatment -naïve (TN) or have relapsed or been refractory 
to prior therapy.  Relapsed means a subject previousl y achieved a CR or VGPR/PR but after a 
period of 6 months or more showed progressive disease. Refractory means a subject experienced 
prior treatment failure or disease progression within 6 months of therapy initiation. Subjects with no 
prior therapy (TN) w ill comprise no more than 20% of the study analysis set in Cohort 1.  The st udy 
is composed of an initial Screening Phase (up to 35 days), a Treatment Phase, and a Follow -up 
Phase.  The study schema is presented in  Figure  1.  
Approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled on the study. All subjects enrolled on the study will 
have the MYD88  gene sequenced by a central laboratory using the baseline bone marro w.  
Approximately o ne hundred  and eighty -eight WM subjects (150  relapsed/refractory subjects  and 
approximately 38  treatment -naïve subjects)  who have the MYD88MUT mutation, which is 
characteristic of WM and present in approximately 90%  of cases, will be enrolled on to Cohort 1 
and randomized to one of two treatment arms (Cohort 1; zanubrutinib treatment [Arm A] or 
ibrutinib treatment [Arm B]) in a 1:1 ratio using CXCR4  mutational status ( CXCR4WHIM vs. 
CXCR4WT vs missing ) and number of pr ior lines of therapy for WM (0 vs. 1 -3 vs. >3 prior therapies) 
as stratification factors.  Subjects found to have MYD88WT by gene sequencing, which is estimated 
to be present in approximately 10% of enrolled subjects, will be enrolled to Cohort 2 and will 
receive zanubrutinib treatment on a third, non -randomized study arm (Arm C).  This non -
randomized arm is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of zanubrutinib in MYD88WT WM subjects, among 
whom suboptimal efficacy has been observed (i.e. , shorter median survival and lower MRR and 
CR/VGPR rates versus MYD88MUT) when treated with ibrutinib. In addition, those subjects whose 
MYD88  mutational status is missing or inconclusive  will be assigned to Cohort 2, Arm C.  Arm C 
will enroll approximately 22 subjects.  
The prima ry efficacy analysis will be conducted approximately 12 months after the last 
relapsed/refractory subject in Cohort 1 is randomized.  Tumor response will be assessed every cycle 
(every 4 weeks) for the first 48 weeks and then every 3  cycles thereafter by an independent review 
committee (IRC) according to an adaptation of the response criteria updated at the Sixth IWWM 
(Owen et al 2013 ; NCCN Guidelines, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Walden ström’s 
Macroglobulinemia 2015: v2 ). Serum IgM and M -protein levels will be measured at Screening, on 
Day 1 of every cycle for the first 48 weeks (12 cycles) then every 3  cycles thereafter. For subjects

Page 39 with evidence of extramedullary disease (lymphadenopa thy and/or splenomegaly) by computed 
tomography (CT) scan at baseline, assessment by CT scan will occur every 12 weeks ( starting from 
C4D1 ) during the first 48 weeks  (until C13D1) , then every 24 weeks until PD or complete 
resolution of extramedullary disea se.  A CT scan is also required at the safety follow -up visit.  Bone 
marrow will be assessed by aspirate and biopsy at Screening, after 12  cycles (C13D1),  at time of 
suspected CR , and as clinically indicated.  
Response assessments will occur in all subjects at the beginning of every cycle (every 4  weeks ) 
starting from C2D1  during the first 12 cycles ( 48 weeks ), and then every 3 cycles (every 12  weeks ) 
thereafter  e.g., C2D1, C3D1, etc . For those with extramedulla ry disease at baseline response 
assessments must occur in conjunction with CT scans until resolution of extramedullary disease.   
For response assessments that occur during cycles where a CT scan is not required then results from 
prior scans (up to 12 weeks /3 cycles during the first 48 weeks/12 cycles and up to 24 weeks/6 cycles 
thereafter) can be carried forward in those subjects with extramedullary disease at baseline.  Quality 
of life (QOL) will be measured every 12 weeks during the first 48 weeks, and th en every 24 weeks 
thereafter by the EORTC QLQ -C30 and  EQ-5D in MYD88MUT WM subjects  (Cohort 1) . 
All subjects will be followed for AEs for 30 additional days after the last dose of study drug.  All 
treatment -related AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) will be follow ed until resolution or stabilization. 
Efficacy evaluations will continue until documented PD for subjects who discontinued for reasons 
other than PD.   
Screening Phase: Screening evaluations will be performed within 35 days prior to the 
randomization, with the exception of a fresh bone marrow biopsy, which may be performed up to 
42 days prior to randomization, as long as no intervening therapy has been administered.  A fresh 
bone marrow aspirate is required for flow cytometry and the MYD88  and CXCR4  mutatio nal 
analyses at Screening.  If subject enrolls based on a bone marrow biopsy that was obtained within 
the 42 days of randomization, then a fresh bone marrow aspirate will still be required during the 
Screening period.  Subjects who agree to participate wil l sign the informed consent form prior to 
any screening evaluations.  Screening procedures are outlined in  Table 3.  Screening evaluations can 
be repeated within the screening period.  
Treatment Phase:   Subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 1 ( MYD88MUT) or Cohort 2 
(MYD88WT/missing) based on the muta tional status of the MYD88 gene.  Cohort 1 subjects will be 
randomized using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system by the status of stratification 
factors to receive the first dose of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib at Cycle 1 Day 1. Cohort 2 subjects 
(MYD88WT/missing) will be assigned by the IRT to receive zanubrutinib. Subjects randomized to Arm 
A will take 160 mg (80 mg x 2 capsules) of zanubrutinib PO BID .  Subjects randomized to Arm B 
will take 420 mg (140 mg x 3 capsules , or in other applicable do se forms ) of ibrutinib PO QD.  
Subjects assigned to Cohort 2 (Arm C) will take zanubrutinib 160 mg (80 mg x 2 capsules) PO BID.

Page 40 All subjects will continue to be treated and followed by the defined schedules in Table 3 for IgM, 
radiologic assessments and bone marrow, etc. until PD, unacceptable toxicity, deat h, withdrawal of 
consent, lost to follow -up, end of treatment duration or the study is terminated by the sponsor, 
whichever comes first.  A treatment cycle consists of 28 days.   
Follow -up Phase:  In all study arms, subjects will return approximately 30 da ys after the last dose 
of study drug for Safety Follow -up Visit(s) for the collection of  AEs and SAEs that may have 
occurred after the subject discontinued from the study.  For subjects that had extramedullary disease 
at baseline, a CT scan is also require d at the Safety Follow -up Visit.  All treatment -related SAEs 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  The investigator or his/her designee will also 
continue to collect information on new anticancer therapy given after the last dose of study dr ug.  
Efficacy evaluations will continue until documented PD.  If study drug is discontinued due to 
reasons other than PD, serum IgM and M -protein levels will continue to be followed every 12 
weeks while other efficacy evaluations will be followed as per in vestigator’s discretion. Efficacy 
assessments will be continued, as per protocol, until PD, withdrawal of consent, death, lost to 
follow -up, end of study or study termination by sponsor, whichever occurs first.  Follow -up will 
continue to occur even though  a subject may have started a new anticancer therapy after the last 
dose of study drug.  For full efficacy assessment schedules, please refer to Section 7.3 and Table 3.  
Subjects will be followed for survival and further anticancer therapy information after progression 
of disease via phone contact (with the subject’s guardian, if applicable) every 12 weeks  until study 
end.  
Post Study:  Subjects assigned to Arms A and C (zanubrutinib) who, in the opinio n of the 
investigator, continue to benefit from zanubrutinib or ibrutinib at study closure may continue 
treatment with zanubrutinib by enrolling on the zanubrutinib Long Term Extension Study. This 
study is a rollover study for subjects who wish to continue  receiving zanubrutinib.

Page 46 6 STUDY TREATMENT PHAS E AND FOLLOW -UP PHAS E  
6.1 Study Treatment and Dose Rationale  
Subjects randomized to Arm A or assigned to Arm C will receive zanubrutinib 160 mg (80 mg x 2 
white capsules) PO BID .  The dose of 320 mg total daily, given as div ided dose of 160 mg PO BID 
was selected as the recommended Phase 3 dose based on PK/PD data, sustained target occupancy, 
high rates of objective response in multiple histologies, and a favorable safety and tolerability 
profile.  Full occupancy of BTK in per ipheral blood mononuclear cells was achieved in all subjects 
starting at 40 mg zanubrutinib in the Phase 1/2 study, while occupancy in lymph node tissue was 
assessed only at 160 mg BID and 320  mg daily. At the 160 mg BID dose, full BTK occupancy was 
observ ed at trough, suggesting that sustained target occupancy could be achieved in disease -
originating tissues, thus more efficiently inhibiting BTK on a continuous basis, further preventing 
breakthrough signaling despite cycles of new BTK synthesis. Activity h as been observed across 
indications at all tested dose levels; thus, a minimum effective dose cannot be established at this 
time. Conversely, there is now extensive experience at the 160 mg BID dose; which shows a high 
level of activity without compromise of the tolerability profile as compared to lower doses of 
zanubrutinib.  
Subject s randomized to Arm B will rec eive ibrutinib 420 mg (140 mg x 3 capsules , or in other 
applicable dose forms ) PO QD as per prescribing information .  For example, as available, o ne 
420 mg tablet or 140  mg x 3 tablets.   
6.2 Study Treatment Preparation and Dispensation  
6.2.1 Packaging and Labeling  
Zanubrutinib capsules  will be provided in a child -resistant  high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle 
with induction seal and bottle label.  Commercial supplies of ibrutinib will be provided by the 
sponsor or via local procurement by the site. In the case of local procurement, the cost for provision 
of ibrutinib may be covered by a patient’s insurance or via reimbursement by the sponsor.  The 
contents of study treatment labels will be in accordance with all applicable local regulatory 
requirements.  
All study treatments  will be consistent  with those described in the Pharmacy Manual for this study . 
6.2.2 Handling and Storage  
Interactive Response Techno logy (IRT) system will be used for drug supply management. The 
study drug will be dispatched to a study center only after receipt of the required documents in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the sponsor’s procedures. The Investigator  
or pharmacist/designated personnel is responsible for maintaining the drug supply inventory and 
acknowledgment receipt of all study drug shipments. All study drug must be stored in a secure area

Page 47 with access limited to the investigator and authorized study  center personnel and under physical 
conditions that are consistent with study drug -specific requirements. The study drug must be kept at 
the condition as  specified on  the labels. Zanubrutinib bottles must be stored at room temperature 
15ºC to 30ºC .  For ibrutinib , each country should follow the storage condition instructions on the 
local drug label . Study drug must be dispensed or administered according to procedures described 
herein.  Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study drug, in accordan ce with all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  Only authorized study center personnel may supply or 
administer study drug.   
6.2.3 Compliance and Accountability  
Compliance will be assessed by the investigator and/or study personnel by reviewing the patient 
diary and information provided by the subject and/or guardian.  
The investigator and/or study personnel will keep accurate records of the quantities of study drug 
dispensed   All subjects enrolled in the study will be provided with patient diaries.  The subjec t is 
responsible for maintaining the patient diary.  The subject will record the number of capsules  (or in 
other dose forms as applicable, eg , tablets)  taken and if any were missed.  The site personnel 
responsible for drug accountability will record the quantity of drug dispensed and quantity of drug 
returned at periodic visits by the patient , or at any cycle visit if dosing non -compliance is suspected.   
The patient diaries and the pharmacist record of drug dispensation will be assessed by the 
Investigator/study personnel at each visit .  The investigator is responsible for study drug 
accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance.  In accordance w ith all applicable regulatory 
requirements, the investigator or designated study center personnel must maintain study drug 
accountability records throughout the course of the study. This person will document the amount of 
study drug received from the spons or, the amount supplied, and/or administered to and returned by 
subjects, if applicable.  
6.2.4 Disposal and Destruction  
At appropriate times during the conduct of the study or  after completion of the study, all unused 
zanubrutinib and ibrutinib will be inventori ed and packaged for return shipment by the hospital unit 
pharmacist or other designated study center personnel. The inventoried supplies can be destroyed on 
site or at the depot according to institutional policies, after receiving written sponsor approval.   
6.3 Subject Numbering and Treatment Assignment  
6.3.1 Subject Numbering and Screening  
Subjects will be identified by a subject number.  Each subject enrolled in this study will receive a 
unique subject number which will be assigned by the IRT system when the subje ct is screened in the 
study.  Subject number will be assigned in chronological order starting with the lowest number.  
Once a subject number has been assigned to a subject, it cannot be reassigned to any other subject.

Page 48 Repeating the screening procedures or tests within the original screening window is allowed if the 
subject did not previously meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  A new informed consent is not 
required and the subject shall maintain the same subject  number as originally assigned.  Within the 
screening window, a failed screening test can only be repeated  one time.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the patient meets the eligibility criteria for this 
study.  An eligibility packet which contains checklist of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and scanned 
copies of subject’s source data/documents will need to be provided to the Medical Monitor or 
designee for review during the screening period .  Medical Monitor or designee will confirm wheth er 
the subject is eligible for the study and confirmation will be sent to the site.  Subject can not be 
randomized until confirmation  from the M edical Monitor  or designee is received . 
6.3.2 Treatment Assignment  
After a subject has completed all screening procedu res and meets the eligibility criteria, study center 
personnel can enroll the subject. Based on MYD88  gene sequencing, the subject will be enrolled into 
either Cohort 1 ( MYD88MUT) or Cohort 2 ( MYD88WT). Those subjects with either missing or 
inconclusive MYD88 gene sequencing results will be assigned to Cohort 2 by default.  
Approximately 210  subjects will be enrolled into the study. Aproximately 188 subjects from 
Cohort  1 (MYD88MUT), including 150 subjects with relapsed refractory WM and approximately 
38 subjects with treatment -naïve WM, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using the IRT system to 
receive either zanubrutinib (Arm A) or ibrutinib (Arm B).  Stratification factors include CXCR4  
mutational status ( CXCR4WHIM vs. CXCR4WT vs missing ) and the number of prior lines of therapy 
for WM (0  vs. 1 -3 vs. >3).  A computer -generated randomization list including stratification factor 
values and treatment arm assignments will be produced, r eviewed and approved by an independent 
statistician. The randomization scheme and identification for each subject will be included in the 
final clinical study report (CSR) for this study. Subjects from Cohort 2 (approximately 22 subjects  
who are  MYD88WT/missing) will be assigned to Arm C using IRT to receive zanubrutinib capsules.  
Cohort 2 assignment and stratified randomization of Cohort 1 will be performed centrally by the 
IRT system on or immediately prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. The investigator or his/her de legate will call 
the IRT after confirming that the subject has fulfilled all the eligibility criteria. At randomization, 
the IRT will assign each subject a unique number. This unique patient number will be used to 
identify the patient in the electronic dat a capture (EDC) system and other data sources. The 
randomization list will be kept by the IRT vendor in their secure system and will not be accessible 
to the study center, responsible (or designee) monitors, project statisticians, or to the project team at  
BeiGene.   The time from randomization of the subject to the initiation of therapy should be no more 
than 5 days.

This is an open -label study.  The IRC will be blinded to study treatment.  The independent data 
monitoring committee (DMC) w ill not be blinded.  
6.4 Dosage and Administration  
Zanubrutinib or ibrutinib will be dispensed by the study center personnel to subjects at scheduled 
study visits to ensure adequate drug supply for administration at home throughout the Treatment 
Phase.  The inv estigator is to instruct the subject to take the study drug exactly as prescribed and at 
the same time each day of dosing.  Subjects will be requested to bring their unused medication 
including empty bottles to the center at each visit.  All dosages prescr ibed and dispensed to the 
subject and all dose changes including reason for dose changes during the study must be recorded 
on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Subjects randomized  or assigned  to zanubrutinib (Arms A and C) will be instruc ted to take 160 mg 
(80 mg x 2 capsules) orally with a glass of water twice a day  at approximately the same time each 
day. The time difference between two consecutive doses should be a minimum of 8  hours .  Subjects 
randomized to ibrutinib (Arm B) will be in structed to take 420 mg (140  mg x 3 capsules  or in other 
applicable dose forms ) orally with a glass of water, once a day at the approximately same time each 
day.   
Zanubrutinib (Arms A and C) or ibrutinib (Arm B) should be taken within 5 days from the time  of 
subject randomization.  
Subjects are not required to fast before or after the administration of either zanubrutinib or ibrutinib. 
Zanubrutinib or ibrutinib will be taken as prescribed from Cycle 1 Day 1 until PD, unacceptable 
toxicity or death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, or termination of the study by the 
sponsor, whichever comes first . Zanubrutinib capsules or ibrutinib in any applicable dose forms 
should not be opened, broken, or chewed at any time.  
In subjects undergoing pharma cokinetics (PK) blood sampling, study drug administration for 
subject s randomized  or assigned  to Arms A and C (zanubrutinib) will occur on the specified days at 
the center after the pre -dose blood sampling has occurred under the supervision of the investig ator 
or his/her designee.  The investigator or his/her designee must instruct the subject not to self -
administer the study drug prior to the office visit on those days.   
Subjects on Arms A and C (zanubrutinib) should be instructed that if a dose of the st udy drug is not 
taken at the scheduled time, they should skip the study drug if the time to next dose is 8 hours or 
less, and return to normal dosing with next dose.  If subjects vomit after taking the capsules, they 
should not repeat that dose.

Page 50 Subjects o n Arm B (ibrutinib) should be instructed that if a dose of the study drug is not taken at the 
scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to normal dosing 
the next day, or to take ibrutinib according to local prescribi ng guidelines.  The patient should not 
take extra capsules (or in other applicable dose forms) to make up the missed dose.  If subjects 
vomit after taking the capsules, they should not repeat that dose.  
Any dose of study drug in excess of that specified i n this protocol is considered to be an overdose.  
AEs associated with an overdose of study drug should  be recorded as an AE in the patient's chart 
and on the appropriate eCRF.  Any SAEs associated with an overdose  are required to be reported 
within 24 hour s of awareness via SAE reporting process as described in Section 9.2.2 .  There is no 
specific antidote for either zanubrutinib or ibrutinib. In an event of an overdose , subjects should be 
closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment.  
6.5 Dose Interruption and Modification  
The guidelines set forth in Table  1 should be followed for dose interruption or modification of 
zanubrutinib or ibrutinib for hematologic ( Section 6.5.1 ) or non -hematologic ( Section 6.5.2) 
toxicities based on investigator assessmen t of study drug relatedness.   
Study drug may be held for a maximum of 2 consecutive cycles  and restarted upon resolution of 
toxicity and per investigator discretion.   If, in the investigator’s opinion, it is in the subject’s best 
interest to restart treat ment after being held for more than 2 consecutive cycles , then written 
approval must be obtained from the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  or designee . More than one study 
drug hold is allowed.

6.5.1 Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity  for Zanubrutinib  
For zanubrutinib, d osing will be  held for hematologic toxicity suspected to be related to study drug 
treatment under any of the following conditions:

Page 51  Grade 4 neutropenia  (lasting >10 days despite the use of growth factors)   
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  (lasting >10 days)  
 Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia  
 Grade ≥  3 thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding  
For the first occurrence of hematologic toxicity, treatment may restart at full dose upon recovery of 
the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline.  If the same event reoccurs, subjects will restart at one dose 
level lower upon recovery of the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline.  A maximum of 2 dose 
reductions will be allowed.  
6.5.2 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematologic Toxicity for Zanubrut inib 
For non-hematological toxicities ≥ Grade 3 , other than hypertension  that is  adequately controlled 
with oral medication  or asymptomatic laboratory events (laboratory events indicating liver or renal 
dysfunction will not be considered asymptomatic labor atory events ) suspected to be related to study 
drug treatment, study drug will be held until recovery to ≤ Grade 1  or baseline , and then restarted at 
the original dose level .  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3, drug will be held until recovery to 
≤  Grade  1 or baseline and restarted at Dose L evel -1.  If the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3  at Dose 
Level  -1, drug will be held until recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline and restarted at Dose L evel -2.  If 
the event recurs at ≥ Grade 3 at Dose L evel -2, the subject will be discontinued from study 
treatment.  For subjects experiencing atrial fibrillation that is symptomatic and/or incompletely 
controlled:  after the atrial fibrillation is adequately controlled the study drug may be restarted at 
either the original dose or Dose Level -1, per discretion of the treating investigator.  
Zanubrutinib should be held for any ≥ Grade3 bleeding.  The drug should be permanently 
discontinued for any related ≥ 3 Grade hemorrhage with the exception of those where the 
underlying condition can be fully treated (e.g. gastric ulcer resulting in GI bleed) and the risk of a 
re-bleed is deemed acceptable.  For any intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of grade  or relationship 
to the study drug , the study drug should be held and the risk of rebleedin g should be assessed. If the 
risk of rebleeding is deemed unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of case s, the study 
drug should be permanently discontinued. Study drug should not be  resumed unless event 
resolution has been demonstrated by CT scan s or MRI, the risk of rebleeding is deemed low, and the 
patient does not have a need for concurrent anti -coagulation or anti -platelet medications  (except low 
dose aspirin or low molecular weight heparin used to prevent venous thromboembolism ).  Study 
drug resumption can only occur after a discussion and approval by the study medical monitor.

Page 53 6.5.4 Dose Modifications for Ibrutinib  
For dose modification of Ibrutinib, local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or 
Summary of Product Characteristics) should be followed throughout the study.  The major dose 
modifications for ibrutinib are descr ibed below:   
Ibrutinib should be interrupted for  any new onset or worsening  ≥ Grade 3 non -hematologic 
toxicities, ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with infection or fever, or Grade 4 hematologic toxicities.  Once 
the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1  or baseline, ibrutinib therapy may be re -
initiated at the starting dose.  If the toxicity recurs, drug dose  will be reduced  to Dose Level -1 (280 
mg orally QD).  A second dose reduction to Dose Level -2 (140 mg orally QD) may be considered 
as needed.  If these toxicities persist or recur following 2 dose reductions, the subject will be 
discontinued for study treatment.   
As with zanubrutinib, ibrutinib should be interrupted for any ≥ Grade3 bleeding.  The drug should 
be permanently discontinued for any related ≥ Grade 3 hemorrhage with the exception of those 
where the underly ing condition can be fully treated (e.g. gastric ulcer resulting in GI bleed) and the 
risk of a re -bleed is deemed acceptable.  For any intracranial hemorrhage, regardless of grade  or 
relationship to the study drug , the study drug should be held and the risk of rebleeding should be 
assessed. If the risk of rebleeding is deemed unacceptable, which is expected in the majority of 
cases, the study drug should be permanently discontinued. S tudy drug should not be  resumed unless 
event resolutio n has been demonstrated by CT scans or MRI, the risk of rebleeding is deemed low, 
and the patient does not have a need for concurrent anti -coagulation or anti -platelet medications  
(except low dose aspir in or low molecular weight heparin used to prevent venous 
thromboembolism ).  Study drug resumption can only occur after a discussion and approval by the 
study medical monitor.  
Use of ibrutinib in patients requiring other anticoagulants or medicinal product s that inhibit platelet 
function may increase the risk of bleeding, and particular care should be taken if anticoagulant 
therapy is used.   
As described in Section 6.6.2 , concomitant use of ibrutinib with strong and moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors should be avoided.  If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must 
be used, ibrutinib dose must be reduced or withheld temporarily (7 days o r less).  Ibrutinib dose 
must be reduced when administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.  Refer to the local 
prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or Summary of Product Characteristics) for specific 
instructions on dose modifications with these  inhibitors.  
For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A) and patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh Class B) , refer to the local prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information 
or Summary of Product Characteristics) for specific instructions on dose modifications  of ibrutinib .

Pugh Class C).  
6.6 Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies  
6.6.1 Permitted Medications  
All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF with indication 
and dates of administration.   
Subjects with high tumor burden sho uld be monitored closely and prophylactic measures, including 
allopurinol, may be instituted per institutional standards. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) has not 
been currently reported with zanubrutinib treatment, but has been reported rarely with ibrutinib.  
Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2 weeks or less) are permitted, if used to treat a 
concomitant (non -cancer) medical condition.  
Bisphosphonates can be coadministered with zanubrutinib.  
Patients with hematologic malignancies , particularly those having received prior lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy or having prolonged corticosteroid exposure,  are predisposed to opportunistic 
infections as a result of a number of disease  and treatment -related factors.   In patients with a high 
risk of opportunistic in fections, including pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), prophylaxis 
should be considered  as per institutional standards . 
6.6.2 Prohibited Medications  
Subjects should not receive other anticancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, or hormone other than for 
replacement) while on treatment in this study.  Other anticancer therapy, experimental therapy and 
radiotherapy are prohibited and should not be administer ed until PD (as per clinical practice 
standards at the study center), unmanageable toxicity, or no further clinical benefit occurs which 
requires permanent discontinuation of the study drug.  
Any anticancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy, corticosteroids give n with antineoplastic intent, 
experimental therapy, and radiotherapy are prohibited.  
Corticosteroid courses of limited duration (2  weeks or less) are permitted, if used to treat a 
concomitant (non -cancer) medical condition. The chronic use of corticostero ids at doses equivalent 
to adrenal replacement (2.5 mg to 7.5 mg prednisone) is prohibited without previous discussion with 
and approval from the Medical Monitor or designee.    
Use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered conco mitantly with 
ibrutinib.  Supplements such as fish oil or supplements and vitamin E preparations should be 
avoided.   
Use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort should be avoided.

Page 55 The primary metabolic pathway for ibrutinib involve the CYP3A isoform.  Administration of 
ibrutinib  with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers should be avoided  and consider using 
alternative agents . In addition, star fruit, pomegranate and grapefruit and their juices and Seville 
oranges (bitter oranges) should be avoided since they are known to affect the CYP3A pathway.   
Co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with ibrutinib  may lea d to increased 
ibrutinib exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity.  On the contrary, co -administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decreased ibrutinib  exposure and consequently a risk for lack of 
efficacy.  Therefore, concomitant use of ibrutinib with strong or moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers should be avoided.  
If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must be used, reduce the  ibrutinib 
dose or withhold treatment temporarily (for 7 days or less).  If a moderate CYP3 A4 inhibitor must 
be used, reduce ibrutinib treatment for the duration of the inhibitor use.  Refer to the local 
prescribing guidelines (Prescribing Information or Summary of Product Characteristics) for specific 
guidelines on dose modifications.   
Refer t o Appendix 3  for examples of strong and moderate CY3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  Please 
refer to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ for a more complete list.  
6.6.3 Medications to be Used with Caution  
Ibrutini b is metabolized to a minor extent by CYP2D6. Other than strong or moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitor and inducers, CYP 450 enzyme class drug is not restricted in ibrutinib prescribing 
information Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A (see Section 1.3.4 ), 
Administration of zanubrutinib with strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers (refer 
to Table 2 for a list of these medications) and grapefruit juice and Seville oranges should be used 
with caution as they may affect the metabolism of zanubrutinib.   If at all possible, patients are 
encou raged not to use strong/moderate CYP3A inhibitors and inducers and consider using 
alternative agents. If these agents will be used, follow the dose modification table in  Table 2.  The 
medical monitor should be consulted in these situations. Please refer to 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ for a more complete list.   
Based on in vitro data, zanubrutinib may have the potential to affect the human isoenzy mes 
CYP2C8 activity  (Section 1.3.2 ).  A clinical drug -drug interaction study (Study BGB -3111 -108) 
indicated that zanubrutinib does not inhibit CYP2C9 , however, is a mild inducer of CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C19 ( Section 1.3.4 ).  Narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 
(alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus 
and tacrolimus), and CYP2C19  (eg, S-mephenytoin) or CYP2C8 should be used with caution  
(Appendix 4 ), as zanubrutinib may decrease the plasma exposures of these drugs. Because 
ethinylestradiol (a key ingredient in a variety of combined oral contraceptives) is partly metabolized 

 
Zanubrutinib

Page 56 by CYP 3A4, patients using hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pills or devices) must use a 
barrier method of contraception (eg, condoms) as well (see Section 5.1).  
Repeated dosing of zanubrutinib increased exposure of digoxin (P -gP substrate) with a mean 
increase of 11% for AUC 0-t and 34% for C max .(Section 1.3.4 ). The coadmini stration of oral P -gp 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin) should be used with caution as zanubrutinib 
may increase their concentrations.  
6.6.4 Surgery and Procedures  
Susceptibility to bleeding has been observed with BTK inhibitors. Study tre atment for either 
zanubrutinib or ibrutinib should be held for 3 to 7 days pre - and post -surgery depending upon the 
type of surgery and the risk of bleeding, if a subject is to undergo surgery during Treatment Phase.  
6.7 End of Treatment  
All subjects, regardless of reason for discontinuation of study treatment will undergo an End of 
Treatment (EOT) visit within 7 days of stopping study drug.  A visit should be scheduled as soon as 
possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for t he EOT visit will be performed (see Table  
3).  The reason for  discontinuation from treatment will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Subjects may discontinue study drug for any one of the following reasons : 
 Disease progression  
 Adverse event(s)

 Investigator Decision   
 Other  
Subject s may voluntarily withdraw consent from treatment at any time.  Subject s will continue in to 
the Follow -up Phase if subject withdraws consent from the Treatment Phase.    
Subjects who are continuing to receive benefit from zanubrutinib after disease progressi on may 
remain in the study upon discussion with the Medical Monitor or designee.  These subjects that 
remain in the study will continue to follow the required assessments during the treatment phase.  
6.8 Follow -Up Phase  
6.8.1 Safety Follow -Up 
All subjects who discon tinue study drug and agree to a follow -up visit will have a safety follow -up 
visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug to collect AEs and SAEs that may have 
occurred after the subject discontinued from the study treatment.  All treatmen t-related SAEs will be

Page 57 followed until resolution or stabilization.  The investigator or his/her designee will also continue to 
collect information on new anticancer therapy given after the last dose of study drug.  For subjects 
that had extramedullary dise ase at baseline, a CT scan is also required at this visit.  A laboratory 
assessment is only required if the subject had an ongoing laboratory abnormality at the previous 
visit that the investigator considered to be related to study drug.  If the subject is  unable to return to 
the clinic and no laboratory assessment is necessary, the investigator or his/her designee will contact 
the subject or guardian to collect this information.  
6.8.2 Efficacy Follow -Up 
Subjects who are discontinued from study drug for any reas on other than PD will be followed every 
12 weeks (±14 days) until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, lost to follow -up, end 
of study or study termination by sponsor, whichever occurs first. Follow -up will continue to occur 
even though a sub ject may have started a new anticancer therapy after the last dose of study drug.  
IgM will continue to be followed every 12 weeks while other efficacy evaluations will be followed 
as per investigator’s discretion.  
For full efficacy assessment schedules, please refer to Section  7.3 and Table 3.  If the subject 
refuses to return for these visits or is unable to do so, every effort should be made to contact them or 
subject’s guardian by telephone to determine the subject’s disease status and survival.  
6.8.3 Survival Follow -Up 
Subjects will be followed for survival and further anticancer therapy information post progression 
via phone contact (with the subject’s guardian, if  applicable) every 12 weeks (±14 days) as per 
Section 4.1 until study end.  
6.9 End of Study  
Premature discontinuation from the study (including all fol low-up visits) will occur under the 
following circumstances:  
 Subject withdrew consent  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Death  
 Study termination by sponsor  
 Other  
Subject s may voluntarily withdraw consent from the study at any time.

Page 63 Windows:  Days allowed for reschedule of an entire visit due to logistic reasons (e.g., Public Holidays)  
Assessments scheduled on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) should be performed prior to the administration of the first dose of zanubrutin ib or ibrutinib. Screening blood and urine tests 
performed within 72 hours of the first administration of study drug do not need to  be repeated on C1D1. Please refer to Section 7.5 for the requirements of central or local analysis 
regarding blood laboratory assessments.  
1. The center must register the subject at screening.in the IRT system.  
2. Written informed consent form(s) must be signed by the subject before any study -specific procedures are performed.  
3. Screening evaluations will be performed and completed within 35 days of  the randomization . The results of all screening assessments and evaluations must be completed 
and reviewed by the investigator prior to C1D1.  The investigator will review and ensure that the subject meets all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion cr iteria and 
that MYD88  gene sequence has been assessed by central laboratory ( MYD88MUT, MYD88WT, or indeterminant).  
4. Demography includes gender, date of birth (or age), and race/ethnicity.  
5. Relevant medical history (i.e., previous diagnoses, diseases, or surg eries) not pertaining to the study indication, started before signing the informed consent, and 
considered relevant for the subject’s study eligibility, and current medical conditions.  
6. Diagnosis and extent of cancer, includes background information such as  history of disease and current disease status, staging (at time of diagnosis and at time of 
treatment), bone marrow involvement, sites of disease, prior anticancer therapies, and prior medications/significant non -drug therapies will be collected.  
7. The cen ter will utilize the IRT system for Cohort 1 to randomize subjects to Arm A or Arm B, or for Cohort 2 to assign subjects to A rm C in the trial upon completion of 
the all screening activities. Randomization of Cohort 1 can occur on or immediately prior to C 1D1. The time from randomization of the subject to the initiation of 
therapy should be no more than 5 days.  
8. Perform a 12 -lead ECG in triplicate at Screening for all subjects.  For subjects assigned to the zanubrutinib arm, perform a 12 -lead ECG in triplica te at pre -dose (within 
30 min prior to dose), 2 hours (± 30 min) post -dose on C1D1 and C2D1, and then continue to one 12 -lead ECG in triplicate every 4 cycles thereafter [at C6D1, C10D1, 
etc] until EOT (this can be performed at either pre -dose or post -dose).  For subjects assigned to the ibrutinib arm, perform a 12 -lead ECG in triplicate at C1D1 and C2D1 
and every 4 cycles thereafter (C6D1, C10D1 etc.) until EOT (this can be performed at either pre -dose or post -dose).  Subjects should be in the semi -recumbe nt or supine 
position.  
9. Perform ECHO/MUGA at the local lab at Screening, and when clinically indicated.  
10. Physical examination, vital signs (systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], pulse rate, and temperature ), weight, B symptoms exami nation, and 
review for arrhythmia signs/symptoms will be performed at the time points specified. In addition, baseline reason(s) for trea tment initiation must be reviewed and 
documented at each visit.  Symptoms that triggered treatment will be followed at,  during, and end of treatment until resolutions. A complete physical exam includes 
assessments of cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological systems as well as the examination of the abdomen, lymph nodes, spleen, skin, oropharynx and extremities. 
Clinic al suspicion of PD at any time will require a physical examination to be performed promptly, rather than waiting for the next  scheduled radiological assessment. B 
symptoms include unexplained weight loss >  10% over previous 6 months, fever ( ≥38°C), and/or drenching night sweats.  The review for arrhythmia signs/symptoms 
for all subjects will be conducted by the Investigators by providing a questionnaire to be completed by all subjects enrolled  in the study.  These questions will include 
signs and symptoms o f ventricular dysfunction (e.g., shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting).  The completed questionnaire will be provided back to the investigator 
for review and the Investigator will monitor the subjects at every clinic visit as part of the routine AE monitoring.  Data collected at each visit (Day 1 of each cycle 
during the first 48 weeks [until C13D1], then every 3 cycles [every 12 weeks], and at EOT and Safety Follow -up Visits) will be recorded in the eCRF.).   
11. Laboratory assessments include the follo wing:  
a. Screening clinical laboratory assessments performed within 72 hours of the first administration of study drug do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1. 
Screening quantitative serum immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, IgA), β2 -microglobulin and serum immunoelectrophoresis, with M -protein quantitation by 
densitometry (SPEP), performed within 14 days of the first administration of study drug do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1  Day 1.  
b. Complete Blood Count is required to be performed every cycle (every 4  weeks) during the Treatment Phase. Clinical Chemistry and urinalysis tests will follow 
the same schedule to be performed at Screening, on every cycle (every 4 weeks) for the first 48 weeks and every 3 cycles (eve ry 12 weeks) thereafter.  
c. Complete Blood Co unt includes red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils) and platelet count.  In the event of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil c ount [ANC] < 750/mm3) or

Page 64 thrombocytopenia (platelets of less than 50,000/mm3), these assessments will be conducted as frequently as the investigator feels it necessary and until toxicity 
resolves to ≤ Grade 2 or baseline (ANC ≥ 750/mm3). 
d. Clinical chemistry  includes sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphate, magnesi um, total 
bilirubin, total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogena se (LDH), alkaline phosphatase and 
uric acid.  In the event of ≥ Grade 3 clinical chemistry toxicity, these assessments will be conducted as frequently as the i nvestigator feels it necessary and until 
toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 2. The Screening β2 -microg lobulin, if performed within 14 days of the first administration of study drug, does not need to be 
repeated on C1D1.  
e. Coagulation profile will be performed at Screening only includes prothrombin time (PT), which will also be reported as intern ational norma lized ratio (INR).  
f. Quantitative serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) and β2 -microglobulin will be measured at Screening Visit, pre -dose on C1D1, on Day 1 of every cycle 
for the first 48 weeks  through and including Day 1 of Cycle 13, then on Day 1 of ever y 3 cycles starting on Cycle 16 (C16, C19, C22 etc.).  If a subject 
discontinues study drug due to reasons other than PD, the screening serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) and β2 -microglobulin will continue to be 
followed every 12 weeks. The Screening se rum immunoglobulin (i.e., ie, IgG, IgM, IgA) and β2 -microglobulin, if performed within 14 days of the first 
administration of study drug, do not need to be repeated on C1D1. Response assessments will be documented every cycle (starti ng from C2D1) for the fi rst 48 
weeks (12 cycles) then every 12 weeks (3 cycles) thereafter as indicated in Section 7.3. Assessments will be based on physical examination (i n cases in which 
organomegaly is present), laboratory evaluations, quantitative immunoglobulins and SPEP, radiologic assessment, and bone marr ow studies. For response 
assessments during cycles when a CT scan is not required, the results of the most recent CT scan(s) may be used for the response assessment only if the prior 
scan date is within 12 weeks of the response assessment date during the first 48 weeks of the study  and within 24 weeks of the response assessment date 
thereafter.  
g. SPEP and serum immunofi xation will be performed at Screening Visit, on Day 1 of every cycle for the first 48 weeks until Day 1 of Cycle 13 with the C1D1 
sample drawn at pre -dose, then every 3 cycles starting on Cycle 16 (C16, C19, C22 etc.) and thereafter. The Screening serum im munoelectrophoresis, with 
M-protein quantitation by densitometry (SPEP), performed within 14 days of the first administration of study drug do not need t o be repeated on C1D1.   
h. Cold agglutinins, cryoglobulin; anti -MAG (myelin associated glycoprotein) and serum viscosity will be performed at Screening. If there are abnormal findings 
for any of these laboratory assessments at Screening, follow -up is required every cycle (every 4 weeks) for the first 48 weeks, then every 3 cycles (every 12 
weeks) starting on Cycle 16 (C16, C19, C22, etc.) and at time of suspected CR. Once these labs have normalized, they should be repeated every 3 cycles and at 
time of suspected CR .  Of note, subjects that have cryoglobulinemia at Screening and confirmed by the central test sh ould be tested for the presence of 
cryoglobulins  at the local laboratory prior to C1D1 .  The C1D1 sample will serve  as the baseline. The test for cryoglobulinemia should always be performed 
under warm conditions.  The local laboratory should be used to test for cryoglobulinemia throughout the study to ensure that the same methodology is used 
throughout the study .  In addition, serum immunoglobulins should be retested using the residual cryoglobulin blood sample, which is to be collected  and 
processed und er warm  conditions at the local laboratory throughout the study. If serum immunoglobulins cannot be quantified, the serum 
immunoelectrophoresis sample will need to be re -collected, processed, and analyzed at the local laboratory under warm conditionsThese blood samples  
(cryoglobulin/serum IgM/SPEP/serum immunofixation)  are to be collected and processed under warm conditions . 
i. Iron, TIBC, and Ferritin will be performed at Screening only. If abnormal, iron supplementation should be provided per invest igator’s discretion prior to 
initiation of study treatment.  
j. Hepatitis B/C serologic markers and viral load will be tested at Screening only.  The hepatitis B testing includes hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsAb ), 
hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and hepatitis B s urface antigen ( HBsAg ) as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA by PCR if the subject is negative for 
HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status). The hepatitis C testing includes Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody as w ell as HCV RNA by PCR if 
the su bject is HCV antibody positive. Subjects with positive HBsAg and/or detectable level of HBV DNA or detectable level of HCV RN A are not eligible.  
Subjects negative for HBsAg, HBcAb positive, and HBV DNA negative must undergo monthly HBV DNA screening by PC R.  Subjects positive for HCV 
antibody but negative for HCV RNA must undergo monthly HCV RNA screening. Subjects with known HIV are excluded from the study . 
k. Urinalysis will be assessed using urine dipstick.  Urine microscopy will be performed if urine dips tick is abnormal (may be at investigator discretion except 
when urine protein ≥ 2+).  Urinalysis includes pH, glucose, protein, ketones, bilirubin, blood, and specific gravity.  If uri ne protein is ≥ 2+ by dipstick, a 
24-hour urine for total protein and a random urine for total protein and creatinine will be obtained and evaluated. All these tests will be performed in a local 
laboratory.

Page 65 l. All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at Screening within 7 days of 
randomization.  Laboratory -based highly sensitive pregnancy tests (urine or serum) will be performed on Cycle 1 Day 1, then on Day 28 of every cycle (wh ich 
can be performed on Day 1 of the following cycle).  Any female subject wh o is pregnant will not be eligible for the study.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests must 
be continued every 4 weeks (cycle) for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  At the last dose of study drug, a  serum pregnancy test is required 
(EOT).  If  a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  
12. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from select subjects randomized to Arms A and C (zanubrutinib) at the following tim e points:  pre -dose (within 30 min of 
dose), 2 hours (±30 min) post -dose and before subject discharge (3 -6 h post -dose) on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1. The time of study drug administration on the day 
prior to Cycle 2 Day 1 must be recorded on the eCRF.  Additionally, subjects who receive plasmap heresis (in Cycle 1 or Cycle 2 or beyond) will be evaluated for the 
effects of plasmapheresis on PK, including collection of additional PK samples immediately before the start of plasmapheresis , approximately an hour after the start of 
the procedure, and 3 0 min after the end of procedure (please also see Section 7.6.2 ).  Subjects are recommended to receive zanubrutinib in the clinic on day of 
plasmap heresis and plasmapheresis is to commence between 2 to 3 hours (T max) following zanubrutinib dosing.   
13. Zanubrutinib and ibrutinib will be dispensed by the study center personnel on scheduled study visits, approximately every 4 weeks (every cycle), to ensure adequate drug 
supply for each cycle throughout the Treatment Phase. Subjects randomized to Arm A, or assigned to Arm C will receive zanubru tinib at a dose of 160 mg (80 mg x 2 
white opaque capsules) PO BID. Subjects randomized to Arm B will receive ibrutinib at a dose of 420 mg ( e.g.140 mg x 3 capsules). Zanubrutinib or ibrutinib will be 
administered on a 28 -day cycle and will continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity or death, withdrawal of consent, or study terminated by sponsor f or any reason.  All  
subjects will have an end of treatment (EOT) visit within 7 days after stopping study drug.  All subjects will have a follow -up visit 30 days after the last dose of the study 
drug to collect AEs and SAEs that may have occurred after the subject discontinu ed from the study. The investigator or his/her designee will also continue to collect 
information on new anticancer therapy given after the last dose of study drug.  
14. Fat pad biopsy or biopsy of other relevant tissue (e.g., bone marrow) for subjects with a p revious biopsy positive for amyloidosis will be collected at the time of 
suspected CR by IgM response.  
15. Screening bone marrow biopsy samples is allowable within 42 days prior to randomization unless intervening therapy; however, a fresh bone aspirate must b e collected 
during the Screening period for the flow cytometry and the mutation analyses.  A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be perf ormed for all subjects at 48 weeks, 
(C13D1), at time of suspected CR, and as clinically indicated. An aliquot of bone m arrow specimen from Screening will be used for mutation analysis, including but not 
limited to MYD88  and CXCR4 .  Optional bone marrow aspiration will be collected in subjects with progressive disease for studying the resistance mechani sm.  With 
Medical Mon itor (or designee) approval, archival tissue from a prior bone marrow biopsy may be sent to the central lab for assessment of  mutation status; this will be 
allowed only if the fresh bone marrow biopsy/aspirate result in an indeterminate mutation result by the central lab.  
16. CT scans should encompass neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and include oral and/or intravenous contrast. An MRI of the head is re quired if clinically indicated.  An MRI 
may be used in place of CT for anatomic lesions which cannot be adequately  visualized by CT or for subjects who cannot undergo CT (e.g., due to inability to take 
contrast).  The CT portion of a PET/CT scan can also be performed.  In Germany, an MRI may be used in place of CT in all subj ects.  However, in all cases the same 
modal ity should be used throughout the study. All efforts will be made to ensure that the imaging equipment, contrast agent, and p erson (investigator or radiologist) 
performing the evaluation is kept constant throughout a subject’s course on study.  For subject s with evidence of extramedullary disease (lymphadenopathy and/or 
splenomegaly) by CT scan at baseline, assessment by CT or scan will occur every 12 weeks starting on Day 1 of Cycle 4 (C7, C1 0 and C13 etc.) during the first 48 
weeks, then every 24 weeks (C 19, C25 etc.) starting on Cycle 19 until PD, resolution of extramedullary disease, or EOT, whichever comes first.  Additional ly, for 
subjects with extramedullary disease at baseline, a CT scan is also required at the safety follow -up visit.  Unscheduled re sponse assessments may be performed based on 
physical examination or laboratory findings, at the discretion of the investigator.  CT scans for post treatment follow -up will be performed as per investigator’s discretion 
for subjects discontinued due to the reasons other than PD .  
17. In Cohort 1 (Arm A and Arm B only) quality of life (QOL) will be measured at C1D1 pre -dose (to avoid having subjects in Cohort 2 having to complete this at 
Screening) and every 3 cycles during the first 12 cycles then every 6 cycles  thereafter throughout the study using the EORTC QLQ -C30, and EQ -5D.  In addition, in 
Cohort 1, medical resource utilization will be recorded at each visit, including Screening and C1D1, including hospitalizatio ns, emergency room visits, transfusion 
suppor t, intravenous antibiotic use, and growth factor support.

be related to study drug.  Additionally, all treatment -related SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  For subjects that had extramedullary disease at 
baseline, a CT scan is also required at this visit.

 7.2 Subject Demographics/Other Baseline Characteristics  
Refer to Table 3 for all windows for assessments.   
7.2.1 Demography  
Demographic data will include gender, date of birth (or age), and race/ethnicity.  
7.2.2 Medical History  
Clinically significant medical history findings (i.e. , previous diagnoses, diseases or surgeries) not 
pertaining to the study indication, started before signing  of the informed consent, and considered 
relevant for the subject’s study eligibility will be collected and captured, including baseline severity 
if ongoing, in the eCRF. “Clinically significant ” is defined as any events, diagnoses or laboratory 
values requiring treatment, follow -up or the presence of signs or symptoms that require medical 
intervention. Concurrent medical signs and symptoms must be documented to establish baseline 
severities.  All co nditions ongoin g at the time of first study drug dose and all relevant conditions 
that may have resolved prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded.  
7.2.3 Other Baseline Characteristics  
Other background information including history of disease, inc luding the date of initial diagnosis 
and current disease status, staging at diagnosis and time of entry on this study, sites of disease, prior 
anticancer therapies, dates administered, responses and duration of response to these treatments will 
also be rec orded. Prior medications/significant non -drug therapies will also be collected.  
Not all patients with a diagnosis of WM need immediate therapy. Criteria for the initiation of 
therapy (Seventh IWWM) are presented in Table  4.  Subjects who do not fulfill the criteria in Table  
4 at Screening and in whom only l aboratory evidence may indicate a possible development of 
symptomatic disease (such as a minor decrease in hemoglobin level, but >10 g/dL or mild increases 
in IgM or mild increase of lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly without discomfort for the patient) 
are n ot eligible for the study.

Information will also be collected regarding childbearing potential and any other assessments that 
are done for the purpose of eligibility for inclusion into the study (physical examination, vital signs, 
complete blood count [CBC ] and blood chemistry, urin alysis, pregnancy test, ECG , and 
ECHO/MUGA ).  For further details on eligibility assessments, please see Table  3. 
7.3 Efficacy  
Response will be evaluated using an adaptation of the consensus panel criteria updated at the Sixth 
International  Workshop ( Owen et al 2013 , NCCN Guidance Insights, 2012 ). Response will be 
assessed both with and without considering extramedullary disease ( ie, IWWM -6 Including 
Extramedullary Disease  and IWWM -6 “IgM -based” ).  Please refer to Appendix 2  for categorical 
response definitions and guidelines for special clinical and laboratory circumstances including 
response assessment in the case of dose hold  or missing CT  scans .  Response categories include CR, 
VGPR, PR, Minor Response , SD, and PD. Additionally an IgM  flare can be assigned during periods 
of study drug withholding (see Appendix 2  and guidelines for specific clinical or laboratory 
circumstances #5).

Page 69 Response assessments  will be performed , for both  every 4 weeks  (every cycle)  starting from C2D1 
for the first 48 weeks  (12 cycles) then every 12 week s (every 3 cycles) thereafter as indi cated in 
Table 3, based on physical examination (in cases in  which organomegaly is present), laboratory 
evaluations , quantitative serum immunoglobulins and serum immunoelectrophoresis with M -protein 
quantitation by densitometry  (SPEP), radiologic assessment and bone marrow studies.  All response 
assessments should be performed at the required visits as described above and should be entered 
into the eCRF.  The data can be entered retrospectively in the eCRF according to the most recent 
version of the protocol . 
Radiological assessment  for extramedullary disease for those who have findings at baseline , by 
either IRC or investigator,  will occur every 12 weeks for the first 48 weeks and then every 24 weeks 
thereafter until CT scan has normalized.  Additionally, for subjects who had extramed ullary disease 
at baseline, a CT scan is also required at the safety follow -up visit . For response assessments that 
occur during cycles where a CT scan is not required then results from prior scans ( as long as within 
up to 12 weeks during the first 48 week s and up to 24 weeks thereafter) can be carried forward in 
those subjects with extramedullary disease at baseline . 
Change in serum IgM level from baseline will be based upon the IgM value from the central  
quantitative serum immunoglobulin assay, unless for  assay limitations this is not possible, in which 
case the central M-protein level by densitometry  (SPEP) will be used.    
The serum IgM value (quantitative serum immunoglobulin/SPEP methodology) at C1D1 will serve 
as the baseline (last value prior to drug administration) for all assessments throughout the study 
except for patients who have undergone plasmapheresis . For patients who have undergone 
plasmapheresis, the pre -plasmapheresis serum IgM value (if available at screening) should be used. 
In the case o f multiple prior consecutive plasmapheresis procedures during screening , the highest 
predose value (least confounded by plasmapheresis) should be used as the baseline.   
For patients with cryoglobulinemia, blood sample s (cryoglobulins/serum  IgM/SPEP/serum 
immunofixation) should be collected and processed under warm conditions for baseline assessment 
and throughout the study .   
Response assessments should  be performed using results based on the same methodology  in the 
same laboratory i.e., central or local throughout the study. Of note, all local labs, e.g. local serum 
IgM/SPEP or serum immunofixation or cryoglobulin  results should be reported in the eCRF.    
Per IWWM criteria, PD by increase in IgM requires a confirmatory blood draw wh ich should be 
obtained at next scheduled IgM draw, or at a minimum of 4 weeks from the previous draw.  In 
addition, PD requires a total increase of IgM of at least 500 mg/dL from lowest nadir. Subjects 
should remain on study drug until the central laborato ry IgM testing confirms PD.  Transformation 
of WM to large cell lymphoma (Richter’s transformation) is considered as progressive disease and 
should not be recorded in the eCRF as an adverse event.

Page 70 For patients with new disease symptoms, every effort shoul d be made to obtain and document 
objective evidence of disease progression according to the disease -specific response criteria 
Appendix 2 .  Of note, progressive disease cannot be determined solely by the presence  of 
B symptoms.  Disease progression due to new symptomatic disease must be accompanied by 
objective evidence (e.g. , imaging, laboratory value, biopsy , or bone marrow histology) consistent 
with the disease and associated response criteria for progression.   For example, in the absence of 
IgM increase or other objective measures of disease progression, new B  symptoms alone should not 
be the sole reason to discontinue a patient from study treatment.  
If there is a rapid rise in serum IgM level or an increase i n known extramedullary disease leading to 
an “apparent” response of PD (e.g. an increase in serum IgM level of at least 25% and 500 mg/dL 
from lowest nadir) after the study drug has been held for at least 7 consecutive days, an assessment 
response of IgM f lare will be assigned instead of PD. The period to which this is applicable begins 
on the day of the first missed dose and ends when the subject has IgM levels or extramedullary 
disease that no longer qualify as “apparent” PD (e.g., there is a drop  in seru m IgM level  to below  
25% and 500 mg/dL from lowest nadir) or the subject has a confirmed response of PD whichever 
comes first .  During and following periods of study drug withholding, response assessments that 
would otherwise qualify as PD will initially b e recorded as IgM Flare and NOT be considered as 
progressive disease.  See Appendix 2 for all conditions and timing that must be met when assigning 
response for IgM Flare.   Subjects may undergo plasmapheresis, when clinically indicated, during 
the first two cycles of study treatment.  IgM r esponse and nadir  determination should be at least  
4 weeks following the last plasmapheresis procedure .  Subjects requiring plasmapheresis  after 
Cycle  2 will be adjudged to have progressive disease.  
At Screening, a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, and CT scanning of the neck, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis (including oral and/or intravenous contrast ) will be conducted.  If a b one marrow biopsy was 
performed within 42 days prior to randomization , the specimen  will be  sent for  analysis  
as described in Section 7.7.  If a bone marrow biop sy is collected within 42 days of randomization, a 
fresh bone marrow aspirate must still be collected during the Screening period for flow cytometry 
and MYD88  and CXCR4  mutational analyses. With Medical Monitor (or designee) approval, 
archival tissue from a prior bone marrow biopsy may be sent to the central lab for assessment of 
mutation status; this will be allowed only if the fresh bone marrow biopsy/aspirate result in an 
indeterminate mutation result by the central lab. Quantitative serum immunoglobulin s (IgM, IgG, 
IgA), serum immunoelectrophoresis with quantification of M -protein by densitometry  and serum 
immunofixation , and β2 -microglobulin will be drawn at Screening and followed as primary 
endpoints through the study. Complete blood count (CBC) will b e drawn at Screening and followed 
every cycle.  Cold agglutinins, cryoglobulins, anti -MAG (myelin associated glycoprotein), and 
serum viscosity will be drawn at Screening and followed if positive as markers of associated 
symptoms.

Page 71 Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be obtained at Screening as described above  and at 48 weeks  
(C13D1) .  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will also be repeated to confirm a CR if the subject has 
absence of M -protein and normal serum IgM level during the course of study treatment.   
For subjects with evidence of extramedullary disease (lymphadenopathy and/or spleno megaly) by 
CT scan at Screening/baseline, the CT scan will be repe ated every 12 weeks during the first 
48 weeks beginning on C4D1 and every 24 weeks thereafter until PD or resolution of 
extramedullary disease , as well as at the safety follow -up visit . Please refer to Section 7.3.2 . 
Quantitative serum immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgA) and serum immunoelectrophoresis with 
quantification of M -protein by densitometry  and serum immunofixation  will be performed on Day1 
of every cycle for first 48 weeks with the Cycle 1 Day1 sample drawn at pre -dose, then every 3 
cycles and thereafter. Please refer to Section 7.5.3  and Section 7.5.4 . 
In the event that cold agglutinins, cryoglobulin, anti -MAG (myelin associated glycoprotein), or 
serum viscosity are found to be abno rmal at Screening, then the abnormal laboratory test will be 
repeated every cycle for the first 48 weeks  (12 cycles) , then every 3 cycles, and at time of suspected 
CR.  Once these labs have normalized, they should be repeated every 3 cycles and at the time of a 
suspected CR . For subjects with previous biopsy positive for amyloidosis, a fat pad biopsy or biopsy 
of other relevant tissue will be collected at the time of suspected CR  by IgM response.  
7.3.1 Physical Examination  
Enlargement of  lymph nodes  and spleen i s included in the physical examination at each visit  for 
efficacy . Body systems (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory etc.) should be evaluated at each visit when 
a physical examination is performed and any abnormalities recorded. See Section 7.4.2  for details of 
physical examination.  
7.3.2 Radiological Tumor Assessment  
Baseline radiological tumor assessment should be performed within 35 days of the randomization.  
All subjects must have baseline CT scan with contrast of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and any 
other disease sites. An MRI of the head is required if clinically indicated.  The CT portion of a 
PET/CT scan can also be performed as long as the same modali ty is used throughout the study.  
For subjects with evidence of extramedullary disease (lymphadenopathy [note lymph nodes must 
measure >15mm in longest diameter (LDi)] and/or spleno megaly  [measured craniocaudally 
> 130mm] ) by CT scan at baseline, the CT sca n will be repeated every 12 weeks during the first 
48 weeks beginning on C4D1 and every 24 weeks thereafter until documented PD or complete 
resolution of extramedullary disease during the T reatment Phase by investigator according to 
consensus panel criteri a updated at the Sixth International Workshop ( Owen et al 2013  and 
Appendix 2 ; NCCN Guidance Insights, 2012 ).  CT scans for post treatment efficacy follow -up will 
be performed for subjects discontinued due to the reasons other than PD  at the follow -up visit .  A

Page 72 CT scan will also be repeated to confirm a CR if the subject has absence of serum monoclonal IgM 
protein and normal serum IgM level and had extramed ullary disease at baseline and at the discretion 
of the investigator.   At least one post-baseline CT scan  is also required in situations where the 
baseline extramedullary disease assessment was determined to be absent by investigator and present 
by the IRC.   The first follow -up CT scan  for such patient should be perform ed within 30 days upon 
notification , ie, by the next clinic visit  regardless of the protocol defined CT scan schedule and/or 
achievement of CR . Afterwards, follow -up CT scans should  be obt ained per the protocol schedule 
(with a minimum of 12 weeks between scans , at investigator’s discretion ). 
All lesions found by imaging will be recorded at baseline as target (up to 10 lesions in 
extramedullary CRF) or non -target.  Measureable lesions will be recorded in the eCRF at each 
imaging timepoint in 2 perpendicular dimensions: LDi and short diameter (SDi).  SDi is defined as 
the longest diameter perpendicular to LDi.  
Target lesions may become “too small to measure”  (TSTM) .  While on study, all lesio ns (nodal and 
extra nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2  mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which 
are recorded as target lesions at baseline become  so faint on a CT scan that the radiologist may not 
feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being “too small to measure”.  
When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF.  If it is the opinion of the 
radio logist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0  mm.  If 
the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 
5 mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small 
to measure, a d efault value of 5  mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well).    
An MRI may be used in place of CT only for anatomic lesions which cannot be adequately 
visualized by CT, or for subjects who cannot undergo CT.   The CT portion of a PET/CT scan can 
also be used.  In Germany, an MRI may be used in place of CT in all subjects.  However, in all 
cases the same modality should be used throughout the study.  All efforts will be made to ensure that 
the imaging equipment, contrast agent, and person (investigat or or radiologist) performing the 
evaluation is kept constant throughout a subject’s course on study.   
All CT scans, and MRIs obtained during the study will be collected and reviewed by a central 
imaging vendor identified to this trial. De -identified copies of all scans and radiology reports 
(including those from screening) must be provided to the sponsor or designee (e .g., central imaging 
vendor).

Page 73 7.3.3 Bone Marrow Assessment  
A unilateral bone marrow biopsy at Screening (within 42 days of the randomization,  as long as no 
intervening therapy is administered)  and a fresh bone marrow aspirate taken during Screening,  
followed by  aspirate and biopsy  at 48 weeks, at time of suspected CR, and as clinically indicated  
will be used to assess for bone marrow involvemen t by WM . Bone marrow for post treatment 
efficacy follow -up will be performed as per investigator’s discretion for subjects discontinued due 
to the reasons other than PD.    
All pathology samples will undergo central pathology review . 
An aliquot of bone marr ow specimen from Screening will be used for the mutation analysis, 
including but not limited to MYD88  and CXCR4  gene sequencing.  
Optional bone marrow aspiration will be collected in subjects with progressive disease for studying 
the resistance mechanism.  
7.3.4 Biopsy for Amyloidosis  
For subjects with a known history of amyloidosis  (based on screening bone marrow studies and 
indication of treatment initiation [ Table  4]), fat pad biopsy or biopsy of other relevant tissue (e .g., 
bone marrow) will be collected at the time of suspected CR  by IgM response.  
7.3.5 Biopsy for Suspected Disease Transformation  
Biopsy confirmation is necessary for  subjects suspected to have dis ease transformation.  
7.4 Safety  
Safety assessments should be performed at all site visits throughout the study. Please see Table 3 for 
the schedule of the assessments and windows for assessments.   
7.4.1 Adverse Events  
After informed consent has been signed bu t prior to the administration of the study drug, only SAEs 
should be reported.  All AEs and SAEs, regardless of the relationship to the study drug, will be 
collected from the time of first dose of study drug.  Secondary malignancies will be recorded as AEs  
and should be reported to the sponsor. Transformation of WM to large cell lymphoma (Richter’s 
transformation) is considered as progressive disease and should not be recorded in the eCRF as an 
adverse event.  
All subjects will be followed for safety 30 add itional days after the last dose of study drug.  All 
treatment -related AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization. The accepted 
regulatory definition for an AE is provided in Section 9.1.  Important additional requirement for 
reporting SAEs are explained in Section 9.2.

Page 74 In addition, arrhythmia signs/symptoms will be reviewed at every cycle.  This will involve the 
investigators asking subjects for signs and symptoms of ventricular dysfunction via a brief 
questionnaire, as part of the routine AE monitoring for each cycle.  
7.4.2 Physical Examination, Vital Signs, Height, Weight, Assessment of B symptoms, 
Re-evaluation of Baseline Reason(s) for Initiation of Therapy, and Review for 
Arrhythmia Signs/Symptoms  
Physical examination, vital signs (sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, and b ody temperature), weight, 
B symptoms examination  will be performed at the timepoints specified (See Table 3).  Additionally, 
a brief questionnaire to review signs and symptoms of ventricular arrhyt hmia (e.g., shortness of 
breath, d izziness, or fainting)  will be completed by all patients for both cohorts and the data will be 
recorded in the eCRF.  These signs and symptoms will be monitored throughout the study at every 
visit.   Height (cm) is determined at Screening only.  B symptoms includes unexplained weight loss 
> 10% over previous 6  months, fever ( ≥ 38°C), and/or drenching night sweats.   
Body systems (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory etc.) should be evaluated at each visit when a 
physical examination is performed and any abnormali ties recorded. A complete physical exam 
includes assessments of cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological systems as well as the 
examination of the abdomen, lymph nodes, spleen, skin, oropharynx and extremities.   As part of the 
tumor assessment, physical examination should also include the evaluation of the presence and 
degree of enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly.   For a lymph node to be considered enlarged , 
the longest diameter should measure >  1.5 cm. Spleen should be measured craniocaudal.  
In addition, baseline reason(s) for treatment initiation must be reviewed and documented at each 
visit (Day 1 of each cycle  during the first 48 weeks [until C13D1), then every 3 cycles (every 
12 weeks), and at EOT and Safety Follow -up Visits ).  Symptoms th at triggered treatment will be 
followed until resolution (s) through the  end of treatment .  
7.4.3 ECOG Performance Status  
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status will be assessed at the Screening Visit, 
each visit during study treatment, the End of Treatment Visit , and the S afety Follow -up Visit.  
Appendix 5  will be used to assess performance status.  
7.4.4 Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed locally in triplicate at Screening  for all subjects. Subjects should 
be in the semi -recumbent or supine position.    
For subjects assigned to the zanubrutinib arm, a 12 -lead ECG in triplicate will be performed at  pre-
dose (within 30 min prior to  dose) and at 2 hours (± 30 min) post -dose on C1D1  and C2D1 , and one 
12-lead ECG in triplicate performed at every 4 cycles thereafter (at C6D1, C10D1, etc.) until EOT.  
Where not specified, triplicate ECGs can be performed at either pre -dose or post -dose.

performed at either pre -dose or post -dose.  
7.4.5 ECHO/MUGA  
An ECHO/MUGA will be performed at the local lab at Screening, and when c linically indicated.  
7.4.6 Quality of Life Assessment and Medical Resource Utilization  
Subject in Cohort 1 ( MYD88MUT) must have quality of life assessed by EORTC QLQ -C30 and 
EQ-5D.  Assessments will occur on Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre -dose) and every 12 weeks during the first 
48 weeks, and then every 24 weeks thereafter.  In addition, in Cohort 1, m edical resource utilization, 
including the number of hospitalizations, length of hospital stay, and supportive care  (e.g., 
transfusions, growth factor support, intravenous antibiotics)  will be evaluated  every cycle, including 
at Screening and Cycle 1 Day 1.  
7.5 Laboratory Evaluations  
Samples for CBC, Chemistry, and coagulation profiles will be drawn and analyzed locally. All other 
required blood samples (See Table 3) will be sent to central laboratory for analysis throughout the 
study.  Windows for assessments are outlined in Table 3.   
A detailed description of the procedures for sample collection, handling, storage, and shipment of 
the laboratory samples and all material such as test tubes and labels is provided in the Study 
Procedure Manual or in the Central Laboratory Manual.   
Clinica l chemistry, CBC, coagulation, urinalysis, serum immunoglobulin, and β2 -microglobulin, 
will be performed at the time points specified in Table 3 and may also be performed as medically 
necessary.  On Cycle 1 Day 1, laboratory assessments should be done before the study drug 
administration.  Screening blood and urine  tests performed within 72 hours of the first study drug 
administration do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
7.5.1 Hematology Studies  
CBC with differential is required to be performed every cycle during the Treatment Phase. CBC 
include hemoglobin, hema tocrit, platelet count, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) 
count with differential including neutrophils (including bands), lymphocytes, monocytes, 
eosinophils, and basophils. In the event of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <  750/mm3) or 
thrombocytopenia (platelets of less than 50,000/mm3), these assessments will be conducted as 
frequently as the investigator feels it necessary until toxicity resolves to ≤  Grade  2 or baseline (ANC 
≥ 750/mm3).

Clinical chemistry incl udes albumin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, bicarbonate, blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN)  or urea , calcium, chloride, creatinine, LDH, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, 
sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, and uric acid.  In the event of ≥ Grade 3 clinical ch emistry 
toxicity, these assessments will be conducted as frequently as the investigator feels it necessary until 
toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 2.  
7.5.3 Quantitative Serum Immunoglobulins and β2 -microglobulin  
Quantitative serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) and β2 -microglobulin will be measured at the 
Screening Visit, on Day 1 of every cycle for the first 48 weeks with Cycle 1 Day 1 sample drawn at 
pre-dose, then every 3 cycles during the T reatment Phase. If subjects discontinue study drug due to 
reasons other than PD, serum immunoglobulin (i.e. , IgG, IgM, IgA) will continue to be followed 
every 12 weeks. If serum immunoglobulin and β2 -microglobulin performed at the screening are 
performed within 14 days of th e first administration of study drug, they do not need to be repeated 
on Cycle 1 Day 1. It is recommended that sequential response assessments for individual subjects 
are performed in the same laboratory using the same methodology.  
7.5.4 Serum Immunoelectrophor esis with M -Protein Quantitation by Densitometry 
(SPEP) and Serum Immunofixation  
Serum immunoelectrophoresis with M -protein quantitation by densitometry (SPEP) and serum 
immunofixation will be performed at Screening, on Day 1 of every cycle for the first 4 8 weeks with 
Cycle 1 Day 1 sample drawn at pre -dose, then every 3 cycles during the T reatment Phase. If 
subjects discontinue study drug due to reasons other than PD, serum immunoelectrophoresis will 
continue to be followed every 12 weeks. If serum immunoel ectrophoresis at the Screening is 
performed within 14 days of the first administration of study drug, it does not need to be repeated on 
Cycle 1 Day 1.   Additionally, see note below in Section 7.5.5  regarding retesting serum 
immunoglobulins in subjects with cryoglobulinemia.  
7.5.5 Cold Agglutinins, Cryoglobulin, Anti -MAG, Serum Viscosity  
Cold agglutinins, cryoglobulin, anti -MAG (myelin associated glycoprote in), serum viscosity blood 
tests will be performed at Screening.   If there are abnormal findings for any of these laboratory 
assessments at Screening, follow -up is required every cycle for the first 48 weeks, then every 3 
cycles starting C13D1 and at time of suspected CR.  
Subject s who have cryoglobulinemia at Screening and are confirmed by the central test, should be 
tested for the presence of cryoglobulins  at the local laboratory prior to C1D1 .  The C1D1 sample 
will serve as the baseline.  Repeat testing is required at every visit at the local lab oratory  or central 
laboratory  until cryoglobulin testing has normalized  (negative result) , and then be assessed every 3 
cycles and at time of suspected CR .  When samples are collected and tested at local lab oratorie s, the 
local results should be recorded in the eCRF.  In addition, the s erum immunoglobulins /SPEP and 

Zanubrutinib

26 August 2019  
 
                          
Page 77 serum immunofixation assays  should also be retested prior to C1D1,  using the residual cryoglobulin 
blood sample  if available, at the local laborat ory, which should be collected and processed similarly 
to the cryoglobulins under warm conditions.  Only when serum immunoglobulins cannot be  
quantified, the serum immunoelectrophoresis sample will need to be re -collected, processed, and  
analy zed at the lo cal laboratory under warm conditions. If neither the local laboratory baseline 
serum IgM  nor SPEP M -protein  was available, then the central laboratory serum IgM should be 
collected in addition and may be used for response assessment throughout the study. I f central 
serum IgM has shown to be reliable despite the cryoglobinemia, the local laboratory serum IgM 
may no longer be required.   
The samples (cryoglobulin and serum immunoglobulins) should always be collected and processed 
under warm conditions at the local  or central  laboratory throughout the study to ensure that the same 
methodology is used throughout the study.  The results of all local testing should be entered into the 
EDC once they are available.  If it is not possible  to perform the cryoglobulin or serum 
immunoglobulin testing at the local lab oratory , the Clinical Research Associate or BeiGene should 
be contacted as soon as possible.   
7.5.6 Iron, Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), and Ferritin Tests  
Iron, TIBC and ferritin tests will be performed at Screening only. If abnormal, iron supplementation 
should be provided per investigator’s discretion prior to initiation of study treatment.  
7.5.7 Coagulation  
The coagulation profile includes prothrombin time (PT), which will also be reported as international 
norm alized ratio (INR).  The coagulation profile will be performed at Screening only.   
7.5.8 Urinalysis with Dipstick  
Urinalysis will be assessed using urine dipstick.  Urine microscopy will be performed if urine 
dipstick is abnormal  (may be at investigator discret ion except when urine protein  ≥ 2+). Urinalysis 
includes pH, glucose, protein, ketones, bilirubin, blood, and specific gravity. If urine protein is ≥ 2+ 
by dipstick, a 24 -hour urine for total protein and a random urine for total protein and creatinine will  
be obtained and evaluated. All these tests will be performed in local laboratory.  
7.5.9 Pregnancy Test  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening within 7 days of randomization and end of 
treatment in women of childbearing potential.  Any female subj ect who is pregnant will not be 
eligible for the study.  Laboratory -based highly sensitive  pregnancy tests  (urine or serum)  will be 
performed on Cycle 1 Day 1 , and then on Day 28 of every cycle (which can be performed on Day 1 
of the following cycle) .  Pregnancy tests must be continued every 4 weeks (cycle) for at least 90 
days after the last dose of study drug.  At the last dose of study drug, a serum pregnancy test is 
required (for practicality, it will be performed at End of Treatment Visit).  If a urine  pregnancy test

Page 78 is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  A subject who has a positive pregnancy 
test result at any time after the study drug administration will be immediately withdrawn from 
participation in the study.  
7.5.10  HIV and Hepatit is B/C Testing  
Hepatitis B/C serologic markers and/or viral load will be tested at Screening.  The hepatitis B 
testing includes hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsA b), hepatitis B core antibody ( HBcAb), and 
hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsA g) as well as hepa titis B virus (HBV) DNA by polymerase chain 
reaction ( PCR ) if the subject is negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb 
status). The hepatitis C testing includes Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody as well as HCV RNA by 
PCR if the subject is H CV antibody positive.  Subjects with positive HBsAg and/or detectable level 
of HBV DNA or detectable level of HCV RNA are not eligible.  Subjects HBsAg negative, HBcAb 
positive and HBV DNA negative must undergo monthly HBV DNA Screening PCR.  If, during 
monthly monitoring of HBV DNA by PCR, the value is between 20 IU/mL and 100 IU/mL then the 
HBV DNA level should be rechecked within 2 weeks.  Study drug should be held and anti -viral 
therapy initiated if the repeat level is between 20 IU/mL and 100 IU/mL.  If the HBV DNA by PCR 
is 100 IU/mL or higher then study drug should be stopped and anti -viral therapy initiated.   Subjects 
positive for HCV antibody but negative for HCV RNA must undergo monthly HCV RNA 
Screening.   Subjects with known HIV are excluded from the study.  Subjects with detected HCV 
RNA should stop study drug and anti -viral therapy should be initiated.  The Medical Monitor or 
designee should be informed of any suspected hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactiv ation.  
Table 5 below, shows how the results for HBV, and HBV testing at Screening relate to inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.

7.6 Pharmacokinetics  
Blood will be collected to characterize the PK of zanubrutinib and/or its major metabolites from all 
subjects on Arms A and C. Close monitoring of zanubrutinib drug co ncentrations may be needed by 
taking additional unscheduled PK samples in the event of suspected drug -drug interactions (eg, 
when a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer must be used for control of infection).  
7.6.1 Pharmacokinetic Blood Samples  
Pharmacokinetic sampl es will be collected from subjects randomized to Arms A and C 
(zanubrutinib) only at the following time points: pre -dose (within 30 min prior to dose), 2 hours 
(± 30 min) post -dose and before subject discharge (3 -6 h post -dose) on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2  
Day 1. The time of study drug administration on the day prior to Cycle 2 Day 1 must be recorded on 
the eCRF.  
Blood samples (2 mL) for PK analysis will be collected via the intravenous cannula pre -dose and at 
the time points specified in  Table 3.  The actual time each sample was collected will be captured to 
the nearest minute in the eCRF and recorded in the database.  
Details concerning handling of the PK plasma samples, including la beling and shipping instructions 
will be provided in the Study Manual.   
Samples will be shipped to the central laboratory where they will be stored and batch shipped to 
designated bioanalytical lab for quantification of plasma zanubrutinib concentrations using a 
validated method.

Page 80 7.6.2 Effects of Plasmapheresis on PK of Zanubrutinib  
For subjects receiving plasmapheresis (in Cycle 1 or Cycle 2 or beyond), below are additional 
procedures to follow:  
 Subjects are recommended to come in the clinic to receive zanubrutinib dosing on the day of 
plasmapheresis.  To properly assess the impact of plasmapheresis on zanubrutinib PK, 
plasmapheresis session is to commence between 2 to 3 hours (T max) following zanubrutinib 
dosing.  
 Zanubrutinib dosing time and the start and end time of each plasmapheresis session must be 
recorded in the database.  
 For subjects receiving plasmapheresis, additional PK samples (in addition to those noted in 
Section 7.6.1 ) will be collected at the following time points: immediately before the start of 
plasmapheresis, approximately an hour after the start of the procedure, and 30 min after the 
end of the procedure.  PK collection time wil l be recorded in the database.  
 For each plasmapheresis session, the volume of removed plasma will be measured and 
recorded in eCRF and an aliquot will be stored at a temperature of -20ºC or lower until 
analysis.  
 Zanubrutinib concentrations in both circulat ing and removed plasma will be measured using 
a validated method.

Page 81 Additionally, the Sponsor would like to retain/archive/save any residual or extra samples that  are 
not analyzed in Study BGB -3111 -302 for additional exploratory  studies and analyses that 
may be conducted at a later time.  The samples will be used only for studies related to WM.  
The biological samples will be labeled with a unique code an d be stored under BeiGene’s control 
for up to 20 years , at which point they will be destroyed . During and after the study, the subject has 
the right to have any remaining sample material destroyed by the Sponsor or returned to the 
subject’s  Study Doctor at  any time.  Any  generated from the additional research 
during the study or after the study is completed will belong to the Sponsor and will not become part 
of the patient’s medical record.  
Disclosure of any data obtained from the optional s tudies will be restricted.  Site monitors, auditors, 
ethics committees and/or regulatory authorities may also access the patient data in connection with 
such additional research. Patient data will be retained as long as it is useful for such purposes. If t he 
results of such studies are published or presented in a meeting, the patient’s identity will not be 
disclosed.  
7.8 Appropriateness of Measurements  
All safety and PK assessments used in this study are standard, and generally recognized as reliable, 
accurate,  and relevant.

Page 82 8 DATA HANDLING AND QU ALITY ASSURANCE  
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, standard 
operating procedures (SOPs), working practice documents, and applicable regulations and 
guidelines.  Site a udits will be made periodically by the sponsor’s or the contract research 
organization’s (CRO’s) qualified compliance auditing team, which is an independent function from 
the study team responsible for conduct of the study.   
8.1 Data Collection  
Data required by the protocol will be collected on the eCRFs and entered into a validated data 
management system that is compliant with all regulatory requirements.  As defined by International 
Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, the CRF is a printed, optical,  or electronic 
document designed to record all of the protocol -required information to be reported to the sponsor 
on each study subject.  
Data collection on the CRF must follow the instructions described in the CRF Completion 
Guidelines.  The investigator h as ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all 
clinical data entered on the CRF.  The investigator or designee as identified on Form FDA 1572 
must sign the completed CRF to attest to its accuracy, authenticity, and completeness.  
Complet ed, original CRFs are the sole property of BeiGene and should not be made available in any 
form to third parties without written permission from BeiGene, except for authorized representatives 
of BeiGene or appropriate regulatory authorities.  
8.2 Data Managemen t/Coding  
All software applications used in the collection of data will be properly validated following standard 
computer system validation that is compliant with all regulatory requirements.  All data, both CRF 
and external data (e .g., laboratory data), wi ll be entered into a clinical system.  
The Data Management Plan defines and documents the procedures necessary to ensure data quality.  
These activities must be followed to ensure that data are properly entered, validated, coded, 
integrated, reconciled, and  reviewed.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) 
Version 18.1 or higher.  Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD).  Concomitant diseases/medi cal history will be coded 
using the MedDRA® Version 18.1 or higher.  
8.3 Quality Assurance  
To ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements, the sponsor may conduct a quality assurance audit.  Regulatory agencies  may also

Page 84 9 SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING  
The investigator is responsible for the monitoring and d ocumentation  of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  During the study, when there is a 
safety evaluation, the investigator or study center personnel will be responsible for detecting AEs 
and SAEs, as detailed in thi s section of the protocol.  After informed consent has been signed but 
prior to the administration of the study drug, only SAEs should be reported.  
After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
reporte d. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
9.1 Adverse Events  
9.1.1 Definitions and Reporting  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abno rmal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
The investigator or designee will ask about adverse events by asking t he following standard 
questions:  
 How are you feeling?  
 Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
 Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Worsening of chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition in cluding an increase in severity, 
frequency , duration,  and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome .   
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or a 
concurrent medication.  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator  to review all documentation 
(e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the AE or SAE .  The 
investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or SAE in the eCRF.  
However, there may be instances wh en copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -3111 -302 Amendment 5.0  BeiGene  
26 August 2019  
 
                          
Page 85 the sponsor.  In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical 
records prior to submission to the sponsor.  
9.1.1.1  Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will ma ke an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study.  When applicable, AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the 
NCI-CTCAE v4.03 .  
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI-CTCAE v4.03  will be defined as follows:  
 Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
 Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated;  limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL  
 Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5: Death related to AE  
NOTE: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2] , severe [Grade 3], or life -
threatening [Grade 4]), whereas seriousness is classified by the criteria based on the regulatory 
definitions. Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations from the 
Sponsor to applicable regulato ry authorities as described in Section 9.2. 
9.1.1.2  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the occurrence of 
each AE or SAE.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors, and the temporal relationshi p of the event to the study drug will be considered and 
investigated.  The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred  and the investigator has minimal information to 
include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is very important that the investigator 
always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the SAE report to 
the spons or, since the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements .    The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality considering 
follow -up information, amending the SAE report accordingly.   

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -3111 -302 Amendment 5.0  BeiGene  
26 August 2019  
 
                          
Page 86 The cau sality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related” or “not 
related”. An AE is considered related if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may have 
been caused by the study drug (i.e., there are facts, evidence, o r arguments to suggest possible 
causation). A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment, including:  
 Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study procedure  
 Whether an alternative etiology has been id entified  
 Mechanism of action of the study drug  
 Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered ‘related’ to study drug if any of the following are met, otherwise the 
event should be assessed as not related:  
 There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing 
factors can be ruled out  
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely  
 There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the AE occurred within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study drug). However, the influence of other 
factors may have contributed to the AE (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition or other 
concomitant AEs).  
9.1.1.3  Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject 
and provide further information to the sponsor on the subject’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and are designated as ongoing , will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwise explained, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent . The 
investigat or will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated 
to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory 
tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consul tation with other health care 
professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE.  T he investigator is obligated to assist.  If a subject dies during participation in the 
study or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of any 
post-mortem findings, including histopathology.

Page 87 New or updated informatio n will be recorded on the originally completed SAE report  form , with all 
changes signed and dated by the investigator.  The updated SAE report  form  should be resent to the 
sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section 9.2.2.1  and the eCRF should be updated 
accordingly.  
9.1.2 Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e .g., clinical chemistry, CBC, coagulation, urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (e .g., ECGs, X -rays, vital signs, etc.) that are judged by the investigator as 
clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (as 
defined in Section 9.1.1 ) or an SAE (as defined in Section 9.2).  The definition of  clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings is left to the judgment of the investigator.   In general, these 
are the laboratory test abnormalities  that are associated with clinical signs or symptoms, require 
medical intervention, l ead to dose interruption or discontinuation, require close observation,  more 
frequent follow -up assessments , or require further diagnostic investigation.   The investigator will 
exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnorma l laboratory finding 
or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
9.2.1 Definitions  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 Results in death.  
 Is life -threatening.  
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the d efinition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
 Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
NOTE:  In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate  in the physician’s office or out . 
 Results in disability/incapacity.  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, 
but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

Page 88  Is a cong enital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Is considered a significant medical AE by the investigator based on medical judgment (e.g., may 
jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above).  
The following are  NOT  considered SAEs:  
 Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline  
 Hospitalization for social/convenience consideration  
 Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for transfusion 
support or convenience  
9.2.2 Reporting  
9.2.2.1  Timeframes for Submitting Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events  must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s first knowledge  to the 
sponsor as described in Table 6 once the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol 
definition of a SAE .

9.2.2.2  Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a subject, he/she will report the 
information to the sponsor within 24 hours as outlined in Section 9.2.2.1 .  The SAE  report form will 
always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event,  signed by the 
investigator (or designee), and forwarded to the sponsor or designee within the designated 
timeframes.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE , he/she is not to wait to receive 
additional information before notifying the sponsor or designee of the SAE  and completing the 
form.  The form will be updated when additional information i s received.

Page 89 The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality for each SAE  as described in 
Section 9.1.1.2 . 
The sponsor will provide  contact information for the SAE report form receipt . The SAE must also 
be reported in the EDC System by completing the electronic Case Report Form.  
9.2.2.3  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section 9.2.2.2 .  The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, bot h the 
local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical 
investigation.   
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requireme nts related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
When a study center receives an initial or follow -up safety  report or other safety information (e .g., 
revised IB) f rom the sponsor,  the investigator or designated  responsible person according to local 
requirements is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
9.2.2.4  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug, only SAEs 
should be reported.  
After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be 
reported until 30 days after the last study treatment of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib. After this period, 
the investigator should report any SAEs  that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  
A post -study AE or SAE is defined as any AE that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting period 
defined above.  Investigators are not obligated to actively se ek AEs or SAEs in former subjects.  
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has 
been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the SAE related to the study drug, the 
investigator will notify the sponsor.  
9.2.2.5  Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Disease Progression  
Disease progression (including fatal disease progression)  is expected in this study population, and is 
measured as an efficacy endpoint, therefore  should not be reported as an AE term. Instead, the 
signs, symptoms or clinical sequelae  that result from  disease progression should be reported as the 
AE term.   
For instance, a subject with pleural effusion presents with shortness of breath.  The cause of the 
shortness of breath is a pleural effusion resulting from disease progression.  The AE term should be

Page 90 reported as “pleural effusion” instead of disease progression or metastasis to lungs.  If a subject has 
a seizure that is determined to be associated w ith a brain metastasis, the term “seizure” should be 
recorded as the AE instead of disease progression or brain metastasis.   If a subject experienced 
multi -organ failure due to disease progression, the term “multi -organ failure” should be reported as 
the A E instead of disease progression.   
Deaths that are assessed by the investigator as solely due to disease progression should be recorded 
on Study Completion or Early Discontinuation eCRF as efficacy data.  They should not be reported 
as an SAE. A patient d eath not solely due to disease progression,  as assessed by the investigator,  
should be reported as an SAE immediately, regardless of relationship to the study drug.  
If there is any uncertainty regarding whether an AE is due to disease progression, it shoul d be 
reported as an AE.  
Death  
Death is an outcome and not usually considered an event.   If the only information available is death 
and the cause of death is unknown, then the death should be reported as an event, e.g. , “Death”, 
“Death of unknown cause”, or  “Death unexplained.”  
9.2.2.6  Serious Adverse Event Related to Study Participation  
An SAE considered related to study participation (e .g., procedures, invasive tests), even if it occurs 
during the post -treatment period, will be reported promptly to the sponsor ( Section 9.2.2.2 ). 
9.2.2.7  Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Investigator, Institutional Review 
Boards and Ethics Committees  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAE against cumulative study drug experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate new safety findings to health authorities, investigators, institutional 
review boards and ethics committees based on applicable legi slation.  
To determine reporting requirements for individual adverse event cases, the sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of these events using the following reference documents:  
 Zanubrutinib (BGB -3111) Investigator’s Brochure  
 Local prescribing informatio n for ibrutinib  
9.3 Pregnancies  
A subject who has a positive pregnancy test result at any time after the study drug administration 
will be immediately withdrawn from participation in the study.  All post --study assessments will be 
collected at the time of disc ontinuation as described in Table 3. 
If a female subject or the partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while participating in this 
study , a pregnancy report form is required to be completed .  The investigator, or his/her designee, 
will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the spo nsor within 2

Page 91 weeks of learning of a subject’s or male subject’s female partner’s pregnancy.  The subject or male 
subject’s female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  
Information on the status of the mother and child w ill be forwarded to the sponsor.  Generally, 
follow -up- will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any 
premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, an y pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE, as 
described in Section 9.1 and Section 9.2 and will be followed as described in Section 9.1.1.3 . 
An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic or  spontaneous , should  always be reported  as an SAE 
as described in Section 9.2.2.1 .  Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study 
pregnancy and is considered reasonably related to the study drug by the investigator, will be 
reported to the sponsor as described in Section 9.2.2.2 .  Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth 
defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the study drug should be recorded and reported as an 
SAE.  
9.4 Lack of Efficacy  
“Lack of effic acy” will not be reported as an AE.  The signs and symptoms or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the AE or SAE definition (including 
clarifications).  
9.5 Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will monitor  safety data periodically throughout the study.  An efficacy and 
safety interim analysis, which occurs approximately 6  months after the first 50 relapsed/refractory 
subjects randomized from Cohort 1, will be implemented in the study.  A stop in recruitment  is not 
planned for this interim safety review. At regular safety reviews, data review will include but not be 
limited to deaths, SAEs, adverse events leading to dose reduction, dose interruption, or drug 
discontinuation. The DMC may recommend study modifi cation, including termination of the study 
due to efficacy and/or safety concerns.  Subsequent safety data review is outlined in DMC charter.

Page 92 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANALYTICA L 
PLAN  
All statistical analyses will be performed by the Sponsor or designee after the study is completed 
and the database is locked and released.   
Details of the statistical analyses will be included in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
10.1 Primary, Secondary and Exploratory Study Endpoints  
Please refer to Section 3 for a full listing of study endpoints.  
10.2 Statistical Analysis  
All inferential statistics described in this Section refer to  the efficacy comparisons of Arms A and B 
in Cohort 1 which are the primary/secondary objectives of the study. Separate descriptive statistics 
in Cohort 2 will be used to report the efficacy of zanubrutinib in Arm C.   
10.2.1  Analysis Sets   
The Intent to Treat analysis set  (ITT) includes all enrolled subjects who are assigned to a treatment 
arm. The Relapsed/Refractory analysis set in Cohort 1  will be the primary analysis set  used for 
efficacy analyses.  
The Relapsed/Refractory analysis set  (a subset of the ITT analysis set ) includes all randomized 
subjects with at least 1 prior line of therapy as determined by the IRT system.  
The Safety analysis set  includes all subjects who received any dose of zanubrutinib or ibrutinib.  
Subjects will be assigned to the treatmen t arms as treated. The S afety  analysis set  will be used for 
all safety analyses.  
The Per -Protocol analysis set  (PP) includes subjects who received any dose of study medication and 
had no major protocol deviations.  Criteria for exclusion from the PP analys is set will be determined 
and documented before the database lock for the primary analysis.  The PP  analysis set  will be the 
secondary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
The PK analysis set  includes all subjects who have at least one post -dose zanubrutini b 
concentration.   
10.2.2  Subject Disposition  
The number of subjects enrolled, treated, prematurely discontinued from study drug (defined as 
those who discontinued study drug due to any reason except for progressive disease) and those with 
major protocol deviation s will be counted by treatment arm.  The primary reason for study drug 
discontinued will be summarized according to the categories in the eCRF.  The end of study status 

Zanubrutinib

Page 93 (alive, dea d, withdrew consent or lost to follow -up) at the data cutoff date will be su mmarized using 
the data from the eCRF.  
Major protocol deviations will be summarized and listed by each category.  
10.2.3  Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment arm in ITT and 
Safety analysis set s using descriptive statistics.  Continuous variables include age, weight, vital 
signs, time since initial WM diagnosis; categorical variables include sex, age group (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 
years), race, disease stage, ECOG -PS, prior line of thera py for WM (0 vs. 1 -3 vs. >3 prior 
therapies), geographic region, MYD88/CXCR4  gene mutation status, presence of extramedullary 
disease (yes vs. no), baseline bone marrow involvement (< 50% vs. ≥  50%), WM IPSS (low, 
intermediate, high), and β2 microglobulin (≤3 mg/ L, vs. >3 mg/ L). 
10.2.4  Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11 -digit code using the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary drug codes.  Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate 
Anatomical The rapeutic Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic classification.  Prior and 
concomitant medications will be summarized and listed by drug and drug class in the  CSR for this 
protocol.  Prior medications will be defined as medications that stopped before the first dose of 
study drug.  Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that (1)  started before the first 
dose of study drug and were continuing at the time of the first dose of study drug, or (2) started on 
or after the date of the first dos e of study drug up to 30 days after the subject’s last dose.  A listing 
of prior and concomitant medications will be included in the CSR of this protocol.  
10.2.5  Efficacy Analyses  
10.2.5.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Comparison of the primary endpoint CR/VGPR rate  in Cohort  1 assessed by independent review 
committee will be  tested using hierarchical fixed -sequence procedure under the  null and alternative 
hypotheses as follows:  
H0: RR A=RR B 
Ha: RR A>RR B 
where RR A is the CR/VGPR rate in Arm A ( zanubrutinib ) and RR B is the CR/VGPR rate in Arm B 
(ibrutinib ).   
Testing for above hypotheses will be performed in the Relapsed /Refractory  analysis set  first at 
1-sided alpha of 0.025.   If the result is in the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set is statistically 
significant, the primary objective has been met and further testing will be performed in the ITT 
analysis set  at 1-sided alpha of 0.025.

Page 94 A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test of rate difference based on CXCR4  status (WHIM vs 
WT/missing) and prior line of therapy  (1-3 vs. >3 for Relapsed /Refractory  analysis set analysis and 
0 vs 1-2 vs >3 in ITT analysis) will be performed for hypothesis testing at the 0.025 level (1 -sided) 
in the  corresponding analysis set of Cohort 1 .   
A CMH 95% stratified confidence interval (CI ) of rate difference (RR A-RR B) with each rate 
weighted by number of subjects in each stratification factor combination will be constructed  for the 
Relapsed/Refractory analysis set  and the ITT analysis set , respectively . A Clopper -Pearson 95% CI 
of CR/VGPR rate within each arm will be constructed  for the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set and 
the ITT analysis set , respectively . 
The primary efficacy analysis in Cohort 1 will be conducted approximately 12 months after the 
cohort assignment of the last subject.    
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using investigator assessment. An 
unstratified analysis using exact method will also be performed in the sensitivity analysis.  
10.2.5.2  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
If the primary efficacy analysis is statistically significant in Cohort 1, secondary endpoints will be 
tested in the analysis set where the null hypothesis for primary efficacy endpoint is rejected.  
MRR  
MRR will be tested for non -inferiority of Arm A vs Arm B.  The null and alternative hypot heses of 
MRR are set as follows:  
H0: MRR A-MRR B≤-8% 
Ha: MRR A- MRR B>-8% 
where MRR A is the major response rate in Arm A ( zanubrutinib ) and MRR B is the major response 
rate in Arm B ( ibrutinib ) based on respective analysis sets .   
MRR will be compared between Arms A and B.  It will be analyzed using the same methods as 
described in the primary endpoint.  A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test of rate difference 
adjusting for stratification factors (CXCR4 status [WHIM vs WT/missing] and prior line of therapy  
[1-3 vs >3 for Relapsed /Refractory  analysis set  analysis and 0 vs 1 -2 vs >3 in ITT analysis set  
analysis ]) will be performed at the  0.025  level (1 -sided).  Equivalently, the 2 -sided 95% CI for the 
weighted rate difference (weighted by the number of subjects in each stratification factor 
combination) will be constructed to examine whether it excludes -8%.  Furthermore, superiority can 
be claimed if the lower limit excludes 0.

Page 95 Justification of non -inferiority margin  
The same non -inferiority margin will be used for both ITT and Relapsed/Refractory analysis sets.  
Since no randomized trial has been conducted in WM, the ibrutinib treatment benefit over placebo 
can only be estimated from the single -arm ibrutinib Phase 2 tr ial in which the MRR is 0.73 with 
95% CI (0.60, 0.83).  As a ≥ 50% reduction of IgM is impossible without treatment, MRR can be 
considered 0% in the placebo treated subject.  Therefore, the lower bound of 95% CI (i.e., 60%) can 
be used as the treatment effect of ibrutinib over placebo (M1).  A NI margin of 8% (M2) is 
proposed assuming 86.7% of the ibrutinib benefit over a placebo is retained. With close to 90% of 
the ibrutinib effect preserved, the 8% NI margin in MRR is clinically justified.   The loss of the 
ibrutinib treatment benefit is well within the clinically acceptable range.   It is worth noting that the 
NI of MRR will only be performed after the superiority of zanubruti nib over ibrutinib in CR/VGPR 
rate, which is closely correlated with MRR, has been demonstrated.  Hence, a numerically higher 
MRR in zanubrutinib is certainly expected if the NI test of MRR is to be performed.  The inclusion 
of the NI test of MRR is mainly  based on the sample size consideration in a rare disease setting 
where statistical significance might not  be shown in a superiority test with a clinically meaningful 
MRR difference (e .g., 12% higher MRR in zanubrutinib over ibrutinib) in 150 randomized  
relapsed/refractory  subjects.  
Best overall response (BOR) which is defined as the best response recorded from cohort assignment 
date until data cut or start of new antineoplastic treatment.  Subjects with no post -baseline response 
assessment (regardless of r eason) will be considered non -responders for best overall response.  The 
proportion and its corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for each of the response categories (CR, 
VGPF, PR, Minor Response , SD, and PD) will be presented.  
Other secondary endpoint anal yses:  
Progression -free survival (PFS) will be analyzed at the time of the primary analysis of VGPR/CR 
rate. In addition, subjects will continue to be followed for PFS  events after the primary analysis of 
VGPR/CR tate, until the final analysis of PFS. Durin g this period, the sponsor will keep maintaining 
trial integrity according to the Data Integrity Protection Plan (DIPP). Timing of the final analysis of 
PFS will be specified in the statistical analysis plan . 
Distribution of PFS will be estimated using the  Kaplan -Meier (KM)  method  per treatment  arm.  PFS 
censoring rule  will follow FDA Guidance for Industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of 
Cancer Drugs and Biologics (2007) . 
A stratified log -rank test with CXCR4 and prior line of therapy as strata (CXCR4 status [WHIM vs 
WT/missing ] and prior line of therapy [1-3 vs. >3 for Relapsed /Refractory  analysis set  analysis and 
0 vs 1-2 vs >3 in ITT analysis set  analysis ]) will be used to test the PFS differences between Arms 
A and B.   The Cox regression will be used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of PFS A vs PFS B.  A 
95% CI of HR in PFS will be constructed.

Page 96 Median PFS, if estimable, will be estimated using the KM method.  Its 2-sided 95% CIs, if 
estimable, will be constructed with a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method.  KM estimates 
of PFS will be plotted over time.  The PFS rate at selected timepoints such as,  12, 18 and 36 
months, defined as the percentages of subjects in th e analysis set who remain alive and progression -
free at the specified time points, will be estimated using KM method along with the corresponding 
95% CI constructed using Greenwood’s formula.  
For responders with PR or above, t he duration of CR/VGPR /PR within subjects who have achieved 
major response will be analyzed similarly as PFS.  
Indications for initiation of therapy (see Table 4) will be documented for all subjects at baseline 
visit.  Symptoms that triggered treatment will be followed at during and end of treatment visits until 
resolution. Percentages of subjects wit h resolution of each and all baseline symptom(s) will be 
summarized; and compared between Arms A and B using Fisher’s exact test.  
Maximum decrease in percentage of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes in bone marrow will be 
compared using analysis of variance mo del with treatment arm (A vs. B) as group variable. 
Percentage of subjects with decreased percentage of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphocytes after the 
start of study medication will also be compared using Fisher’s exact test. Percentages of subjects 
with resolut ion and/or reduction of pretreatment lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly according 
to CT scan will be summarized separately; and compared using Fisher’s exact test.

PK analysis set will be carried out to include plasma concentrations from this trial in an existing 
model.  PK p arameters such as C min will be summarized, and additional PK parameters such as 
apparent clearance of the drug from plasma (CL/F) and area under the plasma concentration -time 
curve (AUC [0-24]) may be derived from the PK analysis set if supported by data.  
Exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be carried out if supported by data.  
The impact of plasmapheresis on zanubrutinib exposure will be estimated by comparing the AUC of 
zanubrutinib in subjects with or without the plasmapheresis pr ocedure.    
10.2.7   
The mutational status of the MYD88  and CXCR4  genes has been shown to predict responsiveness of 
the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in WM ( Treon et al. 2015 a).  All subjects will have sequencing of 
MYD88  and CXCR4  performed on bone marrow samples which will be sent to the central laboratory 
for analysis.  
10.3 Safety Analyses  
Safety will be assessed by monitoring and recording of all AEs graded by NCI-CTCAE v4.03 . 
Laboratory values (CBC, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), vital, physical exams and 
ECGs findings will also be used in determining the safety.  Descriptive statistics will be used to 
analyze all safety data  by treatment arm, as well as by combining Arms A and C in the Safety 
analysis set .

Page 98 10.3.1  Extent of Exposure  
Extent of exposure to study drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of cycles received 
(number and percentage of subjects), duration of expos ure (days), cumulative total dose received 
per subject (mg), dose intensity (mg/day) and relative dose intensity.  
The number (percentage) of subjects requiring dose reductions, dose interruption, and drug 
discontinuation due to AEs will be summarized.  The  cycle in which the first dose 
reduction/interruption occurred will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Frequency of 
reductions and dose interruptions will be summarized by categories.  
Subject data listings will be provided for all dosing records  and for calculated summary statistics.  
10.3.2  Adverse Events  
The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from the CRF) will be classified into standardized 
medical terminology using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®).  Adverse 
events wil l be coded to MedDRA® (Version 18.1 or higher) lower level term closest to the verbatim 
term.  The linked MedDRA® preferred term (PT) and primary system organ class (SOC) are also 
captured in the database.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date on or after the first dose of study drug up to 
30 days following study drug discontinuation or was worsening in severity from baseline 
(pretreatment) or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first.  Only those AEs that 
were treatment emerge nt will be included in summary tables.  All AEs, treatment  emergent or 
otherwise, will be presented in subject data listings.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by 
SOC and PT.  A subject will be counte d only once by the highest severity grade according to 
NCI-CTCAE v4.03  within an SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced more than 1 TEAE 
within a specific SOC and PT.  The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs w ill also be 
summarized by relationship to the study drug.  Treatment -related AEs include those events 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug or with missing assessment of the causal 
relationship.  Serious adverse events, deaths, TEAE wi th grade 3 or above, related TEAE and 
TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction or dose interruption will be 
summarized.  
10.3.3  Laboratory Analyses  
Clinical laboratory (i.e. , CBC, serum chemistry, and qualitative urinalysis) values will be evalu ated 
for each laboratory parameter by treatment arm.  Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged and 
identified as those outside (above or below) the normal range.  Reference (normal) ranges for 
laboratory parameters will be included in the CSR for this pr otocol.  Descriptive summary statistics 
(e.g., n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for

Laboratory values  will be summarized by visit and by worst post -baseline visit.  
Laboratory parameters that are graded in NCI-CTCAE v4.03  will be summarized by CTCAE grade.  
In the summary of laboratory parameters by CTCAE grade, parameters with CTCAE grading in 
both high and low directions (e .g., calcium, glucose, magnesium, potassium, sodium) will be 
summarized separately.  
10.3.4  Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital sign parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure , heart r ate, 
temperature, weight) and changes from baseline will be presented by visit and treatment arm for all 
visits.  Vital signs will be listed by subject and visit.  
10.3.5  Electrocardiogram  
Descriptive statistics for baseline ECG parameters will be presented.  
10.4 Sampl e Size Consideration  
The sample size calculation is based on the comparison of the primary endpoint CR/VGPR rate in 
the Relapsed/Refractory analysis set in Cohort 1.  Assuming RR A=0.35 and RR B=0.15, seventy -five 
subjects per arm  (150 total)  provide a power  of 0.814 in testing RR A versus RR B in the 
Relapsed/Refractory analysis set in Cohort 1 using a normal approximation to binomial test with a 
two-sided significance of 0.05.  Assuming MRR A=0.90 and MRR B=0.80, the power of 
demonstrating non -inferiority of za nubrutinib  in the Relapsed/Refractory analysi set  is 85.5 % when 
a NI margin of 0.08 is used.    
In addition to 150 replased/refractory subjects, approximately 20% (38) treatment -naïve subjects 
with MYD88MUT will be enrolled in Cohort 1.  
Assuming MYD88MUT  mutation is present in 90% of the enrolled subjects, a total of approximately  
210 subjects will be enrolled in  Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined.  
10.5 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis, which occurs approximately 6 months after the first 50  relapsed/refractory 
subjects  are randomized from Cohort 1, will be implemented in the study.  This analysis is for 
futility only. No recruitment stop is planned for this interim analysis. If futility is demonstrated in 
the interim analysis , enrollment will be halted and safet y and efficacy data will be further evaluated 
before making the decision of stopping the study permanently. Otherwise, the enrollment will be 
continued to 150 relapsed/ refractory subjects in Cohort 1.  Details of the interim analysis will be 
provided in t he SAP.

reviewed and approved by the appr opriate IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB must be constituted in 
accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.  The sponsor will provide the investigator 
with relevant document(s)/data that are needed for IEC/IRB review and approval of the study.  
Before the  study drug(s) can be shipped to the study center, the sponsor or its authorized 
representative must receive copies of the IEC/IRB approval, the approved informed consent form, 
and any other information that the IEC/IRB has approved for presentation to pot ential subjects.  
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other information that the IEC/IRB has approved 
for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the study, the investigator (or sponsor, 
where applicable)  is responsible for ensur ing the IEC/IRB reviews and approves, where applicable,

Page 102 these amended documents.  The investigator must follow all applicable regulatory requirements 
pertaining to the use of an amended informed consent form including obtaining IEC/IRB approval 
of the amen ded form before new subject consent to take part in the study using this version of the 
form.  Copies of the IEC/IRB approval of the amended informed consent form/other information 
and the approved amended informed consent form/other information must be fo rwarded to the 
sponsor promptly.  
11.2.3  Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential 
hazards of the study and before undertaking any study -related procedures.  The investigator must 
utilize an IRB/IEC -approved consent form for documenting written informed consent.  Each 
informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by the subject or the sub ject’s legally 
authorized representative and the person obtaining consent.  
Informed consent will be obtained before the subject can participate in the study.  The contents and 
process of obtaining informed consent will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
Study site personnel must obtain signed informed consent before any study -specific procedures are 
conducted unless the procedures are part of routine standard of care, and must document the 
informed consent process in the patients’  clinical record. Informed consent may be obtained before 
the 35 -day Screening period.   Consent must be obtained using the most current version of the form 
approved by the ethics committee.  
Repeating Screening procedures or tests are allowed if the patient  did not previously meet the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria or if needed to have a documented result within the protocol -
specified Screening window.   The maximum number of repeats for a failed screening test is one 
within the screening window, and a pati ent may be re -screened no more than once.  
For patients who provide informed consent and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria or 
withdraw consent before randomization, study site personnel should document the screen failure in 
the patient’s source documents. The documentation should include demographics and medical 
history, the reason for screen failure, the eligibility criteria reviewed, procedures performed, etc.  
11.2.4  Investigator Reporting Requirements  
As indicated in Section 9.1, the investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for 
reporting SAEs to the IEC/IRB, in accordance with all applicable regulations.  Furthermore, the 
inves tigator may be required to provide periodic safety updates on the conduct of the study at 
his/her study center and notification of study closure to the IEC/IRB.  Such periodic safety updates 
and notifications are the responsibility of the investigator and not of the sponsor.

Page 103 11.2.5  Confidentiality  
Information on maintaining subject confidentiality and privacy in accordance to individual local and 
national subject privacy regulations must be provided to each subject as part of the informed 
consent form process, eit her as part of the informed consent form ( ICF) or as a separate signed 
document (for example, in the US, a site -specific HIPAA consent may be used). The investigator 
must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their identities  are 
protected from unauthorized parties.  Only subject initials  (if allowed) , date of birth  (as permitted by 
local law) , and an identification code (i.e. , not names) should be recorded on any form or biological 
sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB, or lab oratory.  The investigator must keep a Screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the 
trial. 
The investigator agrees that all information received from BeiGene, including but not limited to the 
IB, this protocol, CRFs, the investigational new drug, and any other study information, remain the 
sole and exclusive property of BeiGene during the conduct of the study and thereafter.  This 
information is not to be disclosed to any third party (excep t employees or agents directly involved in 
the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from BeiGene.  The 
investigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any 
employee or agent of  the study site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain.  
11.2.6  Case Report Forms  
For each subject enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal investigator or sub -
investigator within a reasonable time period after data collection.   This also applies to records for 
those subjects who fail to complete the study (even during a pre -randomization Screening period if a 
CRF was initiated).  If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the CRF.  If 
a subject is withdr awn from the study because of a treatment limiting - AE, thorough efforts should 
be made to clearly document the outcome.  
The CRFs exist within an electronic data capture (EDC) system with controlled access managed by 
BeiGene or its authorized representativ e for this study. Study staff will be appropriately trained in 
the use of CRFs and applications of electronic signatures before the study start and before being 
given access to the EDC system. Original data and any changes of data will be recorded using th e 
EDC system, with all changes tracked by the system and recorded in an electronic audit trail. The 
Investigator attests that the information contained in the CRFs is true by providing an electronic 
signature within the EDC system. After final database loc k, the Investigator will receive a copy of 
the subject data from that site (e.g., paper, CD, or other appropriate media) for archiving the data at 
the study site.

Page 104 11.2.7  Drug Accountability  
The investigator or designee (i.e. , pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of 
all used and unused study drug.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study 
product (quantity and condition), subject dispensing records and returned or destroyed st udy 
product.  Dispensing records will document quantities received from BeiGene, quantities dispensed 
to subjects, including lot number, date dispensed, subject identifier number, subject initials  (if 
allowed) , the initials of the person dispensing the med ication, and quantities destroyed or returned 
to BeiGene . At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
study drug disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with BeiGene requirements.  At 
the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by the monitor, the study site will 
dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, according to 
these procedures.  If the site cannot meet BeiGene’s requirem ents for disposal, arrangements will be 
made between the site and BeiGene or its representative for destruction or return of unused study 
drug supplies.  
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the 
Study Monitor over the course of the study.   A patient diary will be provided to each subject to 
record the study drug dose taken each day. Any missed doses with explanation should be recorded 
in the diary. The diary should be returned to the site personnel  for review , and will be reviewed by 
the Study Coordinator on a regular basis.  
11.2.8  Inspections  
The investigator should understand that the facilities used for this trial and all  source documents for 
this trial should be made available to appropriately qualified per sonnel from BeiGene or its 
representatives, to IRBs/IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors.  
11.2.9  Protocol Adherence  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations de scribed in this protocol. Investigators ascertain they will apply due 
diligence to avoid protocol deviations and shall report all protocol deviations to BeiGen e. 
11.3 Sponsor Responsibilities  
11.3.1  Protocol Modifications  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study subjects, may be 
initiated only by BeiGene. All protocol modifications must be submitted to competent authorities and 
to the IRB/IEC  together with, if applicable, a revised model ICF  in accordance with local 
requirements. Written documentation of competent authorities (as applicable according to local 
requirements), IRB/IEC and required site approval must be obtained by the sponsor before changes 
can be implemented.

26 August 2019  
 
                          
Page 105 Information on any change in risk and /or change in scope must be provided to subjects already 
actively participating in the study, and they must read, understand and sign each revised ICF 
confirming willingness to remain in the trial.  
11.3.2  Study Report and Publications  
A CSR will be prepared and provided to the regul atory agency(ies).  BeiGene will ensure that the 
report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study 
Reports (ICH E3).  Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases.  
As this is a multi -center stud y, the first publication or disclosure of study results shall be a complete, 
joint multi -center publication or disclosure coordinated by the sponsor.  Thereafter, any secondary 
publications will reference the original publication(s).  
Each  investiga tor agrees to submit all manuscripts, abstracts, posters, publications and presentations 
(both oral and written) to the sponsor for review before submission or presentation in accordance 
with the clinical study agreement . This allows the sponsor to protect  proprietary information, 
provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the 
investigator, and ensure scientific and clinical accuracy.  Each investigator agrees that, in accordance 
with the terms of clinical study  agreement, a further delay of the publication/presentation may be 
requested by the sponsor to allow for patent filings in advance of the publication/presentation.   
If a written contract for the conduct of the study, which includes publication provisions i nconsistent 
with this statement is executed, that contract’s publication provisions shall apply rather than this 
statement.  
11.4 Study and Study Center Closure  
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will conduct the following activities in conjunction with 
the investigator or study center personnel, as appropriate:  
 Return of all study data to the sponsor.  
 Data queries.  
 Accountability, reconciliation, and arrangements for unused study drug(s).  
 Review of study records for completeness.  
 Return of treatment codes to the sponsor.  
 Shipment of PK samples to assay laboratories.  
In addition, the sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this 
study either at a single study center or at all study centers at any time for reasons including, but not 
limited to, safety or ethical issues or severe non -compliance with this protocol, GCP, the clinical 
study agreement or applicable laws and regulations .  If the sponsor determines such action is 

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -3111 -302 Amendment 5.0  BeiGene  
26 August 2019  
 
                          
Page 106 needed, the sponsor will discuss this with the investigator (including the reasons for taking such 
action) at that time.  When feasible, the sponsor will provide advance notification to the investigator 
of the impending action prior to it taking effect.  
The sponsor will promptly inform all other in vestigators and/or institutions conducting the study if 
the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, and will also inform the regulatory 
authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  If required 
by applicable regulations, the investigator must inform the IEC/IRB promptly and provide the 
reason for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data must be provided to the sponsor.  In addition, 
arrangements will b e made for all unused study drug(s) in accordance with the applicable sponsor 
procedures for the study.  
Financial compensation to investigators and/or institutions will be in accordance with the agreement 
established between the investigator and the spons or. 
11.5 Records Retention and Study Files  
11.5.1  Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to 
be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documen ts should be 
classified into at least the following 2 categories: (1) investigator’s study file, and (2) subject 
clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, IRB/IEC, 
and governmental a pproval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum 
vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Subject clinical source documents (usually defined by the project in advance to record key 
efficacy/safety parameters independent of the CRFs) would include (although not be limited to) the 
following: subject hospital/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original 
laboratory reports, ECG, Screening ECHO/MUGA, electroenceph alogram, X-ray, pathology and 
special assessment reports, consultant letters, Screening and enrollment log, etc.  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all study records in a safe and secure 
location.  The records must be maintaine d to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed (e .g., 
audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in conjunction 
with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and personnel.  Where permitted by local 
laws/ regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a format 
other than hard copy (e .g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised 
before such action is taken.  The investigator must assure that all reproductions are legible, are a 
true and accurate copy of the original, and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including 

Zanubrutinib  
BGB -3111 -302 Amendment 5.0  BeiGene  
26 August 2019  
 
                          
Page 107 re-generating a hard copy, if required.  Furthermore, the investigator must ensure there is an 
acceptable back up of  these reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for 
making these reproductions.  
The sponsor will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining these records to comply 
with all applicable regulatory requirements.  The m inimum retention time will meet the strictest 
standard applicable to that study center for the study, as dictated by any institutional requirements or 
local laws or regulations, or the sponsor’s standards/procedures; otherwise, the retention period will 
default to 15 years.  
The investigator must notify the sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, but 
not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, transfer of ownership of or 
responsibility for the records in the event  the investigator leaves the study center.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the 
documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and BeiGene to store these 
in sealed co ntainers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator in case 
of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the subject, 
appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site.  
Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators  
When the CSR is completed, the sponsor will provide the major findings of the study to the 
investigator.  
In addition, details of the study drug assignment will be provided to the investigator to  enable 
him/her to review the data to determine the outcome of the study for his/her subject(s).  
The sponsor will not routinely inform the investigator or subject the test results, because the 
information generated from this study will be preliminary in na ture, and the significance and 
scientific validity of the results will be undetermined at such an early stage of research.   
11.6 Information Disclosure and Inventions  
All information provided by the sponsor and all data and information generated by the study c enter 
as part of the study (other than a subject’s medical records) is the sole property of the sponsor.  
All rights, title, and interests in any inventions, know -how or other intellectual or industrial property 
rights which are conceived or reduced to prac tice by the study center personnel during the course of 
or as a result of the study are the sole property of the sponsor, and are hereby assigned to the 
sponsor.  
If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes ownership provisions inconsi stent 
with this statement is executed between the sponsor and the study center, that contract’s ownership 
provisions shall apply rather than this statement.

Page 108 All information provided by the sponsor and all data and information generated by the study center 
as part of the study (other than a subject’s medical records) will be kept by the investigator and 
other study center personnel.  This information and data will not be used by the investigator or other 
study center personnel for any purpose other than cond ucting the study.   
These restrictions do not apply to:  
 Information which becomes publicly available through no fault of the investigator or study 
center personnel.  
 Information which is necessary to disclose in confidence to an IEC/IRB solely for the 
evalu ation of the study.  
 Information which is necessary to disclose in order to provide appropriate medical care to a 
subject.  
 Study results which may be published as described in Section 11.3.2 . 
If a written contract for the conduct of the study which includes provisions inconsistent with this 
statement is executed, that contract’s provisions shall apply rather than this statement.  
11.7 Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities  
11.7.1  Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the Study Monitor must have direct access to the 
investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the CRFs fo r 
consistency.  
The monitor is responsible for routine review of the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study 
to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data 
being entered on them.  The monitor should ha ve access to any subject records needed to verify the 
entries on the CRFs.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
11.7.2  Access to Information for Auditing  or Inspections  
Representatives of regulatory authorities or of BeiGene may conduct inspections or audits any time 
during or after completion of this clinical study.   If the investigator is notified of an inspection by a 
regulatory authority the investiga tor agrees to notify the sponsor or its designee immediately.  The 
investigator agrees to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or BeiGene access to 
records, facilities, and personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or audit.

CR 
 
• Disappearance of monoclonal protein by immunofixation  
Note: If immunofixation status is not reported/not interpretable 
for any available timepoints, the best possible response is 
VGPR. One negative immunofixation is sufficient to be called 
CR for a particular visit. Once a negative immunofixation has 
been reported for a visit, any subsequent visits with 
immunofixation status not reported or  not interpretable can be 
CR as long as all remaining data supports a continued CR 
status  
Negative cryoglobulinemia if cryoglobulinemia was Positive at 
baseline. Otherwise, if cryoglobulinemia was negative or not 
available at baseline, a negative cryoglobu linemia assessment at 
post-baseline is not required for an overall timepoint assessment 
of CR.  
Very good partial response (VGPR)  ≥90% reduction in serum IgM level from baseline or normal 
serum IgM values  
Partial response (PR)  ≥50% reduction of serum IgM from baseline   
Minor response (MR)  At least 25% but <50% reduction of serum IgM from baseline  
Stable disease (SD)  Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, MR, or progressive 
disease  
Progressive disease (PD)  Confirmed ≥25% increase in serum IgM and total increase of 
≥500 mg/dL from nadir (on treatment)b,c 
a IgM assessment should be made incorporating only IgM -related clinical data including IgM, M protein 
(SPEP/paraprotein), serum immunofixation, plasmapheresis, cryoglobulinemia and drug hold, as applicable .  If the 
patient has developed new symptomatic disease attributable to WM, the overall response will be assessed as disease 
progression.  
b Sequential changes (separated by at least 4 weeks) in IgM levels should be determined by the IgM value fro m the 
quantitative serum immunoglobulin assay, unless for assay limitations this is not possible, in which case the M -protein 
level by densitometry (SPEP) will be used  
c If there is a rapid rise in serum IgM level or an increase in known extramedullary dis ease leading to an “apparent” 
response of PD (e.g. there is an increase in IgM level of at least 25% and 500 mg/dL from nadir) after the study drug has 
been held for at least 7 consecutive days, an assessment of IgM flare will be assigned instead of PD. Th e period to 
which this is applicable begins on the day of the first missed dose and ends when the subject has IgM levels or 
extramedullary disease that no longer qualify as “apparent” PD or the subject has a confirmed response of PD*, 
whichever comes first .  Please see Guidelines for specific clinical or laboratory circumstances and timing below.

extramedullary disease  at baseline  
b Sequential changes (separated by at least 4 weeks) in IgM levels should be determined by the IgM value from the

level by densitometry (SPEP) will be used  
c If there is a rapid rise in serum IgM level or an increase in known extramedullary disease leading to an “apparent” 
response of PD (e.g. there is an increase in IgM level of at least 25% and 500 mg/dL from nadir) after th e study drug has 
been held for at least 7 consecutive days, an assessment of IgM flare will be assigned instead of PD. The period to 
which this is applicable begins on the day of the first missed dose and ends when the subject has IgM levels or 
extramedull ary disease that no longer qualify as “apparent” PD or the subject has a confirmed response of PD*,

dIf only physical exam (PE)is available an d the clinical assessment is indicative of an unequivocal improvement from 
baseline (enlarged spleen have regressed, abnormal lymph nodes have reduction in measurements), then the reduction in 
extramedullary disease can be assessed by PE alone.

Page 115 Guidelines for specific clinical or laboratory circumstances:  
 
1. Baseline serum total IgM value above the central laboratory limit of quantitation  
 
If the baseline central laboratory serum total IgM value exceeds the upper limit of 
quantitation, the M -protein value, by  central assessment, will be used for response 
determination throughout the study.  
 
2. Baseline serum total IgM value, by central assessment, is not interpretable due to technical 
reasons  
 
If the baseline central laboratory serum total IgM value is not interp retable due to technical 
reasons, the central laboratory serum M -protein value will be used of response determination 
throughout the study. In cases where both the central laboratory total serum IgM and M -
protein values are not interpretable due to technic al reasons, the local serum total IgM (or 
local M -protein value, in cases where the local serum total IgM value exceeds the upper 
level of quantitation) will be used for response assessment throughout the study.  
 
3. Subjects with documented cryoglobulinemia  
 
For subjects with abnormal cryoglobulin result at Screening and confirmed by the central 
test, the local laboratory will retest for the presence of cryoglobulins prior to C1D1. The 
C1D1 sample will serve as the baseline. In addition, serum quantitative im munoglobulins 
should be retested using the residual cryoglobulin blood sample at the local laboratory, 
which should be collected and processed under warm conditions. Only when serum 
immunoglobulin cannot be quantified, serum immunoelectrophoresis sample wi ll need to be 
re-collected, processed, and analyzed at local laboratory under warm conditions. The blood 
samples (for cryoglobulin and serum immunoglobulins) should be collected and processed 
under warm conditions at the local laboratory throughout the stu dy to ensure that the same 
methodology is used throughout the study. The results for cryoglobulin and serum 
immunoglobulins would need to be recorded in the eCRF at all required visits. It is 
recommended that the blood samples (cyroglobulins/serumIgM/SPEP/ serum 
immunofixation) should be sent to central lab for analysis in addition to the local lab and 
collected and processed under warm conditions throughout the study.  
  
4. Plasmapheresis  
 
Subjects may undergo plasmapheresis, when clinically indicated, during the first two cycles 
of study treatment. A pre -plasmapheresis serum total IgM and M -protein must be obtained 
during the screening period, or the highest predose value (least confounded by 
plasmapheresis) will serve as the baseline value for response assess ment throughout the 
study. IgM response and nadir determination should be at least 4 weeks following the last 
plasmapheresis procedure). Subjects requiring plasmapheresis after Cycle 2 will be adjudged 
to have progressive disease.

Page 116 5. Assigning IgM Flare due to study drug hold  
 
An assessment of IgM flare will be assigned instead of PD after study drug has been held at 
least 7 consecutive days and there is a rapid rise in serum IgM level (or an increase in known 
extramedullary disease for resonse that includes extramedullary disease assessment) leading 
to an “apparent” response of PD. The period that this is applicable begins on the day of the 
first missed dose and ends when the subject has IgM levels or extramedullary disease that no 
longer qualify as “apparent ” PD* (e.g. there is a drop in IgM level below 25% and 500 
mg/dL from nadir) or the subject has a confirmed response of PD*, whichever comes first.  
When assigning response for IgM flare after drug is restarted, the following conditions must 
be met:  
 If IgM levels and/or known extramedullary disease continues to decrease from peak IgM 
level (off study drug) or peak (highest SPD) in extramedullary disease, when drug was 
held, PD will not be recorded. If, however, while on study drug the IgM level or SPD 
increa ses above the peak level that occurred when drug was held, and IgM level or SPD 
increase is confirmed with a repeat assessment 4 weeks later, the subject will be 
considered to have PD and IgM will not be assessed.  
 If, after 10 weeks of study drug re -initia tion (to allow for fluctuation), the next assessed 
IgM level shows either a continued rise at each timepoint from the initiation of the drug 
hold or no decrease from the previous visit, then a serum IgM level obtained 4 weeks 
later must be used to confirm PD. PD will be confirmed if the subsequent IgM 
measurement is greater than or equal to the previous IgM assessment (first IgM 
assessment post 10 weeks study drug initiation). The response assessment of PD* will be 
recorded at the first visit 10 weeks after  study drug re -initiation.  
 Similarly, if apparent PD was due to an increase in extramedullary disease and after 
10 weeks of study drug re -initiation the evaluation of extramedullary shows either a 
continued rise from the initiation of the drug hold or no d ecrease from the previous visit, 
then PD is confirmed and the response assessment of PD will be recorded at the first 
visit 10 weeks after study drug re -initiation.  
 If during drug re -inititation the IgM level decreases and then rises at any timepoint 
there after:  
o If at the time of the IgM rise, the IgM level still qualifies as PD* then a 
confirmatory serum IgM level obtained 4 weeks later must be used to confirm 
PD*. PD will be confirmed if the subsequent IgM measurement is greater than or 
equal to the previ ous IgM assessment (IgM at the time of the initial IgM rise 
following IgM decrease). The response of PD will be recorded at the time of the 
initial IgM rise following the IgM decrease.   
o If at the time of the IgM rise, the IgM level does not qualify as PD*  then continue 
response assessments as described above.  
Of note, in the setting of multiple drug holds the nadir continues to be the lowest achieved 
serum IgM level on study for purposes of response assessment.  
 
PD* is defined per protocol as an increase in serum IgM level of at least 25 percent and 
500 mg/dL from lowest nadir

Page 117 6. Missing CT scans  
 
If a required CT scan timepoint is missed, it should be performed as soon as possible.  In cases where a single 
CT scan timepoint is missed and the subsequent CT scan findings remain the same or improved from the 
prior scan, response can be assessed for the intervening cycles using the CT scan obtained prior to the missed 
CT scan.  If 2 consecutive CT scan timepoints are missed, then the best response that can be a ssessed during 
those cycles is an MR (minor response).

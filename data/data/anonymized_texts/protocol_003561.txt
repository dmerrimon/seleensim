Terms Definition of terms
Adverse Event An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
administered a study drug and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.
Baseline The baseline value is defined as the last measurement before the first dose of 
double -blind study drug. For variables based on the electronic diary, the 3 days 
of the diary recorded prior to the randomization visit will be used to derive 
these va riables at baseline.
Discontinuation The act of concluding participation, prior to completion of all protocol -
required elements, in a trial by an enrolled subject.
End of Study The time of the last subject’s last protocol -defined assessment.
Enrolled A screened subject who has received the study medication.
Frequency The complaint of voiding too often during the day.
Incontinence Any involuntary leakage of urine. For purposes of data analysis specifically for 
this study, both full void incontinence with or without any urgency as well as 
partial void incontinence with passed urine in the toilet will be considered as 
incontinence.
Micturition Any voluntary micturition (episodes of incontinence only are not included).
Mixed urinary 
incontinenceThe complaint of involuntary leakage associated with urgency and also with 
exertion, effort, sneezing or coughing.
Nocturia Waking at night one or more times to void (i.e. any voiding associated with 
sleep disturbance between the time the subject goes to bed with the intention to 
sleep until the time the subject gets up in the morning with the intention to stay 
awake).
Overactive Bladder Urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually with frequency and 
nocturia, which can be described as the OAB syndrome, urge syndrome or 
urgency- frequency syndrome.
Randomization The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Run-In Failure Screened subject who did n ot fulfill protocol inclusion and/or exclusion 
criteria at Visit 2. Subjects who are considered a run -in failure cannot be re-
screened into the study at a later date.
Screened A subject who has signed informed consent and has performed the screening 
visit.
Screening Failure Screened subject who did not fulfill protocol inclusion and/or exclusion 
criteria, or decided not to participate anymore (withdrew consent) prior to Visit 
2. Subjects who are considered a screen failure at Visit 1 due to an acute 
condition that resolved (e.g. ,a treated UTI, an ECG that a cardiologist cleared, 
discontinuation of a prohibited or restricted medication) may be re- screened 
into the study at a later date.

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 18of 87Study Design Overview:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multi -center study.
At Screening (Visit 1), subjects will enter into a 4 -week open label tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg 
QD run -in period prior to being randomized into the 12-week double -blind treatment period (Visit 2).  
At the conclusion of the 4 -week tamsulosin hydrochloride run- in period, subjects will complete a 
3-day diary just prior to Baseline (Visit 2). Approximately 7 days prior to Visit 2 subjects will receive 
a phone call reminding them about the diary and to answer any questions.
A training diary will be completed in the first 2 weeks of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run -in period. 
During this evaluation period at least one telephone contact will take place with the subject. Diaries 
will be completed at home, using the electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) device, for 
3consecutive days prior to each visit: Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and 
Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). Site st aff will contact the subject approximately 7 days prior to 
the scheduled visit to remind the subject that they need to complete the electronic diary, review 
completion instructions and review changes to concomitant medications and adverse events (if 
applic able). 
If subjects meet all entry criteria at the end of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run -in period, subjects 
will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (mirabegron or placebo) for 12 weeks of treatment in 
addition to the continuation of tamsulosin hyd rochloride 0.4 mg QD. Those subjects randomized to 
mirabegron will start at 25 mg and will increase to 50 mg after 4 weeks.  Those subjects randomized 
to placebo will start blinded product matched to the mirabegron 25 mg tablet and will increase to 
blinded product matched to 50 mg mirabegron after 4 weeks. Once a subject has increased dose, he 
will remain on that dose for the remainder of the study unless for safety reasons he is required to 
discontinue study drug.
Three days before Visits 2 (Baseline), 3 ( Week 4), 4 (Week 8), and 5 (Week 12), subjects will 
complete a 3- day diary, using the electronic patient- reported outcome (ePRO) device in which they 
will record micturition frequency, urgency (PPIUS), incontinence and volume voided.  In addition the 
diary will capture morning and evening blood pressure and pulse rate measurements via Home Blood 
Pressure Monitoring (HBPM). At Visit 1 ,International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) will be 
completed. At Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5, subjects will complete the IPSS, EQ-5D-5L , OAB -q, PPBC, and 
TS-VAS.  Maximum urinary flow (Q max) will be measured at Visit 1 (Screening/tamsulosin
hydrochloride run-in) and Visit 5 (Week 12/End of Treatment).  Post- void residual volume (PVR) 
will be assessed at Screening/tamsulosin hydroch loride run-in (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2) and at 
Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4) and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). A follow -up phone call 
(Visit 6) will be conducted 4 -weeks after End of Treatment (Visit 5). Total study participation is 
approxim ately 20 weeks.

Performance of s ubgroup analyses by PSA cutoff scores for < 2, 2-4. 
Safety Variables:
Incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including AEs of 
special interest .
Vital signs: sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (home blood pressure
monitoring [HBPM] and office measurements).
ECG parameters (heart rate, PR, RR, QRS, QT, QTcF intervals).
Laboratory parameters ( hematology, serum chemistry , including liver function tests, and 
urinalysis).
PVR andQmax.
Statistical Methods: See Section 7STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
Sample size justification: 
The primary endpoint for this study is change from Baseline to E nd of Treatment in mean number of 
micturitions per day based on a 3- daydiary. 
A number of 272evaluable subjec ts per treatment group provides 80% power to detect a reduction of 
0.65 in the mean number of micturitions per dayover placebo in the mirabegron group at an alpha 
level of 0.05.  A standard deviation of 2.7 for change from Baseline in micturitions was assumed. 
If 85% of the randomized subjects are evaluable, 640subjects should be randomized.  With an 
expected drop -out rate of 35% by the end of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in phase (V2) , 985
subjects need to be s creened .
Safety:  
Safety analyses will be done on the Safety Analysis Set (SAF), which consists of subjects who 
received at least one dose of double- blind medication.  Treatment emergent adverse events will be 
coded using the MedDRA dictionary and will be summarized by trea tment group. The number and 
percentage of treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs ,AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs related to 
study drug will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term and treatment group. Laboratory 
variables (biochemistry, hematolo gy, and urinalysis) will be descriptively summarized for Baseline 
(Visit 2), Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12/End of Treatment and change from Screening to End of 
Treatment will be summarized by treatment group. Vital sign changes will be summarized by 
treatment group.  Categorical changes in vital signs will also be examin ed. In addition, post -void 
residual volumes as measured by bladder sonography and Q maxwill be summarized by change from 
baseline.  Centrally assessed ECGs will also be summarized by treatmen t group.
Interim analyses: 
Not applicable.

1.1 Back ground
Overactive bladder (OAB) s yndrome is a highl y prevalent medical condition. The prevalence 
of OAB is estimated to be 34 million in the US and 22 million in Europe [Irwin et al, 2009; 
Kim et al, 2006; Stewart et al, 2003; Milsom et al, 2001]. International C ontinence Societ y 
(ICS) defines OAB as urgency , with or without urge incontinence, usually  with frequency  
and nocturia [Abrams et al, 200 3; Lee and Lee, 2014]. Prevalence of OAB sy mptoms 
increases with age, and the prevalence of OAB wet (with incontinence) is greater in women 
than in men [Jaffe and Te, 2005]. I n clinical practice, it is recognized that men may  
experience OAB s ymptoms concurrent with those of benign prostatic hy perplasia (BPH).
BPH is a condition affecting over 50% of men b y age 60 [Bechis et al, 2014]. I t is also a 
common cause of lower urinary  tract sy mptoms (LUTS) such as frequent urination, urgency , 
nocturia, and the sensation of incomplete bladder empty ing [Miller and Tarter, 2009]. I n 
2008, an estimated 917 million men worldwide were a ffected b y LUTS from BPH [Irwin et 
al, 2011]. L UTS can be divided into storage and voiding s ymptoms, with BPH predominantly  
associated with voiding LUTS s ymptoms. Patients with voiding sy mptoms may  also have 
concomitant storage s ymptoms. Analy sis of the general population identified that the 
combination of storage and voiding LUTS was the most common ty pe of LUTS, affecting 
8.9% of the general population sample in a multinational, population -based study  (EPIC) 
[Irwin et al, 2009; Irwin et al, 2006].
Alpha-b lockers, such as tamsulosin hy drochloride, are commonl y prescribed to manage BPH 
symptoms but may  fail to alleviate storage (OAB) sy mptoms [L ee and Lee, 2014]. Thus, the 
American Urological Association (AUA) has identified combination therapy  with an 
α-blocker and anticholinergic as a potential treatment option for patients with BPH and 
coexisting OAB s ymptoms [AUA Guidelines, 2010].
The use of antimuscarinics (e.g., tolterodine and solifenancin) as add -on therapy  to alpha -
blockers such as tamsulosin hydrochloride has been evaluated in a number of clinical studies 
in men with OAB and BPH [ADAM study  by Chapple et al, 2009; VICTOR study  by Kaplan 
et al, 2009; TI ME study  by Kaplan et al, 2006]. Evaluated add -on therapies were generally  
found to be well -tolerat ed and showed an added benefit over alpha -blocker monotherapy  in 
improving OAB- related sy mptoms.
Mirabegron (M yrbetriq® /Betmiga ®) is a potent and selective human beta-3adrenergic 
receptor agonist approved for the treatment of OAB with sy mptoms of urge, urinary  
incontinence, urgency  and urinary  frequency  [Mirabegron US Package Insert, 2015 and 
Myrbetriq Canadian Monograph, March 2015, EU SmPC, 2015]. For the mirabegron 
monotherap y clinical development program, 32 phase 1 studies and 13 phase 2 and 3 studies 
(10 in patients with OAB, 1 in patients with L UTS/bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and 2 in 
patients with ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus) were conducted. Several global phase 3 studies have 
demonstrated the efficacy , safet y and tolerability of once dail y mirabegron in patients with 
OAB. In these clinical trials, the incidence of urinary  retention did not increase with

et al, 2013]. I n a phase 2 study  of 200 men with LUTS and BOO, mirabegron was also found 
to be safe and generall y well-tolerated, with no adverse effects on either the detrusor pressure 
at maximum flow rate or on the max imum flow rate [Study  178-CL-060].
The use of the beta-3 adrenergic agonist mirabegron to treat OAB s ymptoms as add-on 
therap y to tamsulosin hydrochloride will be evaluated for efficacy, safet y, and tolerability of 
the combination therap y. It is anticipate d from previous studies of add -on therapies, the 
combination of mirabegron and tamsulosin hy drochloride will show an added benefit over α-
blocker monotherap y in improving OAB -related sy mptoms.
1.2 Summary of Non-clinical and Clinical Data
Detailed information on the non -clinical studies conducted with mirabegron and tamsulosin
hydrochloride can be found in the approved product labeling, Summary  of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and US Package Insert for mirabegron and tamsulosin hy drochloride, 
copies of which w ill be made available to the Investigator, Institutional Review Boards 
[IRB], Independent Ethics Committees [I EC] and other bodies as appropriate. Summaries of 
findings from non -clinical and clinical studies with mirabegron and tamsulosin hydrochloride
which may  have relevance for the current study  are listed below.
1.2.1 Mirabegron (YM178)
Mirabegron was approved for the treatment of OAB in adults in Japan in 2011 and in the US, 
Canada and Europe in 2012. Mirabegron is a selective human beta-3 adrenergic agonist and 
the first of a new class of compounds with a different mode of action from the current 
standard of care, muscarinic receptor antagonists, in the treatment of patients with OAB. 
Antimuscarinic sand mirabegron both reduce micturition frequency  and incon tinence. Data 
from the phase 2 stud y 178 -CL-100 showed that mirabegron has a similar effect size to 
antimuscarinics. Consistent with the Phase 2 data, one phase 3bcomparative trial 
(178-EC-001) between mirabegron and so lifenacin in patients dissatisfied w ith their previous 
antimuscarinic showed that the two drugs had similar effect sizes formicturition frequency  
and incontinence.
1.2.1.1 Summary of Non -clinical Studies of Mirabegron
Mirabegron is a potent and selective agonist of the human beta-3adrener gic receptor . 
Mirabegron has low intrinsic activity  for human beta -1 and beta -2 adren ergic receptors . 
Mirabegron has no significant affinity for other pharmacological targets in a comprehensive 
test battery  of receptors, ion channels and enzy mes. Mirabegron directl y relaxes human 
bladder in vitro through activation of beta-3 adren ergic receptors . Studies in conscious and 
anesthetized rat models of bladder function demonstrate modulation consistent with a 
beneficial profile in OAB patients.
Increases in heart rate have been observed following mirabegron administration to rats, dogs, 
and monkey s. Decreases in blood pressure were observed in dogs but not in rats or monkey s. 
Assessment of the potential for mirabegron to delay  cardiac repolarization demonstrated that 
mirabegron and its most abundant human metabolites were free from effects on cardiac

in isolated perfused dog ventricular tissue neither mir abegron nor its metabolites induced 
electroph ysiological changes. Mirabegron and its five most abundant human metabolites did 
not significantl y alter the IKr (hERG), IKs (hKv LOT1/mink), I to (hKv4.3/KChip2.2), I na 
(hNAV1.5), or Ica (hCav 1.2) conductance in in vitro studies at relevant concentrations 
(>100 -fold human C max) at a 100 mg dose.
Single and repeat dose toxicology  studies in dogs, monkey s, and rats demonstrate 
cardiovascular changes at high doses. In a 13- week rat toxicology  study , significant incr eases 
in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were observed at doses of 30 mg/kg and higher 
(22-fold higher than maximum recommended human dose). Modest (less than 2 -fold) 
increases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were o bserved 
at high doses (72 -fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose), together with 
reversible changes in hepatocy tes. Modest elevation of ALT was also observed in monkey s 
but the changes observed were deemed to be below the level of toxicologica l significance and 
there were no changes in liver histopathology . There were no significant changes in liver 
enzy mes or liver histopathology  in dogs. Mirabegron was not genotoxic, carcinogenic, or 
teratogenic in the battery of conventional in vitro and in vivo studies.
1.2.1.2 Summary of the Pharmacokinetics of Mirabegron
After oral administration of mirabegron in healthy volunteers, peak mirabegron plasma 
concentrations were attained between 3 to 5 hours. The absolute bioavailability  increases 
from 29% at a dose o f 25mg to 45% at a dose of 150 mg under fasted conditions in healthy  
volunteers. Mean C maxand AUC infincreased more than dose proportionality over the 
recommended dose range. Steady  state concentrations were achieved within 7 day s of once 
daily  dosing wi th mirabegron. The C maxand AUC tauof mirabegron and its metabolites 
following multiple oral doses in older adult subjects (≥65 y ears) were similar in those in 
younger subjects (18 to 45 y ears). The C maxand AUC tauof mirabegron were approximately  
40-60% h igher in females than in males. The mean terminal t ½is comparable in both sexes. 
Evaluation of special populations in the phase 1 studies demonstrated that volunteers with 
severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 mL/min or eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min per 1.73 m2) or 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class B) had an approximately  2-fold increase in 
exposure to mirabegron relative to normal health y volunteers.
The in vitro oxidative metabolism of mirabegron in human liver microsomes is primarily  
mediated b y cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, but a possible role for CYP2D6 could not be 
excluded. I n vitro CYP inhibition studies suggest that mirabegron is a moderate and time -
dependent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4.
1.2.1.3 Summary of Clinical Data with Mirabeg ron
The clinical development program consists of 48 completed clinical studies to date over 
approximately  10 y ears and is comprised of 13,640 subjects (1,909 volunteers and 
11,731 patients) including patients with OAB, t ype 2 diabetes mellitus, and lower u rinary  
tract s ymptoms (LUTS)/bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). A total of 34 phase 1 studies and

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 31of 8714 phase 2 and 3 studies (11 in patients with OAB, 1 in patients with L UTS/BOO and 2 in 
patients with ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus) have been conducted globall y.
Mirabegron has been studied across the dose range of 25 mg to 200 mg once dail y in OAB 
patients. Mirabeg ron 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg demonstrated statistical superiority  
compared to placebo for the co- primary  endpoints of incontinence episodes and micturiti on 
frequency . Both the 50 mg and 100 mg doses also demonstrated superiorit y compared to 
placebo for almost all key  secondary  endpoints defined in the phase 3 program.
Evaluation of the combined safet y data from the mirabegron clinical program to date shows
mirabegron to be safe and well tolerated. The incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Events (TEAEs) in the active treatment group is comparable with the incidence in the 
placebo group. The most frequentl y reported TEAE was hypertension which i ncludes reports 
of blood pressure above the normal range, and BP increased from baseline, occurring 
predominantly  in subjects with baseline hy pertension . Most commonly  reported adverse 
reactions (>2% and >placebo) were h ypertension, nasophary ngitis, urinary  tract inf ection and 
headache. Most of the events were mild or moderate in intensity . Other adverse reactions 
occurring at greater than 1% and greater than placebo include constipation, upper respiratory  
infection, arthralgia, diarrhea, tach ycardia, abdominal pain a nd fatigue ( Table 2). The number 
of serious TEAEs is low and comparable across mirabegron and placebo treatment groups.

1.2.2 Tamsulosin Hydrochloride
Tamsulosin hy drochloride was registered in Japan in 1993, in the European Community  in 
1995 and in the USA in 1997. I n the US, tamsulosin hy drochloride is indicated for treatment 
of the signs and sy mptoms of BPH and in the EU, for lower urinary  tract sy mptoms (LUTS) 
associated with BPH. Since the launch of tamsulosin hy drochloride, a worldwide exposure of 
more than 24 million patient y ears h as demonstrated that tamsulosin hy drochloride is 
effective and safe in the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH. The most common adverse 
event is dizziness and weakness.  Intra -operative Floppy  Iris syndrome during cataract and 
glaucoma surgery  has been a ssociated with t amsulosin hydrochloride use.  The initiation of 
tamsulosin hydrochloride in patients with scheduled cataract or glaucoma surgery  is not 
recommended (see US Package Insert, 2014 and EU SmPC, 2013) .
1.2.2.1 Summary of Non -clinical Studies of Tamsulos inHydrochloride
Tamsulosin hy drochloride is an antagonist of alpha 1Aadrenoceptors in the prostate. The 
symptoms associated with benign prostatic hy perplasia (BPH) are related to bladder outlet 
obstruction, which is comprised of two underl ying components: static and dy namic. The 
static component is related to an increase in prostate size caused, in part, b y a proliferation of 
smooth muscle cells in the prostatic stroma. However, the severity  of BPH sy mptoms and the 
degree of urethral obstruction do not cor relate well with the size of the prostate. The dy namic

-CONFIDENTIAL -
22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 33of 87component is a function of an increase in smooth muscle tone in the prostate and bladder 
neck leading to constriction of the bladder outlet. Smooth muscle tone is mediated b y the 
sympathetic nervous stimulation of alpha 1adrenoceptors. Antagonism of these adrenoceptors 
can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an 
improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in sy mptoms of BPH.
Tamsulosin hydrochloride , an alpha 1adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits selectivity  for 
alpha 1receptors in the human prostate. At least three discrete alpha 1adrenoceptor subt ypes 
have been identified: alpha 1A, alpha 1B, and alpha 1D; their distribution differs between human 
organs and tis sue. Approximately  70% of the alpha 1receptors in the human prostate are of 
the alpha 1Asubtype.
1.2.2.2 Summary of the Pharmacokinetics of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride
The pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have been evaluated in adult healthy  
volunteers and patients with BPH after single and/or multiple administration with doses 
ranging from 0.1 mg to 1 mg. Absorption of tamsulosin hy drochloride from capsules of 
0.4mg is essentiall y complete (90%) following oral administration under fasting conditions. 
Tamsulosin hy drochloride exhibits linear kinetics following single and multiple dosing, with 
achievement of stead y-state concentrations by  the fifth day  of a once-a- day dosing. The time 
to maximum concentration (T max) is reached b y 4 to 5 hours under fasting conditions and by  
6 to 7 hours when administered with food. Taking capsules under fasted conditions results in 
a 30% increase in bioavailab ility (AUC) and 40% to 70% increase in peak concentrations 
(Cmax) compared to fed conditions.
Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extensively  metabolized by  cytochrome P450 enzy mes in the 
liver and less than 10% of the dose is excreted in urine unchanged. However, the 
pharmacokinetic profile of the metabolites in humans has not been established. In vitro 
results indi cate the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism of tamsulosin
hydrochloride as well as some minor participation of other CYP isoenzy mes. I nhibition of 
hepatic drug- metabolizing enz ymes may  lead to increased exposure to tamsulosin
hydrochloride . 
1.2.2.3 Summary of Clinical Data with Tamsulosin Hydrochloride
Four placebo- controlled clinical studies and one active -controlled clinical study  enrolled a 
total of 2 296 patients (1003 received 0.4 mg capsules tamsulosin hy drochloride once daily , 
491 received 0.8 mg capsules tamsulosin hy drochloride once daily , and 802 were control 
patients) in the US and Europe.
In the two US placebo -controlled, double -blind, 13 -week, multi -center studies [Study  1 
(US92 -03A) and Stud y 2 (US93 -01)], 1486 men with the signs and s ymptoms of BPH were 
enrolled. In both studies, patients were randomized to either placebo, tamsul osin 
hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once dail y, or tamsul osin hy drochloride capsules 0.8 mg once 
daily . Patients in tamsul osin hy drochloride capsules 0.8 mg once daily treatmen t groups 
received a dose of 0.4 mg once dail y for one week before increasing to the 0.8 mg once dail y 
dose. The primary  efficacy  assessments included: 1) total American Urological Association

1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
1.3.1 Summary of Key Safety Information for Mirabegron
Mirabegron was first approved in Japan on 1 July  2011, and was launched to market on 
16September 2011 under the trade name Betanis ®. On 28 June 2012, mirabegron received 
approval in the United States (trade name: M yrbetriq
®). The approved indication is the 
treatment of OAB with sy mptoms of urinary  incontinence, urgency , and urinary  frequency . 
On 20 Decembe r 2012, mirabegron received marketing approval in the EU under the trade 
name Betmiga ®. On 6 March 2013, mirabegron received approval in Canada (trade name: 
Myrbetriq ®). As of September 3, 2015, mirabegron has regulatory approval in 58 countries.
The safet y of mirabegron treatment has been well characterized in 5,863 subjects in the 
phase 2/3 studies, including 5,648 subjects with OAB, treated with mirabegron at doses 
ranging from 25 to 200 mg once dail y. Of the 5,648 subjects with OAB who received 
mirabegr on, 1,572 subjects received mirabegron continuous
ly for at least 6 months, 
1,482 subjects for at least 9 months, and 622 for at least 1 y ear.
Important potential risks include QT prolongation with supratherapeutic doses or in high -risk 
populations, increas ed heart rate, increased blood pressure, non-immediate cutaneous 
hypersensitivity  reactions and exposure in utero. The potential risks of QT prolongation, 
increased heart rate, or increased blood pressure are greater with increasing exposure. The 
expected adverse drug reactions for mirabegron are presented in Table 2 The approved 
therapeutic dose of mirabegron in the United States and Canada is 25 mg once dail y which 
may be increased to 50 mg once dail y based on individual patient efficacy and tolerability 
[Mirabegron US Package I nsert, 2015 and M yrbetriq Canadian Monograph, March 2015]. In 
the EU the approved starting dose of mirabegron is 50 mg once dail y [EU SmPC, 2015].  The 
favorable benefit risk profile of mirabegron is not expected to change over time.
A mean increase of approximately  1 bpm for pulse rate was observed in OAB patients who 
received mirabegron 50 mg. This magnitude of change was similar for both 12 -week and 
long-term studies, for men and women, and in both the mirabegron and tolterodine (active 
control) treatment groups. I n patients with OAB, categorical increases in pulse rate were 
noted more frequentl y with mirabegron and tolterodine than with plac ebo, with similar

pronounced in young subjects in comparison to older adults (age 55 years and greater) 
subjects. Changes in pulse were reversible upon discontinuation of trea tment.
An approximate mean increase in 1 mmHg from baseline for SBP/DBP was observed in 
OAB patients who received mirabegron 50 mg compared with placebo. This magnitude of 
change was similar for both 12- week and long -term studies, for men and women, and in both 
the mirabegron and tolterodine treatment groups. TEAE and SAE related to hy pertension 
were similar for mirabegron 50 mg, placebo, and tolterodine in the 12- week studies, and were 
similar for mirabegron and tolterodine in the long- term study . Blood pr essure increases were 
more pronounced in y oung subjects in comparison to older adult (age 55 years and greater) 
subjects. Changes in blood pressure were reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. Please 
refer to the product insert for expected adverse d rug reactions (ADR).
Detailed information on the clinical safety  profile for mirabegron can be found in the full 
prescribing information [Mirabegron US Package Insert, 2015, M yrbetriq Canadian 
Monograph, March 2015, and EU SmPC, 2015].
According to current package inserts, no dose adjustment is necessary  for older adult patients. 
The pharmacokinetics of mirabegron is not significantly  influenced by  age. The C maxand 
AUC of mirabegron following multiple oral doses in older adult volunteers (≥ 65 y ears) were 
similar to those in y ounger volunteers (18 to 45 years). Of 5,648 patients who received 
mirabegron in the phase 2 and 3 studies, 2,029 (35.9%) were 65 y ears of age or older, and 
557 (9.9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in saf ety or effectiveness 
were observed between patients y ounger than 65 years of age and those 65 y ears of age or 
older in the studies [Mirabegron US Package Insert, 2015 and My rbetriq Canadian 
Monograph, March 2015, EU SmPC, 2015].
1.3.2 Summary of Key S afety Infor mation for Tam sulosin Hydrochloride
In the phase 3 trials (178-CL-046, 178- CL-047, 178 -CL-074), 308 men were on tamsulosin
hydrochloride across treatment groups. There were no differences in rates of hy pertension or 
elevated heart rate between men on and o ff tamsulo sinhydrochloride .
1.3.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Combination of Mirabegron and 
Tam sulosin Hydrochloride
Study  178- CL-080 was an open- label, 2 -treatment arm, 2 -sequence stud y to investigate the 
cardiovascular (CV) interactions between mirabegron (100 mg) and tamsulosin hydrochloride
(0.4mg as a single dose) in healthy  male volunteers. Under the conditions of the study , the 
CV results suggest there is no clinically  relevant pharmacod ynamic interaction between 
tamsulosin hydrochloride and mirabegron. Combination treatment of mirabegron and 
tamsulosin hydrochloride did not appear to affect the safety profiles of either drug. In this 
interaction study , there were no serious adverse events and no events of s yncope in either 
treatment arm.

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 36of 87InJapanese men with OAB induced by  benign prostatic obstruction, addition of mirabegron 
to tamsulosin hydrochloride was shown to be more effective for ameliorating storage 
symptoms compared to tamsulosin hydrochloride monotherap y [Ichihara et al, 2014].
1.4 Risk-Benefit Assessment
Subjects randomized to placebo treatment are unlikely  to benefit from the study  beyond the 
benefits they  receive from tamsulosin hydrochloride alone. However, OAB is not a life-
threatening disease and it is not expected that a 12- week exposure to placebo treatment will 
have a negative impact on disease progress, given that subjects will have been on tamsulosin
hydrochloride prior to study  entry  and it will be continued. Subjects receiving mirabegron are 
likely  to benefit from at least a partial relief of s ymptoms during the study.
There is extensive clinical experience with tamsulosin hy drochloride monotherap y in the 
treatment of BPH.  Clinical equipoise is maintained in the study  because an alpha blocker is 
considered standard treatment of men with BPH and because the subjects are continuing on 
their usual prescribed dose as opposed to being placed on a tamsulosin hydrochloride placebo.
Mirabegron has a distinct mechanism of action (beta-3 adrenergic agonist) compared with the 
current st andard of care, primarily  antimuscarinics, for the treatment of s ymptoms of OAB. 
Antimuscarinics have been studied concomitantly with alpha blockers and appear to be 
efficacious without added risk.  Muscarinic antagonists and beta -3 adrenergic agonists 
modulate bladder function through distinct mo lecular pathway s. Thus concomitant use of 
tamsulosin hy drochloride and mirabegron offers the possibility  of enhancing efficacy  in the 
treatment of men with BPH who have co -existing OAB.
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DESIGN, AND ENDPOINT S
2.1 Study Objectives
The primary objective is to study  the efficacy  of mirabegron versus placebo in men with 
OAB s ymptoms while taking tamsulosin hy drochloride for LUTS due to BPH.
The secondary  objective is to assess safet y and tolerability of mirabegron versus placebo in 
men with OAB s ymptoms while taking tamsulosin hy drochloride for LUTS due to BPH.
Other objectives are to assess patient reported outcomes (PROs) as measured by  Symptom 
Bother and Total Health Related Quality  of Life scores as assessed by  the Overactive Bladder 
questionnaire (OAB -q), EQ -5D- 5L, Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), Patient 
Perception of Intensit y of Urgency Scale (PPIUS), I nternational Prostate S ymptom Score 
(IPSS), and Treatment Satisfaction- Visual Analog Scale (TS -VAS).

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 37of 872.2 Study Design and Dose Ra tionale
2.2.1 Study Design
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multi -center stud y.
Approximately  985 subjects will be enrolled at up to 100 study  centers in North America and 
Europe.
At Screening (Visit 1), subjects will enter into a 4- week open label tamsulosin hy drochloride 
0.4mg QD run- in period prior to being randomized into the 12- week double -blind treatment 
period (Visit 2).  At the conclusion of the 4 -week tamsulosin hy drochloride run -in period, 
subjects will complete a 3-day diary  just prior to Baseline (Visit 2). Approximately  7 day s 
prior to Visit 2 subjects will receive a phone call reminding them about the diary  and to 
answer an y questions.
A training diary  will be completed in the first 2 weeks of the tamsulosin hy drochloride run -in 
period. During this evaluation period at least one telephone contact will take place with the 
subject. Diaries will be completed at home, using the electronic patient -reported outcome 
(ePRO) device, for 3 consecutive days prior to each visit: Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 
(Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). Site staff will contact 
the subject approximately 7 day s prior to the scheduled visit to remind the subject that they  
need to complete the electronic diar y, review completion instructions and review changes to 
concomitant medications and adverse events (if applicable). 
If subjects meet all entry criteria at the end of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run- in period, 
subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatme nt groups (mirabegron or placebo) for 12 weeks 
of treatment in addition to the continuation of tamsulosin hy drochloride 0.4 mg QD. Those 
subjects randomized to mirabegron will start at 25 mg and will increase to 50 mg after 
4 weeks.  Those subjects randomized to placebo will start blinded product matched to the 
mirabegron 25 mg tablet and will increase to blinded product matched to 50 mg mirabegron 
after 4 weeks. Once a subject has increased dose, he will remain on that dose for the 
remainder of the stud y unless for safety  reasons he is required to discontinue study  drug.
Three day s before Visits 2 (Baseline), 3 (Week 4), 4 (Week 8), and 5 (Week 12), subjects 
will complete a 3 -day diary , using the electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) device in 
which they  will record micturition frequency , urgency  (PPI US), incontinence and volume
voided.  In addition the diary  will capture morning and evening blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements via HBPM. At Visit 1, International Prostate Sy mptom Score (IPSS) wi ll be 
completed. At Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5, subjects will complete the I PSS, EQ -5D-5L, OAB -q, 
PPBC, and TS -VAS.  Maximum urinary  flow (Q max) will be measured at Visit 1 
(Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in) and Visit 5 (Week 12/End of Treatment).  
Post-void residual volume (PVR) will be assessed at Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride
run-in (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2) and at Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4) and Week 
12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). A follow-up phone call (Visit 6) will be conducted 4- weeks 
after End of Treatment (Visit 5). Total study  participation is approximately  20 weeks.

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 38of 872.2.2 Dose Rationale
The approved dose in the treatment of overactive bladder in the United States and Canada is 
mirabegron 25 mgdaily, which may  be increased to 50 mg dailybased on individual efficacy  
and tolerability  [Mirabegron US Package Insert, 2015 and My rbetriq Canadian Monograph, 
March 2013]. The recommended dose of mirabe gron in the European SmPC is 50 mg[EU 
SmPC, 2015]. The dosing regimen for the stud y is starting with mirabegron 25 mg with an 
obligatory  increase to mirabegron 50 mg after 4 weeks of treatment which is intended to 
reflect a pragmatic and clinically  plausible regimen. The treatment effect size at Week 4 in 
the phase 3a program approaches the max imum treatment response for incontinence and 
micturition.

when critical therapeutic decisions are contingent on knowing the assigned study  drug.
Withdrawal of a subject from the study  (refer to Section 6.1) is not a sufficient reason to 
break the stud y blind. Any decision to break the blind should be discussed with the Astellas 
Study  Physician (refer to Section IIfor contact information).
If the blind is broken for a subject, the reason is to be documented as a written entry  in the 
source document. Key  information will be recorded at the time when the blind is broken. This 
includes the date the blind was broken, the reason, the person who requested the breaking of 
the blind, the name of the person who broke the blind, and the name of the Astellas 
representative contacted.
4.4.4 Breaking the Treatment Code for E mergency
In order to break the treatment code ( unblind ing) for a subject, the assigned study  medication 
information is accessible through the IWRS. The Sponsor must be notified immediately  if the 
blind is broken. The date, time, and reason the blind was broken must be recorded in the 
source documents and on the appropriate Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) if applicable.
Breaking the treatment code, or unblinding of an individual subject’s treatment assignment, 
may be done onl y for reasons relating to subject safet y or when critical therapeutic decisions 
are contingent upon knowing the blinded stud y drug assignment .
4.4.5 Breaking the Treatment Code by the Sponsor
The Sponsor may  break the treatment code for subjects who experience a Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), in order to determine if the individual case 
or a group of cases requires expedited regulatory  reporting. Individual Emergency  Codes will 
be provided to the limited staff, who are responsible to break the codes for all SUSAR cases
for reporting purposes.
4.5 Assignment and Allocation
After a subject signs informed consent, a subject number will be assigned. To obtain a subject 
number, the Investigator or designee will utilize a web or phone -based Interactive Response 
Technology  (IRT), available seven day s a week and 24 hours a day .
Subjects who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will enter a 4 -week 
tamsulosin hy drochloride 0.4mgcapsule (US) / tablet (EU/CA) run-in period (Visit 1). At 
Visit 2 (Baseline), subject s will be randomly  assigned to receive mirabegron or placebo using 
a 1:1 randomization schedule. Randomization will be stratified b y geographic region (NA, 
EU).
To obtain the randomization treatment, the Investigator or designee will utilize a web or 
phone- based IRT, available seven day s a week and 24 hours a day . After submitting certain 
information about the eligible subject, the randomized drug assignment will be provided b y

preprinted with a Medication I D number. The Medication ID number assigned to the subject 
will be noted in the electronic case report form (eCRF) for stud y drug.
Once a subject number is assigned, if the corresponding subject does not receive study drug, 
the subject number will not be used again. 
5 TREATMENTS AND EVALU ATION
5.1 Dosing and Administration of Study Drug(s) and Other 
Medication(s)
5.1.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period
Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to either 
mirabegron or placebo (PTM). Those subjects randomized to mirabegron will start at 25 mg 
tablet QD for 4 weeks along with tamsulosin hy drochloride 0.4mgcapsule (US) / tablet 
(EU/CA) . Mirabegron dose will be titrated to mirabegron 50 mg QD at 4 weeks. Mirabegron 
50mg dose will be maintained for the remaining 8 weeks of the stud y along with tamsulosin 
hydrochloride capsule 0.4 mg(US) / tablet (EU/CA) . Oral mirabegron can be taken with or 
without food, but during the course of the study  will be taken the same time each day  as the 
concomitant tamsulosin hy drochloride medication.
Those subjects randomized to placebo will start placebo to match (PTM) mirabegron 25 mg 
tablet QD for 4 weeks along with tamsulosin hy drochloride 0.4mg capsule (US) / tablet 
(EU/CA) . PTM mirabegron 25 mg will be increased to PTM mirabegron 50 mg and will be
maintained for the remaining 8 weeks of the study  along with tamsulosin hy drochloride 
0.4mg capsule (US) / tablet (EU/CA) . Subject swill be instructed to take PTM at the same 
time each day  as the concomitant tamsulosin hy drochloride medication.
Subjects will be instructed to take oral tamsulosin hy drochloride 0.4 mg approximately  one-
half hour following the same meal each day .
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s)
The study  design employs a dose increase from 25 mg mirabegron to 50 mg mirabegron at 
Week 4 (Visit 3). Once a patient has increased dose, he will remain on that dose for the 
remainder of the stud y unless for safety reasons that require discontinuation of study  drug.
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Non -Medication 
Therapy)
5.1.3.1 Previous Medication (Drugs and Therapies)
The Investigator must record the use of previous (all medication taken within 30 day s prior to 
Screening [ Visit 1]) and current concomitant treatment, both drug and non -drug therapies, 
prescribed and over -the-counter and all alternative medicines, in the eCRFs. This also 
includes drugs used on a chronic and as -needed basis.

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 47of 87Subjects must be instructed not to start an y new medication, both prescribed and over -the-
counter, without consulting the Investigator, unless the new medication is required for 
emergency  use. Subjects must be instructed to notify  the Investigator immediately  if 
medications were required for emer gency  use.
5.1.3.2 Concomitant Medication (Drugs and Therapies)
Concomitant medications will be captured from Screening/tamsulosin hy drochloride run -in 
(Visit 1) through the Follow -Up Phone Call (Visit 6).
Prohibited Medications ( Appendix 1 , part A)
Medications pr ohibited between Screening/tamsulosin hy drochloride run -in (Visit 1)and 
Week 16/Follow- up phone call (Visit 6) include other alpha- adrenergic blockers, 
anticholinergics, antispasmodics, strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 with narrow 
therapeutic inde x, specifically  thioridazine, flecainide , propafenone , amitripty line, 
paroxetine, and terbinafine, and moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (seeAppendix 1,
Part A).  These medications must have been discontinued at least 30 day s prior to 
Screening /tamsulosin hydrochloride run -in(Visit 1). Current or previous use of mirabegron 
within 6 months p rior to Screening (Visit 1) is also prohibited.
Restricted Medications ( Appendix 1, part B)
Medications restricted between Screening/t amsulosin hydrochloride run-in (Visit 1) and 
Week 1 6/Follow -up Phone Call (Visit 6) include loop diuretics , 5-Alpha reduct ase inhibitors 
and PDE5 inhibitors (see Appendix 1, Part B). These medications are permitted provided the 
subject has been taking the medication on a long- term basis, i.e. has not stopped, or started, 
or changed dose within the 30 day s prior to Screening /tamsulosin hy drochloride run -in 
(Visit 1), no new drug of the same class has been added to the regimen within the 30 day s 
prior to Screening /tamsulosin hy drochloride run -in(Visit 1), and the subject remains on the 
medication at the same dose during the course of the study .  For 5-alpha reductase inhibitors
the subject must have been taking the medication for at least 6 months. No alpha -blockers 
other than tamsulosin h ydrochloride are allowed. Intermittent use of PDE5 inhibitors 
(e.g. tadalafil) for treating erectile d ysfunction (ED) is allowed.  PDE5 inhibitors that are 
taken on a dail y basis for the management of LUTS are not allowed. 
Restricted Non -Drug Therapy
Subjects participating in any behavioral modification therap y (i.e. ,pelvic floor exercises, 
Kegel exercises, biofeedback, timed voiding, etc.) or other nondrug therap y must have started 
the therap y within 30 days prior to Screening /tamsulosin hy drochloride ru n-in(Visit 1) and 
must continue the same schedule through Follow -Up Phone Call (Visit 6). N eurostimulation
for OAB is a strict exclusion criterion.
5.1.4 Treatment Compliance
Study  subjects should be counseled on the need to meet 100% compliance with study  drug.  
Investigator or designee should ensure that study  subjects meet this goal throughout the study  
Sponsor: APGD, Medical Affairs, Am ericas ISN/Protocol 178 -MA-1008
EudraCT 2015 -004036 -36
-CONFIDENTIAL -
22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 48of 87period.  Compliance will be verified b y the accounting of each study  drug at each monthl y 
visit starting with the Baseline (Visit 2). 
If compliance during the tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period is less than 80% or greater 
than 120% of stud y medication the subject is considered non -compliant and will be excluded 
from the s tudy.
If compliance for blinded treatment is less than 80%, the Investigator or designee is to 
counsel the subject and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. Subjects who are less 
than 80% compliant with the dosage regimen for any  two consecutive visit periods during the 
study  should be withdrawn from the study .
5.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1 Demographics
The subject’s date of birth (or age, if local regulations do not allow recording of subject’s 
date of birth), gender, race, ethnicity , height, and weight will be recorded at 
Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run -in (Visit 1).
5.2.2 Medical History
Medical history  (other than for overactive bladder), including smoking history  will be 
obtained at Screening/tamsulosin hy drochloride run- in (Visit 1 ) from each subject. All 
relevant past and present conditions, as well as prior surgical procedures will be recorded for 
the main body  systems.
5.2.3 Diagnosis of the Target Disease, Severity, and Duration of Disease
A detailed history  of OAB and lower urinary  tract sy mptoms (LUTS) due to Benign Prostatic 
Hyperplasia (BPH) for each subject will be obtained at Screening/tamsulosin hy drochloride 
run-in (Visit 1). This includes date of onset of OAB s ymptoms, OAB s ymptoms at time of 
diagnosis and at Screening, OAB no n-drug therapy  and medication history  for OAB and 
reason for treatment termination. I n addition information regarding the history  of BPH and 
LUTS will be collected.
5.3 Efficacy Assessment
5.3.1 Patient Diary – Micturition and Incontinence
During the study , subjects will be requested to complete a “3 -day diary ” which will be 
implemented on an electronic handheld device. This diary  will collect data on micturition and 
incontinence, sleep interruption, protective garments, vital sign measureme nts and the Patient 
Perception of Intensit y of Urgency Scale (PPIUS) prior to Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 . The 
information from the diaries will be used to evaluate the efficacy  of treatment. Therefore, 
subjects will receive full instructions and training on how to complete the diary  at 
Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run -in (Visit 1) and will be counseled on the importance 
of completing the diaries prior to the next visit. The diaries and questionnaires will be 
reviewed during each visit after Screening/tamsu losin hy drochloride run -in (Visit 1) by  the 
Investigator or designee to ensure accuracy  of completion.

-CONFIDENTIAL -
22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 49of 87A training diary  will be completed in the first 2 weeks of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in 
period. The purpose of this training diary  is to familiari ze the subject with using the 
electronic handheld device and for the Investigator to assess the ability  and willingness of the 
subject to complete the diary . During these 2 weeks the I nvestigator will remotely  evaluate 
diary  completion and will provide additional instructions if necessary . During this evaluation 
period at least one telephone contact will take place with the subject. The diary  that is 
completed during the last 3 day s before randomization will be used to establish Baseline data. 
Therefore, it is very  important to ensure that any  compliance or completion issues are 
discussed during the 2- week training diary .
Diaries will be completed at home for 3 consecutive day s prior to each visit: Baseline 
(Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5).  Site 
staff will contact the subject approximately  7 day s prior to the scheduled visit to remind the 
subject they need to complete the electronic diary , review completion instructions and review 
changes to concomitant me dications and adverse events (if applicable).
A diary  day starts at midnight and ends at midnight the following day . Time to bed with 
intention to sleep, time to wake with intention of staying awake, type of episode 
(urination/incontinence), time of episod e, urgency  severit y (see Section 5.3.2 ), measure of 
urine volume voided, and sleep interruption will be recorded b y the subject in the micturition 
diary .
At Baseline (Visit 2), diary  data, including frequency  of micturition (urination episodes) and 
urgency  episodes (grade 3 and 4) with or without incontinence will be reviewed to confirm 
inclusion criteria.
Voiding episodes will be recorded in one of three way s: “urination”, “ incontinence ”, or “both”
in the electr onic diary . Micturitions will be counted for “urination” episodes in which the 
subject fully  voids in the toilet.  “ Incontinence ”will be counted for episodes in which the full 
void was incontinent and the subject did not make it to the toilet to finish urinating . If a 
subject experienced incontinence and then passed urine into the toilet this should be recorded 
as “both”. During anal ysis, “both” will be counted towards micturition and incontinence. In 
addition to micturition information, the electronic diary  will also collect time of medication 
intake and vital signs along with sleep interruption and protective garment use (see Table 1, 
Schedule of Assessments).
5.3.2 Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS)
The Patient Perception of I ntensit y of Urgency  Scale (PPI US) will be completed as part of 
the micturition diary .
For each micturition and/or incontinence episode, subjects will be asked to rate the degree of 
associated urgency  according to the following validated 5 -point scale. The categories are 
recommended b y the Committee for Prop rietary  Medicinal Products [CPMP/EWP/18/01, 
Final].

1 –Mild urgency , I could postpone voiding as long as necessary , without fear of wetting 
myself.
2 –Moderate urgency , I could postpone voiding for a short while, without fear of wetting 
myself.
3 –Severe urgency , I could not postpone voiding, but had to rush to the toilet in order not to 
wet my self.
4 – Urge incontinence, I leaked before arriving at the toilet.
The PPI US w ill be completed at Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and 
Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5).
5.3.3 Total Urgency and Frequency Score (TUFS)
The Total Urgency  and Frequency  Score (TUFS) is calculated by  adding the PPI US score sof 
every  void in a patient’s 3- day diary , and dividing this by  the number of day s recorded in the 
diary [Chapple et al, 2014]. 
5.3.4 International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)
The International Prostate Sy mptom Score (I PSS) consists of seven questions concern ing 
urinary  symptoms and one question concerning quality  of life.
The I PSS will be completed at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), 
Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5).
5.3.5 OAB Symptoms, Quality of Life, Bladder Health and Treatment Benefit
OAB has significant effects on health -related quality  of life (QoL) of afflicted subjects. This 
has been quantified in various empirical studies [Wall et al, 1993]. QoL  is determined by  
socio- demographic, clinical, psy chological an d social factors. This underlies the importance 
of assessing the perceptions of subjects when evaluating the effects of medical or 
pharmacological treatment [Palmtag 2004]. I n this study , the Overactive Bladder-
questionnaire (OAB -q), EQ-5D- 5L, the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), and 
Treatment Satisfaction – Visual Analog Scale (TS -VAS) will be utilized.
5.3.5.1 Overactive Bladder -questionnaire (OAB -q)
OAB s ymptoms and QoL in relation to OAB will be assessed by  the Overactive Bladder-
questionnaire (O AB-q) [Coy ne et al, 2002]. This questionnaire has validated psychometric 
properties, has been used extensively  in QoL -research in respondents with OAB, and has 
been shown to be responsive in treatment studies [Coy ne et al, 2002]. The OAB -q is a self -
report ed questionnaire with 33 items, which contain the dimensions Coping, Concern, Sleep, 
Social Interaction, and a Sy mptom Bother scale with eight sy mptoms [Garely  et al, 2007].
The OAB -q will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and 
End of Treatment (Visit 5).

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 51of 875.3.5.2 Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC)
The Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) is a validated, global assessment tool 
using a 6 -point Likert scale that asks subjects to rate their subjective impression of their 
current bladder condition [Coy ne et al, 2006]. The PPBC questionnaire will be assessed at 
Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and End of Treatment (Visit 5).
5.3.5.3 EQ-5D-5L
The EQ -5D- 5Lis an international standardized non -disease s pecific (i.e., generic) instrument 
for describing and valuing health status. I t has a multidimensional measure of health -related 
QoL, capable of being expressed as a single index value and specificall y designed to 
complement other health status measures [E uroqol, 1990; Herdman et al, 2011].
The EQ -5D- 5Lhas five dimensions: Mobility , Self -Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, 
and Anxiety /Depression. Each dimension has 5 response levels (e.g., no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, severe proble ms, and extreme problems/unable to perform the 
activity ). In addition, it has a visual analog scale that elicits a self -rating b y the respondent of 
his health status.
EQ-5D- 5Lwill be assessed at Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and End 
of Treatment (Visit 5).
5.3.5.4 Treatment Satisfaction – Visual Analog Scale (TS- VAS)
The Treatment Satisfaction –Visual Analog Scale (TS -VAS) is a visual analog scale that 
asks subjects to rate their satisfaction with the treatment by  placing a vertical mark on a line 
that runs from 0 (No, not at all) to 10 (Yes, completely ). The TS -VAS will be assessed at 
Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and End of Treatment (Visit 5).
5.4 Safety Assessment
The safet y evaluation including vital signs, adve rse event recording, clinical laboratory  
assessments and ph ysical examination will be performed according to Table 1, Schedule of 
Assessments.
Requirements related to the evaluation, reporting and anal ysis of Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
(DILI) information are found in Appendix 2(Liver Safety  Monitoring and Assessment). In 
the event of a confirmed, marked hepatic abnormality  as defined in Appendix 2, it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility  to ensure contact with the Sponsor/delegated CRO by  teleph one 
or fax immediately  (i.e., within 24 hours of awareness).
5.4.1 Vital Signs
Vital signs, including pulse rate and blood pressure, will be measured in the diary  for 3 day s 
prior to each visit and at all in- office visits according to Table 1, Schedule of Assessments.
The Investigator responsibility  for reporting the Treatment Emergent Adverse Event ( TEAE )
of hy pertension will be based on office visit measurements and not on diary  review.
For office based vital signs the patient should be seated comfortabl y for at least 5 minutes 
with the back supported, feet on the floor, arm supported in a horizontal position, and the

use the same device and cuff size throughout the study . The same arm should be used 
throughout the stud y.
An AE of h ypertension will be recorded, in dependent of Investigator assessment of clinical 
significance or relatedness, if one of the following criteria is met on 2 or more consecutive 
visits:
1. If the average s ystolic blood pressure is >140 mmHg AND/OR the average diastolic 
blood pressure is >90 mmHg at two consecutive visits after Baseline (Visit 2) in subjects 
who were normotensive (average s ystolic blood pressure <140 mmHg AND average 
diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg )[WHO -ISH, 20 13]at Baseline (Visit 2).
2. If the average s ystolic blood pressure is increased ≥20 mmHg AND/OR the average 
diastolic blood pressure is increased ≥10 mmHg at two consecutive visits as compared to 
Baseline (Visit 2) in subjects with hy pertension at Baseline (Visit 2).
3. If treatment with antihypertensive drugs is IN ITIATED for treatment of hy pertension OR 
if the dose of prior antihypertensive drugs is INCREASED due to an increase in blood 
pressure.
An AE of “increased Blood Pressure” should be considered if the above conditions are not 
met, but a high blood pressure is recorded (seeAppendix 4).
An AE of tach ycardia should be considered if resting heart rate (pulse rate) is > 100 bpm (see
Appendix 5).The Investigator responsibility  for reporting the TEAE will be based on office 
visit measurements and not on diary  review. 
5.4.2 Patient Diary – Subject Measurement Vital Signs
During Visit 1, the Investigator should instruct the subject on how to perform and document 
in the electronic diary  the self -measurement of BP and PR. The subject will have an 
opportunity  to familiarize himself with the self- measurement of BP and PR and recording of 
the data.
The electronic diary  will capture HBPM vital signs. I t will be completed in both the morning 
and evening for 3 consecutive days prior to each visit: Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), 
Week 8 (Visit 4), Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). 
Validated devices for measuring BP and PR will be provided to subjects along with detailed 
operating instructions. At home, according to the “The ABCD’s of Blood Pressure 
Measurement” [American Heart Association, April 2012], the subject should rest for at least 
5 minu tes before taking the measurements. The subject should be quiet and relaxed, sitting in 
a chair with their feet on the floor, legs should not be crossed, and arms should be bare and 
supported at heart level. The cuff should be put on according to the instr uctions of the 
Investigator. The subject should not move and should remain silent during the reading as 
moving and talking can affect the reading. The subject should measure his BP and PR in 
triplicate during the 3 consecutive day s prior to the next visit, on the arm chosen from the 
Screening measurements.

-CONFIDENTIAL -
22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 53of 87Measurement should be taken after waking up in the morning and again in the evening. The 
subject should ensure that the morning measurements of vital signs are taken BEFORE 
breakfast and BEFORE study  medi cation intake. The evening BP measurement is not 
specified in relation to either a meal or the time study  drug was taken. It is recommended to 
be taken after 4 pm and before going to bed. 
Three readings at each occasion should be taken, each about 2 minut es apart. Date, time, 
systolic and diastolic BP, and PR will be documented in the electronic diary. The subject 
should take care to have a 30 minute rest after exercise or smoking or intake of caffeine or 
alcohol, prior to taking a measurement.
5.4.3 Adverse Eve nts
Adverse Event collection will begin from the time of informed consent and continue through 
the Follow -up Phone Call (Visit 6). See Section 5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety 
Aspects for information regarding adverse event collection and data handling.
5.4.3.1 Adverse Events of Possible Hepatic Origin 
See Appendix 2Liver Safety  Monitoring and Assessment for detailed information on liver 
abnormalities, monitoring and assessment, if the AE for a subject enrolled in thestudy  and 
receiving stud y drug is accompanied b y increases in liver function testing (LFT, e.g.: AST, 
ALT, bilirubin, etc.) or is suspected to be due to hepatic dy sfunction. 
Subjects with AEs of hepatic origin accompanied by  Liver Function Test (LFT) 
abnormalities should be carefully  moni tored.
  
5.4.3.2 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse Events of Special I nterest include:
●Blood pressure and pulse rate (defined in Section 5.4.1, anal ysis in Section 7.5.3 )
●Acute urinary  retention (urinary  retention requiring catheterization)
●Benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) requiring surgery .
5.4.4 Laboratory Assessments

*Urine culture and sensitivity must be performed for positive leukocyte esterase (LCE), nitrites, or turbidity, or at the 
discretion of the Investigator . Urine culture and sensitivity at the discretion of the Investigator will be performed at a local 
laboratory. It is not required to send isolated trace positive leukocyte esterase samples for culture.
Clinical significance of out-of- range laboratory  findings is to be determined and documented 
by the Investigator /sub-Investigator who is a qualified phy sician.
Before the start of the study , sampling and shipment procedures will be provided in a 
laboratory  manual. The Investigator may  decide to repeat the tests, should the results be 
outside normal ranges and considered clinically  relevant, or if the original sample could not 
be anal yzed.
If the blood sample at Visit 1 cannot be anal yzed, the test results are considered a lab error or 
the test results are increased related to a temporary  condition unrelated to OAB and likely  to 
resolve at short notice, it is acceptable to repeat the laboratory  tests to check eligibility  
criteria. The subject should be requested to come for an unscheduled visit between Visit 1

randomized. Repeat test to check eligibility  criteria can onl y be repeated once before Visit 2.
Any changes in laboratory  values are to be evaluated by  the Investigator. Clinically  releva nt 
changes must be recorded as AEs in the eCRF (see Section 5.5.1).

The subject will have a phy sical examination performed at Screening/tamsulosin 
hydrochloride run -in (Visit 1) and at Week 12 (Visit 5). This includes examination of main 
body  systems. Date of phy sical examination and any  clinically  relevant adverse findings not 
documented in the medical history  will be recorded a s an AE in the eCRF (see Section 5.5.1).
5.4.6 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Asingle 12-lead ECG will be recorded at Screening/tamsulo sin hy drochloride run- in 
(Visit 1), Basel ine (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and End of Treatment 
(Visit 5). ECG will be taken with the subject in the supine position (subject is allowed to be 
sitting if unable to be supine).
ECGs will be submitted to a central laboratory  to allow for central reading (ECG recordings 
will be performed according to ICH guidelines E14 to make them readable and interpretable 
for potential later assessment by  an independent cardiologist). Recordings will be made at a 
speed of 25 mm/s and all leads have to include at least four complexes. This is according to 
the standard setting on the machines.
The ECGs should be transmitted from the machine to the central laboratory (following the 
steps indicated in the user manual). In addition, one print copy  of the original ECG traces 
should be maintained in the study file. These should be clearl y marked with the subject 
identification number (in such a way  that they  are anony mized), visit date, and visit number, 
and should be kept with the source documents.
The ECG machine will produce automatically  calculated interval duration measurements and 
an evaluation on the printed ECG. The manuall y read analysis reports of the central ECG 
readings will be made available to the Investigators (within 72 hours). The final ECG r eports 
sent by  the central laboratory  must be reviewed b y the I nvestigator and should be used for 
immediate safet y assessment and subject care since there might be slight changes from the 
initial analy sis produced by  the ECG machines.
If the QTcF interval is >450 ms on the printed ECG at Visit 2, an expedited central ECG 
reading (within 24 hours) should be requested. In this case the final ECG report should be 
received/reviewed before the subject is allowed to be randomized.
The ECG report itself should not be captured on the eCRF, but will be captured in the central 
ECG laboratory  database. Only  the visit, ECG date, automated QTc, overall ECG 
interpretation and relevant comments will be captured in the eCRF.

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 56of 87If specific concerns regarding the cardiac safety of a subject exist, a dual approach is 
recommended:
●On-site evaluation of the ECGs should be conducted by  a local cardiologist,
●In addition, the central ECG laboratory  can be contacted (24 hours a day ) to provide 
the final centrally  read ECG analy sis resu lts within a shorter timeframe than the usual 
72 hours (for contact details see the ECG Study  Manual provided by  the central ECG 
laboratory ).
Any abnormalities (based on the Central Reading I nterpretation) must be evaluated in clinical 
context (based on su bject’s medical history  and concomitant medication) and the I nvestigator 
should determine if it is clinically  significant and record with Potentially  Clinically  
Significant (PCS). An y clinically  significant abnormalit yshould be reported as an AE.
5.4.7 Post-Void Residual Volume (PVR)
Post-Void Residual (PVR) volume will be assessed by ultrasonograph y or bladder scan at 
Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run -in (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), 
Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5).
5.4.8 Uroflowmetry
Maximum flow rate (Q max) will be assessed at Screening/tamsulosin hy drochloride run -in 
(Visit 1) and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). The subject must void a minimum of 
125mL for the uroflow measurement to be considered adequate. 
5.4.9 Follow -up Phone Call to Patients
Subjects will be contacted 4 weeks after Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5) by  telephone 
for a Follow -up Phone Call (Visit 6) to assess concomitant medications and any  adverse 
events that may  have occurred following the end of treatment.
5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
Some countries may  have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE.  I n these cases, it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility  to ensure thes e AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriatel y record ed in the (e)CRF accordingly .

EudraCT 2015 -004036 -36
-CONFIDENTIAL -
22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 57of 87An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be define d as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets one of the 
following criteria:
●Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  medication
●The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically  significant in the opinion of the 
Investigator.
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the I nvestigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any  of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life threatening (an adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the I nvestigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
● Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious) 
●Other medicall y important events .
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited repo rting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; bloo d dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Stroke, my ocardial infarction, dy srhythmias, and uncontrolled hy pertension will also be 
examined.
In addition to AEs special situations (SS) (with or without an associated AE) occurring on the 
medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the study  (e.g., study  drug, 
comparator, background therap y) that may require expedited reporting and/or safet y 
evaluation include, but are not l imited to:
●Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
●Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
●Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)

-CONFIDENTIAL -
22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 58of 87● Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name confusion)
All of the events of interest noted abo ve should be recorded on the e CRF. Any  SS that also 
meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded on the AE page of the e CRF and marked 
‘serious’ and the SAE worksheet and submitted to Astellas. 
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an adverse 
event is reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious”, 
additional information on the event may  be requested.  
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "adverse 
events whose relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out".
Causal relationship to 
the study drugCriteria for causal relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal  
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and/or in  which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information 
on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or  other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on re- administration (rechallenge) or 
withdrawal (dechallenge).
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The following standard with 3 grades is to be used to measure the severit y of adverse events, 
including abnormal clinical laboratory  values.
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities
●Severe: Inability to perform dail y activities
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
The reference saf ety information for m irabegron to be used for this stud y is the Company  
Core Data Sheet (CCDS) for mirabegron, Section 4.8 -Undesirable Effects .
Please refer to the reference safet y information for details of prescribing information 
(contraindications, special warnings and precautions).

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 60of 875.5.6 Follow -up ofAdverse Events
All AEs occurring during or after the subject has discontinued the study  are to be followed up 
until resolved or judged to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they  become chronic to 
the extent that they  can be fully  characterized. 
If during AE f ollow -up, the adverse event progresse sto an"SAE ", or if a subject experiences 
a new SAE, the I nvestigator must immediately  report the information to the Sponsor . 
5.5.7 Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events
Common serious adverse events are SAEs commonly anticipated to occur in the study  
population independent of drug exposure. SAEs classified as “common” are provided in
Appendix 3Most Common Serious Adverse Events for reference. The list does NOT 
change your reporting obligations or prevent the need to report an AE meeting the definition 
of an SAE as detailed above. The purpose of this list is to alert y ou that some events reported 
as SAEs may  not require expedited reporting to the regulatory  authorities based on the 
classification of “common serious adverse events” as specified in Appendix 3Common 
Serious Adverse Events .The S ponsor will monitor these events throughout the course of 
the study  for any  change in frequency .Any changes to this list will be communicated to the 
participating investigational sites. I nvestigators must report individual occurrences of these 
events as s tated in Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events. 
5.5.8 Procedure in Case of Pregnancy
If during the conduct of a clinical trial, a male subject impregnates his partner, the subject 
should report the preg nancy to the Investigator. The I nvestigator wil l report the pregnancy  to 
the Sponsor or delegated CRO as an SAE .
5.5.9 Emergency Procedures and Management of Overdose
In the event of suspected overdose, refer to the approved Package Insert, SPC, or local 
product information supplied by  the manufacturer for each agent. 
5.5.10 Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Study
When new information becomes available necessary  for conducting the clinical study  
properl y, the Sponsor will inform all I nvestigators involv ed in the clinical study  as well as the 
regulatory  authorities. Investigators should inform the I RB/IEC of such information when 
needed.

at Screening/tamsulosin hy drochloride run -in (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), 
Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). It is anticipated the total amount 
of blood taken will not exceed 50 mL throughout the duration of the study .
6 DISCONTINUATION
6.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subject(s)
A discontinuation is a subject who enrolled in the study and for whom study  treatment is 
permanentl y discontinued prematurel y for an y reason.  
The subject is free to withdraw from the study  treatment and/or study  for any  reason and at 
any time without giving reason for doing so and wit hout penalty  or prejudice. The 
Investigator is also free to terminate a subject's involvement in the study  at any  time if the 
subject's clinical condition warrants it.
If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory  result that is significantly  outsi de of the reference range, the I nvestigator will 
attempt to provide follow- up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically  
significant. 
Subjects will be discontinu ed if they  meet an y of the following criteria:
●ALT or AST >3x ULN and total bilirubin >2x ULN
●ALT or AST >8x ULN on one occasion
●ALT or AST >5x ULN for more than 2 consecutive weeks
●ALT or AST >3x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%)
Subjects may  also be discontinued for:
●Medically  important adverse event(s)
●Protocol deviation (s) (e.g., subject took prohibited medication that in the Investigator’s 
opinion, after discussion with the Medical Monitor, may  negativel y impact the subject’s 
safet y or demonstrated lack of cooperation in following protocol -specified 
procedures/instructions)
●Withdrawal of consent
● Investigator and/or Sponsor feel it is in the subject’s best interest
6.2 Discontinuation of the Site
If an Investigator intends to discontinue participation in the study , the Investigator must 
immediately  inform the Sponsor.

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 62of 876.3 Discontinuation of the Study
The Sponsor may terminate this study  prematurely , either in its entirety  or at any  study  site, 
for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination. Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  concerns. If 
the Sponsor terminates the study  for saf ety reasons, the Sponsor will immediately notify the 
Investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for study  termination.
7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  the responsible biostatistician of Astellas. A 
Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analysis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before 
database softlock at the latest. Any  deviations from the anal ysis planned in SAP will be 
justified in the Clinical Study  Report (CSR).
Prior to Database Lock, a Final Review of Data and TLFs Meeting will be held to allow a 
review of the clinical trial data and to verify  the data that will be used for analy sis set 
classif ication. If required, consequences for the statistical anal ysis will be discussed and 
documented.  A meeting to determine anal ysis set classifications may  also be held prior to 
database hard lock.
In general, baseline is defined as the last measurement bef ore the first dose of double -blind 
study  drug. For variables based on the electronic diary , the 3 day s of the diary  recorded prior 
to Visit 2/Baseline (Week 0) will be used to derive these variables at baseline just as the 
3diary  days before each post -baseline visit will be used to derive these variables at these 
visits.
The End of Treatment (EOT) visit is defined as the last post- baseline visit during the double -
blind study  period for which data is available. The EOT visit value for diary variables is the
average or number of the diary  measurements for Week 12, as applicable. If no Week 12 
diary  data measurements are available, then the last available earlier post -baseline average or 
number of the diary  measurements within a designated visit window will be used (LOCF). 
Data from the EOT visit will be anal yzed to account for subjects prematurely  terminating the 
study  and is regarded as the primary  visit. The EOT visit will be Week 12/EOT (Visit 5) for 
subjects who complete the study .
All statistical comparis ons will be made using a two -sided test at α = 0.05 significance level 
and confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported with a coverage consistent with this 
significance level unless specified otherwise. 
All efficacy  and safet y variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using the descriptive statistics number of non -missing 
observations (N), mean, standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), minimum, median, 
and maximum unless specified otherwise. C ategorical variables will be described using N 
and percent.

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 63of 877.1 Sample Size
The primary  endpoint for this study  is change from baseline to end of treatment in mean 
number of micturitions per daybased on a 3- day diary .
Based on subgroup anal ysis of prior OAB s tudies, 544subjects ( 272evaluable subjects per 
treatment group )provides 80% power to detect a reduction of 0.65 in the mean number of 
micturitions per dayover placebo in the mirabegron group at an alpha level of 0.05.  A 
standard deviation for change f rom baseline in micturitions of 2.7 was assumed. 
If 85% of the randomized subjects are evaluable, 640subjects should be randomized.  With 
an expected drop- out rate of 35% by the end of the tamsulosin hy drochloride run- in phase
(V2) , 985 subjects need to be screened.
7.2 Analysis Set
Three main anal ysis populations will be defined: Full Anal ysis Set (FAS), Full Anal ysis Set -
Incontinence (FAS -I), and Safety  Anal ysis Set (SAF).
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be laid out in Classific ation Specifications and the 
allocation of subjects to analy sis sets will be determined prior to database hard -lock. 
7.2.1 Full Analysis Set
The FAS will include all subjects who meet all of the following criteria:
● Subjects who took at least 1 dose of double-bl inded study  drug after Randomization,
●Reported at least 1 micturition in the baseline diary  and at least 1 micturition 
post-baseline,
The FAS will be used for the summary  of all baseline characteristics, including demographic, 
disease state data, prior medications, prior medical history  and a statistical anal ysis of 
efficacy  endpoints and QoL  instruments.
7.2.2 Full Analysis Set - Incontinence (FAS -I)
The FAS-I will include all subjects who meet all of the following criteria:
●Subjects who took at least 1 dose of double -blinded study  drug after Randomization,
●Reported at least 1 micturition in the baseline diary  and at least 1 micturition post-
baseline,
●Reported at least 1 incontinence episode in the baseline diary .
The FAS -I will be used for the anal ysis of inc ontinence episodes.
7.2.3 Safety Analysis Set (SAF)
The SAF will consist of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
double -blind study  medication. The SAF will be used for summarizing demographic and 
baseline OAB characteristics and safet y data .

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 64of 877.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and OAB baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics by  treatment group, mirabegron and placebo.
7.4 Analysis of Efficacy 
Efficacy  anal ysis will be conducted on the FAS and PPS. Incontinence episodes will be 
analyzed with the FAS -I. The interpretation of results from statistical tests will be based on 
the FAS.
7.4.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint
7.4.1.1 Primary Analysis
The primary  efficacy variable is change from baseline to end of treatment in mean number of 
micturitions per daybased on a 3 -day electronic diary . The primary  analy sis will be 
performed for the FAS at the EOT visit, i.e. Week 12 for subjects who complete the study  or 
last post -baseline visit during the double -blind study  period for subjects who discontinue 
early.
The hy pothesis for comparison is as follows:
H0: Difference between mirabegron and placebo in change from baseline to end of treatment 
in mean number of micturitions per daybased on a 3- day electronic diary  is 0.
H1: Difference between mirabegron and placebo in change from baseline to end of treatment 
in mean number of micturitions per daybased on a 3- day electronic diary  is not equal to 0.
Change from baseline to end of treatment in mean number of micturitions per daywill be 
analyzed using Analy sis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The response variable will be the mean 
change in number of micturition episodes per dayfrom baseline to end of the stud y with 
treatment group, geographic region , and age group as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. 
Within the framework of this ANCOVA model, LS means and two -sided 95% CI s for the 
mean change from baseline within each treatment group will be provided. Differences in LS 
means between mirabegron and placebo will be derived together with 95% CI s and p -values. 
Further details may  be found in the SAP.
7.4.1.2 Secondary Analysis
The primary  anal ysis will be repeated for completers only , i.e. without utilizing L OCF 
imputation for subjects with missing Week 12 values. Additionally , Week 4 and Week 8 
values will be anal yzed similarly  to End of Treatment.
An anal ysis of change from baseline in mean number of micturitions per dayusing a Mixed 
Model R epeated Measures (MMRM) with age group, geographic region, time (visit), and a 
time-by-treatment interaction as factors and the number of micturition episodes at baseline as 
covariate will serve as another sensitivity  anal ysis. The repeated measures model will present 
LS means and two- sided 95% CI s for changes from baseline within each treatment group.

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 65of 877.4.1.3 Subgroup Analysis
Subgroup anal yses will include anal yses bygeographic region , age group, by previous OAB 
medication ,and reason for treatment termination if previously  treated.  If sample sizes are 
sufficient, subgroup analyses b y race will be performed.  More details on subgroup anal yses 
will be provided in the SAP.
7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary  variables are change to end of treatment in mean incontinence ep isodes per day , 
mean volume voided per micturition, mean number of urgency  episodes (grade 3 and 4) per 
day, IPSS total score and subscales (Voiding, Storage, and Quality  of Life), Sy mptom Bother 
and Total Health related quality  of life scores as assessed by OAB -q questionnaire (and 
subscales) , TUFS, PPBC, EQ -5D- 5L, and TS -VAS.
An anal ysis of change from baseline in PRO values using a Mixed Model Repeated Measures 
(MMRM) with geographic region, age group, time (visit), and a time -by-treatment interaction 
asfactors and PRO value at baseline as a covariate will serve as a sensitivity  analy sis. The 
repeated measures model will present L S means and two- sided 95% CIs for changes from 
baseline within each treatment group.
Analy sis of mean change in number of inco ntinence episodes per dayfrom Baseline to End 
of Treatment will be performed on the FAS -Iusing ANCOVA model , p-values will be 
calculated b y stratified ranking ANCOVA . The response variable is standardized ranks on 
change from Baseline to End of Treatment , with Baseline standardized ranks as covariates 
and geographic region as a stratum. Standardized ranks are used to adjust for differences in 
the number of subjects at each geographic region. Further details may  be found in the 
Statistical Analy sis Plan.
The number of incontinence episodes and protective garment use during the 3 -day diary  
period will be anal yzed using a mixed effects Poisson regression model with treatment group, 
age group, and geographic region as factors and number of incontinence episodes at baseline 
as a covariate. Differences in L S means between mirabegron and placebo will be calculated 
together with 95% CI.
Other secondary  efficacy variables will be anal yzed using the same ANCOVA model as 
described for micturitions (refer to Section 7.4.1.1 ).Descriptive anal yses of the EQ -5D- 5L 
will be in the Clinical Study  Report.  Other planned utility  indices and analy ses will be 
calculated i n a separate report from the Statistical Analy sis Plan and Clinical Study  Report .
Responder analy ses will be performed for 50% reduction in micturition frequency  and for 
number of subjects with less than 8 micturitions per day at End of Treatment.
7.4.3 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints
Subgroup anal yses by PSA cutoff scores for < 2, 2 -4 will be performed.

summarized for Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12/EOT and change from 
Screening to EOT will be summarized by  treatment group.
For each hematology  and biochemistry  laboratory  parameter, laboratory  test results will be 
classified as low (L), normal (N), or high (H) according to the laboratory -supplied reference 
ranges. Shift tables of reference range changes from Screening to Week 12/EOT and most 
extreme value during the double -blind treatment period by  treatment group will be 
summarized.
7.5.3 Vital Signs
Pulse rate, s ystolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure will be summarized by  
treatment gr oup using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum 
and median) for baseline value, post -baseline time point values (Week 4, Week 8, and 
Week 12/EOT), and change from baseline to each post- baseline time points. The average 
change f rom baseline to end of treatment for each vital sign variable will be anal yzed using 
the ANCOVA model with treatment group and geographic region as fixed factors and 
baseline vital sign value as covariate.  Results will be summarized separately  for office based 
measurements and HBPM. No p -values will be calculated.
An anal ysis of change from baseline of vital signs using a Mixed Model Repeated M easures 
(MMRM) model with geographic region, age group, time (visit), and a time -by-treatment 
interaction as facto rs and the baseline values as covariate will serve as another sensitivity  
analysis. The repeated measures model will present L S means and two -sided 95% CIs for 
changes from baseline within each treatment group. 
Number and percentage of subjects with more than 2/5/10/15/20 mmHg increase from 
baseline in SBP, more than 2/ 5/10/15 mmHg increase in DBP or more than 5/10/15 bpm 
increase from baseline in pulse rate, on 2 consecutive post- baseline visits will be summarized 
by treatment group. Number and percentage of subjects with vital sign values shifting 
between JNC -7 defined risk categories will be summarized by  treatment group. These 
categories are listed below:

7.5.4 Physical Examination
Physical examination will be listed by  treatment group.
7.5.5 ECGs
ECG variables (heart rate, PR interval, RR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc 
interval) will be summarized using frequency  tables and percentages for each treatment group 
at Baseline, Week 4, W eek 8, and Week 12/EOT, including changes from Baseline to EOT.
The overall ECG interpretation from the local Investigator (normal, abnormal –not clinically  
significant, abnormal –clinically  significant) will be summarized by  treatment group and 
visit. A lso a shift table will be produced for showing the shift from baseline by treatment 
group and visit. Parameters from central ECG readings (QT, QTcB, QTcF, HR, PR, QRS, 
RR, coded abnormalities and overall conclusion) and their change from baseline will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics by  treatment group and visit. Numbers and 
percentages of subjects with QTcF values >450 ms, >480 ms or >500 ms or with ch anges 
from baseline in QTcF ≥30 msec or ≥60 msec will be summarized by  treatment group.
7.5.6 PVR
PVR volume and its change from baseline will be summarized by  treatment and visit. Shifts 
in PVR from baseline to each visit and from baseline to worst post- baseline value will be 
produced.   Number and percentag es of subjects with a PVR > 200 ml will be tabulated.  
7.5.7 Q max
Qmaxwill be anal yzed from change from baseline (collected at the beginning of the run- in

Protocol deviations as defined in Section 8.1.6 Protocol Deviations will be summarized for 
all randomized subjects by treatment group and total as well as b y site. A data listing will be 
provided b y site and subject.
Theprotocol deviation criteria will be uniquely  identified in the summary  table and listing. 
The unique identifiers will be as follows:
PD1 - Entered into the study  even though they  did not satisfy  entry  criteria, 
PD2 - Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and was not withdrawn,
PD3 - Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose,
PD4 - Received excluded concomitant treatment. 
Any other anal yses will be specified in the Statistical Anal ysis Plan (SAP).
7.9 Interim Analysis (and Early Discontinuation of the Clinical Study)
No formal interim anal ysis is planned.
7.10 Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows, and Other 
Information
For efficacy  variables and vital sign data, anal ysis at End of Treatment will take into account 
subjects who withdraw before Week 12 and therefore do not have efficacy  measurements 
available for that visit. The End of Treatment analysis is a Last Observation Carried Forward 
(LOCF) approach. As a secondary  anal ysis, a mixed model repeated measures anal ysis will 
be performed for selected variables as described in Sections 7.4.1 and 7.4.2
Other imputation rules to account for missing data will be described in the SAP.
Subjects do not alway s adhere strictl y to the visit timing the protocol. Visit windows around 
the target day s for each visit will be defined in the SAP.

when the source documents are subject to direct access.
8.1.5 Data Management
Data Management will be coordinated b y the CRO appointed by  the Sponsor in accordance 
with the CRO’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data management. All study  
specific processes and definitions will be documented by  Data Management. Coding of 
medical terms and medications will be performed using MedDRA and World Health 
Organization (WHO ) Drug Dictionary  respectively . Data analy sis will be performed 
according to Astellas data standards .
8.1.6 Protocol Deviations
A protocol deviation is generall y an unplanned excursion from the protocol th at is not 
implemented or intended as a s ystematic change. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring 
the study  is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this 
protocol and must protect the rights, safet y, and welfare of s ubjects. The Investigator should 
not implement any  deviation from, or changes of, the protocol, unless it is necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects.  
A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an I nvesti gator to 
deviate from the protocol. Protocol waivers are strictly  prohibited.
For the purposes of this protocol, deviations requiring notification to Sponsor are defined as 
any subject who: 
●Entered into the study  even though they  did not satisfy  entry  criteria
●Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and not withdrawn
●Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose
● Received excluded concomitant treatment. 
When a deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the I nvestigator or 
designee must ens ure the Sponsor is notified. The Sponsor will follow -up with the 
Investigator, as applicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact to the safet y and / 
or efficacy  of the subject to determine subject continuation in the study . 
If a deviation impacts the safet y of a subject, the Investigator must contact the Sponsor 
immediately .
The I nvestigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory  
authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriat ely. All documentation and

22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 81of 8712.2 Appendix 2: Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment
If laboratory  testing for a subject enrolled in study and receiving stud y drug reveals an 
increase in serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3X ULN, bilirubin > 2 × ULN, at least all four 
of the usual serum hepatic measures ( ALT, AST, AL P, and TBL) must be repeated . Testing 
should be repeated within 48 -72 hours of notification of the test results. A lerts will be 
generated b y the central lab reg arding moderate and severe liver abnormality  to inform the 
Investigator, study  monitor and study  team. Subjects should be asked if they  have any  
symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3× ULN or > 2× ULN
Severe* > 3× ULN and > 2× ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8× ULN
●ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks  
●ALT or AST > 3× ULN and INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3× ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tender ness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
The I nvestigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , 
physical examination and laboratory  tests. The site should complete th e Liver Abnormalit y 
Case Report Form (LA -CRF) or an appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal 
liver function testing should be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2- 3 times weekly  then weekl y or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study  drug has been discontinued an d the subject is 
asymptomatic.
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology , may  be considered an important medical event and may  be reported as a Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE).  The Sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for

-CONFIDENTIAL -
22 Jan 2018 Astellas Page 82of 87whom severe hepatic liver function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are 
observed.
To further assess abnormal he patic laboratory  findings, the Investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘adverse events’ on the AE page of the 
(e)CRF. Illnesses and conditions such as h ypotensive events, and decompensated cardiac 
disease that may  lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Non -alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients 
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels.   The Investigator should 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non- presc ription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets.  Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medication page of the (e)CRF.  Information on alcohol, other substanc e use, and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
●Based on the subject’s history ,  other testing may  be appropriate including: 
oacute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) 
oultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
oother laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or 
acute liver disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subjec t may  be 
discontinued from the study . The Investigator may determine that it is not in the subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered 
if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated)
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia ( > 5%).

Investigator Criteria for Determining TEAE of Hypertension
During each office visit a sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured . The 
Investigator responsibility for reporting the TEAE of hy pertension will be based on office 
visit measure ments and not on diary  review. 
For post -baseline assessments, the I nvestigator will use the following criteria, as defined in 
the protocol, to determine if a subject is considered hy pertensive:
An AE of h ypertension will be recorded if one of the following criteria is met on 
2consecutive visits:
1.If the average s ystolic blood pressure is ≥ 140 mmHg AND/OR the average d iastolic 
blood pressure is ≥ 90 mmHg at two consecutive visits after Baseline (Visit 2) in subjects 
who were normotensive (averag e systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg and averag e 
diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg [WHO -ISH, 201 3]) at Baseline (Visit 2).
2.If the average s ystolic blood pressure is increased >20 mmHg AND/OR the average 
diastolic b lood pressure is increased > 10 mmHg at two consecutive visits as compared 
to Baseline (Visit 2) in subjects with hy pertension at Baseline (Visit 2).
3.If treatment with antih ypertensive drugs is initiated for treatment of hy pertension or if 
the dose of prior antihy pertensive drugs is incr eased due to an increase in blood pressure.
In addition, the Investigator can record an A E based on clinical assessment.

Investigator Criteria for Determining TEAE of Tach ycardia
During each office visit pulse rate will be measured .  The Investigator responsibility  for 
reporting the TEAE of tachy cardia will be based on office visit measurements and not on 
diary  review.  Tach ycardia is defined as a rest ingheart frequency  > 100 beats per minute 
(bpm) measured as pulse rate. If pulse rate is > 100 bpm at the office visit, the I nvestigator is 
to record an AE of tach ycardia. However, if the Investigator’s clinical assessment was that 
this did not constitute an AE of tach ycardia, then an AE will as not be recorded.

Study Title:  
A prospective P hase 3, double -blind, multicenter, randomized study of  the efficacy and safety 
of sulopenem followed by s ulopenem etzadroxil with probenecid versus ertapenem followed 
by ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or amoxicillin -clavulanate for treatment of complicated 
intra-abdominal infections in adults . 
Study Number:  
IT001 -303 
Study Phase:  Phase 3  
Primary Objective(s) :  
To compare the efficacy  of sulopenem followed by s ulopenem etzadroxil with probenecid 
versus ertapenem followed by ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or  amoxicillin -clavulanate for 
treatment of complicated intra -abdominal infection  in adults , on Day 28 (test of cure  [TOC ]) 
post randomization . 
Secondary Objective(s) :  
To compare the efficacy outcomes at other relevant time points as well as the safety profile of 
treatment with s ulopenem followed by sulopenem etzadroxil plus probenecid versus 
ertapenem followed by ciprofloxacin and m etronidazole or amoxicillin -clavulanate for 
treatme nt of complicated intra -abdominal infection in adults .  
To assess the population PK profile of sulopenem when administered either intravenously or 
as the prodrug , sulopenem etzadroxil , co-administered with  probenecid.  
Study Design:   
Sulopenem is an investigational penem antibiotic being developed for treatment of 
uncomplicated urinary tract infection s (uUTI ), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) 
and complicated intra -abdominal infections (cIAI). S ulopenem etzadroxil is an oral pro- drug 
of sulopenem. Upon oral absorption, s ulopenem etzadroxil  is expected to be rapidly 
hydrolyzed to yield sulopenem, the active  moiety, as well as  the non- active moieties , 
formaldehyde and 2- ethylbutyric acid (2 -EBA).   
Sulopenem possesses potent activity against species of the Enterobacteriaceae that encode 
ESBLs or AmpC -type β -lactamases that confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins. 
Sulopenem etzadroxil is expected to be the first oral penem on the market in  the United States

switch therapy for early discharge of patients hospitalized with serious complicated 
infections.  Probenecid, co- administered with the oral prodrug, will reduce renal clearance 
and increase systemic exposure of the active moiety, sulopenem.   
This Phase 3, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, controlled study compares IV 
sulopenem followed by s ulopenem etzadroxil with probenecid and ertapene m IV followed by 
oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or  amoxicillin -clavulanate for treatment of cIAI. The 
site pharmacist will be unblinded in order to prepare the intravenous study medications and 
select the appropriate oral follow on therapy for patien ts randomized to the ertapenem 
regimen. Approximately 670 adult s with c IAI will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive 
either IV sulopenem 1000 mg once daily for at least 5 days followed by s ulopenem etzadroxil 
500 mg co -administered with oral probeneci d 500 mg twice daily to complete 7- 10 days of 
treatment or  ertapenem IV 1000 mg once daily for at least 5 days followed by ciprofloxacin 
and metronidazole  or amoxicillin -clavulanate to complete 7- 10 days of therapy . Duration of 
therapy in both treatment gr oups may be extended up to a total duration of 14 days if both (a) 
approved by the medical monitor, and (b) the patient  has either  multiple abscesses or non -
appendix -related diffuse peritonitis  AND has one of the following: fever  or hypothermia  
(temperatur e ≥38°C  or <35°C ), leukocytosis defined as WBC  ≥12,000/mm3, or ileus . 
The primary outcome measure (clinical response) for the efficacy evaluation will be assessed 
programmatically on Day 28 (TOC) as either:  
Clinical cure , defined as :  
• Patient is alive  
• Resolution in baseline signs and symptoms of the index infection 
o No new symptoms  
• No new antibiotics or interventions for treatment failure are required  
Clinical failure , defined as:  
• death due to cIAI  
• Surgical site wound infection requiring non- study systemic antibiotic therapy  
• Unplanned surgical procedures or percutaneous drainage procedures for complication 
or recurrence of cIAI based on documented worsening symptoms or signs of cIAI  
• Initiation of non- trial antibacterial drug therapy for treatment of cIAI b ased on 
documented worsening symptoms or signs of cIAI  
If data are unavailable to determine if the patient is a cure or a failure, the patient outcome 
will be considered an indeterminate response.  
For the primary efficacy evaluation, the proportions of pat ients achieving cure, failure  or 
indeterminate  will be determined in the  microbiologic -modified int ent to treat population (m -
MITT). The m -MITT population will be comprised of all randomized patients who received 
at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline pathogen causing cIAI isolated from a 
culture specimen taken at baseline, prior to initiation of study drug therapy.

Confidential  Page 12 of 74 Study drug administration will b e documented in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual.  
Both Treatment Groups :  
In both treatment groups, patients found to have pathogens isolated from blood cultures that 
are resistant to carbapenems including ertapenem should be discontinued from study dru g 
therapy, but should remain in the study and treated appropriately. Patients found to have 
pathogens isolated from intra -abdominal cultures  that are resistant to carbapenems including 
ertapenem, may be allowed to continue on study drug therapy based on cl inical response and 
investigator judgement.  
Dosing with food: Food significantly increases bioavailability of sulopenem and consequently 
results in decreased rates of diarrhea. Therefore, dosing of oral sulopenem  
etzadroxil /probenecid with food whenever possible is recommended.  Since adequate target 
attainment appears to be achieved in the fasted state, an inability to administer the dose with 
food should not preclude dosing. The overall absorption of ciprofloxacin is not substantially 
affected by food.  
Efficacy Assessments:  
The assessment of clinical response includes a review of the following signs and symptoms  of 
cIAI:  fever, leukocytosis, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen 
saturation, abdominal pain or tenderness, abdominal mass , altered mental status , and nausea 
or vomiting.  
Microbiologic response assessments will be made based on cultures performed on collected 
surgical  specimens.  
Other Assessments  
Plasma sampling for population PK evaluations will be collected in a subse t of patients at 
selected study sites.  
Safety Assessment s 
Safety will be assessed by means of vital signs, collection of adverse events and clinical 
laboratory tests. A targeted p hysical examinatio n will be performed at the Screening visit, 
Day 5, Day 10 (+/- 1 day ) or Day 11 -14 (+/ - 1 day ), and  Day 28 (+/- 1 day ) visits  or at 
premature discontinuation;  a targeted physical examination may also be performed as needed 
according to symptoms. V ital signs will be collected at the Screening Visit, and at Day 5, Day 
10 (+/ - 1 day ) or Day 11 -14 (+/ - 1 day ), and Day 28  (+/- 1 days ) or premature

Confidential  Page 13 of 74 at trial entry with no new symptoms such that no new antibiotics or interventions are 
required . 
The proposed sample size  for the ITT population is 670 patients.  This IT T sample size 
estimate is based on the assumption that 80%, or 536 patients, of t his ITT population will be 
m-MITT evaluabl e.  The sample size of the m -MITT population is 268 patients per arm  based 
on a Z -test with unpooled variance . This 536 m -MITT sample  size assumes a non -inferiority 
margin of 10%, a power of 90%, a one -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a n 85% clinical cure 
rate in both treatment groups . The final ITT sample size may be increased  based on the 
observed clinical cure  rate at the blinded inter im analysis , as well as the evaluability rate, to 
maintain a power of 90%. 
General Statistical Considerations:    
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and 
the numbers, means, standard deviations, medians,  minimums, and maximums for continuous 
variables will be provided. All comparisons will be for sulopenem/ sulopenem etzadroxil plus 
probenecid versus ertapenem/  ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole or amoxicillin -clavulanate. 
Exploratory analyses may also be pe rformed.  Listings of individual patient’s data will be 
produced.  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to the interim 
analysis.  
Efficacy Analyses:    
The study is designed to determine whether sulopenem/ sulopenem etzadrox il co-administered 
with probenecid is NI to ertapenem/ ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole  or amoxicillin -
clavulanate for the outcome measure of clinical  response  on Day 28.  
The number and percentage of patients assessed as a clinical cure, failure and indeterminate  
will be determined in each treatment group  in the m -MITT population. The observed 
difference in the percentage of patients  with a clinical cure at Day 28 (+/- 1 day ) 
(sulopenem/ sulopenem etzadroxil plus probenecid group minus the ertapenem/ ciproflo xacin 
plus metronidazole  or amoxicillin -clavulanate group) will be determined and a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the observed difference will be computed using a Z -statistic . The 
NI hypothesis test is a one -sided hypothesis test performed at the 2.5% l evel of significance. 
If the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in clinical cure rates in the m -MITT 
population is greater than - 10% the NI of sulopenem to the comparator  group  will be 
concluded.  
Safety analyses will be conducted in the Safety po pulation (all patients who received any 
amount of study drug).  Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs, laboratory 
evaluations, and vital signs. All safety analyses will be based on the Safety population and 
will be summarized by treatment group.

1.1 Indication  
Sulopenem is being studied for the treatment of the following indications:  
- Complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections  
- Compli cated in tra-abdominal infection s 
1.2 Background and Rationale  
β-lactam antimicrobials are widely recognized for their efficacy and low toxicity and form the 
cornerstone of therapy for the treatment of infections caused by gram -positive and gram -
negative bacteria.  How ever, extensive use of β -lactams during the past 50  years has resulted in 
the development of microbial resistance to these agents among clinically important bacteria.   
This resistance commonly takes the form of β -lactamase production , expression of porins in the 
bacterial outer membrane  or alterations in penicillin -binding proteins (PBPs).  Such mechanisms 
have reduced the clinical utility of frequently prescribed β -lactams such as amoxicillin, 
amoxicillin plus clavulanate (a β -lactamase inhibitor), and cep halosporins.  The issue of 
resistance continues to drive the search for new compounds with increased stability and efficacy 
against resistant pathogens. 
The prevalence of infections caused by extended -spectrum β -lactamases (ESBL) producing 
Enterobacteriaceae has been increasing worldwide and includes both hospital acquired and 
community onset infections. An analysis of data reported from 2011 to 2014 to the National 
Healthcare Safety Network performed by the Centers for Disease Control in March 2016 
revealed that the proportion of E.coli  resistant to extended -spectrum cephalosporins causing 
hospital -acquired infection was 13.4% nationally, with rates as high as 24% reported in some 
Northeastern, Southern and Western states.  The same analysis also demonstrat ed that over a 
third of E.coli  isolates in 2014 were resistant to quinolones. Oral antibiotic treatment options are 
extremely limited for patients with these infections, resulting in lengthy hospital stays to 
facilitate administration of intravenous antibiotics . Data reported by the European Antimicrobial 
Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS -NET) in Europe demonstrate that the prevalence of 
quinolone resistant E.coli  and E.coli  resistant to third -generation cephalosporins is > 25% and 
E.coli  resistant to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and quinolones has 
increased to >10% in some southern and eastern European countries. Consequently, options for 
oral antibiotic step -down therapy for patients with resistant gram- negative infections are limited.  
Sulopenem (CP -70,429) is a broad- spectrum penem β -lactam antibiotic which is being 
developed for the treatment of infections caused by multi -drug resistant bacteria. Sulopenem 
possesses potent activity against species of the Enterobacteriaceae that encode ESBLs or 
AmpC -type β -lactamases that confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins. The targeted 
gram -negative spectrum of sulopenem is balanced by its potent in vitro  activity against 
anaerobic pathogens, which is similar to that of imipenem.  
An in -vitro susceptibility study of sulopenem was conducted in April 2016 utilizing 
contemporary clinical bacterial isolates from patients in the United States and Europe. Minimal 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sulopenem and 18 comparators were determ ined against

Confidential  Page 23 of 74 1,122 recent (2013- 2015) clinical isolates following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
(CLSI) guidelines.   The study collection included 872 aerobes (811 gram -negative, 61 gram -
positive) and 250 anaerobes.  Isolates were chosen rand omly from the IHMA (International 
Health Management Associates, Inc., Schaumburg, IL) repository, which is a global collection 
of single patient clinical isolates.    For this study the  selection of isolates focused on infection 
source (IAI and UTI) and reg ion (US and Europe) for the inclusive years . Aerobes were tested 
by broth microdilution and anaerobes were tested by agar dilution. Results from this study 
presented below demonstrate that sulopenem retains potent in vitro activity against common 
pathogens  implicated in urinary tract infections and intra -abdominal infections, including those 
that are caused by organisms that produce ESBLs.  Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
(CRE) were excluded from the analysis shown below, but the MIC 90 of Enterobacte riaceae 
remains at 0.25 µg/mL even if CRE are included, given that their overall prevalence is low (data 
on file) .

As in the case of most β -lactams, sulopenem is not active against methicillin -resistant 
staphylococci or MDR enterococci. Sulopenem also does not have  activity against 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, therefore its broad use for treating such cephalosporin- resistan t 
hospital isolates should not select for resistant P. aeruginosa as can occur with imipenem and 
meropenem.  
Sulopenem is available as an intravenous formulation (CP -70,429 is active moiety). Intravenous 
sulopenem was previously evaluated in Phase 1 and Pha se 2 clinical studies in Japan in 
approximately 1474 subjects, at doses up to 1 g BID administered intravenously over 3 -14 days 
in the early 1990’s. Safety data collected from these trials regarding both adverse events as well 
as laboratory examinations pr ovides support for the safety and tolerability of sulopenem in 
patients and its further development.   
Sulopenem and its oral pro- drug, sulopenem etzadroxil, have been studied in single and multiple 
dose Phase 1 studies, and the oral prodrug has been studi ed with and without co- administration 
of probenecid. One small Phase 2 study in patients with community acquired pneumonia was

receive either: a single loading dose o f intravenous (IV) sulopenem with switch to oral 
sulopenem etzadroxil , 4 dose minimum of IV sulopenem with switch to oral sulopenem 
etzadroxil , or ceftriaxone (IV) for a minimum of 2 doses, with step down to amoxicillin/  
clavulanate. The cure rates in the clinically evaluable subjects in this study at TOC were 90%, 
88% and 63% in the single IV dose sulopenem, multiple IV dose sulopenem and ceftriaxone 
groups (IV), respectively. While these efficacy results were not statistically significant due to 
the small numbers enrolled, they provide encouraging support for further clinical testing in this 
indication .  Phase 2 studies in patients with urinary tract infection or intra -abdominal infection 
have not been conducted in the United States. 
Sulopenem etzadroxil  has minimal in vitro  antibacterial activity.  Upon oral absorption, 
sulopenem etzadroxil  yields the active moiety sulopenem  in addition to the non- active moieties 
forma ldehyde  and 2- ethylbutyric acid (2 -EBA) .  
The currently proposed study will compare the s afety, tolerability and efficacy of sulopenem  
followed by sulopenem  etzadroxil  co-administered with oral probenecid with ertapenem 
followed by  oral ciprofloxacin  and metronidazole  or amoxicillin -clavulanate for the treatment of 
complicated  intra -abdominal infection. 
1.2.1  Safety data 
1.2.1.1  Sulopenem etzadroxil  (oral prodrug)  
Pre-clinical data  
The non- clinical program to assess toxicity of sulopenem etzadroxil  consisted of acute oral and 
repeat -dose toxicity studies, safety pharmacology studies, genetic toxicity assessm ents, and 
reproductive development toxicity studies in multiple species of animals .  Following oral 
administration of sulopenem etzadroxil  in rats and monkeys, circulating concentrations of 
sulopenem etzadroxil  were variable and minimal or below limits of quantitation, whereas 
significant levels of sulopenem and 2- EBA were present in whole blood. Effects observed in 
rats and monkeys from the repeat dose toxicology studies were generally consistent with those 
expected from the active moiety sulopenem. The NO AEL in the rat is 100 mg/kg with a C max 
of 1.90 µg/mL and AUC of 7.24 µg•h/mL for sulopenem, and the NOAEL in the monkey is 50 
mg/kg with a C max of 4.63 µg/mL and an AUC of 11.1 µg•h/mL for sulopenem, respectively. 
Sulopenem etzadroxil  was negative in muta genicity and in vivo clastogenicity tests but 
positive for clastogenic activity in human lymphocytes. Sulopenem etzadroxil  had no effects 
on male and female rat fertility and early embryonic development and was not teratogenic to 
rats or rabbits. Developme ntal toxicity was observed in both rats and rabbits with the NOAEL 
being 100 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, at doses where maternal toxicity was also 
observed.

The sulopenem etzadroxil  clinical studies have investigated the phar macokinetics, safety and 
tolerabi lity of single oral doses  ranging from 400 mg to 8000 mg. The pharmacokinetics, 
safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of sulopenem etzadroxil  at a dose of 2000 mg 
BID for 10 days and 1200 mg plus 1000 mg probenecid BID for 10 days, 500 mg, 1000 mg 
and 1500 mg BID for 7 days have also been investigated.  
Single doses of sulopenem etzadroxil  of 400 mg, 600 mg, 1000 mg, and 2000 mg produced 
an approximately linear increase in sulopenem mean exposure. The apparent terminal half 
life of sulopenem was generally dose independent and ranged from 0.76 hours to 1.10 hours. 
Mean time to observed maximum concentration (T max) was on average 1 hour for all doses. 
Neither sulopenem etzadroxil  nor formic acid has been detected in eit her plasma or whole 
blood following dosing with s ulopenem etzadroxil . In addition, the levels of 2 EBA were 
much lower (~1/20) than sulopenem concentrations. During the administration of multiple 
doses of  sulopenem etzadroxil  for 10 days due to the short half -life of sulopenem there is no 
accumulation on Day 10 of dosing.  Sulopenem etzadroxil  doses of 2000 mg produced a 
mean sulopenem C max of 4.7 µg/mL and a mean AUC last of 13.1 h•µ g/mL. Sulopenem 
systemic exposure parameters (C max and AUC last) following s ulopenem etzadroxil  single 
doses ranging from 400 to 2000 mg, increased in a dose -related manner.  
There is a significant effect of food (high fat  meal) on the PK of sulopenem, given as 
sulopenem etzadroxil  orally. The mean AUC inf  and C max increased 69% and 13.5% 
respectively, with a longer mean time above MIC of 1 µg/ mL (1.91 hours).  Mean t 1/2 was 
similar between the fed and fasted states (0.98 -1.14 hr).  
The concentrations of radioactivity in plasma and whole blood, the excretion of radioactivity 
and the metabolic pathways of [14C] sulopenem etzadroxil  have been determined in healthy 
male volunteers (N = 4) following single oral solution (2000 mg)  administration. The majority 
of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine and feces (40.8 and 44.3% respectively). Total 
mean recovery of radioactivity ranged from 80.2 to 95%. 
Overall sulopenem etzadroxil  was well tolerated in the P hase 1 program. The most common 
adverse events occurring in the program were  diarrhea and abnormal urine odor.

Preclinical intravenous data  
In non -clinical evaluations of intravenous administration of sulopenem , the NOAEL in the 
2-week toxi city study in rats was 200 mg/kg with extrapolated AUC (0-tlast) of 50  µg•h/mL.  
NOAEL was based on increases in kidney and liver weights, erythema, and salivation at 
800 mg/kg.  
The NOAELs in the 4 -week toxicity studies in rats and monkeys were both 60 mg/ kg.  In rats, 
the NOAEL was based on a slight decrease in RBC parameters and increases in liver, kidney, 
and cecum weights at ≥ 60 mg/kg.  In monkeys, the NOAEL was based on a decrease in RBC 
parameters and increased bilirubin at 200 mg/kg.  
The NOAELs in t he 3-month studies were 120 mg/kg in the rat; AUC (0-tlast) of 29.2 ug•hr/mL 
(AUC (0-tlast) represents 0 -2 h), and 60 mg/kg in the monkey; AUC (0-tlast) of 49.2 ug•hr/mL; 
(AUC (0-tlast) represents 0 -8 h).  The NOAEL in rats was based on adverse effects on body  weight 
and food consumption, and slight decreases in RBC parameters at 600 mg/kg.  The NOAEL in 
monkeys was based on a positive Direct Coombs test result, decreases in RBC parameters, 
increased bilirubin, moribundity in 2 animals, bone marrow hyperplasia,  and soft stools at 
200 mg/kg.  
No change in heart rate or QTc was observed in a single- dose cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study in anesthetized dogs up to 300 mg/kg, yielding an average blood level of 
258 µg/mL (total). Similarly, no change in heart rate or QTc was observed in the cardiovascular 
study in telemetry -implanted monkeys at 1000 mg/kg, yielding a blood concentration of 
2270 µg/mL (total).    
In a safety pharmacology study evaluating the effect on the hERG potassium channel, 
sulopenem  inhibi ted the hERG current by approximately 50% at the maximum concentration of 
300 µM (105 µg/mL; free).  There were no changes in action potential duration in the in vitro  
Purkinje fiber assay at concentrations up to 300 µM (105 µg/mL; free).   
Previous human experience (intravenous)  
The pharmacokinetics and safety of sulopenem  have been evaluated in Phase 1 single and 
multiple dose studies. Doses of 400 mg, 800 mg, 1600 mg, 2400 mg and 2800 mg of sulopenem  
were evaluated in a single dose ascending study, and doses of 800 mg infused over 3 hours, 1200 
mg infused over 1 hour, 1200 mg infused over 2.5 hours, 1600 mg infused over 1.5 hours for 14 
days and 2000 mg infused over 1.5 hours for 7 days were evaluated in a multiple dose study in 
healthy volunteers (8 subj ects in each dose group). There were no deaths or serious adverse 
events (SAEs) in either study. One subject who received 1200 mg IV BID was discontinued on 
Day 4 from study drug therapy due to an adverse event (AE) of mildly increased troponin (0.107 
ng/m L [normal limit <0.04  ng/mL]); the AE was reported to be resolved on Day 8. The most 
frequently reported AEs were gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting). Severe AEs included 
nausea and vomiting, and were reported only in the highest dose groups (>2000 mg), indicating 
that MTD had been reached. All AEs in the lower dose groups (<2000 mg) were considered mild 
to moderate in severity. No clinical laboratory abnormalities occurred that were considered to be 
clinically significant by the investigator. There were no vital signs or ECG changes (including 
QTc interval changes) of clinical concern.

Confidential  Page 27 of 74 Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a dose proportional increase in C max and AUC last. The mean t 
½ remained constant over the dose range. Following a 1 hour intravenous  infusion, all doses 
higher than 400 mg produced mean concentrations above 1.0 μg/mL for > 3.3 hours, allowing 
for a twice daily dosing and potentially a single daily dose with a longer infusion duration.  
In healthy adults, intravenous sulopenem  doses up to 1000 mg  BID were studied in 3 small 
Phase 1 studies (two in Japan and one in the US) in the early 1990’s; sulopenem  was well 
tolerated.  The mean C max and AUC inf were 61.5 µg/mL and 51.9 µg•h/mL, respectively for a 
single 1000 mg dose infused over 30 minutes in the Japanese study.  The mean C max and AUC inf 
were 69.8 µg/mL and 54.1 µg•h/mL, respectively, for a single 1000 mg dose infused over 
10 minutes in the US study.  
The IV formulation of sulopenem  was also investigated in four Phase  2 clinical efficacy studies 
in Japan in the early 1990s.  Fourteen hundred and seventy six  patients with hospital and 
community acquired infections were administered primarily 250 or 500 mg BID dosing 
regimens of IV sulopenem  for 3 to 14 days.   
Complete information on sul openem etzadroxil  and sulopenem  are available in the Investigator’s 
Brochure . 
1.2.2  Rationale for Study  
ß-lactam antimicrobials are widely recognized for their efficacy and low toxicity and form the 
cornerstone of therapy for the treatment of infections caused by gram -positive and gram -
negative bacteria. However, extensive use of ß -lactams during the past 50 years has  resulted in 
the development of microbial resistance to these agents among clinically  important bacteria. This 
resistance commonly takes the form o f ß-lactamase production , development of porins  or 
alterations in penicillin -binding proteins (PBPs). Such mechanisms have reduced the clinical  
utility of frequently prescribed ß- lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanate  (a ß-
lactamase inhi bitor), and cephalosporins. The issue of resistance continues to drive the  search for 
new compounds with increased stability and activity against resistant pathogens. Nowhere is the 
importance of resistance more evident than among agents of the ß- lactam  family.  
For Escherichia coli , ampicillin resistance has risen to ≥50% in high- risk populations, and 
resistance to third generation cephalosporins is now increasingly common  in certain  areas. Only 
through the recognition of factors associated with increasing resistance and the mechani sms 
responsible can strategies be designed for minimizing ß- lactam resistance. As antibiotic 
resistance leads to increased costs of treatment, increased morbidity as well as  increased 
mortality, there is an unmet urgent medical need for antimicrobial agents that can  be utilized in 
serious hospital and community infections, especially agents that can be delivered orally. 
The penems are considered to exhibit advantages to the ß- lactam class as they possess good  
antibacterial activity against gram -negative pat hogens commonly  responsible for a wide range of 
community and hospital infections, and are stable to many  ß-lactamases.  
Sulopenem has in vitro activity against many common hospital pathogens, including  extended 
spectrum ß -lactamase (ESBL) producing gram -negative pathogens (except  Pseudomonas spp., 
Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas spp.), and anaerobes  such as Bacteroides fragilis .

Confidential  Page 28 of 74 Rationale for probenecid  
Probenecid has been shown in a dog model to increase the systemic exposure of a penem 
CP-65,207 ( sulopenem [ CP-70,429]  is the S -isomer of CP -65,207) by about 2- fold, suggesting a 
role of active renal tubular secretion in drug elimination. Findings from a previous clinical 
pharmacokinetic study indicate that renal clearance accounts for a significant pr oportion 
(approximately 50%) of total clearance of sulopenem  in healthy volunteers suggesting that 
probenecid could increase exposure and thus time over MIC for sulopenem .  Probenecid is 
known to increase plasma levels of weak organic acids such as penicil lins, cephalosporins, and 
other beta -lactam antibiotics, including penems, by competitively inhibiting their renal tubular 
secretion.   Probenecid has been used safely with other beta -lactam antibiotics, to either reduce 
dose or dosing frequency of beta -lactams when used to treat infectious diseases in human beings.  
Please refer to  probenecid product label  for more pharmacology information on probenecid.  
The pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of sulopenem etzadroxil  in combination with 
probenecid 1000 mg was evaluated in 6 subjects in Study A8811006. Escalating oral doses of 
sulopenem etzadroxil  administered with 1000 mg probenecid produced approximately 
proportional increases in systemic exposure of sulopenem  over the dose range of 800 mg to 1200 
mg. The combination of sulopenem etzadrozil 500 mg and probenecid 500 mg was evaluated in 
study IT001- 101. R esults from this study were consistent with those observed in previous 
studies. 
Thus probenecid has the potential to be used as a PK booster with s ulopenem etzadroxil , 
optimizing the time over MIC for any given sulopenem dose while minimizing the 
gastrointestinal exposure of the parent compound and subsequent gastrointestinal adverse events 
such as diarrhea.   
Rationale for dosing with food  
In a multiple dose (A8811003) study, at higher doses of sulopenem etzadroxil , there is a higher 
rate of gastrointestinal symptoms especially diarrhea in a fasted state.  It has therefore been 
postulated that if the fraction of s ulopenem etzadroxil  absorbed and bioavaila bility of sulopenem  
(the active moiety) can be increased, the gastrointestinal toleration and pharmacokinetics of the 
compound can be improved. 
In Study A8811008 there was an increase in relative bioavailability of sulopenem  when 
sulopenem etzadroxil  was administered in the fed state (~82% increase in mean AUC).  In Study 
IT001 -101, s ulopenem etzadroxil  was evaluated in a fasted and fed state at a dose of 500 mg 
BID. Results from this study indicate that food significantly increases bioavailability of 
sulopenem  and consequently results in decreased rates of diarrhea.  Therefore, dosing of oral 
sulopenem  etzadroxil with food whenever possible is recommended.  Since adequate target 
attainment appears to be achieved in the fasted state, an inability to administe r the dose with 
food should not preclude dosing.  
1.2.3  Dose Rationale  
Sulopenem and S ulopenem etzadroxil  
Doses of sulopenem and sulopenem etzadroxil  were chosen by PK/PD modeling using a 
combination of ( 1) modeling (Naïve Pool analysis) of the sulopenem effect  on net change in 
colony forming units (CFU) over 24 hours of clinically relevant organisms in an

nonlinear mixed effects models , generated from  clinical data in  multiple IV sulopenem and oral 
sulopenem etzadroxil  Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers.  
Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the human population PK parameters for 
sulopenem etzadroxil  and mean pharmacodynamic parameters from a murine thigh infection 
model to determine % target achievement (TA) for the selected doses. A %TA of ≥90% was 
deemed desirable for selecting particular doses. The 1000 mg IV dose delivered  over 3 hours and 
the 500 mg dose of sulopenem etzadroxil  co-administered with 500 mg of probenecid 
administered twice daily meets the criteria of %T>MIC for achieving 1 -log kill in >90% of 
bacteria with MIC’s expected in this indication .  
Probenecid  
The m aximum total daily dose of probenecid will be 1000 mg (500 mg BID) which is within the 
recommended dosage of 2000 mg daily in divided doses.  
Ertapenem  
The recommended dose of IV ertapenem in this study is 1000 mg administered over 30 minutes 
and is consis tent with the ertapenem USPI and SmPC for treatment of complicated intra -
abdominal infections.  
Amoxicillin -clavulanate  
The recommended dose of oral a moxicillin -clavulanate in this study is 875 mg bid, consistent 
with the amoxicillin -clavulanate US FDA Pac kage Insert and SmPC for severe infections. 
Ciprofloxacin  
The recommended dose of oral ciprofloxacin in this study is 500 mg bid following an initial 
course of ertapenem IV to complete 10 days of therapy, consistent with the c iprofloxacin USPI  
and SmPC  for treatment of cIAI.  
Metronidazole  
The recommended dose of oral metronidazole in this study is 500 mg qid , consistent with the 
metronidazole  USPI  and SmPC  for treatment of IAI .

3 STUDY DESIGN  
Sulopenem is an investigational penem antibiotic being developed for treatment of uUTI , complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and complicated intra -abdominal infections (cIAI). 
Sulopenem etzadroxil is an oral pro-drug of sulopenem. Upon oral absorption, sulopenem etzadroxil  is expected to be rapidly hydrolyz ed to yield sulopenem, the active moiety, as well as  
the non- active moieties , formaldehyde and 2- ethylbutyric acid (2 -EBA).   
Sulopenem possesses potent activity against species of the Enterobacteriaceae that encode ESBLs or AmpC -type β -lactamases that con fer resistance to third generation cephalosporins. 
Sulopenem etzadroxil is expected to be the first oral penem on the market in the United States or Europe and will offer the option of treatment in the outpatient setting as well as IV to oral switch therap y for early discharge of patients hospitalized with serious complicated infections.  
Probenecid, co- administered with the oral prodrug, will reduce renal clearance and increase 
systemic exposure of the active moiety, sulopenem.   
This Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study compares IV sulopenem 
followed by sulopenem etzadroxil with probenecid and  ertapenem IV followed by an oral 
regimen of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or amoxicillin -clavulanate for treatment of cIAI. 
The site ph armacist will be unblinded in order to prepare the intravenous study medications and 
select the appropriate oral follow on therapy for patients randomized to the ertapenem regimen. Approximately 670 adults with cIAI will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to r eceive either IV 
sulopenem for at least 5 days followed by sulopenem etzadroxil 500mg co- administered with 
oral probenecid 500 mg twice daily to complete 7-10 days of treatment or  ertapenem IV for at 
least 5 days followed by ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or amoxicillin -clavulanate, based on 
quinolone susceptibility of baseline pathogen to complete 7-10 days of therapy. Duration of therapy in both treatment groups may be extended up to a total duration of 14 days if both (a) approved by the medical monitor, and (b) the patient has either multiple abscesses or non-appendix-related diffuse peritonitis AND has one of the following: fever or hypothermia (temp erature ≥38°C  or <35°C), leukocytosis defined as WBC ≥12,000/mm
3, or ileus. 
The primary outcome measure for efficacy evaluation on Day 28 will be the r esolution of the 
symptoms of cIAI present at trial entry .

Randomization will be stratified by the  type of infection (cIAI caused by appendicitis with 
perforation or peri -appendiceal abscess versus all other cIAI diagnoses). The proportion of 
patients who have cIAI caused by appendicitis with perforation or peri -appendiceal abscess will 
not exceed approximately 5 0%. 
4.4 Life Style Guidelines  
For the duration of the study, all female patient s of child -bearing potential , and all male patients 
must agree to be strictly abstinent from sexual intercourse with any individual of the opposite 
sex, or to follow the following instructions for contraception.  
4.4.1  Women of Child -Bearing Potential  
If the pati ent is a woman of childbearing potential, she and any male partner are required to 
simultaneously use 2 effective contraceptive methods, from the following list of 5:  
1. A barrier (condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap) with spermicide;  
2. A second, different barri er method (condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap);  
3. Oral or similar contraceptive, which includes, but is not limited to: injectable, implanted , or 
patch hormone therapy, and intrauterine device (IUD);  
4. Documented surgical sterilization at least 4 weeks prior to baseline;  
5. Partner vasectomy at least 6 months prior to baseline. 
She and any male partner must agree to continue all of these contraceptive methods until the last 
Study Visit. Within these limits, the specific forms of contraception employed are left to the 
discretion of the patient, and/or the principal investigator, and/or the patient’s physician.  
4.4.2  Males  
It is required that all male subjects use one of the following methods of contraception from the 
first dose of study medication and until 28 days after last dosing:  
1. Abstinence  
2. Use of condom for males that have not been vasectomized for at least 6 months. 
3. Male subjects who have not had a vasectomy must use a condom.  In addition, such a male 
subject should be instructed that, unless his female partner has had a tubal ligation, 
hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or is post -menopausal, his female partner should 
use another form of contraception from the time of the first dose of study medication until 28 
days after dosing.  Such other forms of contracept ion include an IUD, spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptive, injectable 
progesterone, or subdermal implant. 
5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Allocation to Treatment  
This is a randomized double blind study in which approxi mately 670 patients will be randomized 
to receive either sulopenem followed by sulopenem etzadroxil plus probenecid or  ertapenem 
Sulopenem; Sulopenem etzadroxil   Iterum Therapeutics International Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -303  May 2018  
 
 
Confidential  Page 36 of 74 followed by ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole or oral amoxicillin -clavulanate in the treatment of 
cIAI. Randomization will be ba sed on an IWRS -generated schedule in a 1:1 allocation ratio . 
A patient will be eligible for randomization once it  has been determined that he/ she meets all 
inclusion criteria and has none of the exclusion criteria. On the day the patient is to receive the 
first dose of study drug, a designated member of the clinical pharma cy staff will contact the 
IWRS  to obtain the study treatment assignment and dispense therapy accordingly. The IWRS 
will associate that patient with the next available treatment in the appr opriate stratum on the 
randomization schedule.  The IWRS will then give the investigative site information which 
corresponds to study medication that has been previously shipped to the site and is in the site’s 
inventory ready to be dispensed. A patient is  considered randomized when the pharmacist or 
designee receives the treatment assignment associated with the patient entered into the IWRS.  
5.1.1  Criteria for Switch from IV to Oral Therapy  
After 5 days  of IV treatment ( at least 5 administrations of IV therapy) patients are eligible to 
switch to oral treatment if they have met the following criteria:  
1. Patient can tolerate oral medications  
2. Fever and white blood cell count are improving; these signs of infection do not 
have to return  to normal  
3. Clinical signs or symp toms such as ileus, abdominal pain or tenderness, 
abdominal wall rigidity or guarding, nausea or vomiting , if present at baseline, are 
improving.

The site pharmacist will be unblinded in order to prepare  the intravenous study medications and 
select the appropriate oral follow on therapy for patients randomized to the ertapenem regimen.  
Both Treatment Groups :  
In both treatment groups, patients found to have pathogens isolated from blood cultures that are 
resistant to carbapenems including ertapenem should be discontinued from study drug therapy, 
but should remain in the study and treated appropriately. Patients found to have pathogens 
isolated from intr a-abdominal cultures that are resistant to carbapenems  including ertapenem, 
may be allowed to continue on study drug therapy based on clinical response and investigator 
judgement.  
Dosing with food:  Food significantly increases bioavailability of sulopenem and consequently 
results in decreased rates of diarrhe a. Therefore, dosing of oral sulopenem  etzadroxil /probenecid 
with food whenever possible is recommended.  Since adequate target attainment appears to be

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -303  May 2018  
 
 
Confidential  Page 39 of 74 achieved in the fasted state, an inability to administer the dose with food should not preclude 
dosing. The overall absorption of ciprofloxacin  is not substantially affected  by food.  
5.2.4  Compliance  
All patients  should be informed that compliance with taking all medication  as instructed is 
imperative. Intravenous treatment will be administered under the supervis ion of investigative site 
personnel at a hospital or , for centers approved by the Sponsor to do so, in an outpatient infusion 
center, and infusion date, start and stop time will be documented on the CRF.  
Patients  discharged on oral medication will be asked  to bring all study medication bottles (used 
and unused) to the next scheduled study  visit for drug accountability. Patients  will be asked to  
record oral dosing on a dosing record and bri ng it to the site at each visit. The total amount of 
oral dosing completed  (determined by tablet count from returned bottles /blister packs ) will be 
recorded on the CRF.  A urine sample will be collected and frozen for all patients at the EOT 
visit if a need to confirm compliance with study drug therapy arises for any patien t. 
5.3 Drug Storage and Drug Accountability  
The investigator, or an approved representative, e.g., pharmacist/designee, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions , and 
in accordance with ap plicable regulatory requirements.  To ensure adequate records, all study 
drugs will be accounted for by using site standard accountability form or forms provided by 
Iterum Therapeutics.  In either case, the forms must identify the investigational product, 
including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition on a patient -by-patient basis, 
including specific dates and quantities.  
At the end of the study, Iterum Therapeutics will provide instructions as to disposition of any 
unused investigational pr oduct .  If Iterum Therapeutics authorizes destruction at the study site, 
the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by I terum 
Therapeutics.  Destruction must be adequately documented. 
5.4 Concomitant Medication(s), Adjunctive Therapy and Non-drug 
Therapy  
5.4.1  Concomitant Medications  
Any medication taken by the patient, other than study drug, is considered a concomitant 
medication.  All concomitant medications from Screening (Day - 1) through the Day 28 (TOC)  
must be recorded in the patient's source record and on the CRFs . 
At each visit, the investigator /site designee  will obtain information on any therapeutic 
interventions (e.g., drug  and non- drug therapy, surgery, etc .) provided.  The use of any other 
investigational drug is prohibited and patients may not participate in any other studies involving 
marketed products concomitantly while in this study.   
The use of other (non- antibacteri al) medications should be limited to those essential for the care 
of the patient.  All medications required by the patient to manage underlying illnesses, other than

recorded on the CRF.   
5.4.2  Concomitant Antibacterial Medications  
Concomitant systemic antibacterials are prohibited during the study, up to the EOT visit, with 
the following exceptions: 
• Vancomycin IV, linezolid IV or PO, or daptomycin IV can be given for known or suspected 
methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) or Enterococcus spp. The Sponsor will not 
provide any of these medications . 
5.4.3  Non-drug Adjunctive Therapy  
The potential need for surgical intervention in patients with cIAI during the study must be prospectively defined at Baseline. Patients expected to require more than 2 surgical interventions for the cIAI under study are not to be enrolled.
 
The following adjunctive therapies are permitted for the treatment of cIAI:  
• Percutaneous drainage procedures , open laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery  
• Topical solutions including antiseptic agents such as povidine-iodine; 
• Local bedside wound care as per hospital protocol.

effort sh ould be made to contact the patient.  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to 
document patient outcome, if possible.  If the patient withdraws or is withdrawn from study drug 
treatment, the investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal , request  the patient to 
return for all protocol- specified assessments, if possible, and follow-up with the patient 
regarding a ny unresolved AEs through Day 28. 
For patients who discontinue from the study early, a Premature Discontinuation  visit should be 
performed within 3 calendar days  after decision to discontinue ( Section 6.4) and no further visits 
are required . 
If the patient discontinues from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further study- specific evaluations should be performed, and no additional data 
should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 
7 ASSESSMENTS 
7.1 Safety  
7.1.1  Physical Examination  
A targeted  phys ical examination will be performed at Baseline (including general appearance, 
examination of heart, lungs, abdomen, and extremities) . A targeted physical exam may be 
conducted at any visit to address patient’s symptoms if needed.

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -303  May 2018  
 
 
Confidential  Page 44 of 74 7.1.2  Vital Signs (Blood Pressur e, Respiration Rate, Temperature and Pulse  Rate)  
Vital signs are performed at Baseline, Day 5 , Day 10  (or Day 11 -14) and Day 28 (+/- 1 days).  
Blood pressure will be measured and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  All blood pressure 
measurements should be taken at rest .  The same size blood pressure cuff will be used to 
measure blood pressure each time.  When the timing of these measurements coincides with a 
blood collection, blood pressure and pulse rate are to be obtained first.  Temperature will be 
measured as an oral, rectal, tympanic (ear) or core temperature.  
7.1.3  Clinical Laboratory Assays  
The following laboratory parameters will be measured:  
• Hematology: Complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC) and 
differential c ounts; at Baseline, Day 5, Day 10 (or Day 11- 14), and premature 
discontinuation. If abnormal at the Day 10 or Day 11- 14 visit, need to repeat on Day 28.  
• Serum Clinical Chemistry: AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total and 
direct bilirubin, BUN or urea, creatinine, Na+, K+, Cl -, total CO2 (Bicarbonate), glucose, 
C-reactive protein (CRP) and LDH at Baseline, Day 5, Day 10 (or Day 11 -14) and  
premature discontinuation. If abnormal at the Day 10 or Day 11- 14 visit, need to repeat on 
Day 28.  
• Urinalysis at Baseline.  
• Pregnancy T est (women of child- bearing potential): Urine or serum βhCG only at 
Baseline/Day 1; urine βhCG at Day 28 or premature discontinuation; Pregnancy test at 
Baseline should also be performed on peri -menopausal women until FSH value is available.  
• Serum FSH (to conf irm postmenopausal status [amenorrheic for at least 1 year] for women 
<50 years of age or those ≥50 years of age who have been post -menopausal for <2 years) : 
FSH at Baseline only, as needed.  
• Blood cultures: Blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) should be drawn at Baseline (prior 
to study drug treatment) from 2 different anatomical sites and not through an existing 
intravascular line. If positive, blood cultures should be repeated immediately (no later than 
24 hours after notification) and repeated until ne gative.  If baseline cultures are negative, 
follow up cultures should be obtained only if clinically indicated (eg, worsening of signs 
and symptoms, relapse, or new infection). Specific instructions for sample collection, 
processing, and shipment can be found in the laboratory manual(s) for this study.  
• In addition, serum and urine samples will be banked at baseline for retrospective safety and 
efficacy analyses if needed.  Urine specimens may be collected at EOT and banked if a need 
to document compliance wit h study drug therapy is identified.  
7.1.4  Clinically Significant Laboratory Tests  
Clinical laboratory tests may be repeated during the study if deemed necessary as part of routine 
practice based on investigator judgment.  All clinically significant abnormal lab oratory test 
results occurring during the study will be repeated at appropriate intervals until they return either 
to baseline or to a level deemed acceptable by the investigator and the Iterum  appointed medical 
monitor.

Confidential  Page 45 of 74 7.2 Efficacy 
7.2.1  Clinical Response  
A patie nt’s outcome  will be programmatically defined as a clinical cure  if the following criteria 
are met:  
• Patient is alive  
• Resolution of baseline signs and symptoms of the index infection 
o No new symptoms  
• No new antibiotics or interventions for treatment failure are required  
Clinical failure is defined as: 
• Death due to cIAI  
• Surgical site wound infection requiring non- study systemic antibiotic therapy  
• Unplanned surgical procedures or percutaneous drainage procedures for complication or 
recurrence of cIAI based on documented worsening symptoms or signs of cIAI  
• Initiation of non- trial antibacterial drug therapy for treatment of cIAI based on 
documented worsening symptoms or signs of cIAI  
If data are unavailable to deter mine if the patient is a cure  or a failure the patient outcome  will be 
considered indeterminate . Deaths not due to cIAI will also  be considered indeterminate. Patients 
with an indeterminate response are included in the denominator for determination of the clinical 
cure rate in the m -MITT population.  
7.2.2  Investigator  Assessment of  Clinical Response  
Investigators will use the definitions below to document clinical response at the EOT, TOC  and 
premature discontinuation visits : 
Clinical response  Definition  
Clinical cure  Pre-therapy signs and symptoms of the i ndex infection had resolved such that 
no additional antibiotics or interventions were required  
Clinical failure  Patients who met any one of the criteria below were considered as failure:  
Death related to c IAI prior to EOT  or TOC for the EOT  or TOC a ssessm ents,  
respectively  
No apparent response to treatment  defined as: persistence or progression of 
most or all pre- therapy signs and symptoms or use of additional antibiotics or 
additional interventions for the current infection  
Patient previously  met criteria for failure based on receipt of rescue antibiotics

Confidential  Page 46 of 74 Clinical response  Definition  
Indeterminate  Study data were not available for evaluation of efficacy for any reason, 
including:  
Patient lost to follow -up or assessment not undertaken such that a 
determination of cli nical response could not be made at either the EOT or 
TOC  visit 
Death prior to EOT or TOC  for the EOT and TOC assessments, respectively, 
where cIAI was clearly noncontributory  
 
7.2.3  Other Efficacy Outcomes  
Microbi ologic response will be determined at EOT  and TOC in the ME and m -MITT 
populations. For each pathogen, microbiologic response will be defined as follows:  
• Eradication: An acceptable specimen at a post -baseline visit indicates absence of the 
baseline pathogen  
• Presumed eradication: There was no acceptabl e post -baseline specimen for culture 
and the patient was assessed as a clinical curebased on the programmatic 
determination of clinical response . 
• Persistence: An acceptable post -baseline specimen indicates presence of the baseline 
pathogen  
• Presumed persist ence: There was no acceptable post -baseline specimen for culture 
and the patient was assessed as a clinical failure based on the programmatic 
determination of clinical response . 
• Persistence with increasing MIC: An acceptable post -baseline culture taken aft er at 
least 2 full days of treatment indicates presence of the baseline pathogen and 
displayed ≥4- fold higher MIC to study drug therapy after treatment with study 
therapy. For patients with bacteremia at Baseline, follow -up blood cultures after 72 
hours of treatment show growth of baseline pathogen and displayed ≥4- fold higher  
MIC to study drug therapy.  
• Indeterminate: Study data were not available for evaluation of efficacy, for any 
reason including:  
o Patient was lost to follow up or an assessment was not undertaken such 
that no culture was obtained (or culture results could not  be interpreted for 
any reason) at either the Day 5, EOT or the TOC visit  
o Death prior to Day 5, EOT or TOC respectively, where the underlying 
infection was clearly non -contributory  
o Circumstances that precluded classification as an eradication, persistence,  
or persistence with increasing MIC  
A microbiologic success is defined as eradication or presumed eradication whereas a failure is 
defined as persistence or presumed persistence.  
The per -patient microbiological response is based on the outcomes for each ba seline pathogen. 
For a subject to be a microbiological success, the outcome for each baseline pathogen must be a

defined by persistence or presumed persistence) t hen the patient will be regarded as a per -patient

8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 
8.1 Adverse Events 
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the investigational product(s) will be reporte d as described in the following sections.  
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious AE  
(SAE) requiring imme diate notification to Iterum Therapeutics designated pharmacovigilance 
provider .  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to determine 
the causality of the AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality.  All AEs w ill be 
followed- up by the investigator until the event or its sequel resolve or stabilize at a level 
acceptable to the investigator, and Iterum concurs with that assessment.  
8.2 Reporting Period  
Adverse events will be collected from the time that the patient p rovides informed consent 
through the Day 28 (TOC) visit .  
For SAEs, the reporting period to Iterum Therapeutics  begins from the time that the patient 
provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, i.e., 
prior to undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, 
through the Final Visit.   Any SAE occurring any time after the reporting period must be 
promptly reported if a causal relationship to investigational product is suspected.  
All AEs should be recorded on the CRF if they occur from the time the patient provides 
informed consent  through the Day 28 (TOC) visit . 
8.3 Definition of an AE  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
product or medical device , unless the event is captured in the study endpoint, as defined below ; 
the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.   
An event would be considered as adequately captured in the study endpoint i f it is accurately and 
fully represented by a protocol -defined reason for clinical failure (other than mortality) or 
relapse.  Such an event should not be reported as an adverse event unless it is a serious adverse 
event as defined in this protocol.   
Even ts represented by the study endpoints include  all of the following:  
• Symptoms of c IAI have not resolved from Baseline to such an extent that new antibiotics 
are not needed for the infection under study  
• Development of new c IAI symptoms not present at Baselin e 
Sulopenem; Sulopenem etzadroxil   Iterum Therapeutics International Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -303  May 2018  
 
 
Confidential  Page 48 of 74 Except for circumstances as defined above, examples of AEs include but are not limited to:   
• Abnormal test findings (see Section  8.4);  
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs; 
• Changes in physical examination  findings; 
• Hypersensitivity;  
• Progression/worsening of underlying disease.  
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from: 
• Drug overdose; 
• Drug withdrawal; 
• Drug abuse;  
• Drug misuse;  
• Drug interactions; 
• Drug dependency; 
• Extravasation  of study drug; 
• Exposure during Pregnancy. 
8.4 Abnormal Test Findings 
An abnormal objective test finding (e.g., an abnormal liver function test result) should be 
reported as an AE only if the following conditions apply :  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms and/or signs, constituting a clinical syndrome (e.g., abnormal liver function test results, jaundice, and hepatic tenderness suggesting a diagnosis of hepatitis), and/or 
• Test result requires  medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or withdrawal  from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy. 
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not define the abnormal objective test fin ding as an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.  Additional diagnostic testing and /or medical/surgical interventions that occur as a result of an adverse event due to an abnormal lab test fin ding should be noted in the CRF.  
8.5 SAEs  
An SAE or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exist ing hospitalization; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
Sulopenem; Sulopenem etzadroxil   Iterum Therapeutics International Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -303  May 2018  
 
 
Confidential  Page 49 of 74 • Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is assessed as being a medically important event based on medical and scientific judgment.  
Such medically important events may not  be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring i ntensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.6 Hospitalization  
Adverse events associated with hospitalizat ion or prol ongations of hospitalization are considered 
serious.  Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (e.g., 
from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, neurological 
floor to a t uberculosis unit). 
Hospitalization does not include the following:  
• Rehabilitation facilities; 
• Hospice facilities; 
• Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief);  
• Skilled nursing facilities; 
• Nursing homes;  
• Routine emergency room evaluation ; 
• Same day surgeries (as ou tpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is 
not in itself an SAE.  Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a 
new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for work -up of persistent pre -
treatment lab oratory  abnormality);  
• Social admission (e.g., patient has no place to sleep);  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical  exam);  
• Protocol -specified admission during a study (e.g., for a procedure required by the study 
protocol);  
• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (e.g., for elective cosmetic 
surgery).  Pre -planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;  
• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as an AE.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -303  May 2018  
 
 
Confidential  Page 50 of 74 begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 
8.7 Severity Assessment 
The investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  For purposes of consistency, these int ensity grades are defined as 
follows: 
• MILD :  Does not interfere with the patient's usual function. 
• MODERATE :  Interferes to some extent with the patient's usual function.  
• SEVERE:  Interferes significantly with the patient's usual function.   
Note the distin ction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above. 
8.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE.  If the investigator does not know whether or not investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by the Spons or (see Section 8.12 on Reporting Requirements ).  If the investigator's causality 
assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", this should be clearly documented on study records.  Specifically, the invest igator will choose whether the AE is 
unrelated, unlikely related, possibly related or probably related to the investigational product. 
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the 
investigator must record this  causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  
The Investigator will assess causal ity of the event in relation to study drugs  based on the 
following defined criteria:  
• UNRELATED: No relationship between the event and medicinal product 
• UNLIKELY, Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a 
relationship improbable (but not impossible); Disease or other drugs p rovide plausible 
explanations 
• POSSIBLY, Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake; Could also be explained by disease or other drugs; Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear

Confidential  Page 51 of 74 • PROBABLY, Event or l aboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake; Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs; Response to withdrawal clinically 
reasonable; Rechallenge not required  
8.9 Exposure during Pregnancy  
For investigational products  and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (also 
referred to as exposure in -utero [EIU]) occurs if:  
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been directly 
exposed to (e.g., environmental exposure) the investigational product, or the female 
becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly exposed to the 
investigational product (maternal exposure);  
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental exposure, to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of his partner’s conception and/or is 
exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure). 
If any study patient or study patient’s partner becomes  or is found to be pregnant during the 
study pati ent’s treatment with the investigational product,  no further study drugs  should be given 
and the investigator must submit this information to Iterum Therapeutics  on a Pregnancy Form.  
In addition, the investigator must submit information rega rding environm ental exposure to 
sulopenem  in a pregnant woman (e.g., a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed 
to sulopenem  by spillage) using the Pregnancy  Form.  This reporting must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hour s of awareness of the pregnancy.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information 
related to induced termination of pregnancy).  
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Pregna ncy reports with 
an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until 
pregnancy termination (i.e., induced abortion) and then notify Iterum  of the outcome.  The 
investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial Pregnancy  Form.  The 
reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified.  A  Pregnancy report is not created when 
an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable.  Rather, an 
SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an 
aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal  death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs.  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth 
(i.e., no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required before  a 
Pregnancy  Form can be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by 
gross visual inspection, unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classif ied as SAEs follows:  
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
Sulopenem; Sulopenem etzadroxil   Iterum Therapeutics International Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -303  May 2018  
 
 
Confidential  Page 52 of 74 • All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 1 month that the investigator  assesses 
as possibly related to the exposure during pregnancy to the investigational medication should be reported. 
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the investigator.  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(e.g.,  follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator must obtain permission from the patient’s partner in order to conduct any follow -up or collect any information.  
8.10 Discontinuation from Study Drug Due to AEs (See also Patient 
Withdrawal, Section 6.4 ) 
Discontinuation from study drug due to an AE should be distinguished from discontinuation due to insufficient res ponse, according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate AE CRF page.   
When a patient discontinues study drug due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance 
with the reporting requirements defined below. 
8.11 Eliciting AE Information 
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study patient through the Final Visit.  In addition, each study patient will be questioned about the occurrence of any AEs.  
8.12 Reporting Requirements 
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE.  If an SAE occurs that is considered by the investigator or the Sponsor to be at least possibly related to study drug, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate. 
8.12.1  SAE Reporting Requirements  
If an SAE or exposure during pregnancy occurs, Iterum Therapeutics  (Iterum ’s PV Service 
provider ) is to be notified within 24  hours of awareness of the event by the investigator  on an 
SAE form or Pregnanc y form.   If the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Iterum must 
be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available event  information.  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of Pregnancy cases.   
In the rare instance that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewh ere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24  hour s after learning of it and document the time of 
his/her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAEs and  pregnancies, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to 
Iterum in accord ance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may be requested by Iterum Therapeutics  to obtain specific additional follow -up

Confidential  Page 53 of 74 information in an expedited fashion.  This information may be more detailed than that captured 
on the SAE form .  In general, this information may include hospital discharge summary, 
laboratory test and X- ray results .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as 
concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Iterum 
Therapeutics .  The information should be reported on an SAE/ Pregnancy form and sent  to the 
PSI Pharmacovigilance unit .
 
8.12.2  Non-SAE Reporting Requirement s 
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  Please note that while all AEs are reported on the AE page of the CRF, there is an additional form used for collection of SAE information, as described in Section  8.12.1, which is not the same as the AE CRF.  When the 
same data are collected, the two forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms.  A dverse events  should be reported using 
concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.  The information on the AE CRF and the SAE form must be the same and will be reconciled at defined periods throughout the study to ensure that they do. 
8.12.3  Sponsor Reporting Requirements  to Regulatory Authorities  
Adverse event reporting, including reporting of suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, 
will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.  Death and life- threatening 
Suspected, Unexpected Serious Advers e Reactions (SUSARs) are subject to expedited reporting 
within a 7 calendar day (life- threatening and fatal) or 15 calendar day (all other SUSARs) 
timeframe.  
9 DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
The study is designed to determine whe ther sulopenem IV followed by sulopenem etzadroxil co-
administered with probenecid is non- inferior (NI ) to ertapenem followed by oral ciprofloxacin 
and metronidazole or amoxicillin -clavulanate on Day 28 for the outcome measure of clinical  
response, defined as r esolution of the signs and symptoms of cIAI present at trial entry with  no 
new symptoms such that no new antibiotics or interventions are required. 
The expected clinical cure rate is estimated from numerous large randomized controlled trials in 
a similar cIAI patient population. In those studies, the estimated cure  rate for the proposed 
primary efficacy outcome measure of clinical cure on Day 28 in the m-MITT population was 85%. 
The proposed sample size for the ITT population is 670 patients.  This ITT sample size estimate 
is based on the assumption that 80%, or 536 patients, of this ITT population will be m- MITT 
evaluable.  The sample size of the m -MITT population is 268 patients per arm  based on a Z -test 
with unpooled variance . This 536 m- MITT sample size assumes a non -inferiority margin of 
10%, a power of 90%, a one-sided alpha level of 0.025 and an 85% treatment response rate in 
both treatment groups.  
The aggregate blinded clinical cure rate will be assessed when approximately 60% of the 
subjects have been randomized and have efficacy outcome data at TOC available. If the

Confidential  Page 54 of 74 aggregate response rate at that point is <85%, t he final ITT sample size  may be increased  
based on the observed clinical cure rate at that  blinded interim analysis , as well as the 
evaluability rate , to maintain a power of 90%.  See  Section 9.7. 
9.2 Definition of Analysis Populations 
1. Intent -to-Treat ( ITT): all randomized patients  regardless of whether or not the subjects 
received study drug  
2. Modified ITT (MITT) : randomized patients who received a t least a single -dose of study 
medication  
3. Safety : randomized patients who received any amount of a single -dose of study 
medication  
4. Micro -MITT (m-MITT) : All MITT patients who have at least one gram-negative 
pathogen ident ified at study entry (regardless of isolate susceptibilities). Patients with a 
bacterial species typically not expected to respond to either study drug (e.g. 
Acinetobacter  spp., Stenotrophomonas  spp., Pseudomonas  spp.) will be  excluded.   
5. Clinically evaluable: Clinically evaluable (CE) at the EOT and TOC visits population:  
a) Received a minimum number of days of study drug (to be defined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP])  
b) Had no important protocol deviations that would affect the assessment of efficacy 
(to be defined in the SAP) 
c) Had an outcome assessment of clinical cure or failure (and not indeterminate) at 
the EOT or TOC visits (ie, within the protocol allowed visit window), respectively.   
d) Had not received prior antibiotic within 48 hours of the initiation of study therapy 
for this infection unless the patient had received only 1 dose of a short- acting 
antibiotic regimen  within 24 hours 
e) Did not receive any non- study antibiotic therapy with potential activity  against 
any of the baseline pathogens collected at screening between the time of the baseline 
culture and the EOT or TOC culture, respectively.  This excludes the protocol defined study therapy and patients who were considered clinical failures and required additional antibiotic therapy.  Patients with a coinfection with a gram -positive 
pathogen resistant to study drugs are allowed to receive agents with narrow spectrum 
gram -positive coverage (ie, such as linezolid, daptomycin or vancomycin)  
6. Microbiologic ally evaluable (ME):  all patients in cluded in both the m -MITT and CE 
populations at the EOT visit (ME -EOT) and at the TOC visit (ME -TOC).  
9.3 General Statistical Considerations 
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and the numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided. All comparisons will be for the sulopenem treatment group and the comparator  treatment group. Exploratory analyses may also be performed. Listings of individual

Confidential  Page 55 of 74 patient’s data will be produced. A comprehensive  SAP will be finalized prior to the interim 
analysis.  
9.4 Patient Characteristics  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, discontinuations from the study drug and withdrawal from the 
study will be summarized by treatment group.  Demog raphics (age, race, sex), medical and 
surgi cal history , baseline assessment of the symptoms of c IAI, baseline pathogen , and study drug 
administration will also be summarized.  Differences between treatment groups will be analyzed 
using the chi -square or Fi sher’s exact test for dichotomous variables and the Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum test for ordinal variables and continuous variables.   
9.5 Efficacy Analysis  
For all efficacy analyses, patient data will be analyzed in the treatment group to which the 
patient was randomiz ed.  For the primary analysis, patients who were randomized to the wrong 
type of infection  will be analyzed in the stratum to which they were randomized.  
9.5.1  Analysis of Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary efficacy outcome is clinical respon se at the Day 28  (TOC ) visit in the m- MITT 
population. The number and percentage of patients in each treatment group defined as a clinical 
cure, failure and indeterminate will tabulated. The observed difference in percentage of patients 
with a clinical cure  at the Day 28  (TOC) visit (+/ - 1 day) (sulopenem group minus the 
comparator  group) will be determined and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed 
difference will be computed using a Z -statistic . The NI hypothesis test is a one -sided hypothesis 
test performed at th e 2.5% level of significance. If the lower limit of the 95% CI for the 
differenc e in response rates in the m -MITT population is greater than - 10% the NI of sulopenem 
to the comparator  group will be concluded.  
9.5.1.1  Additional Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Out come 
The primary efficacy outcome will also be assessed within each geographic region and by type 
of infection by treatment group. For each geographic region, a two- sided 95% CI for the 
observed difference in the clinical cure rates in the m -MITT population will be calculated.  For 
each type of infection, a two -sided 95% CI for the observed difference in the clinical cure rates 
in the m -MITT population will be calculated.  
Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome will also be conducted. An adjusted analysi s (95% 
CI will be adjusted for the stratification factor of type of infection using the stratified method of 
Miettinen and Nurminen) will be provided for the difference in the clinical cure rate between the 
two treatment groups. Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel wei ghts will be used for the stratum weights in 
the calculation of the CI.  
9.5.2  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Outcome  Measure  
The number and percentage of patients with a clinical  cure, failure and indeterminate response at 
the EOT  (+/- 1 day) visit will be deter mined in e ach treatment group in the m -MITT population. 
The observed difference in percentage of patients with a clinical cure  (sulopenem minus the

computed using the met hod of Miettinen and Nurminen. 
 
9.5.3  Analysis of Additional Efficacy Outcome Measures 
Additional efficacy outcome measure s will be presented for the following time points and 
analysis populations:  
1. Clinical response at Day 28  (TOC )  in the MITT, CE -TOC and ME -TOC populations. 
2. Clinical response at EOT (+/ - 1 day) in the MITT, CE -EOT and ME- EOT populations. 
3. Clinical response by pathogen for key pathogens at TOC in the ME and m -MITT 
populations  
4. Per-subject m icrobiologic response at EOT and TOC in the ME  and m -MITT populations. 
Per-pathogen microbiologic response at EOT and TOC in the ME and m -MITT populations  
5.   Investigators assessment of response (clinical cure, failure and indeterminate) at the EOT 
and TOC visits will be presented by treatment gr oup for the m -MITT and CE populations.  
6.   Efficacy analyses in the subgroups of patients who did and did not receive prior effective 
antibiotic therapy will be presented.  
7. Other analyses of the impact on clinical efficacy of baseline demographic variables su ch as 
age, APACHE score, etc. may be performed.  
For selected additional efficacy outcome measures, t wo-sided 95% unstratified CIs will be 
constructed for the observed difference between the treatment groups for descriptive purposes; 
no conclusion of NI wil l be made.  
9.6 Safety Analyses  
Safety will be assessed through summari es of AEs, clinical laboratory tests  and vital signs.  All 
safety analyses will be based on the Safety population.  Patients who receive the wrong regimen 
of study drug for their entire cour se of treatment will be analyzed in the group based on the 
regimen received.  
Summary tables of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be provided.  A TEAE is any AE that 
newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of s tudy 
drug.  The  incidence of TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term for 
each treatment group, and by severity and relationship to treatment.  Tables of TEAEs leading to 
study drug discontinuation, withdrawal from the study or an S AE will be provided.  AEs 
occurring prior to the first dose of study drug (AEs are recorded from the time of informed 
consent) will be provided in a listing. 
Descriptive statistics summarizing central laboratory data (hematology and chemistry) will be 
presented for all study visits.  The change from baseline to each post -baseline visit  and to the 
overall worst post -baseline value will also be summarized by treatment group.  Laboratory 
values will be classified as of potential clinical concern and the number  and percentage of 
patients with a lab value of potential clinical concern will be summarized by visit and treatment 
group.  Descriptive statistics of the vital signs will be presented by treatment group and study 
visit, as well as the change from baseline at each study visit.

Confidential  Page 57 of 74 9.7 Interim Analysis  
In order to ensure that the point estimate of clinical cure used in the estimation of sample size is 
valid for this study, an interim analysis for sample size re -estimation will be perfo rmed when 
response data at t he TOC visit  are available for approximately 60% of the patients (402 
patients).  The FDA Guidance “Non- inferiority Clinical Trials” [ FDA Guidance 2010] notes 
that such a sample size re -estimation if based on the blinded overall response rates is not only 
acceptable but is advisable.  The interim analysis will involve a sample size re -estimation to 
either confirm the initial sample size estimate is adequate or increase the sample size (number 
of randomized patients) to ensure the study has adequate power for determining whether 
sulopenem/ sulopenem etzadroxil plus probenecid is NI to the comparator regimen  for the 
primary outcome measure. In addition, the sample size may be increased based on a lower than 
expected evaluability rate.  The sample size re -estima tion will be based on the blinded overall 
(not by treatment group) outcome rate and will be conducted by an independent, blinded 
statistician. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be provided the results of the interim 
analysis by the independent, blinde d statistician and make a recommendation regarding 
changes to the sample size.  A detailed DMC charter will be developed which outlines the 
analyses to be completed, statistical rules, the potential changes to the sample size, and the 
recommendations that can be made to the Sponsor. 
9.8 Handling of Missing Data  
Details of the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP.  For the primary and 
secondary efficacy analyses, if any data field needed to determine clinical response is missing 
at the TOC v isit, the patient will be considered an indeterminate response. By definition, 
patients with an indeterminate response are included in the denominator in the m -MITT 
population and thus, are analyzed in the same  manner as clinical failures. Additional sensitivit y 
analyses for handling missing data will be detailed in the SAP. Imputation may be performed to 
understand the impact of any imbalance in indeterminate outcomes between treatment 
regimens. By definition, patients with missing data are excluded from the CE  populations . 
10 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
During study conduct, Iterum  or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that 
the protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to 
confirm that the dat a recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow 
Iterum  monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source 
documents to perform this verification.  
The study site may be subject to review by th e institutional review board (IRB)/independent 
ethics committee (IEC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Iterum , or companies 
working with or on behalf of Iterum , and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. 
It is important tha t the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

Confidential  Page 58 of 74 11 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
11.1 Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an 
electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patie nt.  The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property of Iterum  and should not be made available in any form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of Iterum  or appropriate regulatory authorities, 
without written permission from Iterum . 
The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, and timely collection 
and reporting of all clinical, safety, laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data 
collection forms.  The CRFs must be signed by the investigator o r by an authorized staff member 
to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true.  Any corrections to entries made in the 
CRFs and source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not 
obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the physician's patient chart.  In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these  cases, 
a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Iterum  and clearly identify 
those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source 
document. 
11.2 Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Iterum , the investigator agrees 
to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link 
records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent form s, copies of 
all CRFs, SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and 
adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone 
call reports).  The records should be retained by the invest igator according to ICH, local 
regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (e.g., retirement, relocation), Iterum  should be prospectively notified.  The study 
records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Iterum , such as another investigator, 
another institution, or to Iterum .  The investigator must obtain Iterum 's written permission before 
disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met. 
12 ETHICS  
12.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, i nformed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., recruitment 
advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should 
Sulopenem; Sulopenem etzadroxil   Iterum Therapeutics International Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -303  May 2018  
 
 
Confidential  Page 59 of 74 be retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should be forwarded to 
Iterum . 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In that 
event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Iterum  in wr iting immediately after the 
implementation.  
12.2 Ethic al Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles 
for Medical Research Involving Human Patients, adopted by the General Assembly of the World 
Medical Association ( 2013).  
In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline on Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable 
local regulatory requirements and law s. 
12.3 Patient Information and Consent  
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names on 
any sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any other disclosures, except where required by 
laws.  In case of data tran sfer, Iterum  will maintain high standards of confidentiality and 
protection of patient personal data.  
The informed consent form must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory 
requirements, and legal requirements.  
The informed consent form used in thi s study, and any changes made during the course of the 
study, must be prospectively approved by both the IRB/IEC and Iterum  before use.  
The investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his/her legally acceptable representative, 
is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with 
participation.  The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written 
informed consent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable represent ative before any 
study -specific activity is performed.  The investigator will retain the original of each patient's 
signed consent form.  
12.4 Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or 
ICH GCP  
In the event of any prohibition or restricti on imposed (i.e., clinical hold) by an applicable 
Competent Authority in any area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, Iterum  should be informed immediately.   
In addition, the investigator will inform Iterum  immediately of any urgent safety measures taken 
by the investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of any serious 
breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.

13.1 End of Study in a Member State  
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient patients have been recruited  and have completed the study as stated in 
the regulatory application (i.e., Clinical Trial Application [CTA]) and ethics application in the 
Member State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by a 
Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion 
to the study in that Member State.  
13.2 End of Study in all Participating Countries  
End of Study in all participating countries is defined as the last patient’s Final Visit. 
14 SPONSOR STUDY TE RMINATION  CRITERIA  
Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Iterum .  In 
addition, Iterum  retains the righ t to discontinue devel opment of sulopenem  at any time.  
If a study is prematurely terminated, Iterum  will promptly notify the investigator and the 
investigator must also inform the IRB/IEC.  After notification, the investigator must contact all 
participating patients and the hos pital pharmacy (if applicable) within 90  days.  Investigator 
must also inform the IRB/IEC.  As directed by Iterum , all study materials must be collected and 
all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.  
15 PUBLICATION OF STUDY  RESULTS  
Publication of study results is discussed in the Clinical Study Agreement.  
15.1 Communication of Results by Iterum  
Iterum  fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose the results of studies through registration and 
posting of the results of this study on clinicaltrials.gov  and E udraCT.   
15.2 Publications by Investigators  
Iterum  has no objection to publication by the Investigator of any information collected or 
generated by the Investigator, whether or not the results are favorable to the Investigational 
Drug.  However, to ensure agai nst inadvertent disclosure of Confidential Information or 
unprotected Inventions, the Investigator will provide Iterum  an opportunity to review any 
proposed publication or other type of disclosure before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed.

Confidential  Page 64 of 74 APPENDIX 2   MICROBIOLOGY  
Culture and Susceptibility testing  
 
At baseline, intra -abdominal specimens should be sent  for culture of aerobes and anaerobes. 
Samples collected  from abdominal drains are not allowed. Samples should be inoculated into 
aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles, incubated at 35°C –37°C, and transferred to the 
microbiology laboratory. All gram -negat ive pathogens will be tested locally for antimicrobial 
susceptibility, as appropriate. Specific instructions for sample collection, processing, and 
shipment can be found in  the laboratory manual(s) for this study.  
 
The local laboratory should retain all is olates until the end of the study, if possible, or until 
confirmation of a viable organism is received from the central laboratory. Back -up cultures will 
be requested when the central laboratory does not receive a viable culture, or recovers an 
organism di fferent from the one recorded by the local laboratory.  
 
Gram -staining of material from the site of infection  
One slide for Gram -stain is to be prepared from each specimen obtained from the site of the 
intra-abdominal infection. The slide is to be stained and read by the local laboratory and then 
sent to the central laboratory for re- reading and confirmation.  
Organisms considered as pathogens  
The following organisms will always be considered a pathogen when isolated from an acceptable 
culture  specimen:  
• Monomicrobial  or polymicrobial  infections caused by:  
• Enterobacteriaceae  
• Staphylococcus aureus  
• Streptococci  
• Enterococci  
• Anaerobes  
• Pseudomonas spp. 
• Even if the organism was isolated from an acceptable culture  specimen, the following are 
never a pathogen:  
• S. saprophyticus  
• Corynebacterium spp. 
• S. epidermidis  
• Bacillus spp.  
• Diphtheroids  
• Micrococcus spp. 
• Lactobacillus spp.  
All isolates not defined above will be assessed on a case -by-case basis via manual review by the 
Sponsor. If needed, patient clinical (e.g., type of infection, type of specimen, patient underlying 
conditions, etc.) and microbiological information (e.g., Gram stain) will be used to assist in

reviewed by th e Sponsor to determine if the organism is a pathogen.  
Based on the results of in vitro testing, animal studies, PK/PD modeling, surveillance pr ograms 
and clinical trial data , a provisional breakpoint for susceptibility of sulopenem  to 
Enterobacteriaceae, S treptococci and methicillin -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus  is ≤ 0.5 
µg/mL . Disc diffusion interpretive criteria are available for sulopenem . A detailed description of 
the relevant microbiology data is available in the investigator brochure.

Confidential  Page 66 of 74 APPENDIX 3   METHOD FOR DETERMINA TION OF CREATININE  
      CLEARANCE  
Creati nine clearance should be determined by the method of Cockroft -Gault based on serum 
creatinine concentrations obtained at Baseline, using ideal body weight instead of actual weight.  
For females:  
GFR = [(140 -age) * (Ideal body wt in kg) * 0.85] / (72 * Cr)  
For males:  
GFR = [(140- age) * (Ideal body wt in kg)] / (72 * Cr)  
Ideal body weight is calculated as:  
For females:  
If height  (H) > 152.5 cm  
Ideal body weight = 45.4 + [(H -152.4) * 0.89]  
If H < 152.5 cm  
Ideal body weight = 45.4 – [(152.4 – H)* 0.89]  
For male s: 
If H > 152.5 cm  
Ideal body weight = 50 + [(H -152.4) * 0.89]  
If H < 152.5 cm  
Ideal body weight = 50 –  [(152.4 – H)* 0.89]  
In order to determine the need to adjust the dose and/or dosing interval of IV study therapy to be 
administered, the patient’s estimated CrCl should be calculated using the most recent serum 
creatinine value obtained at the local laboratory.  
Dose adjustments for each of the study drugs  based on es timated CrCl are outlined below.  
Study Drug  CrCl ≥30 mL/min  CrCl  <30 mL/min  
Sulopenem IV  1000 mg QD  250 mg QD  
Ertapenem IV  1000 mg QD  500 mg QD  
Ciprofloxacin  500 mg BID  500 mg every 18 hours  
 
No dose adjustment is required for metronidazole in patients with renal impairment, however, a 
50% dose reduction is required for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh C).

APPENDIX 4   POPULATION PK  SUBSTUDY  
1 INTRODUCTION 
This study will be conducted within the context of an ongoing Phase 3 sulopenem  clinical trial 
in order to generate confirma tory data for the population PK profile of both the IV and oral 
pro-drug regimens  of sulopenem . 
1.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This protocol appendix describes the plan for collection, processing and analysis of 
population PK samples collected within Study IT001-303. 
At selected IT001-303 study sites, randomized patients will also be asked to provide plasma 
samples for population PK, according to the schedule noted below. Samples will be collected 
from subjects in both treatment arms. The study will remain b linded, regardless of whether or 
not any individual patient chooses to participate in the population PK sampling.  
See Study Events Table below.  
1.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
Population PK sample requires sampling from an adequate number of p atients and must 
necessarily be done in the setting of a therapeutic clinical trial. The number of subjects and 
samples, and the sampling schedule has been determined using accepted population PK 
principles. A subset of the treatment population is needed f or the study to meet its objectives, 
thus this study will be conducted at a subset of sites selected for their ability and willingness to 
collect and process the additional plasma samples.  
2 STUDY PROCEDURES  
2.1 Study  Population  
Patients at selected investigatio nal sites who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria for study IT001-303 will be eligible for participation in this study.  
This study can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patients are enrolled. All relevant 
medical and non- medical conditions should be taken into consideration when deciding 
whether a particular patient is suitable for enrollment under this protocol.  
2.2 Inclusion Criteria  
Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study.  
• Patient is rand omized into study  IT001-303 
• Patient has given informed consent to participate in the population PK  sampling.  
2.3 Exclusion  Criteria  
Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study.

Confidential  Page 68 of 74 • Patients who are not participating in clinical study  IT001-303 
• Patients in study IT001-303 who have not received study  treatment.  
2.4 Pharmacokinetic  Assessments  
A blood sample will be collected at the following time points : 
• Two hour s (+/- 30 minutes) after end of Day 1  infusion 
• Four  hours (+/ - 2 hours) af ter end of Day 1  infusion 
• Two hours (+/ - 1 hour ) after end of administration of first dose of oral study drug after IV 
to oral switch  
• Four hours (+/ - 2 hours ) after end of administration of first dose of oral study drug after IV 
to oral switch  
• Six hours (+ /- 2 hours ) after end of administration of first dose of oral study drug after IV 
to oral switch  
4 mL of blood will be collected at each time point in Gray top Sodium Fluoride (2.5 
mg/mL)/Potassium Oxalate (2 mg/mL) tubes (BD part#368587). The labels for all biological 
sample collection and storage containers will contain, at a minimum, the subject’s number, 
study number, collection date and collection time. Additional details are provided in the Study 
Laboratory Manual.  
3. PLANNED STATISTI CAL  METHODS  
3.1 General  Considerations 
The statistical methods for analysis of clinical data are described in detail in the protocol for 
the primary study. Relevant clinical data, including baseline and demographic data and data 
on clinical outcomes will be ex cerpted from the primary database for use in the PK/PD 
analyses.  
3.2 Sample Size  Considerations  
For this class of drugs, the pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic (PK -PD) index which best 
describes efficacy is the time of free concentration of sulopenem above MIC (T >MIC) . 
Therefore, the sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling strategy chosen for this study are the 
times which are most informative of the T>MIC , as determined using optimal sampling 
theory. The optimal times at which the five  samples should be drawn, in ho urs after the 
beginning of the first infusion are as follows (the acceptable sampling window is provided in

 The number of s ubjects (with pharmacokinetic sampling) needed to provide adequate 
precision for a PK -PD model is described above. The intention is to gather quality PK -PD 
data in several studies and to pool the concentration and effect data to achieve reasonable 
precisio n. Therefore, as many subjects as possible should be studied during this trial. It has 
been determined that up to 125 sulopenem treated subjects will have pharmacokinetic 
samples drawn in this study.  
4 PLASMA SAMPLE HANDLING AND ANALYSIS  
Detailed instruction s for the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples will 
be provided in the study Laboratory Manual.  
4.1 Sample Collection and Processing  
• Blood samples for PK analysis of sulopenem levels will be collected via direct 
venipuncture using 4 mL Gray top Sodium Fluoride (2.5 mg/mL)/Potassium 
Oxalate (2 mg/mL) tubes (BD part#368587).  
• Immediately after the sample is drawn, the tube must be mixed gently by 
inversion 8 to 10 times and placed on ice.  
• The samples will be centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 minutes at 4ºC within 60 
minutes of collection to achieve a clear plasma layer over the red cells.  
• The plasma will be immediately separated into two 0.5 ml aliquots, transferred 
into 1.8 mL NUNC Cryovial s and stored at approximately - 70ºC or -20ºC 
within 60 minut es of collection.  Samples may only be stored at - 20ºC for a 
maximum of 5 days. Samples stored at - 20ºC must be shipped on dry ice for -
70ºC storage prior to the 7 day expiry . 
• The time of the sampling as well as the time when the dose was administered 
prior  to the sampling will be noted in the CRF.  
4.2 Transport of Samples  
The clinical staff will inventory the samples which are to be shipped to the central lab for 
accessioning and storage. The central lab  will ship samples to the bioanalytic lab for 
measurement of sulopenem  plasma concentrations. Each shipment will contain a complete 
set of samples.  
For sample shipment, the samples will be packed in ample dry ice within a Styrofoam 
container to ensure the samples will remain frozen for at least 72 hours and shipped 
via express delivery to the central lab. Written notification of sample shipment will be 
communicated to the bioanalytical facility and Sponsor. The samples will be tracked 
to assure arrival in a safe and timely manner.  
The shipment will be accompanied by logs showing the name of the study drug product, 
the protocol number, and the subjects and samples included in the shipment. 
Documentation noting the conditions of the samples upon arrival at the central lab and the 
bioanalytical laboratory will be forw arded to the Sponsor/and or Representative.

 4.3 Bioanalytical Sample  Analyses 
The sulopenem  plasma concentrations will be measured using a validated bioanalytical 
method and according to the Bioanalytical Laboratory’s Standard Operating Procedures and 
FDA Guid ances.  
4.4 Bioanalytical Methodology  
A full validation of a sensitive assay for the appropriate analytes in each biological matrix, 
including precision, accuracy, reproducibility, limit of quantitation, recovery, and 
selectivity  will be completed and approved prior to sample analysis. The bioanalytical 
summary report will include the stability of the frozen samples, and a summary of the 
standard curves and quality control samples.  
4.5 Patient Withdrawal  
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, 
behavioral, or administrative reasons  
4.6 Handling Dropout and Withdrawn  Subjects  
Samples from subjects will be analyzed by the bioanalytical laboratory and concentration 
data will be included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses if the subject 
completes the study.  
Samples from subjects who choose to discontinue their participation in the study without 
submitting a written request to withdraw co nsent or are dropped by the Investigator(s) or 
the Sponsor may be analyzed and included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses, 
if pharmacokinetic parameters can be estimated using the remaining data points, or if 
requested by the Sponsor.  Unanal yzed samples from subjects who submit a written request 
to withdraw consent authorization from the study will not be analyzed.  
4.7 Final Integrated Report  
A final report will be issued by the Sponsor after it has been reviewed and released by a 
quality assuran ce specialist, and this report will be appended to the clinical study report for 
the primary study. Where applicable, it will contain a narrative description of the clinical, 
bioanalytical, pharmacokinetic, and statistical procedures used during the conduc t of the 
study.  Appropriate tables and graphs will be created to summarize the data. 
The regulatory agency for submission will include the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration and other Health Agencies, as deemed appropriate for the purpose of 
study conduct or product registration. 
5 PHARMACOKINETIC AND STATISTICAL DATA ANALYSES  
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses will be performed for sulopenem plasma data.

 Data from subjects with missing concentration values (missed blood draws, lost 
samples, samples una ble to be quantitated) may be used if pharmacokinetic parameters 
can be estimated using the remaining data points.  
5.1 Pharmacokinetic Data Analyses  
PK-PD analyses will include all patients who are clinically and/or microbiologically 
evaluable and for whom sulopenem  concentration -time data are available. An estimate of 
sulopenem PK parameters  will be derived for every patient who undergoes PK sampling. 
This will be accomplished by fitting the population PK model developed for sulopenem 
using the data from patie nts from multiple Phase 1  studies to the sulopenem  concentration -
time data. The PK PD index ( T>MIC) will be calculated . The PK -PD index data as well  as 
patient demographics and outcome information may also be pooled with other Phase 3  
studies of sulopenem  for the conduct of the population PK and PK -PD analysis. The results 
of the PK -PD analysis will be reported separate from the clinical study report.

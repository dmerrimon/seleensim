Pharmacokinetics of JZP -110 [(R)-2- amino -3-
phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride] in Subjects with 
Parkinson’s Disease and Excessive Sleepiness  
STUDY NUMBER  JZP166 -201 
STUDY PHASE  Phase 2  
LOCATION  This trial will be cond ucted at approximately 25 sites in the 
United States . 
PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of JZP -110 in the treatment of excessive sleepiness 
in adult subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES  The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of JZP -110 in the treatment of 
excessive sleepiness, as measured by the ESS,  in adult 
subjects with PD  
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of JZP -110 in 
subjects with PD   
EXPLORATORY  
OBJECTIVE S Exploratory  objective s of the study are to evaluate the effect of 
JZP-110 on mean sleep latency, as measured by the MWT (in a 
subpopulation); and the effect of JZP-110 on motor function

  This study is a 4 -week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, ascending dose, 4-period crossover study 
designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK 
of JZP -110 (75, 150, and 300 mg) in the treatment of excessive 
sleepiness in adult subjects with idiopathic PD. Depending on study center  capabilities, subjects  will ha ve the option of 
enrolling into 1 of 2 group s: Group 1 and Group 2. Subjects 
enrolled in Group 1 will undergo both objective ( Maintenance 
of Wakefulness Test [MWT ]) and subjective (Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) assessments of sleepiness. Subjects 
enrolled in Group 2 will undergo only the subjective (ESS) assessment of sleepiness. Following completion of the 
Screening and Baseline visits, approximately 49 eligible 
subjects will be randomly assigned (3:3:1) to 1 of 3 treatment sequences  in order to have approximately 34 subjects complete 
Treatment Sequences  A and B, and 6 subjects complete 
Treatment Sequence C . There will be no stratification based on 
group.

During the first 6 days of each treatment period, subjects will 
take once -daily, oral doses of study drug (placebo, 75, 150, or 
300 mg JZP -110) with water at home, without regard to food, 
and within 1  hour of awakening in the morning (at 
approximately the same time each day) . If a subject fails to 
take the study drug within an hour of awakening, the subject should be instructed to take the study drug, if he/she is able to do so, at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime. If the subject cannot take the study drug at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime, the subject should not take the study drug for that day. Subjects should take their PD medications and sleep medications allowed by the protocol as 
per their usua l schedule each day.   
On the last day of each treatment period (i.e., Days 7, 14, 21, 
and 28) , subjects will take their usual PD medications and 
sleep medications  allowed by the protocol as per their usual 
schedule, and return to the study center where the y will take

Page 4 of 115 their dose of study drug for that day and undergo as sessments 
for efficacy, safety, and tolerability (Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6).  
Subjects will take their study drug with water in the morning at 
the study clinic after predose  assessments are completed. 
Subjects may be served a light meal at 15 minutes after dosing. 
Pending the investigator’s assessment of safety and tolerability, subjects will proceed to the next treatment period . 
Subjects who do not tolerate the study drug will be considered for early termination (at the discretion of the investigator). Subjects will receive their last  dose of study drug at Visit 6 
(Day 28) prior to the Week 4 visit assessments. Subjects will 
return for a  Safety Follow -up visit (Visit 7)  appro ximately 
7 days after the last dose of study drug for follow- up safety 
assessments. Unless there are outstanding safety issues that require additional follow-up, subjects will be discharged from the study at the Safety Follow -up Visit (Visit 7).  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study and will include the following: monitoring of adverse events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs, changes in physical examination findings, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements (including measuring seated and standing blood pressure), and change in response to the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) at each 
visit.  
Efficacy will be assessed by the change from baseline in the ESS score , and  for su bjects who enroll in Group 1 and subjects 
who enrolled prior to Amendment 2, by the change from 
baseline in mean sleep latency time as objectively measured 
using either 3 or 4 trials of the MWT.  
Exploratory efficacy assessments will include changes in scores  from baseline and/or the percentages of subjects 
improved, as applicable, on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Apathy Scale, and Scales for 
Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-cognition (SCOPA- cog). 
Parkinson’s disease clinical status (i.e., motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and motor function) will be assessed using the Movemen t Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale ( MDS -UPDRS) Parts III and IV.   
In addition, subjects who enroll ed in the study prior to 
Amendment 2 implementation would have participated in the 
PK evaluation. Blood samples for PK analysis w ere to be 
collected from each subject at pr edose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 
hours after dos ing at Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6 . A sample was also

THERAPY, DOSE, 
AND MODE OF 
ADMINISTRATION  Placebo tablets will be over -encapsulated in opaque gelatin 
capsules that will be identical to the active JZP -110 treatments. 
Mode of administration will be the same as for the test product 
above . 
DURATION OF 
TREATMENT  The treatment duration for each  subject will be approximately 
4 weeks . 
EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  The following key efficacy endpoint is defined  in terms of 
change from study baseline (prior to first dose in Period 1) to 
the end of each Treatment Period (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28):  
• Change from Baseline in ESS score   
EXPLORATORY 
ENDPOINTS  Exploratory efficacy endpoints:  
• Change from Baseline  in the mean sleep latency time (in 
minutes), as determined from the 40- minute MWT  
• Change from Baseline in MDS -UPDRS Parts III  and IV 
scores 
• CGIc score and percentage of subjects reported as 
improved (minimally, much, or very much) 
• PGIc  score and percentage of subjects reported as 
improved (minimally, much, or very much)  
• Change from Baseline in FSS score  
• Change from Baseline in Apathy Scale score  
• Change from Baseline in SCOPA -cog score  
PHARMACOKINETIC 
ASSESSMENTS For subjects who enroll in the study prior to Amendment 2 
implementation, the PK profile of JZP-110 will be evaluated 
over an 8-hour period based on blood samples (4 mL) collected at predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after dos ing at  
Visits  3, 4, 5, and 6. A sample was  also collected  7 to 8 hours 
after dosing, if feasible , at each visit . The PK parameters to be 
calculated for plasma JZP -110 concentrations will include the 
maximum concentration (C
max), time to C max (Tmax), terminal 
half-life (t 1/2), and area under the  curve (AUC), as appropriate.  
SAFETY  
ASSESSMENTS Safety and tolerability evaluations will consist of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), discontinuations 
due to AEs, and changes in clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs (including measurement of seated and standing blood pressure), 12- lead 
ECGs, physical exams, and C-SSRS assessments.   
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  Sample Size  
Approximately 49 subj ects will be randomized (3:3:1) to  the 
3 sequence groups (A, B, and C) with the goal of 40 subjects 
completing the study : 34 subjects each in Sequences A and B, 
and up to 6 subjects in sequence C. Although the primary 
objective of this study is to a ssess safety, efficacy

Page 11 of 115 endpoint -based power calculations were performed for 
reference. A sample size of 34 subjects (assuming 
17 completing in each of the S equences  A and B) will provide 
80% power to detect a difference of 3  points in the change 
from baseline in ESS score between one of the JZP -110 and 
placebo groups not adjusting for multiple comparisons. This 
calculation assumes a common standard deviation (SD) of 6 points for the change from baseline in ESS score and a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) -based t -test for difference of means in a crossover 
design.  
The rationale for including S equence C in the study is to 
preserve study blinding. 
Statistical Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of JZP -110 is the primary objective of 
this study and descriptive statistics of all safety endpoints will 
be presented by treatment. No inferential statistics will be provided for safety endpoints.  
For the analysis of the key efficacy endpoint of change from 
baseline in ESS , a mixed -effects model will be used as the 
primary method of analysis. This model will include fixed  
effects for treatment (dose), sequence, treatment -by-sequence 
interaction, and baseline value of the efficacy endpoint. The model will also include a random effect for subject within sequence. Model- adjusted differences between each active 
treatment dose (75, 150, and 300 mg ) and placebo, along with 
95% confidence interval s, will be presented.  
For the analysis of the MWT exploratory endpoint, a similar 
mixed -effect s model as for ESS will be used. However, 
because the MWT will be optional and consequently result in a reduced sample size, there may be convergence issues associated with the mixed -effects model. In th e event such 
issues do arise, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model without accounting for treatment sequence may be used at each visit.  
For the analysis of the efficacy endpoints of improvement in PGIc and CGIc scores, chi- square tests  will be used to test 
hypotheses of differences between placebo and each active dose. A mixed -effects model similar to the model described 
above will be used for the analysis of MDS- UPDRS, FSS, 
Apathy Scale, and SCOPA -cog endpoints. No adjustment for 
multiple testing will be performed.  
Summary statistics for all efficacy assessments will be

Page 22 of 115 1 INTRODUCTION 
JZP-110 [(R)-2-amino -3-phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride] is a phenylalanine derivative 
(previously known as ADX-N05, R228060, and YKP10A) that is currently being 
investigated as a potential treatment for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apn ea (OSA). Nonclinical data indicate that JZP -110 is a wake-promoting agent that 
lacks the noradrenergic releasing effects of amphetamines (EDMS  PSDB -4956838, 
EDMS -PSDB -2735318, EDMS -PSDB -5305783) and does not produce rebound hypersomnia 
in rodent models ( Hasan et al. 2009). Pharmacologically, JZP-110 appears to be a 
low-potency reuptake inhibitor at dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. 
JZP-110 was originally synthesized by SK Life Science (South Korea). The molecule has 
been under development for the treatment of depression and for the treatment of excessive 
sleepiness in nar colepsy under various sponsors. Jazz Pharmaceuticals intends to complete 
development of JZP-110 for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy and in adult patients with OSA by demonstrating increased ability to stay awake throughout the day using the validated Maintenance of Wakefulness T est (MWT) and 
decreased subjective sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).  
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative brain disorder for which no cure has been identified. According to Decision Resources 2015, there were 926,000 patients with PD in the United States (US) in 2014 (or 4.7 cases per 1000) ( Christmann et al. 2015). Due, in 
part, to the aging of the population, the prevalence of PD is estimated to increase approximately 2.7% per year through 2029, yielding 1.37 million in 2029. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons that clinical ly results in motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and 
postural instability ( Halliday  & McCann, 2010). Postmortem studies suggest that 30% to 
50% of dopaminergic cell bodies are lost in the substantia nigra at the time motor symptoms appear ( Cheng  et al. 2010; Ishibashi et al. 2014 ) and imaging studies of patients with PD 
have shown decreased dopamine transporter levels beginning in the posterior putamen (Ishibashi et al. 2014). Although the etiology of PD is unclear, it is thought to involve both genetic and environmental factors.  
In addition to motor symptoms, most patients with PD experience clinically significant nonmotor symptoms such as changes in mood, memory, blood pressure, bowel and bladder function, sleep, fatigue, weight, and sensation. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep disturbances are common and can adversely affect quality of life of patients as well as their caregivers; however, sleep disturbances are often not diagnosed and consequently are often untreated ( Shulman et al. 2002 ; Karlsen et al.  1999; Weerkamp et al. 2013). Sleep 
disturbances in PD include the following: insomnia, rapid eye movement behavioral disorder (RBD), sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder, and excessive sleepiness (for review see Videnovic and Golombek 2013). In a large multicenter s urvey of 
nonmotor symptoms of 1072 PD patients, 21.2% of patients complained of excessive sleepiness, 36.9% referred insomnia, 29.6% suffered from behavioral sleep disturbances, and 15.2% from restless legs syndrome ( Barone et al. 2009). Further, in a Food and Drug

Page 23 of 115 Administration ( FDA ) patient-f ocused report that gathered perspectives from PD patients, 
caretakers and other patient representatives, over one-third of participants iden tified sleep 
disturbances as 1  of their most significant symptoms that impacts daily life 
(FDA  Parkinson’s Dise ase Public Meeting 2015 ). 
In particular, excessive sleepiness can affect 20% to 50% of patients with PD ( Knie 2011; 
Arnulf 2005) and is more frequent in these patients than in age- matched healthy subjects 
(Tandberg et al. 1999; Brodsky et al. 2003) . Although excessive sleepiness is observed at all 
levels of PD severity, studies have shown that disease pathology is an important contributor 
of excessive sleepiness ( Knie 2011). For instance, in a population-based prevalence study, 
the frequency rate of excessive sleepiness increased from 6% at baseline to 41% after 8 years (Gjerstad et al. 2006). In addition, the pathophysiology of excessive sleepi ness is 
multifactorial and might be due to the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system 
and other nondopamine neurons involved in sleep- wake regulation as well as secondary 
mechanisms such as other disorde rs (e.g. OSA , depression) and use of anti-parkinsonian 
medication ( Videnovic and Golombek 2013). For instance, commonly prescribed dopamine 
agonists may contribute to excessive sleepiness ( Paus et al. 2003). However, 1 study 
demonstrated that the frequency of excessive sleepiness was similar between PD patients regardless of dopamine agonist treatment (Gjerstad et al. 2006). Other studies suggest that excessive sleepiness may potentially predate PD (Gao et al. 2011;  Abbott et al. 2005). For 
example, in a large epidemiological aging study, there  was more than a 3 -fold increase in the 
risk o f developing PD in elderly men with excessive sleepiness  that could not be accounted 
for by any other factor (Abbott et  al. 2005). Taken together, these data indicate that 
sleepiness may exist, albeit to a less er degree, before the onset of Parkinsonism and before 
the use of dopamine agents, suggesting that other, disease-dependent factors contribute to the sleepiness ( Arnulf & Leu-Semenescu  2009; Knie 2011;  Gjerstad 2002;  Gjerstad et al. 2006). 
Evidence- based g uidelines by The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American 
Academy of Neurology state that there is an urgent need to evaluate drugs to treat the nonmotor symptoms, including excessive sleepiness, in PD in controlled clinical trials (Zesiewicz et al. 2010).  Although there are no currently approved medications to improve 
wakefulness and to treat excessive sleepiness in PD, there are a few specific guidelines for the pharmacotherapy of excessive sleepiness in PD patients ( Rye 2006;  Zesiewicz et al.  
2010; Seppi et al. 2011; Ferreira et al. 2013). For instance, the guidelines specifically mention that modafinil should be considered for patients to improve their subjective perception of excessive daytime sleepiness. However, modafinil does not appear to adeq uately promote wakefulness throughout the day with once daily dosing in patients with 
PD (Högl et al. 2002; Adler et al. 2003, Ondo et al. 2005; Lou et  al. 2009 ). 
As a result of the findings of significant decreases in excessive sleepiness (lower ESS scores) and significant increases in the ability to stay awake throughout the day (higher MWT sleep latencies) when adult patients with narcolepsy were treated with JZP -110, as well as the 
urgent clinical need reported by patients with PD for therapies tha t better treat their 
symptoms that significantly impacts their daily lives (FDA Parkinson’s Dise ase Public

Page 24 of 115 Meeting 2015), Jazz Pharmaceuticals is conducting this study with JZP- 110 to generate 
safety,  efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) information in this population. 
1.1 Study Rationale 
The MWT is the standard objective measure of an individual’s ability to remain awake 
during in a darkened, quiet environment and is commonly used to assess response to treatment (International Classification of Slee p Disorders, Third Edition, American Academy  
of Sleep Medicine [AASM 2014] ). For example, results from a previous Phase 2a, 4- week, 
crossover study of 300 mg JZP-110 (150 mg for 1 week followed by 300 mg for 1 week) compared with placebo in patients with narcolepsy dem onstrated a maximal difference in the 
means between drug and placebo of 11.8 minutes on a 40- minute MWT ( Bogan et al. 2015). 
Similarly, data from a  Phase 2b , 12-week, parallel -group study of JZP -110 (150 mg for 
4 weeks followed by 300 mg for 8 weeks) compa red with placebo  resulted in maximal 
differences in the means of 8.1 and 10.7 minutes between 150 or 300 mg JZP-110 and placebo, respectively, on a 40- minute MWT ( Ruoff et  al. 2016). Moreover, data from the 
Phase 2b study of JZP-110 in subjects with narcol epsy indicate that the therapeutic effects 
appear to last throughout the day. For instance, the mean change from baseline in sleep latency on the fifth trial of a  5-trial, 40 -minute MWT was 8.2 minu tes for the 300-mg dose of 
JZP-110 (signif icantly greater than placebo, p=0.0007). The mean change from baseline 
(5.4 minutes)  on the fifth trial of a 5 -trial, 40 -minute MWT was also significantly greater 
than placebo (p=0.0002) for the 150-mg dose of J ZP-110.  
In contrast, previous studies of modafinil in patients with narcolepsy have demonstrated statistically significant increases in mean sleep latency using a 20 -minute MWT with 
maximal differences in the means between drug and placebo  groups ranging from 2.3 to 
4.5 minutes ( US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 1998, 
US Modafinil in  Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 2000, Harsh et al. 2006). However, a 
limitation of modafinil is that the therapeutic effects of this drug do not appear to last 
throughout the day and are markedly reduced by the fifth trial of a 5 - or 6 -trial, 20- minute 
MWT ( Schwartz et al. 2003). For example, the effects of 200 and 400 mg modafinil 
diminished throughout the day, and the mean changes from baseline i n sleep latency were 
almost 0  on the fifth and sixth trials of a 6 -trial, 20 -minute MWT (5 :00 to 7:00  
PM) when 
modafinil was given once daily in the morning (Schwartz et al. 2003). O nly a few studies 
have used objective measures of excessive sleepiness, such as the MWT, in PD patients with subjective reports of excessive sleepiness. Perhaps similar to the limited effects of modafinil in patients with narcolepsy, a placebo- controlled, double -blind study of modafinil in patients 
with PD demonstrated no significant increase in mean sleep latency, compared to placebo, using a 40- min MWT ( Högl et al. 2002). Taken together, these data suggest that JZP -110 
might offer an important advance in the treatment of excessive sleepiness in PD by increasing patients’ ability to stay awake throughout the day beyond what has been demonstrated with current available therapies.

Page 25 of 115 1.2 Nonclinical Experience 
Nonclinical studies have been conducted to characterize primary pharmacology, secondary 
and safety pharmacology, abuse liability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, 
and toxicology of JZP-110. 
1.2.1  Mechanism of A ction 
JZP-110 is a selective, low potency dopamine and  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has 
lower binding affinity to the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters than stimulants such 
as cocaine. JZP -110 is a nonamphetamine wake-promoting agent that lacks the  
noradrenergic -releasing effects of  amphetamines and does not produce rebound hypersomnia. 
In vivo pharmacologic studies suggest JZP-110 imparts indirect effects on noradrenergic  and 
dopam inergic systems a nd demonstrate a robust wake-promoting profile.  JZP-110 enhances 
wakefulness in both wild- type and narcoleptic mice and did not have an impact on sleep  
following prolonged wakefulness, suggesting  potential effectiveness in treating  excessive 
sleepiness in narcolepsy.  The wake -promoting action of JZP-110 differs from that of both 
d-amphetamine and  modafinil; both of which are used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness  
in narcolepsy.  
In vitro  and in vivo safety pharmacology  studies indicated no significant sa fety concerns. 
JZP-110 has minimal effects on cardiovascular function, including increases in blood 
pressure and heart rate.  
1.2.2  Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
JZP-110 was rapidly and extensively  absorbed and showed high oral bioavailability (71% to  
100%) in mic e, rats,  and dogs. Single -dose half -life (t 1/2) values  following oral 
administration were 1, 2, and 4 hours in mice, rats (longer in chronic studies at high doses), 
and dogs, respectively,  with no unexpected accumulation with repeated administration.  In 
rats, the disposition profile in plasma was monophasic and elimination was mostly  by renal  
excretion. Overall , the maximum concentration (C max) and area under the concentration- time 
curve ( AUC ) tended to increase proportionally with dose and were comparable in male and 
female animals.  
Plasma protein binding was low (8% to 17%) in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma.  
Metabolism is not an important elimination pathway  in humans as almost all (>90%) material 
excreted in  urine was unchanged drug with a minor metabolite (N -acetyl derivative of  
JZP-110 base) accounting for <1% of the dose excreted in  urine. The main metabolite in 
animal species was an acid metabolite, but a  parahydroxyphenyl  metabolite and its 
glucuronide were also identified.   
In vitro cytochrome P450 (CYP) experiments  indicated low potential for JZP-110 drug- drug 
metabolism interactions by either inhibition or induction mechanisms. JZP -110 did not

Page 26 of 115 inhibit CYP  enzymes including CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. JZP-110 showed no induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, or 
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)  1A1  enzyme s. Furthermore, JZP-110 
was not a substrate or inhibitor of major uptake or efflux transporters, and did not inhibit UGT1A1 or U GT2B7 enzymes . 
1.2.3  Toxicology  
Single oral doses of JZP -110 at up  to 600, 750, and 140 mg/kg were  well tolerated by mice,  
rats, and dogs, respectively. Clinical signs were mainly  related to central nervous system  
(CNS) stimulation in all species.  In addition to these clinical signs, dogs  also had salivation, 
mydriasis,  restlessness, panting, and/or marked transient elevation of body temperature.  
Repeat -dose toxicity studies of durations up to 3 months in mice, 6 months in rats, and 
12 months in dogs resulted in similar dose -related  CNS effects.  
A battery  of in vitro and in  vivo assays indicated that JZP-110 has no genotoxic potential. 
Two-year rat  and mouse carcinogenicity  studies are in progress. 
More detailed information  about the toxicology findings is provided in the JZP-110 
Investigator’ s Brochure . 
1.3 Clinical Experience  
Clinical studies of JZP -110 (seven Phase 1 and five Phase 2 studies) have been completed in 
1048 subjects,  of whom 690 subjects received 1 or more doses of JZP-110. In studies in 
which subjects received acute doses of JZP -110, doses ranged from 50 mg to 1200 mg. In 
studies in which subjects received repeated, daily doses of JZP -110, doses ranged from 
100 to 1000 mg/day (calculated based on the hydrochloride salt). The highest dose that is 
being used in the Phase 3 studies in patients with narcolepsy or OSA is 300 mg, calculated 
based on free base of the molecule. This is equivalent to 356 mg based on the hydrochloride salt. Overall, the highest dose that has been studied in human subjects is 1200 mg with the dose calculated using the weight of the hydrochloride salt, which is equivalent to a 1010 mg dose calculated using the weight of the free base.  
1.3.1  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism  
JZP-110 is eliminated primarily via the renal route, with at least 90% of the dose being 
excreted as unchanged drug within 48 hours. Following single dosing and repeated doses administered twice daily, JZP -110 exposure was dose-propor tional, absorption (time to 
maximum plasma concentration [t
max]: 1.3 to 3.0 hours) and elimination (t 1/2: 5 to 7.6 hours) 
were relatively rapid, and steady state was reached in 3 days. JZP -110 displayed linear PK  
during 14 days of dosing over the dose range of 200 to 1000 mg per day. Limited accumulation and no enzyme auto-induction were evident.

Page 27 of 115 1.3.2  Clinical Efficacy in Subjects with Excessive Sleepiness in Narcolepsy  
In the 2 Phase 2 studies in patients with narcolepsy and excessive sleepiness  
(Studies ADX-N05 201 and ADX-N05 202), JZP- 110 significantly decreased the excessive 
sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, with statistically significant differences from placebo 
on the primary efficacy endpoints. 
Study ADX-N05 201 was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter, crossover study. JZP-110 (after dosing with 150 mg/day for 1 week followed by 
dosing with 300 mg/day for a second week) effectively increased the mean sleep latency as measured by the MWT  in subjects with narcolepsy. Subjects were able to stay awake for an 
average of about 11 minutes longer following dosing with JZP-110 than placebo, a statistically significant difference. When the 5  MWT trials were analyzed separately, 
improvement in sleep latency statistically favored JZP -110 over placebo for all trials and 
improvements were maintained throughout the approximate 7-hour period after dosing. Results from analyses of the subjective measures of the ESS  and the Clinical Global 
Impression of Change (CGIc ) scale were consistent with MWT findings and statistically 
significant in favor of JZP-110 over placebo. 
Study ADX-N05 202 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, 
parallel -group study in which subjects in the JZP-110 group received 150 mg JZP -110 daily 
through Week 4 and then received 300 mg daily through Week 12. JZP-110 demonstrated 
statistically significant differences in favor of JZP -110 compared with placebo on all efficacy 
endpoints, including the objective endpoint of the mean sleep latency time  measured by the 
MWT, and the subjective endpoints of the subject- completed E SS, investigator- completed 
CGIc, and subject- completed Patient Gl obal Impression of Change (PGIc ).  
JZP-110 effectively increased sleep latency time across the first 4 MWT trials. When the 
4 MWT trials were averaged, subjects were able to stay awake f or about 8 minutes longer 
after 4 weeks (150 mg/day) and 11 minutes longer after 12 weeks (300 mg/day) of 
administration of JZP -110 than with placebo, a statistically significant difference. When the 
four MWT trials were analyzed separately, improvement in sleep latency also statistically favored JZP-110 over placebo for all trials at both Weeks 4 and 12 and was maintained throughout the approximate 9-hour period after dosing. 
Analyses of the investigator- completed CGIc  scale results were consistent with MWT 
findings and evidenced statistical superiority of JZP-110 over placebo. After 12 weeks, 
86% of subjects in the JZP-110 group experienc ed at least minimal improvement on the 
CGIc  versus only 38% of subjects in the placebo group. Statistically significant improvement 
was observed as early as after 1 week. Analyses of the subject -completed ESS and PGIc 
scales were also consistent with a statistically significant superiority of JZP -110 over 
placebo.

Page 28 of 115 1.3.3  Safety of JZP -110 in Subjects with Excessive Sleepiness in Narcolepsy  
Pooled across the 2 Phase 2 studies in subjects with narcolepsy, the most frequent (≥5%) 
treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs)  were insomnia, headache, nausea, anxiety, 
diarrhea, palpitations, irritability, bruxism, and chest discomfort; all had a higher incidence with JZP -110 than with placebo. No deaths occurred in either study. In Study ADX- N05 201, 
there were no treatment -emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to 
AEs. Severe treatment -emergen t AEs occurred in 2 subjects (1  with intermittent nausea and 
1 with insomnia). In Study ADX- N05 202, treatment- emergent SAEs  occurred in 2 subjects 
(both in the JZP -110 group): 1 subject  had conversion disorder and 1 subject had acute 
cholec ystitis. Treatment- emergent AE s led to study discontinuation of 3 subje cts in the 
JZP-110 group (the subject with conversion disorder noted above; 1 subject with severe 
anxiet y, moderate insomnia and moderate bruxism; and 1 subject with moderate insomnia 
and mild palpitations ) and 2 subjects in the placebo group (headache and fatigue).  
In Study ADX -N05 202, JZP- 110 was associated with minimal effects on placebo -corrected 
changes in heart rate (both measured and from electrocardiograms [ECGs]) and blood pressure. There was no effect on ECG interval measures.  
1.3.4  Safety of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Major Depression and in Healthy 
Subjects  
Most of the 322 healthy subjects and 600 depressed subjects in studies with completed data analysis experienced AE s, the majority of which were mild or moderate. There were no 
deaths.  
Pooled across 5 studies in healthy subjects and subject s with major depressive disorder 
(MDD) (NED-1, USA-10, MDD-201, SAB-101, and P01-101), the most common (≥5%) 
treatment -emergent AE s that also occurred with a higher incidence with JZP-110 than with 
placebo were insomnia, headache, dizziness, anorexia, dry mouth, nervousness, nausea, palpitation, agitation, abdominal pain, anxiety, fatigue, concentration impaired, and diarrhea. The only common treatment -emergent  AEs that occurred more often with placebo than 
JZP-110 were somnolence and dyspepsia. Safety findings in the other clinical studies were 
consistent with th ose summarized above.

ty Summary  
Safety data from  690 subjects who received JZP-110 in completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical 
trials support initiation and continuation of cli nical trials. Most AE s were mild or moderate 
and did not lead to study discontinuation. Few SAEs or discontinuations due to AE s 
occurred. No clinically significant effects on ECG were observed. Effects on mean heart rate 
and blood pressure were small and transient (with mean heart rate and blood pressure remaining within the normal range) at doses comparable to  or lower than those being used in 
the Phase 3 clinical studies  for narcolepsy or OSA. In safety monitoring of ongoing trials of 
JZP-110, no new safety signals have been identified to date. 
1.4 Summary of Potential Benefits and Risks 
Parkinson’s disease is a p rogressive neurodegenerative disease, which ma nifests with both 
motor and nonmotor symptoms. Until recently, treatment has focused on improving the motor symptoms, however the nonmotor symptoms can also be prominent and disabling and treatment guidelines n ow recognize the n eed to improve these symptoms. Excessive 
sleepiness is a common nonmotor symptom of PD with limited therapeutic options as no therapeutic agents have been approved by the FDA for this indication. 
The wake -promoting effects of JZP -110 (150 and 300 mg administered once daily) on 
subjective (ESS, PGI- c, CGI -c) and objective (MWT sleep latency) endpoints of excessive 
sleepiness were evaluated in P hase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled studi es in patients with 
narcolepsy. The results of these st udies showed statistically significant effects o n both 
subjective and objective endpoints. The magnitude of the effect s was  robust, with increases 
in mean sleep latency (m easured by MWT) of up to 12 minutes compared with placebo 
following 12 weeks of JZP-110 administration.

Page 30 of 115 The wake -promoting effects of JZP -110 for patients with PD have not been previously 
evaluated. The present Study JZP-166-201 will evaluate the effects of 75, 150, and  300 mg  of 
JZP-110 on excessive sle epiness in patients with PD .  
The safety and tolerability of JZP -110 has been well characterized in multiple populations 
including healthy volunteers, patients with MDD, and patients with narcolepsy. Across 
3 Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects (R228060- NED -1, R228060-P01-101, and 
R228060- SAB -101) and 2 Phase 2 studies in patients with MDD (R228060- USA-10 and 
R228060- MDD-201), data were pooled for 421 subjects who received JZP-110 at doses of 
200 to 1200 mg/day (with doses calculated based on the hydrochloride salt of the molecule) and 185 subjects who received placebo. The most common (≥5%) treatment- emergent AEs 
that also occurred with a higher incidence with JZP-110 than with placebo were insomnia, headache, dizziness, anorexia, dry mouth, nervousness, nausea, palpitation, agitation, abdominal pain, anxiety, fatigue, concentration impaired, and diarrhea. Common treatment -emergent AEs that occurred more often with placebo than JZP- 110 were 
somnolence and dyspepsia. Based on data pooled across 2 Phase 2 studies (Studies ADX-N05 201 and ADX-N05 202) of JZP-110 at doses up to 300 mg/day in subjects with narcolepsy (N=77, JZP- 110; N=82, placebo), the most frequent (≥5%) 
treatment -emergent AEs were insomnia, headache, nausea, decreased appetite, anxiet y, 
diarrhea, palpitations, irritability, bruxism, and chest discomfort; all had a higher incidence with JZP -110 than with placebo.  
Randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies in the narcolepsy and OSA populations are currently ongoing and remain blinded. 
No PK- based d rug-drug interactions are expected  between JZP-110 and the commonly used 
background P D therapy medications , as JZP -110 does not undergo hepatic m etabolism, and 
does not inhibit or induce major CYP450 enzymes . JZP -110 is eliminated primarily through 
renal excretion, and in vitro studies indicate that JZP-110 does not inhibit major uptake or 
efflux  transporters. The pharmacodynamic- based drug- drug interaction pot ential between 
JZP-110 (a selective norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor) and background 
dopamine replacement therapy used in PD is unknown, and the effect of coadministration will be evaluated via safety/efficacy assessments in the current study.  
Since there are limited therapeutic options , with no drugs that have been approved for the 
treatment of excessive sleepiness  in PD, there remains an unmet clinical need for a 
well-tolerated and effective therapy. The extensive clinical safety database across multiple 
populations for JZP -110 and the positive efficacy  results in narcolepsy patients provide an 
appropriate balance between risk and benefit. When all the considerations are taken together, they provide the basis to support the evaluation of the safety, tolerability , efficacy,  and PK 
profile of JZP -110 in patients with excessive sleepiness and PD.

The schedules of e vents are presented in Appendix 1 and  Appendix 4, and the study s chema 
in Figure 1. 
This is a 4 -week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose, 
4-period crossover study designed to evaluate t he safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK of 
JZP-110 (75, 150, and 300 mg) in the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult subjects with 
idiopathic PD. Depending on study center  capabilities, subjects  will have the option of 
enrolling into 1 of 2 group s: Group 1 and Group 2. Subjects enrolled in Group 1 will undergo 
both objective (MWT) and subjective (ESS) assessments of sleepiness. Subjects enrolled in 
Group 2 will undergo only the subjective (ESS) assessment of sleepiness. Following completion of the S creening and Baseline visits, approximately 49  eligible subjects will be 
randomly assigned  (3:3:1) to 1 of 3 treatment sequences  in order to have approximately 
34 subjects complete Treatment Sequences A and B, and 6 subjects complet e Treatment 
Sequence C . There will be no stratification based on group. Sequence C is added to  preserve 
blinding across the 4  treatment periods.

During the first 6 days of each treatment period, subjects will take once-daily, oral doses of 
study drug (placebo, 75, 150, or 300 mg JZP-110) with water at home, without regard to 
food, and within 1  hour of awakening  in the morning (at approximately the same time each 
day).  If a subject fails to take the study drug within an hour of awakening, the subject should 
be instructed to take the study drug, if he/she is able to do so, at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime. If the subject cannot take the study drug at least 12 hours before his/her 
anticipated bedtime, the subject should not take the study drug for that day. Subjects should take their PD medications and sleep medications allowed by the protocol as per their usual

Subjects will take their study drug with water in the morning at the study clinic after predose 
assessments are completed. Subjects may be served a light meal at  15 minutes after dosing. 
Pending the investigator’s assessment of safety and tolerability, subjects will proceed to the 
next treatment period. Subjects will receive their last dose of study drug at Visit 6 (Day 28) 
prior to the Week 4 visit assessments. S ubjects will return for a Safety Follow -up visit 
(Visit 7) approximately 7 days after the last dose of study drug for follow- up safety 
assessments. Unless there are outstanding safety issues that require additional follow-up, subjects will be discharged  from the study at the Safety Follow -up visit (Visit 7).  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study and will include the following: monitoring of AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, changes in physical examination findings, ECGs, clinical lab oratory tests, vital sign measurements (including measuring seated and 
standing blood pressure), and change in response to the Columbia- Suicide Severity Ratin g 
Scale (C -SSRS) at each visit.  
Efficacy will be assessed by the change from baseline in the ESS score, and  for subjects who 
enroll in Group 1 and subjects who enrolled prior to Amendment 2, by the change from baseline in mean sleep latency time as objectively measured using either 3 or 4 trials of the 
MWT.  
Exploratory efficacy assessments will include  changes in scores  from baseline and/or the 
percentages of subjects improved, as applicable, on the CGIc, PGIc, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Apathy Scale, and the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson' s disease-cognition 
(SCOPA -cog). 
Parkinson’s disease clinic al status (e.g., motor fluctuations, dyskinesia) will be assessed 
using the Movement Disorders Society- Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale 
(MDS -UPDRS) Parts III and IV.  
In addition, subjects who enroll ed in the study prior to Amendment 2 implementatio n would 
have participated in the PK evaluation. Blood samples for PK analysis were  to be collected 
from each subject at pr edose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after dosing at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 
6. A sample was  also collected 7 to 8 hours after dosing, as feasible, at each study center 
visit.

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
This study was designed to be consi stent with the US  FDA  Guidance for Industry on 
Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, w ith 
the ICH, Guidance on The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety for Drugs 
Intended for Long -Term Treat ment of Non- Life-Threatening Conditions and with the ethical 
principles given in these guidances , which have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The inclusion of a placebo as a control into sequences A and B  in the Treatment Phase of this 
study i s necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of this new investigational medicinal 
product. Inclusion of the placebo sequence C will preserve  blinding. A crossover design has 
been selected in order to evaluate the safety, tolerability , and effects on excessive sleepiness 
across a range of doses. Phase 2 studies in patients with narcolepsy have shown that JZP-110 
(150 and 300 mg doses) improves subjective and objective parameters of sleepiness and is 
well tolerated . While the same sleepi ness parameters are included as endpoints in this study 
as in the Phase 2 narcolepsy study, the objective MWT assessment was made optional in 
Amendment 2 for this study as unlike in narcolepsy, it is not a common assessment for diagnosing s leepiness in PD  and it has not been validated in this patient population. The 
Phase 2 a narcolepsy study was a crossover design and a carryover effect was not observed. In 
light of this and the short half -life of JZP -110, a placebo washout between each treatment 
period was not included. The doses of 75, 150 and 300 mg selected for evaluation in this 
study are comparable to those currently being evaluated  in ongoing Phase 3  studies in the 
OSA and narcolepsy populations. It is feasible that lower doses may be pharmacologicall y 
active and therefore, a bro ad range of doses from 75 to 300 mg given once daily for 7 days

schedule each day.  
On the last day of each treatment period (i.e., Days 7, 14, 21, and 28), subjects will take their 
usual PD medications and sleep medications  allowed by the protocol as per their usual 
schedule, and return to the study center where they will take th eir study drug for that day and 
undergo assessments for efficacy, safety, and tolerability  (Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6). Subjects will 
take their study drug with water  in the morning at the study clinic  after predose assessments 
are completed. Subjects may be served a light meal at 15 minutes after dosing. Pending the 
investigator’s assessment of safety and tolerability, subjects will proceed to the next Treatment Period . Subjects who do not tolerate the study dr ug will be considered for early 
termination (at the discretion of the investigator).  
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
Data from the ADX -N05 201 and ADX-N05 202 trials that were conducted in patients with 
narcolepsy d emonstrated that doses of 150 and 300 mg JZP- 110 increased the mean  sleep 
latency on the first 4  trials of the MWT by 9.5 and 12.8 minutes from baseline, respectively, 
and increased the sleep latency on the fifth trial of the MWT by 5.4 and 8.2 minutes from 
baseline, respectively. B ased on these findings and the safety and tolerability profiles of 150 
and 300 mg JZP- 110 in adult patients with narcolepsy in these trials, this study will further 
evaluate of the safety and efficacy of 150 and 300 mg, in addition to the lower dose of 75 mg JZP-110 given once a day in the morning. 
During the treatment period s, subjects are to continue taking their usual PD medications and 
sleep medications allowed by the protocol as per their usual schedule. Subjects will be 
instructed to take a single dai ly dose of study drug in the morning, with water at home, 
without regard to food, and within 1 hour of awakening  (at approximately the same time each 
day). If a subject fails to take the study drug within an hour of awakening, the subject should 
be instructed to take the study drug, if he/she is able to do so, at least 12 hours before his/her 
anticipated bedtime. If the subject cannot take the study drug at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime, the subject should not take the study drug for that day. On the last day of each treatment period (i.e., Days 7, 14, 21, and 28), subjects will take their usual PD medications and sleep medications allowed by the protocol as per their usual schedule, and 
return to the study center where they will take their  dose of study drug for that day and 
undergo assessments for efficacy, safety, and tolerability (Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6). Subjects will 
take their study drug with water  in the morning at the study clinic  after predose assessments 
are completed. Subjects may be served a light meal at 15 minutes after dosing.  
5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Eligible subjects will be randomly as signed  (3:3:1) to treatment sequences A, B, and C, as 
described in Section 5.2. There will be no stratification based on group. 
The investigator will access an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) or an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to randomize subjects.

Page 42 of 115 5.5 Randomization 
A statistician selected by Jazz Pharmaceuticals will prepare and retain the master 
randomization code for the entire study. This statistician will not be involved in the analysis of this study. A copy of the master randomization code will be provided to the head of the Quality Department at Jazz Pharmaceuticals, or a designee in the Quality Department. The Head of Quality at Jazz Pharmaceuticals will sequester the master randomization code. Unless there is an emergency that requires the release of the subject ’s assigned treatment, the 
code will not be broken or released until all study data are collected and accepted for analysis.    
5.6 Blinding 
A double-blind approach will be used during the Treatment Phase. All study drug throughout the study will be prepared in identical opaque gelatin capsules to ensure adequate blinding of the subject and study personnel. A subject’s treatment assignment may be unblinded for safety reasons (see Section s 6.14.2 and 6.14.4).  
5.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
During the Screening Phase, prior (30 days), during the 4- week Treatment Phase, and during 
the 1 -week Safety Follow -up Period, concomitant medication use and a ny medications 
(including stimulants) or devices used for the treatment of excessive sleepiness since 
diagnosis will be documented. These medications will be recorded on the electronic case 
report form ( eCRF)  for randomized subjects.  
The following OTC or prescription medications must be discontinued within 14 days prior to 
the Baseline visit (Visit 2) . These medications are disallowed  throughout the study as well 
(including the 1- week Safety Follow -up Period) :  
• OTC or prescription medications containing pseudoephedrine 
• Modafinil or Armodafinil 
• Methylphenidate 
• Amphetamines  or Dextroamphetamines  (e.g., Adderall)  
• Diphenhydramine  
• Sodium oxybate (i.e., Xyrem)  
• Droxidopa (Note: Must be discontinued within 7 days prior to Baseline visit) 
• Any other OTC or prescription medications that, in the opinion of the investigator, could 
affect the evaluation of excessive sleepiness  
 
Use of the following medications for the treatment of PD motor symptoms is allowed at any 
time during the study provided that the subject has been on a stable treatment regimen for 
4 weeks prior to screening and will continue this regimen during the study. 
• Dopaminergic agents (e.g., levodopa, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) 
• MAO- B inhibitors (e.g., rasagiline, selegiline , safinamide)

Page 46 of 115 6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent 
All subjects will provide their written informed consent befo re the performance of any 
study- related procedures.  Subjects will be given a copy of their signed and dated informed 
consent. 
Each subject ’s chart will hav e his or her signed informed consent form (ICF) for study  
participation attached to it. When the study treatment is completed and the eCRF has been 
monitored, the ICF will be kept in the investigator’s central study file.  Regulatory authorities 
may check the existence of the signed ICF in this central study folder.  
6.2 Demographics 
Demographic information will be collected at the S creening  visit as permitted by regional or 
national regulations. Demographics will include the date the subject signed the informed 
consent, and the subject’s age (as indicated by date of birth), sex, ethnicity, and race.  
6.3 Medical History 
A complete medical history will be collected for each subject during screening . The 
information will include, but is not limited to, concomitant medication use; any medications or devices used for the treatment of excessive sl eepiness and PD since diagnosis; any prior 
reaction to drugs; history and treatment (if any) of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hep atic, renal, immunologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease; reproductive 
status; and confirmation of relevant inclusion criteria. Medical history should include documenting the diagnosis of excessive sl eepiness and PD , and the frequency of use of any 
therapy for excessive sleepiness. Any updates to the medical history  will be assessed at the 
Baseline visit.  
6.4 Physical Examination 
A review of body systems should be obtained on each subject during the Screening visit and at the Baseline visit; at Visits 3, 4,  5, and 6/Early Termination; and at the Safety Follow -up 
visit. Physical examinations will include a n examination of body systems (except 
genitourinary), height (at screening only), and body weight measurements. Height and weight should be assessed in ordinary indoor clothes without shoes. A qualified investigator or designee should perform the examination. 
6.5 Vital Signs 
Vitals signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure  [both seated and standing], pulse [both 
seated and standing] , respiratory rate, and body temperature) will be obtained at every clinic 
visit after the subject has been resting and seated for at least 5  minutes. For blood pressure 
and pulse rate measurement, the subject  should be seated comfortably with the back 
supported and the upper arm bared without constrictive clothing. The subject’s legs should not be crossed. The arm should be supported at heart level, and the bladder of the cuff should

Page 47 of 115 encircle at least 80% of t he arm circumference. Neither the subject nor the observer should 
talk during the measurement. Standing blood pressure and pulse rate should be taken at 1 and 
3 minutes after the subject has been standing. 
For the seated assessment of blood pressure and pulse rate, a minimum of 2 blood pressure 
and pulse rate measurements should be taken and the measurements should be separated by approximately 5 minutes. If there is >5 mm Hg difference between the first and second blood pressure measurement (systolic or diastolic reading), an additional third measurement should be taken ( Pickering et al. 2005).  
The mean of the 2 or 3 seated blood pressure assessments taken at the Screening visit will be 
used to assess whether  entrance criteria to the study  are met .  
At the  baseline visit, body temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure (seated and standing), 
and pulse (seated and standing) will be taken as part of the initial assessments after arriving at the study clinic. For subjects enrolled in Group 1, additional blood pressure (seated and 
standing) and pulse (seated and standing) measurements will be taken before and after the MWT assessments as described in Appendix 2. For subjects enrolled in Group 2, additional 
blood pressure (seated and standing) and pulse (seate d and standing) measurements will be 
taken approximately 2 and 3 hours after the first set of vital signs as described in Appendix 5.  
At Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6, body temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure (seated and 
standing), and pulse (seated and standing) will be taken approximately 1 hour prior to dosing 
at the clinic . For subjects enrolled in Group 1, blood pressure (seated and standing) and pulse 
(seated and standing) will also be taken approx imately 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosi ng as 
described in Appendix 3. For subjects enrolled in Group 2, blood pressure (seated and standing) and pulse (seated and standing) will also be taken approximately 1 and 2 hours after dosing as described in Appendix 6. 
Body temperature, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (seated and standing) and pulse will also be obtained on admission to the site in the morning at the Follow-up visit. 
The schedule of assessment  for vital signs for subjects enrolled in Group 1 is described in 
Section 7, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3. The schedule of assessment for vital signs for 
subjects enrolled in Group 2 is described in Section 7, Appendix 5, and Appendix 6. 
6.6 Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in 
Parkinson’s Disease – Rating Scale 
At Screening, the QUIP -RS will be administered to subjects (see Appendix 9). This 
instrument supports a diagnosis of impulse control disorder and related disorders in PD 
(Weintraub et al. 2012).  
6.7 Beck Depression Inventory-2 
At Screening , the Beck Depression  Inventory- 2 (BDI -2) will be used to measure the severity 
of depression in patients with PD ( Schra g et al. 2007; Kirsch- Darrow  et al. 2011) 
(Appendix 10). The B DI-2 uses a 4 -point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each 
item. The maximum total score is 63.

Page 48 of 115 6.8 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
At the Screening v isit, the Baseline/Screening Version of the C- SSRS will be administered to 
subjects to exclude any individuals with active suicidal ideation or behavior ( Appendix 11). 
The C -SSRS is a widely used measure of suicidal ideation and behavior. The instrument 
reliably predicts a potential suicide attempt in those who had previously attempted suicide 
and is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011). Suicidal ideation will be assessed for lifetime 
and over the past 12 months, and suicidal behavior will be assessed for lifetime and over the past 5 years with the Baseline/Screening Version of the C- SSRS. Th e Since Last Visit 
Version of the C- SSRS will be administered to subjects at the Baseline  visit; Visits 3, 4, 5, 
and 6/Early Termination; and at the Safety Follow-up visit ( Appendix 12).  
6.9 Electrocardiography 
Standard 12- lead ECGs will be recorded with the subject resting supine for at least 5 minutes. 
ECGs will be performed at every clinic visit. The schedule of ECG assessment is described in Section 7, Appendix 2 (Group 1), Appendix 3 (Group 1),  Appendix 5 (Group 2), and 
Appendix 6 (Group 2). In addition to local assessment by the principal investigator, a core laboratory will independently assess all Baseline and post- Baseline ECGs  for calculation of 
changes from Baseline.  
6.10 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.10.1  Laboratory Parameters  
Subjects will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. Screening labs may be repeated 1  time  within the 30-day screening window. Clinical laborato ry tests to be 
conducted are listed in Table 1.  
The clinical laboratory tests will be analyzed  at a central laboratory. An authorized back-up 
laborat ory, as indicated on the Form FDA  1572 or equivalent, may be used if necessary as an 
emergency laboratory. The investigator will supply Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee with the back -up laboratory’s current licensure and laboratory reference ranges.  
Please note exclusionary clinical laboratory parameters listed in the exclusion criteria 
(Section 4.3). Clinically significant findings that represent a worsening from the Screening 
visit must be documented as AE s (see Section  6.14.1) . 
The central laboratory will calculate the estimated creatinine clearance rate at screening using 
the Cockcroft-Gault formula (FDA Guidance for Industry. Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Impaired Renal Fun ction – Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and 
Labeling, May 1998).

and regulations. Subjects will be instructed to begin daily dosing with the new supply of study drug the day after the completion of Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5. Subjects will also be provided 
with dosing instructions consistent with the restrictions described in Section 5.8. On 
Treatment Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6, dosing from the subject ’s drug supply will be observed and 
documented by site staff  at the study center as described in Section 7 and Appendix 1.  
6.12 Efficacy Assessm ents 
6.12.1  Epworth Sleepiness Scale  
The ESS is a self -administered questionnaire with 8 questions asking the subject how likely 
they would be to doze off or fall asleep in different situations. Responses range from 0 = would never doze to 3 = high chance of doz ing (Appendix 13). Subjects will be asked to 
complete the ESS with regard to the level of sleepiness they experienced over the pas t 7 days 
at Screening, Baseline;  at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6; and at the Safety Follow -up visit. The ESS 
provides a measure of a person’s general level of sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life. It is a validated measure with high specificity and sensitivity for assessing subjective sleepiness ( Johns 1991;  Broderick et al. 2013).  
6.12.2  Movement Disorder Society -Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale – 
Parts III and IV  
The Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS -UPDRS) is a 4 -part clinical rating scale for patients with Parkinson’s 
disease. Part III measures m otor function by examination and Hoehn and Yahr staging, and 
Part IV measures dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, and “off dystonia” ( Goetz et al. 2008; 
Appendix 14). Subjects will complete the MDS -UPDRS Parts III and IV at Baseline and at

Page 53 of 115 6.12.3  Maintenance of Wakefulness Test  
The MWT is the standard objective measure of an individual’s ability to remain awake in a 
darkened, quiet environment and is commonly used to assess response to treatment (Doghramji et al. 1997, Mitler et al. 1982 , AASM  2014). Only for subjects enrolled in 
Group 1, a 3- trial (with the option to do a fourth  trial) , 40-minute MWT will be performed at 
the Baseline visit and at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6.  
Each MWT during the study should be started at approximately the same time of the day. During the MWT trials, subjects should be seated in bed  in a darkened room with the back 
and head supported by a bedrest (bolster pillow) such that their neck is not uncomfortably flexed or extended ( Littner et al. 2005 ). Subjects will be instructed to sit still and remain 
awake for as long as possible during each of the three (or four) 40- minute trials separated by 
2-hour intervals. The first MWT trial should occur approximately 1 hour after dosing with study drug at all visits at which the MW T will be conducted. If the subject falls asleep during 
a trial, they will be awakened and instructed to remain awake until the next trial. If the subject does not fall asleep, then the specific trial is terminated at 40 minutes and a sleep latency of 40 minutes is recorded. The subject is then instructed to remain awake (and will be awoken if they fall asleep) until the next trial.  
Data from the MWT should be recorded and saved electronically, and any technician notes should also be maintained for potenti al transfer to Jazz Pharmaceuticals at the end of the 
study.  A central reader will also evaluate all Baseline and Post -Baseline MWT trials for 
calculation of changes from Baseline.   
Before the start of the first MWT  on a given day, subjects will be asked the following 
question: “How long did you sleep last night?” This information should be recorded and may be used as a factor in the statistical analysis.  
6.12.4  Clinician Global Impression of Severity  
The CGIs is a 7 -point Likert -type rating scale and a widely used assessment in clinical 
psychopharmacology trials to assess severity of illness ( Appendix 15). The responses of this 
investigator -completed scale range from 1 = normal, no signs of illness to 7 = among the 
most extremely ill patients. The investigator will rate his/her impression of the severity of the subject’s current condition at Baseline relative to his/her experience with this patient population. 
6.12.5  Clinician Global Impression of Change  
The CGIc is a 7 -point Likert -type rating scale and a widely used  assessment to assess 
efficacy in clinical drug trials ( Appendix 16). Investigators will rate their impression of any 
change from baseline in the subject’s condition on a 7- point scale ranging from 1 = very 
much improved to 7 = very much worse at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6.

their condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very much 
worse at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
6.12.7  Apathy Scale  
The Apathy Scale assesses apathy in patients with PD ( Starkstein  et al. 1992) (Appendix 18). 
The maximum total score possible is 42, with higher sc ores indicating more severe apathy. 
Subjects will complete the Apathy Scale at Baseline and at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6.

6.14 Adverse Event Reporting 
6.14.1  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans , 
whether or not considered related to study drug or procedure.  
Adverse events include, but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, 
or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; (4) drug interaction; and/or (5) clinically significant laboratory findings that represent a worsening from the Screening visit . 
• Symptoms of t he subject’s Parkinson’s disease or the underlying medical condition of 
excessive sleepiness in  subjects with Parkinson’s disease  are not considered as AE s 
unless there is an exacerbation of the symptoms from baseline at entry into the study .

Page 56 of 115 • During the study, clinically significant adverse changes in  ECGs, routine laboratory tests, 
vital signs, and physical examinations are considered AEs.  
 
All AEs, whether observed by the investigator, reported by the subject, determined from 
laboratory findings, or other means, should be documented. 
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any 
specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs/symptoms,  should be documented as the AE.  
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by the investigator to be related or unrelated to the study drug or procedure, must be documented in the subject’s 
medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice. Adverse events in randomized subjects must also be recorded on the e CRF  in accordance with the 
eCRF completion guidelines . Each such AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , 
seriousness, and causal relationship to the study drug and to study procedure. 
6.14.1.1  Severity  Assessment 
Adverse events will be classified by the investigator as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening or fatal  as defined  below.  
Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation s only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive inter vention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)a. 
Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi talization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting age- appropriate self -care AD Lb. 
Life-
threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated . 
Fatal Death related to AE . 
a  Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
b  Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden . 
6.14.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
Serio us AE s (SAEs) must be reported to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee using the SAE 
Reporting form within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel. SAE Reporting forms and contact information will be provided to the study sites. For randomized

Page 57 of 115 subjects, the event must also be entered on the AE e CRF  in accordance with the eCRF 
completion guidelines. 
An SAE is an AE that fulfills any of the following criteria, as per Title 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations ( CFR ) 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B.  
• Is fatal (results in death)  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability, defined as substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event  
−Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above in the definition of an SAE.  
−Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
−Additionally, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal 
product should be reported as an important medic al event.  
 
A hospitalization is NOT considered an SAE if: 
• It is planned prior to subject entering trial  
• It is for social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s 
general condition  
• It is elective in nature and not relate d to worsening of an underlying condition 
 
Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs the 
hospitalization, it is an SAE.  
“In-patient hospitalization” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospital for 
medical reasons, for any length of time. Emergency room care without admission to a hospital is considered outpatient care. 
Overdose of study drug (i.e., anything exceeding the dose prescribed in the protocol, either 
intentional or unintentional), medicatio n error, or drug misuse are SAEs only if any of the 
seriousness criteria are met.

Page 58 of 115 The SAE Reporting form must be completed as thoroughly as possible before transmittal to 
the contact provided. The investigator must provide his/her assessment of causality (relationship) to study drug and procedure at the time of the initial report. Where the investigator does not provide causality assessment of the SAE at the time of the initial report, the event by default will be presumed “Related.” Follow-up SAE information must be 
provided to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee if there are any updates to the SAE information previously provided, including any change in the investigator’s assessment of causality.  
6.14.1.3  Causal Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure  
The investigator’s assessment of the relationship of an AE to study drug and to study 
procedure is required. The relationship or association of the study drug  or procedure in 
causing or contributing to the AE will be characterized using the following classification a nd 
criteria:  
Related  
or Suspected to be Related to Study Drug or Procedure There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug or procedure 
caused the event —i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug or procedure and the AE.  
Some temporal relationship exists between the event and the administration of the study drug or procedure and the event is 
unlikely to be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies , or accident.   
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or procedure and at least one of the following instances of clinical evidence: 
• The event follows a known or suspected response pattern to the 
study drug or procedure. 
• The event improves upon stopping the study drug or procedure or decreasing the dose ( positive dechallenge).  
• The event reappears upon repeated exposure ( positive 
rechallenge) if medically appropriate.   
Not 
Related 
to Study Drug or Procedure There is not a reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the 
study drug or procedure caused the event.  
The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event.

The following immediately reportable experiences may occur during participation in this 
clinical trial and must be reported within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study 
personnel to the appropriate Jazz Pharmaceuticals contact or designee: 
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with a 3-fold or 
greater elevation above the ULN in addition to an elevation of serum total bilirubin 
greater than 2  times the ULN , with no other identifiable etiology 
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to 5 times the ULN  
• An overdose of study drug defined as anything exceeding the dose prescribed in the 
protocol (either intentional or unintentional) , medication error, or drug misuse 
• Active suicidal ideation or behavior (e.g., a positive response to Question 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS)  
 
As with SAEs  (Section 6.14.1.2) , immediately reportable experiences must be reported on  
the SAE Reporting f orm, which should be completed as thoroughly as possible before 
transmittal to the contact provided. The investigator must provide his/her assessment of 
causality to study drug and study procedure at the time of the initial report.   For randomized 
subjects, t hese experiences must also be entered as AEs on the AE eCRF  in accordance with 
the eCRF completion guidelines. 
6.14.1.5  Adverse E vent and Serious Adverse Event Recording and Reporting Timeframe  
The investigator must document all AEs and SAEs that occur during the study from the time 
written informed consent is obtained until the final study visit or early termination, regardless 
of their relationship to study drug or procedure. Adverse events and SAEs in randomized 
subjects must also be recorded on the eCRF in accordance with the eCRF completion guidelines. 
SAEs and immediately reportable experiences must be reported within 24  hours of first 
knowledge of the event by study personnel as described in Section  6.14.1.2 and 6.14.1.4. 
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, 
the event must be documented and reported as described in Section 6.14.1.2. 
Any SAE assessed as related to study drug or procedure by the investigator must be reported 
regardless of time after study termination.  
6.14.1.6  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
AEs and SAEs assessed as not related to study drug or procedure, including clinically 
significant laboratory tests, ECGs, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final 
study visit occurs, whichever comes first.

necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safe ty, or until the event resolves, the 
condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow up. 
If the event resolves , a resolution date should be provided. For SAEs, a follow-up SAE 
Reporting form must be submitted to provide the final outcome of the event and if the event 
resolves, the resolution date.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes any supplemental 
investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE. This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations, examinations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical. 
6.14.2  Regulatory Reporting  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee is responsible for safety reporting to the applicable 
regulatory authorities, concerned central ethics committees (CECs) , and participating 
investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, the US CFR , the EU Clinical Trial 
Directive (2001/20/EC) and/or local regulatory requirements. 
The reference safety information for the determination of expectedness for  JZP-110 is the 
Investigator’s Brochure . 
All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions ( SUSARs ) will be reported to the 
applicable regulatory authorities, CECs , and all participating  investigators no later than 
15 days after first knowledge of the event. SUSARs that are fatal or life -threatening will be reported to the applicable regulatory 
authorities , IRBs, and investigators (if required by local regulation) no later than 7 days after 
knowledge of such a case, and relevant follow-up information provided within an additional 
8 days. 
Once a year throughout the study, a report listing of all SUSARs (and SAEs if required by 
local regulation) that have occurred during the period and a report of the subject’s safety will be submitted to the applicable regulatory authorities and CECs . 
The subject’s treatment assignment may be unblinded for regulatory reporting purposes. Notification of the treatment assignment is only made known to those who require it for safety reporting and submission processes. All other individuals involved in the study, including the investigator, will remain blinded to the tr eatment assignment. Subjects  will not 
be withdrawn from the study solely based on unblinding for safety reporting . 
Reporting of SAEs by the investigator to his or her local institutional review board (IRB)/ ethics committee will be done in accordance with the standard operations procedures 
and policies of the IRB/ ethics committee. Adequate documentation must be maintained 
showing that the IRB/ ethics committee was properly notified.

Pregnancy of a subject or a male subject’s partner is an immediately reportable event an d 
must be reported within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel to the 
appropriate Jazz Pharmaceuticals contact or designee.  
If a subject or a male subject’s partner becomes pregnant any time after the first dose of study drug is tak en until 30 days after the last dose of study drug is taken , the pregnancy 
form will be used to report the pregnancy to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee.  
The pregnancy of a subject or a male subject’s partner  will be followed until the outcome of 
the pregnancy is known, and in the case of a live birth, for 6 months following the birth of 
the child. The infant follow-up form will be used to report information regarding the status of the infant. 
6.14.4  Emergency Unblinding  
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment 
is necessary for immediate medical management of the subject.  In the case of an immediate 
medical emergency, an investigator or his/her designee will be able to unblind a subject at 
any time via the IVRS/ IWRS . Every attempt should be made to contact Jazz Pharmaceuticals 
or its designee before unblinding a subject as long as this does not compromise the safety of the subject. If a request for unblinding is received from an investigat or, the medical m onitor 
will discuss with the investigator the rationale for the request. A comment  must be entered in 
the source documentation  to specify the reason for unblinding, along with the date on which 
the blind was broken and the identity of the person authorizing the unblinding. Subjects for 
whom the blind is broken will be withdrawn from the study. 
If the request for unblinding is related to the occurrence of an SAE, all procedures for the 
reporting of an SAE must be followed ( Section 6.14.1.2).  
6.14.5  Removal of Subjects  from the Trial or Study Drug 
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, and without prejudice. The investigator must withdraw any subject from the study if the subject states that he/she wants to stop participating in the study.  
The investigator, Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee may remove a subject from the study at any time and for any reason.   
If any of the criteria below are met during the study, study drug administration must be stopped and the subje ct must be discontinued from the study.

1 week later for a Safety F ollow-up visit.  
The specific reason for the discontinuation should be documented on the termination e CRF . 
If a subject withdraws informed consent, the specific reason for withdrawing the informed consent should be stated. 
Adverse events resulting in termination will be followed to the satisfactory resolution and 
determination of outcome as ascertained by the investigator (and/or Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee). The data will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
6.14.6  Handling of Early Terminations  
If a subject terminates early from the study, either at his or her request or at the investigator’s discretion, the investigator will record the reason(s) for early termination on the relevant eCRF page a nd notify the medical monitor immediately. All subjects who terminate from the 
study early should undergo all Early Termination visit assessments as described in 
Section  7.5. 
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject who terminated because of an AE, 
abnormal laboratory test, or ECG finding. In any case, every effort must be made to 
undertake safety foll ow-up procedures. 
6.14.7  Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Termination of Study  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons.  
Such a termination must be implemented by the investigator, if instructed to d o so by Jazz

Page 63 of 115 6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The ESS is a validated measure with high specificity and sensitivity for assessing subjective 
sleepiness ( Johns 1991;  Broderick et al. 2013 ). While the ESS has been most frequently used 
as the primary or only assay of excessive sleepiness in PD studies, in a smaller number of studies the MWT has also been used as an additional assay ( Bliwise et al. 2012 ; 
Hogl  et al. 2002; Stevens et al . 2004; Razmy et al . 2004). The MWT is a validated objective 
measure of the ability to stay awake for a defined period of time and is particularly useful for determining efficacy of treatment in sleep disorder populations such as narcolepsy (Doghramji et al. 1997;  Mitler et al. 1982 ). However, the MWT has not been specifically 
validated in PD, a population that experiences fluctuating nonmotor symptoms including greater day -to-day variability in sleepiness  (Roth et al.  2003). Additionally , the CGIc and  
PGIc have been used extensively in clinical trials to assess efficacy and quality of life.  
For subjects who enroll in the study prior to Amendment 2 implementation, the PK profile of 
JZP-110 will be evaluated  over an 8 -hour period based  on blood samples  (4 mL)  collected  at 
predose and  at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to 8 (if feasible) hours after dosing at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 
6. PK/pharmacodynamic modeling or population PK /pharmacodynamic modeling may be 
used to explore exposure-response relationships in subj ects with PD.
 
The use of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, standard AE reporting, and the questionnaires that have been selected to assess the safety of the study drug are appropriate since they are routinely used to assess the safety profile of drugs in clinical studies and pertinent to known risks of JZP -110. The C- SSRS is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a 
person may be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011).

Page 75 of 115 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations 
All study data will be summarized by treatment or treatment sequence as appropriate . 
Categorical variables will be reported as frequency and percent (e.g. , gender, race). 
Continuous variables will be reported as number of subjects with observations, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum (e.g., age, weight). Listings will 
include the group number (e.g., Group 1 or Group 2) in which a subject was enrolled. All summaries, statistical analyses , and individual subject data listings described in this section 
will be produced using Version 9.3 or later of the SAS Statistical Analysis S ystem (SAS 
Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). 
9.2 Tests of Hypotheses and Significance Levels 
Safety and tolerability of JZP -110 is the primary objective of this study. No inferential 
statistics will be provided for safety endpoints.  
To address the key efficacy objective of treatment effect on the change i n ESS in an  
exploratory manner, pairwise treatment difference against placebo will be tested as part of 
the mixed -effects model described in Section 9.12 using a 2- sided test at 0.05 level.   
9.3 Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 49 subjects will be randomized to the 3 sequence groups (A, B, and C) with the goal of 40 subjects completing the study: 34 subjects each in Sequences A and B, and up to 6 subjects in sequence C. The randomization ratio implemented will be 3:3:1 with expected randomization of subjects to sequences being approximately 21:21:7. 
Although the primary objective of this study is to assess safety, efficacy endpoint- based 
power calculations were performed for reference. A sample size of 34 subjects (assuming 
17 compl eting in each of the Sequences A and B) will provide 80% power to detect a 
difference of 3  points in the change from baseline in ESS score between 1 of the JZP-110 and 
placebo groups not adjusting for multiple comparisons. This calculation assumes a common  
SD of 6 points for the change from baseline in ESS score and a 2- sided significance level of 
0.05 using an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based t- test for difference of means in a 
crossover design. The primary purpose of placebo S equence C  is to preserve  study blinding. 
9.4 Analysis Populations  
The safety population will consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug . 
This population will be analyzed for safety evaluations and will be presented in the tables and listings of safety data.  
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) Population will include subjects who were randomized, 
received at least 1  dose of study medication and have baseline and at least 1 post baseline 
evaluation of ESS. This population will also be analyzed for exploratory effic acy endpoints.

Page 76 of 115 The PK population will consist of all subjects who enrolled under the Original Protocol or 
Amendment 1 and received study drug and provided postdose PK data for at least 1 time point.  
The k ey efficacy population will consist of subjects in the mITT population from Sequences 
A and B only. Exploratory efficacy analyses will be performed on subjects from sequences 
A, B, and C. The details of how these populations are defined will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
9.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characterist ics will be summarized for the safety p opulation and 
the mITT population. The summaries of data will include frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and mean, SD , median, minimum and maximum for continuous 
variables.  
9.6 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
All available data will be presented in descriptive summaries and included in statistical models as appropriate. All su bjects who are included in the s afety,  mITT , or PK population 
will be included in analyses, and their missing data will not be imputed.  
9.7 Pooling of Investigation Centers 
Data from all investigational centers will be pooled together for all analyses.  
9.8 Primary Objective 
The primary  objective of this st udy is the safety and tolerability of JZP -110 administered to 
subjects with excessive sleepiness  and PD. This will be assessed by the occurrence of and/or 
clinically significant changes in: 
• Treatment -emergent AEs  
• Discontinuations due to AEs  
• Clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis)  
• Vital signs  
• 12-lead ECGs  
• Physical examination  
• C-SSRS  
 
9.9  Key Efficacy Endpoint 
The k ey efficacy endpoint is defined  in terms of change from study baseline (prior to first 
dose in Period 1) to the end of each Treatment Period ( Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4); and consists of 
the following: 
• Change from B aseline in ESS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) score

Page 77 of 115 9.10 Exploratory Endpoints 
Explo ratory  efficacy endpoints include the following as measured by the change from 
Baseline in scores (prior to first dose in Period 1) to the end of each Treatment Period 
(Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4) for each of the following assessments : 
• Mean sleep latency time (in minutes),  as determined from the 40- minute MWT  
• MDS -UPDRS Parts III and IV  
• CGIc  
• PGIc  
• FSS 
• Apathy Scale  
• SCOPA -cog 
 
9.11 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic analysi s will include estimation of the following parameters of interest: 
Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, and area under the curve (AUC), as appropriate. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
will be estimated for subjects in the PK population who have evaluable PK data.  
9.12 Efficacy Analysis  
For the analysis of the key efficacy endpoints of change from baseline in ESS, a 
mixed -effects model will be used as the primary method of analysis. This model will include 
fixed effects for treatment (dose), sequence, treatment -by-sequence interaction, and baseline 
value of the efficacy endpoint. The model will also include a random effect for subject within sequence.   
SAS procedure PROC MIXED will be used to carry out this analysis. All available data will be included in the model. The estimates of treatment difference versus placebo and associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
Additional statistical methodologies  will be explored to aid in the interpretation of the study 
results  due to treatment -by-sequence interaction and carryover effects . The de tails will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
For the analysis of the MWT exploratory endpoint , a similar mixed -effects model as for ESS 
will be used. However, because the MWT will be optional and consequently result in a 
reduced sample size, there may be convergence issues associated with the mixed -effects 
model. In the event such issues do arise, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model without accounting for treatment sequence may be used at each visit.  
For the analysis of efficacy endpoints of improvement in PGIc and CGIc, the chi- squared test 
will be used to test the hypotheses of difference between placebo and each active dose  
A mixed -effects model similar to the model described  above will be used for the anal ysis of 
MDS -UPDRS, FSS, Apathy Scale , and SCOPA-cog endpoints. Details of the analyses will 
be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Page 78 of 115 As a sensitivity analysis, the efficacy endpoint summary may be reported separately for 
Groups 1 and 2 to address any potential selection bias.  
In addition, due to the removal of MWT as an eligibility criterion in Protocol Amendment 2, the efficacy endpoint summary may also be reported separately for subjects with eligible MWT at study entry versus those with either i neligible or missing MWT at study entry.  
No adjustment for multiple testing will be performed.  
Summary  statistics for all efficacy assessments/endpoints will be presented by treatment 
dose. 
9.13 Safety Analysis  
9.13.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system to classify events under primary system organ class and preferred term. T he number and 
percent of subjects who experienced TEAEs, TEAEs related to study drug, or SAEs; who died during the study; or who discontinued study drug or withdrew from the study due to an AE will be summarized by treatment at onset. Results will be presented by system organ class , and  preferred term.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that either began after first study drug dose or worsened after  
the first dose. When determining the percent of subjects who experience an AE, multiple increases in severity are only counted as one AE. For example, a subject who develops a mild headache after the first study drug dose (that was not prese nt during screening or at baseline),  
which subsequently worsens to moderate, then severe, is only counted once under the preferred term of headache.  
For all AE summaries, if a subject has more than one AE within a preferred term on a given 
dose, the subject is counted only once at the maximum severity and with the closest relationship to study drug. If a subject has more than one AE within a system organ class, the subject is similarly counted once when reporting results for that system organ class. 
All AE  data will be listed .   
9.13.2  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be summarized at baseline, at each post baseline visit, and within each visit 
across time. Change from baseline to each post baseline visit in each vital sign parameter will 
also be summarized. The summari es will include descriptive statistics ( i.e., mean, median, 
minimum, maximum, SD , and number of subjects) as well as graphs, and will be presented 
by treatment (dose) group, and by sequence.

postbaseline time point by treatment (dose) and by sequence group. 
9.13.5  Physical Examinations  
For randomized subjects, a finding identified by the investigator as abnormal on the physical 
examination at the Screening visit will be recorded on the Medical History eCRF ; whereas,  a 
clinically significant adverse change (i.e., worsening) of a physical examination finding after screening will be recorded as an AE.  
 
9.13.6  Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Data from the Since Last Visit Version of the C -SSRS will be summarized by treatment 
(dose) group according to the Columbia Classification Algorith m of Suicide Assessment  
(Posner et  al. 2007).  
 
9.14 Analysis of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Variables 
PK analyses will be performed for  subjects in  the PK population who have evaluable PK 
data. 
Individual plasma JZP -110 concentrations and corresponding PK parameters will be listed by 
treatment. Descriptive statistics including  number of subjects, mean, SD, minimum, median, 
maximum, coefficient of variation,  geometric mean, and geometric SD  will be used to 
summarize concentration data and PK  parameters by treatment, as appropriate. For T max, a 
frequency  table will also be provided. 
Plasma concentrations of JZP -110 will be displayed as mean (with SD included) and 
individual plasma concentration-time curves using linear and log scales.  If appropriate, all 
curves will be displayed using a unique concentration axis. All statistical summaries and displays will be based on scheduled sampling times unless there 
are significant deviations of actual sampling  times from scheduled sampling  times.  
Differences between scheduled and actual sampling  times will be listed for all subjects.  
PK/pharmacodynamic modeling or population PK/pharmacodynamic modeling may be used 
to explore exposure-response relationships in subjects with PD. 
9.15 Subgroup Analyses  
Exploratory analyses of safety and efficacy will be conducted in subgroups of subjects 
including but not limited to disease severity (by Hoehn and Yahr stage), treatment with levodopa, dopamine agonists, or a combination of dopamine agonist with levodopa. As sensitivity analyses , efficacy and exploratory analyses may be reported separately for

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; mustask about all types)Past X Years
or
Lifetime 
Actual Attempt:
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results,
this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumsta nces. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. 
Have you made a suicide attempt?
Have you done anythin g to harm yourself?
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?
What did you do?
Did you______ as a way to end your life? Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____? 
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY int ention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, 
or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attem pt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed an d taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck 
but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

This chart may not be copied, distributed or otherwise used in whole orin part without prior written consent of the Movement Di sorder SocietyPart III: Motor Examination
Overview: This portion of the scale assesses the motor si gns of PD. In administering Part III of the MDS-UPDRS 
the examiner should comply with the following guidelines: 
At the top of the form, mark whether the patient is on medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease
and, if on levodopa, the time since the last dose. 
Also, if the patient is receiving medicati on for treating the symptoms of Parkinso n’s D isease, mark the pati ent’s 
clinical state using the following definitions: 
ON is the typical functional state when patients are receiving medication and have a good response. 
OFF is the typical functional state when patients have a poor response in spite of taking medications.
The investigator sho uld “r ate what you see”.  Admittedly, concurrent medical problems such as stroke, paralysis, 
arthritis, contracture, and orthopedic problems such as hip or knee replacement and scoliosis may interfere with 
individual items in the motor examination. In situations wher e it is absolutely impossible to test (e.g., amputations, 
plegia, limb in a cast), use t he notation “ UR” for Unab le to Rate. Otherwise, rate the performance of each task as the 
patient performs in the context of co-morbidities. 
All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing ratings). 
Specific instructions are provided for the testing of each item. These should be followed in all instances. The 
investigator demonstrates while describing tasks the patient is to perform and rates function immediately thereafter. 
For Global Spontaneous Movement and Rest Tremor items (3.14 and 3.17), these items have been placed 
purposefully at the end of the scale because clinical informat ion pertinent to the score will be obtained throughout the 
entire examination. 
At the end of the rating, indicate if dyskinesia (chorea or dystonia) was present at the time  of the examination, and if 
so, whether these movements interfered with the motor examination.
3aIs the patient on medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson ’s Disease? NoYes 
3b If the patient is receiving medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinso n’s D isease, 
mark the patient’s  clinical state using the following definitions: 
ON: On is the typical functional state when patients are receiving medication and have a good response. 
OFF: Off is the typical functional state when patients ha ve a poor response in spite of taking medications.

3.3RIGIDITY
 
Instructions to examiner: Rigidity is judged on slow passive movement of major joints with th e patient in 
a relaxed position and the examiner manipulating the l imbs and neck. First, test without an ac tivation 
maneuv er. Test and rate neck and each limb separately. For arms, test the wrist and elbow joints 
simulta neously. For legs, test the hip and knee joints si multaneously. If no rigidity is detected, us e an 
activation m aneuver such as tapping fingers, fist opening/closing, or heel tapping in a limb no t being 
tested. Explain to the patient to go as limp as possible as you test for rigidity.
 
0: Normal: No rigidity.
 
1: Slight: Rigidity only detected with activation maneuver.
 
2: Mild: Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver, but full range of motion is eas ily

Instructions to examiner: Have the patient sit in a straight-backed chair with arms, with both feet on the
floor and sitting back in the chair (if the patient is no t too short). Ask the patient to cross his/her a rms 
across the chest and then to stand up. If the patient is not successful, repeat this attempt a maximum
upto two more times. If still unsuccessful, allow the patient to move forward in the chair to arise with 
arms folded across the chest. Allow only one attemp t in this situation. If unsuccessful, allow th e patient 
to pu sh off using his/her hands on the arms of the cha ir. Allow a maximum of three trials of pushing off. 
If still not successful, assist the patient to arise. After the patient stands up, observe the posture for item
3.13
0: Normal: No problems. Able to arise quickly without hesitation.
1: Slight: Arising is slower than normal; or may need more than one attempt; or may 
need to move forward in the chair to arise. No need to use the arm s of the 
chair.
2: Mild: Pushes self up from arms of chair without difficulty.3: Moderate: Needs to push off, but tends to fall  back; or may have to try more than one
time 
using arms of chair, but can get up without help.
4: Severe: Unable to arise without help.SCORE
3.10GAIT
Instructions to examiner: Testing gait is best performed by having the patient walking away from and 
towards the examiner so that both right and left sides of the body can be easily observed 
simulta neously. The patient should walk at least 10 me ters (30 feet), then turn around and ret urn to the 
examin er. This item measures multiple behaviors: stride amplitude, stride speed, height of foot lift, heel 
strike during walking, turning, and arm swing, but not freezi ng. Assess also for “ freezing of gai t” (next 
item 3.11) w hile patient is walking.  Observe posture for item 3.13
0: Normal: No problems.
1: Slight: Independent walking with minor gait impairment.
2: Mild: Independent walking but with substantial gait impairment.3: Moderate: Requires an assistance device for safe walking (walking stick, walk
er) but not a 
person.
4: Severe: Cannot walk at all or  only with another person ’sa s s i s t a n c e .

3.11FREEZING OF GAIT
 
Instructions to examiner: While assessing gait, also assess for the presence of any gait freezing 
episod es. Observe for start hesitation and stuttering  movements especially when turning and reachi ng
the end of the task. To the extent that safety permits, patients may NOT use sensory tricks du ring the 
assessment.
 
0: Normal: No freezing.
 
1: Slight:            Freezes on starting, tu rning or walking through doorway with a single h alt during 
any of these events, but then continues smoothly without freezing during straight 
walking.
 
2: Mild: Freezes on starting, turning or walking through doorway with more than on e halt 
during any of these activities, but cont inues smoothly without freezing during
straight walking.
 
3: Moderate: Freezes once during straight walking.
 
4: Severe: Freezes multiple times during straight walking.SCORE
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
3.12POSTURAL STABILITY
 
Instructions to examiner: The test examines the response to sudden body displacement produ ced by a 
quick, forceful pull on the shoulders while the patient is standing erect with eyes open and feet 
comf ortably apart and parallel to each other. Test re tropulsion. Stand behind the patient and instru ct 
the patient on what is about to happen. Explain that s/he is allowed to take a step backwards to avoid 
falling. There sh ould be a solid wall behind the examiner, at least 1-2 meters away to allow for the 
observation of the number of retropulsive steps. The first pull is an instructional demonstratio n and is 
purposely milder and not rated. The second time the shoulders are pulled briskly and forceful ly towards
the examin er with enough force to displace the center of gravity so that patient MUST take a step 
backwards. The examiner needs to be ready to catch t he patient, but must stand sufficiently b ack so as
to allow e nough room for the patient to take severa l steps to recover independently. Do not allow the 
patient to flex the body abnormally forward in anticipation of the pull. Observe for the numbe r of steps 
backwards or falling. Up to and including two steps for recovery is considered normal, so abnormal 
ratings begin with three steps. If the patient fails to un derstand the test, the examiner can repeat the
test so that the rating is based on an assessment that the examiner feels reflects the patient ’s limitations 
rather than misunderstanding or lack of preparedness. Observe standing posture for item 3.13
 
0: Normal: No problems: Recovers with one or two steps.
 
1: Slight: 3-5 steps, but subject recovers unaided.
 
2: Mild: More than 5 steps, but subject recovers unaided.
 
3: Moderate: Stands safely, but with absence of postural response; falls if not caught by 
examiner.
 
4: Severe: Very unstable, tends to lose balance spontaneously or with ju st a gentle pull on
the shoulders.

3.13POSTURE
 
Instructions to examiner : Posture is assessed with the patient standing erect after arising fro m a chair, 
during walking, and while being tested for postural reflexes. If you notice poor p osture, tell the patient 
to stand up straight and see if the posture improves (see option 2 below). Rate the worst post ure seen 
in these three observation points. Observe for fl exion and side-to-side leaning.
 
0: Normal: No problems.
 
1: Slight: Not quite erect, but posture could be normal for older person.
 
2: Mild: Definite flexion, scoliosis or leaning to one side, but patient can correct po sture to 
normal posture when asked to do so.
 
3: Moderate: Stooped posture, scoliosis or leaning to one side that cannot be corrected
volitionally to a normal posture by the patient.
 
4: Severe: Flexion, scoliosis or leaning with extreme abnormality of posture.SCORE
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
3.14GLOBAL SPONTANEITY OF MOVEMENT (BODY BRADYKINESIA)
 
Instructions to examiner: This global rating combines  all observations on slowness, hesitancy, and 
small a mplitude and poverty of movement in general, including a reduction of gesturing and of cros sing 
the legs. This assessment is based on the examiner ’s global impression after observing for 
spontaneous gestures while sitting, and the nature of arising and walking.
 
0: Normal: No problems.
 
1: Slight: Slight global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements.
 
2: Mild: Mild global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements.
 
3: Moderate: Moderate global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements.

3.15POSTURAL TREMOR OF THE HANDS
 
Instructions to examiner : All tremor, including re-emergent rest tremor , that is present in this posture is 
to be incl uded in this rating. Rate each hand separately. Rate the highest amplitude seen. Instru ct the 
patient to str etch the arms out in front of the body with palms down. The wrist should be straig ht and 
the fingers c omfortably separated so that they do not touch each other. Observe this posture for 10 
seconds.
 
0: Normal: No tremor.
 
1: Slight: Tremor is present but less than 1 cm in amplitude.

Instructions to examiner: This is tested by the finger-to-nose maneuver. With the arm starting from the 
outstre tched position, have the patient perform at least three finger-to-nose maneuvers with each ha nd
reaching as far as possible to touch the examiner ’s finger. The finger-to-nose maneuver should be
performed slowly enough not to hide any tremor that could occur with very fast arm movements. Rep eat
with the other hand, rating each hand separately. The tremor can be present through out the movement 
or as t he tremor reaches either target (nose or finger). Rate the highest amplitude seen.
0: Normal: No tremor.
1: Slight: Tremor is present but less than 1 cm in amplitude.2: Mild: Tremor is at least 1 but less than 3 cm in amplitude.
3: Moderate: Tremor is at least 3 but less than 10 cm in amplitude.

3.17REST TREMOR AMPLITUDE
Instructions to examiner: This and the next item ha ve been placed purposefully at the end of the 
examination to allow the rater to gather observations on rest tremor that may appear at any time dur ing
the exam, including when quietly sitting, during walking and during activities when some body parts a re 
moving but others are at r est. Score the maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final score. 
Rate only the amplitude and not the persistence or the intermittency of the tremor.
As part of this rating, the p atient should sit quietly in a chair with the hands placed on the arm s of the 
chair (not in the lap) and the feet comfortably supported on the floor for 10 seconds with no other
directives. Rest tremor is assessed separately for all four limbs and also for the lip/jaw. Rate only the 
maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final rating.
Extremity ratings
0: Normal: No tremor.1: Slight.: ≤1 cm in maximal amplitude.
2: Mild: > 1 cm but < 3 cm in maximal amplitude.
3: Moderate: 3 - 10 cm in maximal amplitude.
4: Severe: > 10 cm in maximal amplitude.
Lip/Jaw ratings
0: Normal: No tremor.1: Slight: ≤1 cm in maximal amplitude.

Instructions to examiner : This item receives one rating for all rest tremor and focuses on the consta ncy 
of rest tre mor during the examination period when different body parts are variously at rest. It is rated 
purposefully at the end of the examination so that several minutes of information can be coal esced into 
the rating.
 
0: Normal: No tremor.
 
1: Slight: Tremor at rest is present ≤25% of the entire examination period.

 Part IV: Motor Complications
 
 
Overview and Instructions: In this sect ion, the rater uses historical and objective information to assess two motor 
complications, dyskinesias and motor fluctuations that incl ude OFF-state dystonia. Use all information from patient, 
caregiver, and the examination to answer the six question s that summarize function over the past week including 
today. As in the other sections, rate using only integers (n o half points allowed) and leave no missing ratings. If the 
item cannot be rated, place UR for Unable to Rate. You will  need to choose some answers based on percentages, 
and therefore you will need to establish how many hour s generally are awake hours and use this figure as the 
denominato r for “ OFF” time  and Dyskinesias. For “O FF dystonia ”, the total “Off” time will be the denominator. 
Operational definitions for examiner ’s use.
 
Dyskinesias: Involuntary random movements
Words that patients often recognize for dyskinesias inclu de “irregular jerking”, “wiggling”, “ twitching ”. It is essential to
stress to the patient the difference between dyskinesias and tremor, a common error when patients are assessing
dyskinesias .
 
Dystonia: contorted posture, often with a twisting component:
Words that patients often recognize for dystonia inclu de “spasm s”, “cramps ”, “posture ”.
 
Motor fluctuation: Variable response to medication: 
Words that patients often reco gnize for motor fluctuation incl ude “weari ng out”, “we aring off”, “roll er-coaste r effect”, 
“on-off”, “un even medication effects”.
 
OFF: Typical functional state when patients have a poor resp onse in spite of taking mediation or the typical functional 
response when patients are on NO treatment for park insonism. Words that patients often recognize include “low
time”, “bad t ime”, “sh aking time”, “sl ow time”, “time when my med ications do n’t work.”
 
ON: Typical functional state when patients are receiving medication and have a good response: 
Words that patients often recognize in clude “ good tim e”, “walk ing time”, “time w hen my medications work.”
 
A . DYSKINESIAS [exclusive of OFF-state dystonia]
 
 
4.1 TIME SPENT WITH DYSKINESIAS
 
Instructions to examiner:  Determine the hours in the usual waking day and then the hours of 
dyskinesias. Calculate the percentage. If the patient has dyskinesias in the office, you can point them 
out as a reference to ensure that patients and caregi vers understand what they are rating. You may also 
use your own acting skills to enact the dyskinetic movements you have seen in the patient before orshow them dyskinetic movements typical of other pa tients. Exclude from this  question early morning
and nighttime painful dystonia. 
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver].  Over the past week, how many hours do you usually sleep on a 
daily basis, including nighttime sleep and daytime na pping? Alright, if you sleep    hrs, you are awake
   hrs. Out of those awake hours, how many hours in  total do you have wiggling, twitching or jerking
movements? Do not count the times when you have tremor, which is a regular back and forth shaking
or times when you have painful foot cramps or spasms in the early morning or at nighttime. I will ask 
about those later.  Concentrate only on these types of wiggling, jerking and irregular movements. AddSCORE

Instructions to examiner:  Determine the degree to which dyskinesias impact on the patient’s  daily 
function in terms of activities and social interactions. Use the patient’s and  care giver’s  response to your 
question and your own observations during the office visit to arrive at the best answer. 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: Over the past week, did you usually have trouble doing things or
being with people when these jerking movements oc curred? Did they stop you from doing things or 
from being with people?
0: Normal: No dyskinesias or no impact by dyskinesias on activities or social interactions. 
1: Slight: Dyskinesias impact on a few activities, but the patient usually performs all 
activities and participates in all social interactions during dyskinetic periods. 
2: Mild: Dyskinesias impact on many activi ties, but the patient usually performs all 
activities and participates in all social interactions during dyskinetic periods. 
3: Moderate: Dyskinesias impact on activities to  the point that the patient usually does not 
perform some activities or does not usually participate in some social activities 
during dyskinetic episodes. 
4: Severe: Dyskinesias impact on function to the point that the patient usually does not 
perform most activities or participate in most social interactions during 
dyskinetic episodes. SCORE
B . MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS
4.3 TIME SPENT IN THE OFF STATE
Instructions to examiner: Use the number of waking hours derived from 4.1 and determine the hours 
spent in the “OFF”  state. Calculate the percentage. If the pa tient has an OFF period  in the office, you 
can point to this state as a reference. You may al so use your knowledge of the patient to describe a 
typical OFF period. Additionally you may use your ow n acting skills to enact an OFF period you have 
seen in the patient before or show them OFF function typical of other patients. Mark down the typical 
number of OFF hours, because you will  need this number for completing 4.6 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: Some patients with Parkinson's disease have a good effect
from their medications throughout their awake hours and we call that “ON”time.   Other patients take 
their medications but still have so me hours of low time, bad time, sl ow time or shaking time. Doctors
call these low periods “O FF” time. Over the past week, you told me before that you are generally awake
hrs each day. Out of these awake hours, how many ho urs in total do you usually have this type of
low level or OFF function (Use this number for your calculations).
0: Normal: No OFF time. 
1: Slight: ≤ 25%  of waking day. 
2: Mild: 26 - 50% of waking day. 
3: Moderate: 51 - 75% of waking day. 4: Severe: > 75% of waking day.

4.4FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS
 
Instructions to examiner: Determine the degree to which motor fluctuations impact on the pat ient’s daily 
function in terms of activiti es and social interactions. This question concentrates on the difference 
betw een the ON state and the OFF state. If the pa tient has no OFF time, the rating must be 0, but if 
patients have very mild fluctuations, it is still possible to be rated 0 on th is item if no impact on activities 
occurs. Use the patient ’s and caregiver ’s response to your question and your own observations durin g
theoffice visit to arrive at the best answer.
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: Think about when those lo w or “OFF” periods have occurred o ver
the past we ek. Do you usually have more problems doing things or being with people than com pared to 
the rest of the day when you feel your medications working? Are there some things you usually do
during a good period that you have trouble wi th or stop doing during a low period?
 
0: Normal: No fluctuations or No impact by fluctuations on performance of activities or 
social interactions.
 
1: Slight: Fluctuations impact on a few acti vities, but during OFF,  the patient usually 
performs all activities and participates in all social interactions that typically 
occur during the ON state.
 
2: Mild:                 Fluctuations impact many activities, but during OFF, the patient still usually 
performs all activities and participates in all social interaction s that typically 
occur during the ON state.
 
3: Moderate: Fluctuations impact on th e performance of activities during O FF to the point that 
the patient usually does not perform some activities or participate in some
social interactions that are performed during ON periods.
 
4: Severe: Fluctuations impact on function to the point that, during OFF, the patient usually
does not perform most activities or participate in most social interaction s that
are performed during ON periods.SCORE
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
4.5COMPLEXITY OF MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS
 
Instructions to examiner: Determine the usual predictability of OFF function whether due to dose, time 
of day, food intake or other factors. Use the information provided by the patients and caregiver and 
supplement with your own observations. You will ask if the patient can count on them always coming at
a special time, mostly coming at a special time (in which case you will probe further to separate slight
from mild), o nly sometimes coming at a special time or are they totally unpredictable? Narrowing d own 
the percentage will allow you to find the correct answer.
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: For some patients, the low o r “OFF” periods happen at certain 
times during day or when they do activities like eating or exercising. Over the past week, do you usu ally 
know when your low periods will occur? In other words, do your low periods always come at a certain
time? Do they mostly come at a certain time? Do they only sometimes come at a certain time? Are 
your low periods totally unpredictable? ”
 
0: Normal: No motor fluctuations.
 
1: Slight: OFF times are predictable all or almost all of the time (> 75%).
 
2: Mild: OFF times are predictable most of the time (51-75%).
 
3: Moderate: OFF times are predictable some of the time (26-50%).
 
4: Severe: OFF episodes are rarely predictable. (< 25%).

C.“OFF”DYSTONIA
 
4.6PAINFUL OFF-STATE DYSTONIA
 
Instructions to examiner: For patients who have  motor fluctuations, determine what proporti on of the 
OFF ep isodes usually includes painful dystonia? You have already determined the number of hours of 
“OFF” time ( 4.3). Of these hours, determine how many are associated with dystonia and calc ulate the 
percent age. If there is no OFF time, mark 0.
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: In one of the questions I asked earlier, you said you generally
have hours of low or “OF F”time when your Parkinson's disease is under poor control. During the se
low or “OFF” periods, do you usually have painful cramps or spasms? Out of the total hrs of this
low ti me, if you add up all the time in a day when these painful cramps come, how many hours would
this ma ke?
 
0: Normal: No dystonia OR NO OFF TIME.
 
1: Slight: ≤25% of time in OFF state.
 
2: Mild: 26-50% of time in OFF state.
 
3: Moderate: 51-75% of time in OFF state.
 
4: Severe: > 75% of time in OFF state.

Summary statement to patient: READ TO PATIENT
 
This completes my rating of your Parkinso n’s d isease.  I know the questions and tasks have taken several minutes, but 
I wanted to be co mplete and cover all possibilities. In doing so, I may have asked about problems you do not even 
have, and I may have mentioned problems that you may never develop at all. Not all patients develop all these 
problems, but because they can occur, it is important to ask all the questions to every patient. Thank you f or your time 
and attention in completing this scale with me.

However, if the patient forgets the order and would like to see the order a second time, the researcher does not repeat the order again but starts with the next order.

4. Counting backwards (30 to 0)
Instruction
: "Would you subtract three from 30, and subtract three again from the result 
and continue till zero?".
Mistakes can be: the order, missing or not knowing a number, or not finishing off the series. Record the order of numbers named by the patient. If the patient asks where to start or how much to subtract, the researcher repeats the instructions but counts that as one mistake. If the patient makes a mistake but continues from that point to subtractthree, it is only one mistake. If the patient stops the order and starts all over again, it isone mistake.

5. Months backwards 
Instruction : "Name the months of the year in reverse order, starting with the last month 
of the year". 
Mistakes are: the order, missing or not knowing the next month, or not finishing off the series. Underline the months that are named correctly. When a month is passed over, this is a mistake, even if the patient corrects it later on. If the patient stops the order and starts all over again, it is one mistake. If the patient starts naming the month forward, repeat the instructions and count it as one mistake. Dec- Nov-Oct-Sept-Aug-July-June-May-April-March-Feb-Jan.

1. fist with ulnar side down, 2. stretched fingers with ulnar side down, 3. stretched 
fingers with palm down; Practice 5 times together with the patient, the patient chooses which hand he/she prefers. Do it slowly and tell the patient to watch carefully and repeat what you are doing. Practice first 5 rounds, with verbal help, e.g. FIST- STRETCH-PALM. Then tell the patient to make the movements alone.  Instructions:
 “Now it is your turn to make the three movements, fist-stretch-palm, 10 
times in a row. You don’t have to count, I will tell you when to stop”.Note the number of correct trios from a total of 10; Count carefully but not out loud. Every time a patient makes a wrong movement, count it as a mistake, even when the patient corrects it halfway.

7. Semantic fluency
Tell the patient to name as many animal as he/she knows in one minute. Note all answers that are given by the patient. No repetition or variations of words, such as lion-lioness, tiger-tigress; categories are allowed, bird and pigeon are both correct. Count the number of animals correctly named. The purpose is that the patient generates the animals actively, therefore no clues are allowed. When the patient asks whether, for instance, naming different types of birds is  allowed, this may be confirmed. When the 
patient almost immediately says he/she does not know any more animals, try to

When the patient starts naming other things than animals, do not correct the patient. 
Naming other things besides animals is not counted as an additional mistake.

8.  Dice 
Use 2 cards, one with YES = EVEN, NO = ODD; one with YES = HIGHER, NO = LOWER. Put the correct card face up next to the explanation of the test and make sure that the other, irrelevant card is out of sight. The first round (situation 1) is not scored, and the patient is corrected if necessary. 
Situation 1: YES = EVEN 
Put the card “YES=EVEN, NO=ODD” on the table and leave it there during the test. 
Instruction:
 "Say YES for an even number on a dice and NO for an odd number, when 
you see a picture of a dice with an EVEN number of pips, I would like you to say YES, and NO when the number of pips is ODD”.  Show the first two examples (3 even and 3 odd dices) and ask the patient “If you see one of these dice, do you say yes or no?” Tell the patient if the answer is correct or not. If the answer is not correct, explain why. It is important that the patient says YES or NO and not EVEN or ODD. Show the next two examples (with only one dice) and ask the patient “if you see this dice, do you say yes or no?” Tell the patient if the answer is correct or not. If the answer is not correct, explain why. Then show the patient the following 10 dices. Correct the patient if the answer is wrong.

Situation 2: YES = HIGHER 
With the card “example 1” (dice with 3 pips) the next condition starts. Put the card 
“YES=HIGHER, NO=LOWER” on the table and remove the former card. Instruction:
 “Now, we change the test a little. When you see a picture of a dice that is 
higher than de dice on the page before, you say YES. When the dice is lower, you say NO”.Tell the patient you have an example (example 1). “Try to remember this dice” (turn the page) “Is this YES or NO?” Tell the patient whether the answer is correct or not. If the answer is not correct, explain why. Continue with example 2 and say “now remember this dice”(turn the page) “Is this YES or NO?” Tell the patient if the answer is correct or not. If the answer is not correct, explain why. Then start the test and show all 10 dices one after another. The first response counts and 
corrections are not allowed. Do NOT correct when a wrong answer is given. If a patient 
corrects a wrong answer, it is still counted as a mistake. If the patient asks for the instruction, the researcher explains but that is counted as one mistake.

9. Assembling patterns
The patient is shown 5 incomplete patterns and has to choose 2 or 3 shapes out of 4 to 6 
possible alternatives in order to comp lete the pattern. Firs t practice 2 figures. 
Show the patient example A and give the instruction to choose the shapes that form the pattern. Tell the patient if the answer is correct or not. If the answer is not correct, explain why and give the correct solution. Repeat this with example B. Then show the 5 patterns. Do not tell the patient whether the answer is correct or not. There is no time limit. If the patient corrects a wrong answer, this is not counted as a mistake. a.  b.  c.  d.  e.

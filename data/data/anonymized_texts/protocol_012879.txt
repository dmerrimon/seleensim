• To assess the safety and tolerability of SEL -212 compared to placebo  
• To assess the reduction in serum uric acid (sUA) in patients with gout refractory to 
conventional treat ment treated with two different dose levels of SEL -212 compared to 
placebo, amongst those with tophi at baseline  
Exploratory:  
• To assess the levels of uricase activity in patients  receiving SEL-212 compared to placebo  
• To assess the effect on monosodium urate crystal  deposits and/or total body monosodium 
urate crystal deposit s in patients with gout refractory to conventional treatment treated

• To assess the status of biomarkers related to inflammat ion and toler ogenic immunologic 
responses  in patients with gout refractory to conventional treatment treated with two 
different dose levels of SEL-212 compared to placebo  
• To assess the relationship  between multiomic markers of gout and treatment effect in 
patients with gout refractory to conventional treatment treated with two different dose 
levels of SEL-212 compared to placebo  
• To assess the impact on patient’s self -assessment of gout flares and burden of disease using 
a val idated patient diary (weekly)  in patients treated with two different dose levels of SEL -
212 compared to placebo  
• To assess the correlation between immune tolerance related multiomic  markers and anti -
pegadricase antibody formation in patients treated with two different dose levels of SEL-212  
Methodology:  
This is one of two replicate  randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel arm trials to 
determine the safety and efficacy of two different dose levels of SEL -212 compared to placebo. The 
study will randomize approximately 1 20 patients with chronic refractory gout. A pproxima tely 60% of 
the randomized patients will have tophi at Baseline. P atients, stratified as to the presence or 
absence of tophi, will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio prior to Baseline to receive treatment 
with one of two dose levels of SEL -212 or placebo every 28 days for approximately 6 months in each  
trial (SEL-212/301 and SEL -212/302 ). These two trials will have identical designs with respect to 
being double -blinded, placebo -controlled as well as identical sample sizes, inclusion/exclusio n 
criteria, efficacy/safety assessments and timing thereof , but will be distinguished by the blinded 6 -
month extension in SEL -212/301  and that SEL -212/302 will include sites outside of the United States. 
 
 Efficacy 
assessments will be conducted at intervals that are appropriate to determine treatment effect with 
samples for the prima ry endpoint drawn during Treatment Period 6. Samples will be collected at 
intervals that are appropriate to determine the uricase activity of SEL -212. Safety will be monitored 
throughout the study with an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB). After successful 
completion of the double -blind treatment phase, patients successfully completing six months in SEL -
212/301 will continue, in a blinded fashion, to be treated with the identical investigational 
treatment, (either one of two dose levels of SEL -212 or placebo) for 6  additional doses, every 28

days, lasting approximately 6 months. This will provide up to 12  months of continuous treatment 
with SEL -212 in a placebo -controlled fashion.  
 
Screening P hase  
After providing written informed consent, the p atient is considered enrolled in the study. Patients 
will be evaluated for inclusion during the Screening Phase . For all patient s, the standard Screening 
Phase  will be up to 45 days prior to Baseline . The Screening Phase may be initiated by a preliminary 
screening with an abbreviated informed consent focused on COVID -19 testing and serum uric acid 
levels followed by providing study -wide informed consent and the remainder of screening 
assessments if det ermined to proceed.  Of note , if the s UA level obtained during preliminary 
screening meets eligibility requirements (i.e., ≥ 7 mg/dL), the s UA should not be repeated during the 
subsequent complete screening assessment. Concurrently with the Screening Phase , a 
premedication period for potential gout flare with colchicine  (or a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory 
drug [NSAID] , if colchicine is contraindicated)  of at least 7  days prior to Baseline will be required for 
all patient s, and a washout period of at least 7 days will be required prior to Baseline for patients on 
any urate -lowering therapy (ULT).  Both the ULT washout period and the gout flare prophylaxis 
period may be started earlier than 7 days prior to Baseline. At the discretion of the PI, chronic 
refract ory gout patients whose sUA is lower than the eligibility level of ≥  7 mg/dL on prescreening or 
initial screen, may undergo ULT washout prior to retesting the sUA. Initiation of gout flare 
prophylaxis with colchicine (or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory dru g [NSAID], if colchicine is 
contraindicated) can also be considered coincidentally with the ULT washout to prevent a potential 
gout flare.  
Double -Blind Treatment P hase  
The total duration of the double -blind Treatment Phase  will be approximately 6 months ( i.e., 168 
days, consisting of six 28 -day treatment cycles).  
Eligible patients, stratified according to the presence or absence of tophi, will be randomized in a 
1:1:1 allocation ratio prior to Baseline to receive one of two  dose levels of SEL -212 or placebo. The 
SEL-212 doses will differ as to the SEL -110.36 component. Participants will receive SEL -037 
administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg via intravenous (IV) infusion immediately after receiving 
SEL-110.36 at a dose of either  0.1 mg/kg (SEL -212A) or 0.15  mg/kg (SEL -212B) via IV infusion. The 
placebo will consist of normal saline that will be administered in the same way that the SEL -212 
components are administered to maintain the integrity of the study blind .  
Patient s will co mplete 6 treatment periods each having a duration of 28 days. Patients will receive 
treatment with study drug or placebo on Day 0 of each treatment period for a total of 6 doses.  For 
each treatment cycle, patient s will receive premedication to minimize the  potential for infusion 
reactions during study drug administration. After completing the study drug infusions, patient s will 
remain at the investigational site for 1 hour for safety assessments.  
With each dose , a blood sample will be drawn for assessment of sUA level and uricase activity 
immediately prior to infusion (i .e., Time 0  h) with SEL -212 or placebo and 1 hour after the infusion of 
the second component of SEL -212 or of placebo is completed. Serum uric acid levels  will be assessed 
through additional post -infusion blood samples at pre -determined time points  by an independent, 
central, unblinded medical monitor.

Gout flares will be assessed at each study visit during the Treatment Phase using a validated 
definition of flares in patients with established gout ( Gaffo 2018 ). In addition, in an explorato ry 
manner, gout flares will be self-assessed  by the patient  weekly  after randomization and in each 
Treatment Period  using a weekly flare diary ( Poiley  2016). Health Questionnaires,  tophus burden,  
and joint swelling and tenderness will be assessed on Day 0 of Treatment Period s 1 and 4, and at the 
end of Treatment Period 6  or early termination (ET) if a patient discontinues the study  prior to the 
end of 6 monthly infusions . Samples for anti -uricase , anti-PEG,  and anti -pegadricase  antibody  levels  
will be taken (i) prior to administration of study drug dosing and at D ay 21 for each  of the six  
treatment period s throughout the trial,  and (ii) at the end of Treatment Period 6 , or at early 
termination  (ET). Exploratory assessments of inflammatory /immunologic  biomarkers and multiomic  
analysis will also be assessed.  
Safety laboratory samples , consisting of , but not limited to, complete blood count (CBC)  including 
white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count;  liver function tests (LFTs)  including 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT),;  serum lipids (including 
triglycerides and low density lipoprotein  (LDL)); analyses of renal function including crea tinine, 
urine -albumin -creatinine ratio (UACR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) will be 
collected on Day 0 and Day 21 of Treatment Period 1 , on Day 21 only of each of Treatment Periods 2 -
5, and on Day  21 and Day 28 / ET of Treatment Period 6. On Treatment Period 1 Day 0, safety 
laboratory samples will be collected pre -infusion in both the SEL -212 arms and the placebo arm. 
Concomitant medications and procedures and adverse events (AEs) will be monitored continuously 
during the study. Post -Baseline c hest X -rays (CXR) will be taken at six months  and at one year / early 
termination to assess for presence of or changes in interstitial lung disease (ILD)  compared to 
baseline CXR . 
Follow -Up P hase  
Patients will be followed for safety monitoring for 30 ( + 4) days after their final study drug infusion 
and will have an End of Study visit by telephone  at the following times: either ( 1) at completion of 
the Extension Phase or (2) at early termination if the patient voluntarily withdraws consent . Patients 
who terminate the study prematurely will have all ET assessments performed. Patients who 
terminate the study prematurely who are unable to be on -site for the ET visit will be contacted by 
telephone for  safety follow -up.  
If withdrawn from study drug, the patient will continue study visits to the end of Treatment Period 
12. 
Double -Blind Extension Phase  
Patients will enroll in a double -blind extension to begin after the conclusion of Treatment Period 6. 
Patients in any cohort who have met the stopping rule during the blinded treatment phase will 
continue study visits in the extension phase without study drug administration. All SEL -212 patients 
in the extension phase will receive up to an additional 6  mont hly doses of SEL -212 at the same dose 
level as during the Treatment Phase for those that maintain Day 21 sUA <6 mg/dL. Patients who 
meet the stopping rule during the extension phase will be withdrawn from study drug and will 
continue study visits to the en d of the extension phase.

An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB ) will be formed by charter to assist in 
reviewing safety data and may provide recommendations to the Sponsor regarding study drug d ose 
adjustment or study termination.  
Stopping Rules  
A patient will be withdrawn from study drug for meeting the following stopping rule:  
• sUA level < 2.0 mg/dL, measured 1 hour after the infusion of the second component of study 
drug is completed during Treatment Period 1  
AND  
• sUA level > 1.0 mg/dL measured at the Day 21 visit of Treatment Period 1 or sUA level > 6.0 
mg/dL at the Day 21 visit of any of Treatment Periods 2 -11 
Stopping rules will  be assessed by an independent , central , unblinded medical monitor . 
If withdrawn from stu dy drug during the double -blind treatment period (Treatment Period 1 to 6) or 
the double -blind extension period (Treatment Period 7 to 12), regardless of reason, the patient will 
continue study visits to the end of Treatment Period 12 . The window for all D ay 21 visits is +2/-1 
days.  
If a Day 21 visit sUA value drawn within the protocol window is not available, but if a sUA value 
drawn at an unscheduled visit after the Day 21 window is available prior to dosing that is ≤ 1.0 mg/dL 
during Treatment Period 1 or ≤ 6.0 mg/dL during any of Treatment Periods 2 -11, the patient will not 
be required to be withdrawn from study drug and will be eligible to receive their subsequent dose.  
If 1) a Day 21 visit sUA value drawn within the protocol window is not available and no subsequent 
sUA results are available or 2) a Day  21 visit sUA value drawn within the protocol window is not 
available and a subsequent sUA drawn at an unscheduled visit after the Day 21 window is > 1.0 
mg/dL during Treatment Period 1 or > 6.0 mg/dL du ring any of Treatment Periods 2 -11, then the 
patient will be withdrawn from study drug based on the protocol deviation . If a protocol deviation 
occurs where a patient is not able to be dosed within the dosing day window (for example in the 
case of COVID -19 restrictions temporarily preventing dosing ) the current treatment period will be 
extended up to a maximum of 90 days w ithout skipping doses for patients with a Day  21 visit sUA 
value ≤  1.0 mg/dL during Treatment Period 1 or ≤ 6.0 mg/dL during Treatment Periods 2 -11 in the 
D21 visit window or subsequent up to the rescheduled dosing visit.   If this protocol deviation occurs  
such that the patient was unable to be dosed within the dosing day window for the Treatment 
Period 7 Day 0 dose, then the Treatment Period 6 Day 28 visit should still occur 28 days (+3/ -4 days) 
after the Treatment Period 6 dose or as close to the visit wi ndow as possible to collect the final 
primary endpoint SUA sample .  In this specific instance, t he dosing day Treatment Period 7 Day 0 
should  then occur as soon as possible afterward  up to a maximum of 90 days from the preceding 
dose .   
To maintain the bli nd, a central group of unblinded pre-specified medical personnel will adjudicate 
the implementation of the stopping rules.  
If withdrawn from study drug, the patient will continue study visits to the end of Treatment Period 
12. At the discretion of the Inve stigator, the patient will be permitted to return to ULT 60 days after

• Modified ITT: The modified ITT will include all randomized patients who were dose d, except 
those who discontinue treatment du e to a COVID -19 infection as defined in section 12.1.8.7  or 
do not  have at least two sUA measurements 7 days apart  in TP6 due to a/multiple missed visits 
due to a COVID -19 infection or subsequent complications as defined in  section  12.1.8.7 . 
Patients will be analyzed according to randomiz ed treatment.  
• Per Protocol Set: The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include all patients who were administered at 
least one complete dose of study drug , who have at least one post -baseline assessment of sUA, 
who have sufficient data to assess the primary effi cacy endpoint, and who have no major 
Protocol deviations affecting the primary efficacy assessments. Patients will be analyzed 
according to randomized treatment.  The PPS will be defined for the double -blind treatment 
phase of the study only.  Criteria for e xclusion from the PPS will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.   
• All Randomized Set : The all randomized set will include all patients who were randomized. 
Patients will be analyzed according to randomized treatment group assignment.    
• The Extensio n Phase Evaluable Set (EPS) will include all subjects of the safety set who continue 
in the double -blind extension phase.  
Efficacy Analyses  
Only efficacy endpoints of the double -blind treatment phase will be tested in a confirmatory way. 
Estimands are defined for the confirmatory analysis of efficacy in the double -blind treatment period.  
Most of the efficacy endpoints continue to be assessed in the double -blind extension period , also. 
However, only descriptive summaries and comparisons wil l be provided for the extension period.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of patients in each of the SEL-212 dose groups 
versus placebo who achieve and maintain reduction of sUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the tim e 
during Treatment Period 6.  
The main estimand  for the primary efficacy endpoint will consider a binary variable indicating the 
treatment response when having completed 6 cycles of study treatment, whereby a responder is 
defined as a subject who has sUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Tr eatment Period 6. 
For this primary estimand, intercurrent events which lead to a discontinuation of study treatment 
due to lack of efficacy (includes meeting the stopping criteria), treatment -related or non -treatment 
related AE, patients with a positive CO VID-19 test result along with severe or critical symptoms  of 
COVID -19, used a prohibited medication that   lowers sUA , or death  will be considered as treatment 
failures following the composite strategy, for all other intercurrent events such as  use of a  prohibited 
medication that does not lower sUA, the treatment -policy strategy will be used.  The population -level 
summary is defined as the difference in the percentage of treatment responders of each SEL -212 
treatment group versus placebo. Missing  response  will be multiple imputed. The statistical testing of 
each SEL -212 treatment group versus placebo will be performed using the Mantel -Haenszel (MH) 
estimate and test for common risk difference considering the randomization stratum of tophus 
presenc e (yes/no) with a two -sided type 1 error rate α = 2.5% to adjust for the two comparisons 
against placebo.  
Further estimands will be defined in the SAP. However, only the test results of the main estimand 
will be considered as confirmatory. Sensitivity ana lysis will be performed using the tipping -point 
analysis.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE 18 OF 109 
The analysis of the estimands will be carried out based on the ITT population primarily. Supportive 
analyses will be performed on the mITT , all randomized  and the PP populations.  
The sUA time curv e will be used to estimate the proportion of time that the sUA level is  below 6 
mg/dL. Based on the serum samples collected during Treatment Period 6, an  estimate of the time 
with sUA < 6 mg/dL can be determined by connecting each two  neighboring data poin ts with a 
straight line. If the sUA time curve goes above 6 mg/dL the  linear interpolation method will be used 
to estimate the point in time at which the sUA time  curve intercepts the line between the last sUA 
value < 6 mg/dL and the first value ≥ 6 mg/dL.  The proportion of time that the sUA level is < 6 mg/dL 
will be computed by taking the ratio  between the time during which the sUA level remains < 6 mg/dL 
(if necessary, using the  linear interpolation method) and the entire time interval within Treat ment 
Period 6.  For a patient  to be considered a responder  in Treatment Period 6, the proportion of time 
that the  sUA level is < 6 mg/dL (i.e., percentage of nonhyperuricemic time) during Treatment Period  
6 must be at least 80%.  A frequency table of the per centage of responder will be provided by  
treatment group.   
Additionally, a summary table with the total time a patient has sUA values ≤ 6 mg/dL in Treatment 
Period 6 will be provided by treatment group.  
Summary table of the actual values and change from Baseline for sUA results will be provided for 
each scheduled sampling time point by treatment group. Additionally, mean sUA level, reduction in 
mean sUA and percent reduction in mean sUA from Baseline during Treatment Period 6 will be 
presented by treatment  group.  
• Mean sUA level is defined as the area under the sUA time curve (computed using the linear 
trapezoidal rule during Treatment Period 6) divided by the corresponding time interval.   
• Reduction in mean sUA is computed by subtracting Baseline sUA level f rom mean sUA during 
Treatment Period 6.  
• Percent reduction in the mean sUA from Baseline is computed as the mean sUA level during 
Treatment Period 6 minus Baseline sUA level divided by Baseline sUA level multiplied by 100 % 
Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
If the superiority of both  (one) SEL -212 treatment group(s) against placebo for the main estimand of 
the primary efficacy is shown with a p -value ≤ 0.025, the hierarchical testing approach will continue 
to the testing of the main estimands of the key secon dary efficacy comparing pairwise both (one) 
SEL-212 treatments against placebo. Only the main estimands of the key secondary efficacy will be 
tested in the successive order. The test result of the nth key secondary efficacy estimand will be 
considered as c onfirmatory if the p -value of the two -sided test of the previous estimand resulted in a 
value less or equal 0.025.  
Most  main estimands with a continuous or numerical endpoint will be tested between each SEL -212 
treatment group versus placebo using the mix ed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the 
change from  baseline in the respective variable as dependent variable, and treatment, treatment -by-
period interaction, randomization stratum and baseline value of the respective variable as fixed 
effect variab les. The Least Square (LS) Mean difference between each SEL -212 and placebo 
treatments groups will be estimated on the treatment -by-period interaction with  Treatment Period 
6, along with its 97.5% confidence interval, and 2 -sided p -values.  
The main estiman ds defined for binary or response variables will be tested between each SEL -212 
treatment group versus placebo using the Mantel -Haenszel (MH) estimate and test for common risk

statistics for the ITT population and will be compared between each SEL -212 treatment group and 
placebo using MH or Chi -square tests , as appropriate,  in case of binary endpoints or usi ng ANCOVA 
or MMRM, as appropriate, in case of continuous or numerical endpoints . Exploratory p -values of 
two-sided tests  with  95% confidence intervals for treatment differences between each SEL -212 
treatment group and placebo will be presented.

relationship to study drug.  Event rates by treatment group and overall will be provided for patients 
with at least one related TEAE, at least one SAE,  and at least one TEAE of special interest . 
Additionally, the rate difference  with 95% confidence interval comparing each SEL -212 treatment 
group to placebo as well as comparing the integrated SEL -212 arms to  placebo will be provided.  
Laboratory data will be summarized by the type of laboratory test and will be presented for each

noteworthy QTcF/QTcB changes from baseline (≥ 30 but <60; ≥ 60  ms) will be provided.  
Sample Size Determination  
The primary efficacy criterion in this study is defined as the rate of the patients who achieve and 
maintain reduction of sUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Treatment Period 6. The 
responder rate for the primary estimand in all randomized and dosed patients is assumed to be 45% 
in SEL -212 and 5% in placebo. Considering a randomization ratio of 1:1:1 for SEL -212A and SEL -212B  
against placebo, a statistical power of 90%, a two -sided alph a-level of 2.5% in each pairwise test 
against placebo,  and using the Chi -square test with continuity correction, 32:32:32  randomized and 
dosed patients will be required for the following groups: SEL-212A, SEL -212B , and placebo . 
Considering the potential that some randomized patients will terminate early (approx. 8%), the 
number of the patients required to be randomized (and not replaced) in total was 105 (i.e., 35:35:35 ) 
to demonstrate efficacy.  The randomized but not dosed patie nts will be replaced.  
An additional 15 patients have been added to the study sample size to account for potential 
treatment discontinuations that may occur due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic as a result of the 
emergence of COVID -19 variants which were no t accounted for in the sample size calculations 
resulting in approximately 120 patients (i.e., 40:40:40) to be randomized and dosed to demonstrate 
efficacy.

5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Gout and Refractory Gout  
Gout is a chronic inflammatory condition with intermittent episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis 
characterized by elevated uric acid levels and caused by the formation of urate crystals in joint fluid 
leading to intensely painful joint inflammation. Chronic hyperuricemia leads to further deposition of uric 
acid in soft tissues resulting in destructive arthritis and formation of tophi and renal calculi ( Choi 2005 , 
So 2008 , Wortmann 2008 ). Gout is a common disease with increasing incidence, driven mainly by an 
aging population, with some contribution from the increasing prevalence of obesity and the use of 
diuretics ( Choi 2006 , Luk 2005 ). 
The incidence of gout increases as circulating uric acid levels increase ( Campion 1987 ) and lowering 
circulating urate levels is a primary means of managing gout. The American  College of Rheumatology 
guidelines recommend lowering uric acid level to at least below 6 mg/dL and preferably below 5 mg/dL 
(Khanna 2012a , Khanna 2012b ).  
The progression of gout is believed  to have 4 pathophysiological stages ( Dalbeth 2011 ): 
1. Hyperuricemia without monosodium urate crystal deposition or gout  
2. Crystal deposition without symptomatic gout  
3. Crystal deposition with acute gout flares  
4. Advanced or severe gout, characterized by tophi, chronic gouty arthritis, and radiographic 
erosions  
Refractory gout is a serious condition affecting approximately 160,000  patients in the United States and 
is characterized by uric acid levels that are not adequately co ntrolled by conventional therapies.  
5.2 Symptoms of Gout  
The symptoms and clinical signs of gout have a broad spectrum of severity. Most symptoms present as 
intermittent attacks or flares while others present as more severe , refractory disease have monosodium 
urate crystal deposition with a constellation of severe manifestations including gout flares, multiple 
joints with chronic gouty arthritis and subcutaneous tophus  (Bursill 2019 ). In tophaceous  gout, tophi 
commonly develop in t he fingers, hands, and feet around the olecranon, and under the skin on the ears, 
but may also develop in other tissues and organs such as the kidneys and heart valves ( Ryan 2016 ). Pro -
inflammatory cytokines and white cell debr is are usually present in tophi, which suggest a state of 
chronic monosodium urate -crystal -stimulated inflammation ( Dalbeth 201 0). These tophi can erupt 
through the skin, become inflamed and painful, and discharge urate crysta ls and eventually may cause 
deformities and secondary osteoarthritis (Ryan  2016 ). They can infiltrate into the bone, causing bone 
erosion and joint damage ( Dalbeth  2008). Additional complications include obstruction of the joint and 
infection as well as urolithiasis with uric acid stones or calcium oxalate stones ( Ryan 2016 ). Tophaceous 
gout is associated with more frequent flares, which may be so painful and debilitating that they lead to 
joint replacement or surgical excision. Over time, flares become polyarticular, additive, and increase in 
severity ( Brook 2010 ).

5.3 Gout and Hyperuricemia: Exacerbation of Existing Comorbidities  
The effect of chronic, severe, refractory gout on quality of life is more pronounced in patients with 
medical comorbidities as these complicate the therapeutic management of their symptoms and increase 
their risk of cardiovascular events and all -cause mor tality. It is also well -documented that the presence 
of these comorbidities has a significant impact on patients’ physical functioning, healthcare utilization, 
and quality of life ( Khanna 2012a ).  
Chronic, uncontrolled gout and hyperuricemia are associated with metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, and renal and cardiovascular diseases ( Strand 2012 ; Becker 2009 ; Chan dratre 2013 ). 
There is strong evidence that shows hyperuricemia contributes to worse outcomes under these 
conditions, and there is increasing mechanistic, epidemiological, and clinical data to indicate that 
elevated serum uric acid (sUA) levels can exacerb ate and contribute to the progression of comorbidities 
(Rock 2013 ; Mallamaci 2015 ).  
Data from 5707 patients in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were 
obtained from 2007 -2008, and prevalence of major gout comorbidities were correlated with 
hyperuricemia levels ( Zhu 2012 ). This analysis revealed the presence of hypertension, chronic kidney 
disease, obesity, diabetes, nephrolithiasis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke was 
substantially higher in individuals with gout compared to those without gout. Furthermore, the 
prevalence of these comorbidities increased proportionally to the level of hyperuricemia, w ith the 
incidence of comorbidities being highest among individuals with both gout and hyperuricemia.  
5.4 Impact on Quality of Life  
One longitudinal study in this patient population reports that approximately 70% of patients with 
chronic refractory gout have at  least 1  tophus and an average of 7 flares per year. In a separate study of 
chronic refractory gout, patients self -reported more than 60% of these flares as crippling ( Brook 2010 ). 
Symptoms of pain, limited mobility, and disab ility are debilitating and deeply affect physical function 
and emotional and social functioning, and disease severity correlates with a marked compromise in 
quality of life ( Strand 2012 , Becker 2009 ). 
The relationship between self -reported quality of life and disability and disease severity have been 
evaluated in multiple clinical studies. Over 100  subjects with chronic refractory gout evaluated using the 
Medical Outcomes Study Short Form -36 asse ssment, and results revealed that patients with chronic 
refractory gout have significantly lower subscales analogous to those of 75 -year old individuals ( Becker 
2009 ). Specifically, disease severity, as characterized by numbe r of flares in the past year, number of 
tender or swollen joints, or presence of tophi, significantly correlates with worse quality of life scores in 
all areas, which include bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical functioning and vitality. 
Subjects with comorbidities experienced worse physical functioning ( Strand 2012 ).  
There is also evidence that gout affects workplace productivity, as studies in patients with chronic, 
refractory gout self -report work absences due to flares, losing 25.1 workdays on average per year.

Another study specifically found employees with gout missed 4.56 more days of work per year than 
those without gout ( Edwards 2011 ).  
Hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of gout has steadily increased over the past 2  decades ( Lim 
2016 ). In contrast, hospitalizations due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has dramatically decreased over this 
same time period correlating with the development o f effective biologic drugs to treat RA.  In 2005, the 
number of hospitalizations due to gout exceeded the number of hospitalizations due to RA, and this gap 
has steadily increased. Hospitalization costs for gout and RA show a similar trend. Similarly, gener al 
population studies have shown a substantial reduction in premature death in RA patients but not in gout 
patients ( Rai 2016 ). The findings likely reflect lack of effective therapies for severe gout.  
Together, these data show t hat the burden of chronic, severe, refractory gout extends well beyond that 
of physical discomfort, affecting almost every domain of life thus stressing the seriousness of the disease 
and an unmet need for new therapies given its refractory nature. Lowerin g serum urate levels can 
prevent further deposition of urate crystals, thus leading to a reduction in flare incidence and resolution 
of existing tophi. The American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommend a target serum urate of 
less than 6  mg/dL for patients on urate lowering therapy, with a target of less than 5 mg/dL for patients 
with chronic, severe disease, because this level is associated with more rapid resolution of tophi 
(Dalbeth 2011 ).  
5.5 Approved Therapies for Chronic Gout Refractory to Conventional Therapy  
An estimated ~>200 ,000  gout patients fail to normalize their levels of sUA, have symptoms that are 
uncontrolled with the currently available treatments aimed at lowering urate levels, or suffer from 
comorbidities that preclude their use of conventional therapies ( Strand 2012 ). Lack of treatment options 
leads to unabated disease progression.   
Currently, conventional therapies for the treatment of gout involve the inh ibition of uric acid production 
and the improvement of uric acid renal clearance. The administration of exogenous uricase, an enzyme 
not present in humans that converts uric acid into the water -soluble compound, allantoin, is used only 
in instances of gout  that is refractory to first and second lines of therapy ( Richette 2016 ). 
There are 2 uricase products currently used to treat hyperuricemia , albeit under different 
circumstances : rasburicase (ELITEK®) used for treating hyperuricemia  in patients receiving anticancer 
therapy expected to result in tumor lysis and pegloticase ( Krystexxa®) indicated for the treatment of 
chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy . 
Rasburicase is a recombinant, unpegylated urate -oxidase enzyme produced by genetically modifie d S. 
cerevisiae . It is indicated for tumor lysis syndrome, and its use in treating gout is off -label. Its clinical use 
in gout is limited because it is highly immunogenic and has a short plasma half -life at approximately 18 
to 24 hours, making it an unsuit able treatment for chronic refractory gout ( Terkeltaub 2009 ). 
Pegloticase  is a pegylated recombinant porcine - or baboon -derived uricase. It is currently the only FDA -
approved product for the treatment of chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy ( Krystexxa®

Prescribing Information 2014 ). Wh ile its use is associated with improvements in musculoskeletal 
function, quality of life, and pain, only approximately 42% of patients maintain a target serum urate 
level less than 6 mg/dL after 6 months of the approved dose regimen of 8  mg once every 2 we eks. The 
vast majority of patients ( 89%) develop anti -pegloticase antibodies  (Lipsky 2014 ). High titer antibodies 
appear to adversely affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the enzyme and are 
associated with a de crease in therapeutic response and increased risk of infusion reactions. 
Approximately 26% of patients taking Krystexxa®  report infusion reactions, 6.5% experience anaphylaxis, 
and the incidence of infusion reactions correlate with high anti -pegloticase an tibody titer  (Sundy 2011 ). 
These adverse events are typically preceded by a loss of urate -lowering effects.  
In addition to infusion reactions and gout flares, the most common adverse reactions with Krystexxa®  
are nausea, contus ion, nasopharyngitis, constipation, chest pain, anaphylaxis, and vomiting. In the 2 
pivotal trials, there were 4 reported cases of exacerbations of pre -existing congestive heart failure in 
subjects receiving Krystexxa®  every 2 weeks.  
The high rate of treat ment failure and the potential for anaphylactic reactions are potential drawbacks  
of Krystexxa®  since its approval.  
5.6 Unmet Medical Need  
Current, approved uricase products carry substantial safety risks associated with immunogenicity, 
including anaphylaxis,  as well as reduced efficacy over time as antibodies develop against the exogenous 
enzyme.  
Selecta Biosciences has developed SEL-212, the first drug product designed to reduce or prevent an 
immunologic response and improve efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a uricase enzyme (pegadricase) in 
patients who require long -term treatment to manage symptoms and progression of chronic refract ory 
gout. Selecta uses its proprietary, antigen -specific ImmTOR  technology  to encapsulate the approved 
immunomodulatory drug, rapamycin, to mitigate formation of anti -drug antibodies by inducing antigen -
specific regulatory T cells. Selecta is leveraging it s nanoparticle technology encapsulating rapamycin 
(ImmTOR ) with the goal of inducing durable antigen -specific immune tolerance to pegadricase, a 
pegylated uricase. Specifically, SEL-212, in its current formulation, is a combination intravenous drug 
product  that consists of a pegylated recombinant uricase (pegadricase; SEL-037) and a biodegradable 
nanoparticle containing rapamycin ( SEL-110.36), a small molecule inhibitor of the mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Pegadricase is derived from Candida  utilis  and metabolizes poorly soluble 
uric acid to the more soluble metabolite, allantoin.  Administration of SEL-110.36 just prior to 
pegadricase is intended to induce immune tolerance to prevent the formation of anti -uricase antibodies 
that may compromis e efficacy or safety of pegadricase.   
The development of SEL-212 remains focused on mitigating the formation of antidrug antibodies with 
the goal of providing a product with better efficacy and safety profiles in patients than the only 
approved available t herapy.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design  
This is one of two replicate randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -arm trials to 
determine the safety and efficacy of two different dose levels of SEL-212 compared to placebo . The 
study will randomize approximately 1 20 patients with chronic refractory gout. Approximately 60% of the 
randomized patients will have tophi at Baseline . Patients , stratified as to the presence or absence of 
tophi,  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio prior to  Baseline  to receive treatment with one of 
two dose levels of SEL-212 or placebo every 28 days for approximately 6 months  in each trial 
(SEL-212/301 and SEL -212/302 ). These two trials will have identical designs with respect to being 
double -blinded, placebo -controlled as well as identical sample sizes, inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
efficacy/safety assessments and timing thereof , but will be distinguished by the blinded 6 -month 
extension in SEL -212/301  and that SEL -212/302 will include sites outside of the United States .  
 
 Efficacy assessments will be 
conducted at intervals that are appropriate to determine treatment effect  with samples for the primary 
endpoint drawn during Treatment Period 6 . Samples will be collect ed at intervals that are appropriate to 
determine the uricase activity of SEL-212. Safety will be monitored throughout the study  with an 
independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) . After successful completion of the double -blind 
treatment phase, patients successfully completing six months in SEL -212/301 will continue, in a blinded 
fashion, to be treated with the identical investigational treatment (one of two dose levels of SEL -212 or 
placebo) for 6 additional doses, every 28 days, lasting approxi mately 6  months. This will provide up to 12 
months of continuous treatment with SEL -212 in a placebo -controlled fashion . 
The study will be divided into 3 study phase s: Screening, Treatment, and Follow -up, described below.  
The study is depicted schematicall y in Figure 1. 
The total duration of participation in the study will range from approximately 50 to 55 weeks ( 352 to 
383 days) as follows:  
• Screening and/or washout and premedication Phase : up to 45 days ( up to 6.5 weeks)  
• Treatment Phase : 168 days (24 weeks)  
• Extension Phase: 168 days (24 weeks)  
• Safety Follow -Up: 30 days after last infusion  
7.1.1 Screening Phase  
After providing written informed consent, the patient is considered enrolled in the study. Patients will 
be evaluated for inclusion during the Screening Phase . For all patients , the standard Screening Phase  will 
be up to 45 days prior to Baseline . The Screening Phase may be initiated by a preliminary screening with 
an abbreviated informed consent focused on COVID -19 testing and serum uric acid levels followed by 
providing study -wide informed consent and the remainder of screening assessments if determined to 
proceed. Of note , if the s UA level obtained during preliminary screening meets eligibility requirements

(i.e., ≥ 7 mg/dL), the s UA should not be repeated during the subsequent complete screening 
assessmen t. Concurrently with the Screening Phase , a premedication period for potential gout flare 
with colchicine (or non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drug [NSAID] , if colchicine is contraindicated) of at 
least 7 days prior to Baseline will be required for all patients, and a washout period of at least 7 
days will be required prior to Baseline for patients on any urate -lowering therapy (ULT).  Both the 
ULT washout period and the gout flare prophylaxis period may be started earlier than 7 days prior 
to Baseline. At th e discretion of the PI, chronic refractory gout patients whose sUA is lower than the 
eligibility level of ≥7 mg/dL on prescreening or initial screen, may undergo  ULT washout prior to 
retesting the sUA. Initiation of gout flare prophylaxis with colchicine (or non-steroidal anti -
inflammatory drug [NSAID] , if colchicine is contraindicated)  can also be considered coincidentally with 
the ULT washout to prevent a potential gout flare.  
7.1.2 Double Blind Treatment Phase  
The total duration of  the double -blind Treatment Phase  will be approximately 6 months ( i.e., 168  days, 
consisting of six 28 -day treatment cycles).  
Eligible patient s, stratified as to the presence or absence of tophi,  will be randomized in a 
1:1:1  allocation ratio prior to  base line to receive one of two dose levels of SEL-212 or placebo. The SEL -
212 doses will differ as to the SEL -110.36 component. Participants will receive  SEL-037 administered at a 
dose level of 0.2 mg/kg via intravenous (IV) infusion  immediately after receiving  SEL-110.36  at a dose 
level of either 0.1 mg/kg (SEL -212A) or 0.15 mg/kg  (SEL-212B)  via IV infusion. The placebo will consist of 
normal saline that will be administered in the same way that the SEL-212 components are administered 
to maintain the i ntegrity of the study blind.  Refer to Section 10 for details about study drug 
administration.  
Patients will complete 6 treatment periods each hav ing a duration of 28 days. Patients will receive 
treatment with study drug or placebo on Day 0 of each treatment period for a total of 6 doses. For each 
treatment cycle, participants will receive premedication to minimize the potential for infusion reactio ns 
during study drug administration. After completing the study drug infusions, participants will remain at 
the investigational site for 1 hour for safety assessments.  
With each  dose , a blood sample will be drawn for assessment of sUA level  and uricase activity  
immediately prior to infusion (i .e., Time 0  h) with SEL -212 or placebo  and 1 hour after the infusion of the 
second component of SEL -212 or of placebo is completed . Serum uric ac id will be assessed through 
additional post -infusion blood samples at pre -determined time points  by an independent, central, 
unblinded medical monitor .  
Gout flares will be assessed at each study visit during the Treatment Phase using a validated definitio n of 
flares in patients with established gout ( Gaffo 2018 ). In addition, in an exploratory manner, gout flares 
will be self -assessed by the patient weekly after randomization and in each Treatment Period using a 
weekly flare dia ry (Poiley 2016 ). Health Questionnaires, tophus burden  and joint swelling and 
tenderness will be assessed on Day 0 of Treatment Period s 1 and 4, and at the end of Treatment Period

6 or early termination (ET) if a patient discon tinues the study  prior to the end of 6 monthly infusions . 
Samples for a nti-uricase , anti -PEG,  and anti -pegadricase antibody levels will be taken (i) prior to 
administration of study drug dosing and at Day 21 for each of the six treatment periods throughout the 
trial and (ii) at the end of Treatment Period 6  or at ET. Exploratory assessments of 
inflammatory /immunologic  biomarkers and multiomic analysis will also be assessed.  
Safety laboratory samples, consisting of, but not limited to, complete blo od count (CBC) including white 
blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count; liver function tests (LFTs) including aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT); serum lipids (including triglycerides and low 
density lipoprotein (L DL)), analyses of renal function including creatinine, urine albumin creatinine ratio 
(UACR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be collected on Day 0 and Day 21 of 
Treatment Period 1 , on Day 21 only of each of Treatment Periods 2 -5, and on Day 21 and Day  28 / ET of 
Treatment Period 6. On Treatment Period 1 Day 0, safety laboratory samples will be collected pre -
infusion in both the SEL -212 arm and the placebo arm. Concomitant medications and procedures and 
adverse events (AEs) will be moni tored continuously during the study. Post -Baseline c hest X -rays (CXR) 
will be taken at six months and one year  / ET to assess for presence of or changes in interstitial lung 
disease (ILD)  compared to baseline CXR .  
7.1.3 Follow -Up Phase  
Patient s will be followed for safety monitoring (30 + 4 days) after their final study drug infusion and will 
have an End of Study visit  by telephone at the following times: either ( 1) at completion of the Extension 
Phase or (2) at early termination  if the patient  voluntarily withdraws consent . Patient s who terminate 
the study prematurely will continue to be followed by having all Early Termination assessments 
performed. Patient s who terminate the study prematurely who are unable to be on -site for the E arly 
Termina tion visit will be contacted by telephone for safety follow -up.  
If withdrawn from study drug, regardless of reason, the patient will continue study visits to the end of 
Treatment Period 12.  
7.1.4 Double -Blind Extension Phase  
Patients will enroll in a double -blind extension to begin after the conclusion of Treatment Period 6. 
Patients in any cohort  who have met the stopping rule during the blinded treatment phase will continue 
study visits in the extension phase without study drug administration. All SEL-212 patients in the 
extension phase will receive up to an additional 6  monthly doses of SEL -212 at the same dose level as 
during the Treatment Phase for those that maintain Day 21 sUA <6 mg/dL. Patients who meet the 
stopping rule during the extension p hase will be withdrawn from study drug and will continue study 
visits to the end of the extension phase.

Patient s will be randomized in a double -blind way with an allocation ratio of  1:1:1 to receive treatment 
with two different dose levels of SEL-212 or placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by 
presence/absence of tophi .  
7.4 Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Unless otherwise specified, study drug will be administered as described in Section 9 and Section 10. 
7.4.1 Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses  
7.4.1.1  SEL-212 or Placebo  
A patient will be withdrawn from study drug for meeting the following stopping rule:  
• sUA level < 2.0 mg/dL, measured 1 hour after the infusion of the second component of study 
drug is completed during Treatment Period 1  
AND  
• sUA level > 1.0 mg/dL measured at the Day 21 visit  of Treatment Period 1 or sUA level > 6.0 
mg/dL at the Day 21 visit of any of Treatment Periods 2 -11 
Stopping rules will be assessed by an independent , central , unblinded medical monitor . 
If withdrawn from study drug during the double -blind treatment period (Treatment Period 1 to 6) or the 
double -blind extension period (Treatment Period 7 to 12), regardless of reason, the patient will continue 
study visits to the end of Treatment Period 12.   
The window for all Day 21 visits is +2/-1 days. If a Day 21 visit sUA value drawn within the protocol 
window is not available, but if a sUA value drawn at an unscheduled visit after the Day 21 window is 
available prior to dosing that is ≤  1.0 mg/dL durin g Treatment Period 1 or ≤  6.0 mg/dL during Treatment 
Periods 2 -11, the patient will not be required to be withdrawn from study drug and will be eligible to 
receive their subsequent dose.   
If 1) a Day 21 visit sUA value drawn within the protocol window is n ot available and no subsequent sUA 
results are available or 2) a Day 21 visit sUA value drawn within the protocol window is not available and

a subsequent sUA drawn at an unscheduled visit after the Day 21 window is > 1.0 mg/dL during 
Treatment Period 1 or  > 6.0 mg/dL during Treatment Periods  2-11, then the patient will be withdrawn 
from study drug based on the protocol deviation.  If a protocol deviation occurs where a patient is not 
able to be dosed within the dosing day window (for example in the case of COVID -19 restrictions 
temporarily preventing dosing ) the current treatment period will be extended up to a maximum of 90 
days without skipping doses for patients with a Day  21 visit sUA value ≤  1.0 mg/dL during Treatment 
Period 1 or ≤ 6.0 mg/dL during Trea tment Periods 2 -11 in the D21 visit window or subsequent up to the 
rescheduled dosing visit.  If this protocol deviation occurs such that the patient was unable to be dosed 
within the dosing day window for the Treatment Period 7 Day 0 dose, then the Treatme nt Period 6 Day 
28 visit should still occur 28 days (+3/ -4 days) after the Treatment Period 6 dose or as close to the visit 
window as possible to collect the final primary endpoint sUA sample.  In this specific instance, the dosing 
day Treatment Period 7 D ay 0 should then occur as soon as possible afterward up to a maximum of 90 
days from the preceding dose.  
To maintain the blind,  a central group of  unblinded pre -specified medical personnel will adjudicate the 
implementation of the stopping rules.  
If withdrawn from study drug, the patient will continue study visits to the end of Treatment Period 12. 
At the discretion of the Investigator, the patient  will be permitted to return to ULT 60 days after the 
patient’s last study drug treatment. ULT shall not be SEL -212 or  any experimental or marketed uricase 
(e.g., rasburicase (Elitek, Fasturtec), pegloticase (Krystexxa®), for the remainder of the study . 
7.4.2 Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB ) will be formed by charter to assist in 
reviewing safety data and may provide recommendations to the Sponsor regarding study drug dose 
adjustment or study termina tion.  
7.5 Criteria for Study Termination  
The study can be terminated at any time at the Sponsor’s sole discretion. Otherwise, the study will be 
terminated when all patients have completed follow -up assessments ( Appendix C ) or the Sponsor or 
regulatory agency(ies) have determined there is an unacceptable risk to patients or additional dosing or 
procedures are not warranted or necessary.   
The study may be t erminated at a particular investigational site under the following conditions:  
• The Investigator fails to enroll patients at an acceptable rate;  
• The Investigator fails to comply with pertinent regulations;  
• There is insufficient adherence (i.e., compliance) to the protocol;  
• Knowingly false information is submitted to the IRB /IEC, Sponsor or designee, or regulatory 
authorities.

7.6 Study Rationale  
7.6.1 Rationale for the Study Design  
Refractory gout is a serious condition affecting approximately >200 ,000  patients in the United States 
and is characterized by uric acid levels that are not adequately controlled by xanthine oxidase inhibitors, 
such as allopurinol or febuxostat, or for whom  such drugs are contraindicated. About 5% to 10% of gout 
patients are not treated effectively with allopurinol and thus continue to have acute flares and may 
experience destructive joint damage and tophus formation ( Edwards  2008, Fels 2008 ). Additionally, 
approximately 2% of gout patients exposed develop hypersensitivity to allopurinol which can lead to 
very serious complications and even death ( Markel 2005 ). 
Pegloticase (Krystexxa®), a pegylated uricase, was approved by the United States Food and Drug 
Admi nistration (FDA) in 2010 for the treatment of chronic gout in patients refractory to conventional 
therapy. Pegloticase is effective in lowering serum uric acid after a single dose. However, >58% of 
subjects treated with pegloticase experience loss of effic acy within 6 months with the vast majority 
experiencing loss of efficacy within 3 months due to the formation of anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) with 
the possibility of infusion reactions, sometimes severe.  
SEL-212 is a combination drug product consisting of SEL-037 and SEL -110.36. SEL -037 (pegadricase, 
pegylated recombinant Candida utilis  urate oxidase) is an investigational biological therapeutic product 
presented as a lyophilized pegylated recombinant uricase for intravenous injection. SEL -110.36 is 
designe d to inhibit the formation of ADAs when concomitantly administered with a biologic, specifically, 
the uricase, pegadricase or SEL -037.  
The overall development of SEL -212 remains focused on mitigating the formation of ADAs with the goal 
of providing a prod uct with better efficacy and safety profiles in patients than the only approved 
available therapy.  
Study SEL-212/301 is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -arm study to determine 
the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of SEL-212 com pared to placebo .  
A randomized, controlled study is the gold -standard for evaluation of efficacy in clinical research. 
Randomized, controlled studies are quantitative, comparative, controlled experiments in which 
treatment effect sizes may be determined w ith less bias than observational trials. Randomization is 
considered the most powerful experimental design in clinical trials: with other variables equal between 
groups, on average, any differences in outcome can be attributed to the intervention.  
The blin ding scheme in this study will be applied to all patients, Investigators, study personnel, and 
Sponsor personnel involved in the conduct of the study, except for a designated unblinded statistician 
who will generate and have access to the randomization cod es, a designated unblinded site 
representative (e.g., pharmacist) who will prepare study drug on the day of treatment, an unblinded 
infusion nurse who will be responsible for dosing the patient, a designated  unblinded medical monitor  
for assessing the trea tment stopping rules , and unblinded drug supply personnel . Blinding and 
randomization will reduce the potential for treatment bias and will improve the veracity of detected

efficacy and safety signals, particularly in the use of patient -reported quality of life assessments. The 
parallel arms involving active tre atment and placebo will permit adequate statistical comparison of the 
groups for efficacy and safety signal detection.  
Placebo (normal saline) rather than an active control will be employed in this study for ethical and 
practical considerations. The a ppro ved therapeutic for patients with gout refractory to conventional 
therapy  (pegloticase)  and the uricase product currently used to treat hyperuricemia (rasburicase) 
include exogenous enzymes that are highly immunogenic (Section 5.5) and that would expose patients 
randomized to an active control group to unnecessary risk. The dosing regime ns of the approved 
enzymes are substantially different from the  dosing regime n of SEL-212 and would defeat the steps 
taken to blind the study. The use of multiple doses of SEL -212 will help determine optimal efficacy: 
safety profile in a heterogenous population of patients with significant co -morbidities.  
7.6.2 Rationale f or the Study Population  
The selection of this study population ( Section  8) is based primarily on the desired therapeutic indication 
that the Sponso r will seek . Other selection criteria were set in order to maximize the ability to detect 
efficacy signals while minimizing any undue risk to the enrolled patients. Therefore, the severity and 
refractoriness of the patient’s disease and sUA level are key I nclusion Criteria ( Section 8.1). In order to 
enhance the safety of patients on treatment, key Exclusion Criteria involve history of severe allergies or 
allergies to products that have similar features to the components of SEL-212, medical factors that might 
be exacerbated while on treatment, and prior exposure to experimental or marketed uricase therapies.  
7.6.3 Rationale for the Selected Dose  
Dose selection for this Phase 3 study was based on safety and efficacy analyses of the clinical 
development program for SEL-212, beginning with a completed Phase 1b study (Study  SEL-212/101: “A 
Phase I Single Ascending Dose Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamics Study of SEL-212 in 
Subjects with Elevated Blood Uric Acid,” [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] )  and a  Phase 2 study  (Study SEL-212/201: “ An 
Open Label Phase II Multiple Dose Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamics Study of SEL-212 
Followed by Open Label Administration of SEL-037 in Subjects with Symptomatic Gout and Elevated 
Blood Uric Acid ” NC T02959918 ).  
7.6.3.1  Phase 1b Study with SEL-212 
This was a Phase 1b double -blind, sequential, single -ascending -dose study ( SEL-110; Cohorts 1, 3, 5, and 
7) combined with an open label, single -ascending -dose study ( SEL-212; Cohorts 2, 4, 6, 10, 12 and 14) to 
asses s the safety, tolerability, and PK of SEL-212 and SEL-110. Additionally, the study was to assess the 
PD (ability to reduce sUA) and immunogenicity (ability to prevent ADAs to uricase and pegadricase) of 
SEL-212. Generally, patients were dosed on a cohort b asis in an ascending stepwise manner. A control 
group was dosed with SEL-037 only.  
In the Phase 1b study  (SEL-212/101) , patients (N = 64) with a serum uric acid level ≥  6 mg/dL, with or 
without a history of gout, were administered SEL-110 alone, SEL-037 ( pegadricase ) alone, or SEL-212 
(SEL-037 + SEL -110)  as an intravenous infusion. Mitigation of ADAs and a dose -dependent reduction in

sUA levels occurred from study Day 1 to Day 30 in patients administered SEL-212 (data on file).  There 
was no effect of SEL-110 alone on sUA levels, and patients administered SEL-037 alone developed ADAs 
that resulted in loss of sUA control by Day 14. SEL-212 was generally well tolerated at all dose levels. The 
maximum tolerated dose of SEL-110 was determined to be 0.3  mg/kg. Data from this study were used to 
select additional dose levels of each component of SEL-212 for evaluation in the Phase 2 study 
SEL-212/201 . 
7.6.3.2  Phase 2 Studies with SEL-212 
7.6.3.2.1  Phase 2 Study SEL-212/201 
The Phase 2 study SEL-212/201 was designed as an open -label, ascending multiple -dose study of the 
combination drug, SEL-212, combined with an open -label, multiple -dose evaluation of SEL-037 
(pegadricase ) alone in patients with symptomatic gout and elevated blood uric acid . Part  A of the study 
consisted of three 28 -day treatment cycles of SEL-212, which was then followed by Part B, which 
consisted of two 28 -day treatment cycles of SEL-037 alone, with a primary objective of assessing the 
safety, tolerability, PK, PD of SEL-212 (i.e., the combination of SEL-110 and SEL-037). Additional 
assessments include the ability of SEL-212 to reduce serum uric acid levels and prevent anti -drug 
antibodies to uricase and peg adricase.  Part C of the study consisted of 5 monthly doses of SEL -212.  
In Study SEL-212/201 with SEL-212, sUA  levels remained consistently below 6 mg/ dL in 70% to 89% of 
evaluable Part A patients administered SEL-212 once monthly for 3  months. The control of sUA occurred 
in the context of low incidences of infusion reactions, anaphylaxis, and gout flares as well as treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) known to be potentially associated with rapamycin ( sirolimus – 
Rapamune®). Data support a once monthly dosing regimen.  For cohorts 7 -12 with SEL -110 doses of 0.1 
mg/kg or higher, 46% of evaluable patients had sUA <6 mg/dL at week 20.  
In Part C cohorts receiving 5 monthly doses of SEL -212, 61%, 71%, and 67% of eligible patients in Cohorts 
13, 15, and 17, respectively, maint ained sUA control (sUA, <6 mg/dL) at week 12 without the 
development of ADAs. All 21 patients in cohorts 13, 15 and 17 who had sUA  < 6 mg/dL at week 12, 
maintained sUA control through the end of treatment period 5 and had sUA < 6 mg/dL at week 20.  
The effi cacy signal of SEL -212 in SEL -212/201 persists across multiple treatment cycles in all cohorts and 
through all 5 treatment cycles when SEL -212 is given at each treatment, as demonstrated by dose -
dependent reductions in sUA levels below 6 mg/dL and ADA supp ression in conjunction with increasing 
SEL-110 dose levels up to 0.15 mg/kg.  
Cohorts 7, 11, 13 and 1 7 represent the dose regimens that will be evaluated in the Phase  3 program  (0.1 
or 0.15 mg/kg SEL -110 and 0.2 mg/kg SEL-037) . Part C cohorts 13, 15, and 17  received 5 once monthly 
doses of SEL -212, and patients in the proposed Phase 3 program will receive a total of 6  or 12  once 
monthly doses of SEL -212.  
Across cohorts 1 to 1 7, 28 SAEs have been reported in 20  of 152 (13.2%)  patients . They include  9 
infusion  reactions reported as related or possibly related to SEL-212. Of these 9 infusion reactions, only

3 occurred during repeat dosing of SEL-212 in cohorts 7, 13 and 17 ; 4 occurred in cohorts that received 
SEL-037 alone or SEL-037 with the lowest dose of SEL-110 (0.05  mg/mL); and 2 were due to dosing 
errors. All SAEs were successfully treated without complication. No study drug related SAEs or 
discontinuations involving gout flares, metabolic disorders, hypophosphatemia, or changes in lipid levels 
have been reported in  the Phase  2 study SEL-212/201.  
Leukopenia can be seen in patients taking high doses of  rapamycin  for extended periods of time. 
Leukopenia was reported by investigators in 11 (7.2%) and neutropenia in 6 (3.9%)  of patients . One 
patient ’s neutropenia was reported as severe but not  identified with a TEAE of infection. No SAEs or 
study drug discontinuations involving leukopenia  or neutropenia  have been reported.  
Another TEAE seen in patients taking oral rapamycin is stomatitis (mTor  Inhibitor associated stomatitis -
mIAS) and was observed in the SEL-212 Phase  2 trial at a lesser rate than seen in previous clinical trials 
(Peterson 2016 ). Stomatitis  or aphthous ulcers  were reported in 19 (12.5 %) of patie nts; all were mild or 
moderate in severity . The TEAEs categorized as stomatitis or oral lesions did not result in any SAEs, study 
drug discontinuations, or withdrawals. All resolved with minimal topical oral treatment of 
corticosteroids.  
Additional TEAEs of particular interest for rapamycin are hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and 
hypertriglyceridemia. These were reported in 5.9%, 3.9% and 1 7.8% of patients in the SEL-212 Phase  2 
trial, respectively. These TEAEs resolved without any medica l intervention, their duration was transient, 
and they did not result in any SAEs, study drug discontinuations, or withdrawals.  
7.6.3.2.2  Phase 2 Study SEL-212/202 
Study SEL -212/202 is a Phase 2 randomized, open -label, parallel -arm study to compare the safety and 
efficacy of IV infusions of SEL -212 compared to KRYSTEXXA for 6 months. The study has completed 
enrollment but is ongoing in the treatment phase. Data presented are based upon a data cutoff of 19  
March 2020.  
Subjects in the SEL -212 arm received study drug (S EL-110.36, 0.15 mg/kg + SEL -037, 0.2  mg/kg) every 28 
days (D ay 0 of each treatment period ) for a total of 6 infusions. Subjects in the KRYSTEXXA arm received 
study drug (8 mg) every 14 days (per manufacturer’s prescribing information, D ay 0 and D ay 14 of e ach 
treatment period ) for a total of 12 infusions.  
The planned enrollment was 150 subjects . Actual enrollment was 170 subjects  and included  83 subjects 
in the SEL -212 arm and 87 subjects in the KRYSTEXXA arm.  
Subjects ranged in age from 29 to 79 years wi th 16 3 males (95.9%) and 7 females (4.1%). Twenty -seven 
(27) subjects (15.8%) have completed the study and 22 subjects (12.9%) discontinued from the study. 
Primary reasons for early discontinuation from the study were withdrawal of consent  in 13 (7.6%)  
subjects,  adverse event  in 3 (1.8%)  subjects,  lost to follow -up in 3 (1.8%)  subjects ; and “other ” in 3 
(1.8%)  subjects .

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE 47 OF 109 
Overall, 135 of the 169 (79.9%) subjects enrolled have experienced TEAEs : 71 of the 83 (85.5%) subjects 
who received SEL -212, and 64 of the 86 (74.4%) subjects who received KRYSTEXXA. Overall, 74 of the 
169 (43.8%) subjects enrolled have experienced a TEAE that was considered by the investigator to be 
related or possibly related t o study drug ( i.e., drug -related) : 41 of the 83 (49.4%) subjects who received 
SEL-212, and 33 of the 86  (38.4%) subjects who received KRYSTEXXA.  
In the study, the following TEAEs were identified as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs): infusion -
related reactions, stomatitis and related terms, gout flares, infections, interstitial lung disease, 
malignancies, renal failure, and clinically significant laboratory tests demonstrating hyperlipidemia, 
worsening of renal function tests, proteinuria, and leuk openia. Subjects with at least 1 TEAE of special 
interest included 24 (27.9%) subjects who received KRYSTEXXA and 33 (39.8%) subjects who received 
SEL-212.  
Overall, most TEAEs have been mild or moderate in severity. Eight (8) of the 83 (9.6%) subjects who  
received SEL -212 experienced a total of 14 severe TEAEs. Four (4) subjects experienced a single severe 
TEAE including anemia, gout, rotator cuff syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT); 2 subjects 
experienced 2 severe TEAEs including gastrointestinal hae morrhage and gout; and pulmonary embolism 
and DVT; and 2 subjects experienced 3 severe TEAEs including: arthralgia, joint swelling, and ligament 
pain; and presyncope and 2 gout attacks. In addition, 2 subjects who received SEL -212 each experienced 
a life -threatening TEAE, both anaphylactic reactions .  
A total of 6 of the 86 (7.0%) subjects who received KRYSTEXXA experienced a total of 6 severe TEAEs. 
Subjects experienced a single severe TEAE including: 2 gout, an anaphylactic reaction, drug 
hypersensitivity , gastroenteritis, and an infusion -related reaction. In addition, 2 subjects who received 
KRYSTEXXA each experienced a life -threatening TEAE  of cerebrovascular accident and hypertensive 
emergency , respectively . There have been no concerning trends in labor atory values, vital signs, or 
physical examination findings (data not shown).  
Twelve (12) of the 169 (7.1%) subjects enrolled have experienced a total of 14 SAEs. Six (6) of the 83 
(7.2%) subjects who received SEL -212 experienced a total of 7 SAEs and 6 of  the 86  (7.0%) subjects who 
received KRYSTEXXA experienced a total of 7 SAEs. Two (2) of the SEL -212 SAEs were  considered related 
or possibly related to SEL -212 and 3 of the KRYSTEXXA SAEs were  considered related or possibly related 
to KRYSTEXXA by the inv estigator.  
No deaths have been reported during the study.  
In summary, the safety profile of SEL-212 in the ongoing Phase  2 clinical trial has not demonstrated any 
unexpected TEAEs.  In the dose ranging Phase 2 Study SEL-212/201, in general, TEAEs were most 
frequently observed after the first treatment cycle and diminished with successive treatment cycles. 
Therefore, the potential risk of TEAEs did not appear to increase with repeated exposure to SEL-212.  
Cohorts 7, 11, 13, and 17  from Phase 2 Study SEL-212/201 represent the dose regimens that will be 
evaluated in the Phase  3 program; and the dose administered in the Phase 2 study SEL -212/202 (SEL-

110.36, 0.15 mg/kg + SEL -037, 0.2 mg/kg) represents the high dose planned in the Phase 3 program. 
Data from these two Phase 2 studies support the doses to be administered in Phase 3 and efficacy data 
from Phase 2 Study SEL -212/201 support monthly dosing with SEL-212.  
7.6.4 Rationale for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The incidence of gout increases a s circulating uric acid levels increase ( Campion 1987 ) and lowering 
circulating urate levels is a primary means of managing gout. The American College of Rheumatology 
recommends lowering urate levels to a target of less than  6 mg/dL at minimum ( Khanna 2012a ) to 
improve the signs and symptoms of gout.  
Based on a proposed indication of treatment of chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy, the 
objectives of this study design are to assess the reduction in sUA in adult patient s treated with SEL-212 
compared to placebo. The proposed primary endpoint is comparison in the percentage  of participants 
treated with two different dose levels of SEL-212 compared to placebo who achieve and maintain 
reduction of sUA <6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time dur ing Treatment Period 6.  
7.6.5 Rationale for Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints were selected based on symptoms of chronic gout as well as quality of life as a 
consequence of chronic gout. Patients with severe, chronic gout are often refractory to o ral therapies 
and often present with visible tophi that cause debilitating pain, corresponding to significantly reduced 
quality of life. Exacerbation of gout (flare) and joint tenderness and swelling impact a patients’ ability to 
maintain physical activity  and functioning and adversely affect  quality of life. Several instruments will be 
used to assess quality of life and will include patient -reported outcomes, provider -reported 
assessments, and generalized assessments of overall quality of life.  
7.6.6 Rationale f or Other Assessments of Clinical Benefit  
Exploratory assessments will be used to characterize the effect of SEL-212 on biomarkers of 
inflammation related to gout and multiomic markers of gout.  
Genome wide association studies have identified multiple genet ic markers in regulating uric acid 
metabolism.  These markers may explain some of the variation observed in the control of serum uric acid 
levels in patients on SEL -212.   
Recombinant uricases are highly immunogenic and formation of anti -drug antibodies can adversely 
affect durability of efficacy . Anti-uricase and anti -pegadricase antibodies will be assessed and correlated 
with response to SEL -212.  
SEL-110 induces durable antigen -specific immune tolerance in preclinical models.  Correlation of the 
mitigation o f anti -drug antibodies with biomarkers related to immune tolerance would support the 
induction of antigen -specific immune tolerance against SEL-037. 
Finally, visualization of the effect of SEL-212 on joint surfaces will use multiple imaging  modalities, 
depending on the investigational site.

7.7 Benefits and Risks  
Chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy is a rare and serious condition associated with 
increased mortality rate and significantly decreased quality of life and for which there are very limited 
treatment options. Data from the Phase 2 study SEL-212/201 provide preliminary clinical evidence 
demonstrating that SEL-212 is a substantial improvement over available therapy:  
• Substantially increased percentage of patients that maintain c ontrol of sUA while on therapy  
• Substantially reduced gout flare rate during therapy  
• Substantially reduced risk of infusion reactions  
• More convenient to and greater compliance by patients because of once monthly therapy  
• Acceptable safety at the dose to be s tudied in this Phase 3 study  
• Potential to re -treat patients after a gap in therapy (> 1 month)  because of the mechanism of 
action of SEL-212 
SEL-212 has the potential to be an unprecedented safe and effective treatment option for patients for 
which other t reatment options are inadequate. The overall balance between benefits and risks appears 
acceptable for the Phase 3 study of SEL-212 in the intended population of patients with chronic gout 
refractory to conventional therapy.

8.3 Patient  Completion and Withdrawal Criteria  
8.3.1 Screen Failures  and Replaced Subjects  
A patient  is considered enrolled in the study at the time of ICF signature. Any patie nt that is screened 
but not dosed will be considered a screen failure and the reason for failure will be documented.  
Any patient that is randomized but not dosed will be replaced and not included in the ITT population, 
and the reason for not being dosed w ill be documented.   
Within the 45-day screening window, out -of-range laboratory tests may be repeated up to 2 times 
before declaring a screen failure  (except for COVID -19 testing  as described in Section 12.1.8.7 ). 
After the 45 -day screening window, patients can be re -screened once.   
8.3.2 Patient  Completion  
A patient  will be considered to have completed the double -blind treatment phase of the study when the 
patient  has completed Day 28 of Treatment Period 6. The patient will be considered to have completed 
the double -blind extension phase of the study when the patient has completed the Safety Follow -up 
visit that occurs 30 days (+ 4 day) after the Treatment Period 12 Day 0 visit . Enrolled patient s who 
prematurely discontinue for any reason before completion of the study will be treated as outlined below 
in Section 8.3.3.1 . 
8.3.3 Enrolled Patient  Withdrawal and Discontinuations  
8.3.3.1  Withdrawal Procedures  
Early termination  from the study occur s when an enrolled patient  withdraws consent  or is lost to follow -
up. The reason for withdrawal will be evaluated and recorded in the case report form (CRF) and source 
documents.  
Patient s may withdraw consent at any time. Reason(s) for withdrawal of consent, failure to return for 
the necessary visits,  or termination from the study  should be documented . All patient s that withdraw

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE 53 OF 109 
early upon termination should have the Early Termination visit assessments completed (i.e., End of 
Study assessments)  (Appendi x A or Appendix C ), if the assessments pose no risk to the patient  and the 
patient  allows such assessments.   
The Investigator should consult with the Sponsor/medical monitor prior to withdrawing study treatment 
from any patient  in the study . Since this is a multiple -dose study, once dosed, patient s generally should 
not be terminated by the Investigator . The patient  should be followed through the end of Treatment 
Period 12, unless the patient  withdraws consent or is lost to follow -up. In situations where continued 
participation in certain aspects of the study pose a risk to the patient , with consultation with the medical 
monitor, the Investigator should discontinue those procedures that pose a risk and should continue to 
collect data and conduct those assessments that do not put the patient  at risk through the end of 
Treatment Period 12. Patient s with compliance issues or major deviations that effect data quality will 
also continue to be followed through the end of Treatment Period 12 collecting as much data on the 
patient  as possible, unless otherwise indicated by the Sponsor.  
8.3.3.2  Patient s Lost to Follow -Up 
For patient s to be considered as lost to follow -up, at least 3 contact attempts must be documented, of 
which the last must be a letter sent by a service that requires a delivery signature record (e.g. , US Postal 
Service certified letter or Federal Express/UPS letter that requires signature of delivery). If the letter is 
undeliverable or no response is received within 7 days , the patient  will be considered terminated due to 
lost to follow -up. Additional efforts, will be implemented to encoura ge overall continued trial 
participation including: 1) weekly phone calls to establish patients overall satisfaction with engagement 
in the trial and participation; 2) use of NSAIDs and/or colchicine as rescue medication for patients with 
breakthrough symp toms; and 3)  access to disease related educational material for implementation of 
life-style/dietary changes related to amelioration of the disease process.

grapefruit juice.  
9.2.3 Other Concomitant Medications  
Patients on medications (e.g., antifungals and/or calcium channel blockers) that do not rely on a 
mechanism of action that is kn own to increase the level or effect of rapamycin ( sirolimus  – Rapamune®) 
are permitted to continue taking these medications prior to and during the study, and will not be noted 
as a protocol deviation.  
9.3 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be administered i n the controlled environment of a clinical research center. Direct 
observation of the administration of the study drug by study staff will ensure compliance. The date and 
time of the start and stop of drug administration and volume infused will be recorded . 
9.4 Randomization and Blinding  
This is one of two replicate randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled, parallel arm  trials to 
determine the safety and efficacy of two different dose levels of SEL -212 compared to placebo . The 
study will randomize approximately 1 20 patients with chronic refractory gout. Approximately 60% of the 
randomized patients will have tophi at Baseline . Patients , stratified as to the presence or absence of 
tophi,  will be randomized  in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio prior to Baseline  to receive one of two dose levels of 
SEL-212 or placebo  every 28 days for approximately 6 months in trials SEL -212/301 and SEL -212/302 . 
The SEL -212 doses will differ as to the SEL -110.36 component. Participants will receive SEL -037 
administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg via intravenous (IV) infusion immediately after receiving SEL -110.36 
at a dose of either 0.1 mg/kg (SEL -212A) or 0.15 mg/kg (SEL -212B) via IV infusion. The placebo will 
consist of normal saline that will be administered in the same way that th e SEL -212 components are 
administered to maintain the integrity of the study blind. Prior to randomization, to ensure balance 
among the treatment groups with regard to the presence or absence of tophi, a stratified randomization 
algorithm will be incorpora ted into the IVR system, based on the presence or absence of prevalent 
tophi. All patient s, Investigators, study personnel, and Sponsor personnel involved in the conduct of the 
study will be blinded to patient treatment assignment, except for a designated unblinded statistician 
who will generate and have access to the randomization codes , a designated unblinded site 
representative (e.g.,  pharmacist ) who will prepare study drug on the day of treatment , an unblinded 
infusion nurse who will be responsible for dosing the patient , a designated unblinded medical monitor 
for assessing the treatment stopping rules, and unblinded drug supply personnel . Prior to study drug 
administration in Treatment Periods 2 through 12, the unblinded medical monitor will determine a

patient’s eligibility for treatment with study drug by evaluating the patient’s sUA level measured from 
the blood sample obtained from Day 21 of the most recently completed treatment period.  The 
unblinded statistician and medical monitor will not otherwis e participate in any study procedures or 
data analysis prior to unblinding of the data.  
Central and site laboratory vendors will also be blinded to treatment assignment.  
Certain post -dose laboratory results  can be unblinding . Therefore, the results of such laboratory tests 
will be communicated only to unblinded personnel.  
Study personnel will endeavor to safeguard the integrity of the study blind to minimize bias in the 
conduct of the study.  
9.4.1 Procedures for Breaking the Blind Prior to Study Completion  
Breaking the blind is expressly forbidden except in the event of a medical emergency where the identity 
of the treatment assignment must be known in order to properly treat the patient. If breaking the blind 
is required because of a medical emergency, the tr eatment identity for the unblinded patient only will 
be revealed by the qualified designee with approval from the Sponsor’s medical monitor or designee.  
In all cases where the code is broken, the Investigator must record the date and reason for code 
breaki ng. The unblinding should be noted in the participant’s CRF.  
9.4.2 Revealing Randomization  
In the absence of a medical emergency, the blinded randomization for this study will not be revealed 
until all data are entered in the database, edits checks are performe d, queries closed, CRFs are signed by 
the Investigator a t each site, and the database is officially locked.

10. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1 Study Drug  
This is a randomized, double -blind study. The designated site representative (e.g.,  pharmacist ) will be 
unblinded to enable preparation of study drug on the day of treatment. The site representative will take 
appropriate steps during study drug preparation to maintain the integrity of the study blind.  Prior to 
study drug administration in Treatment Period s 2 through 12, the unblinded medical monitor will 
determine a patient’s eligibility for treatment with study drug by evaluating the patient’s sUA level 
measured from the blood sample obtained from Day 21 of the prior  treatment period.  
10.1.1  SEL-212 
SEL-212 is c omprised of 2 components: SEL-037 and SEL-110.36 . Refer to Section 9.1 for complete 
descriptions of the components.  
Two dose level s of SEL-212 will be investigated in this study:  
SEL-212A:  
• SEL-110.36:  0.1 mg/kg based on patient’s body weight  
• SEL-037: 0.2 mg/kg based on patient’s body weight  
SEL-212B:  
• SEL-110.36: 0.15 mg/kg based on patient’s body weight  
• SEL-037: 0.2 mg/kg based on patient’s body weight  
10.1.2  Placebo  
Placebo will consist of normal saline. Normal saline will be administered sequentially in the same way 
that the SEL-212 components are administered to maintain the integrity of the study blind.  
10.2 Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
SEL-212 will be supplied in vials in individual cartons with cartons  and vials unassigned to a patient . 
10.3 Study Drug Storage  
Upon receipt of the SEL-037 vials at the clinical site, the vials should be stored in a secured way at 2°C to 
8°C within the primary or secondary box container in order to protect the SEL-037 from long -term light 
exposure.  
Upon receipt of the SEL-110.36  vials at the clinical site, the vials should be stored in a secured way at 2°C 
to 8°C within the primary or secondary box container in order to protect the SEL-110.36  from long -term 
light exposure.  
10.4 Study Drug Preparation  
Doses of SEL-212 are calculated on a mg/kg basis according to a patient’s weight. For Treatment Period 
1, the patient ’s Screening weight will be used for dose preparation. For the remaining treatment

periods, the patient ’s weight at the Day 21 visit from the preceding treatment period will be used for 
dose calculation.  
Detailed procedures and examples of dose calculations  and study drug preparation  are provided in the 
Study Operations Manual.  
10.4.1  SEL-037 Preparation  
Each vial of SEL -037 will be reconstituted with 6.9 mL of  sterile water for injection United States 
Pharmacopeia (USP) or equivalent to a 6 mg/mL solution and then the appropriate volume of 
reconstituted solution will be diluted in 100 mL of room temperature 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, 
USP for administra tion. The detailed reconstitution procedure, including the time for vials to rest 
undisturbed and the number of gentle vial inversions to perform, is provided in the Study Operations 
Manual. The full resultant volume of the SEL -037-normal saline solution ( 100 mL saline + required 
volume of reconstituted SEL -037 + saline bag manufacturing overfill) will be administered in the allotted 
time. The SEL -037-normal saline solution infusion must be completed within 12 hours of the start of vial 
reconstitution. The infusion of SEL -037-normal saline solution must be completed within 6 hours of 
dilution. If not administered immediately, store refrigerated and use within the time specified above.  
SEL-037 should be administered on the same day and as soon as possible af ter reconstitution.  
10.4.2  SEL-110.36  Preparation  
Each vial of SEL -110.36 will be reconstituted with 4.9 mL of sterile water for injection United States 
Pharmacopeia (USP) or equivalent, to a 2 mg/mL suspension before being drawn into appropriately 
sized syringe/ syringes for IV infusion with a syringe pump. The detailed reconstitution procedure, 
including the time for vials to rest undisturbed and the number of gentle vial inversions to perform, is 
provided in the Study Operations Manual. The SEL -110.36 dose must be completely administered within 
12 hours of the start of vial reconstitution. SEL -110.36 should be administered on the same day and as 
soon as possible after reconstitution. If not administered immediately, store refrigerated and use within 
the time spec ified above.  
10.4.3  Placebo Preparation  
Placebo will consist of normal saline. An unblinded designated site representative (e.g.,  pharmacist ) will 
prepare placebo infusions in a manner that maintains the integrity of the study blind.  
10.5 Urate -Lowering Therapy Wash -out 
Chronic refractory gout patients may elect to undergo wash -out of urate -lowering therapy at any point 
during Screening but must begin at least 7 days prior to the first dosing of study drug. Patients must 
continue to remain off ULT for as long as they participate in the clinical study.

10.6 Premedication  
10.6.1  Gout Flares ( Prophylaxis and Treatment)  
All patient s that are expected  to be randomized will be premedicated for gout flare prevention. The 
regimen will begin at least 7 days prior to the first dosing of study drug and continue for as long as the 
patient  is participating in the clinical study.  
Patient s not already taking colchicine  will rece ive colchicine 1.2 mg as a single loading dose followed by 
0.6 mg QD for the remainder of participation in the trial. If the patient cannot tolerate the loading dose 
level of 1.2 mg, then the patient will initiate and maintain colchicine at 0.6 mg per day.  If the patient 
cannot tolerate the loading dose level of 0.6 mg, then the patient will initiate and maintain colchicine at 
0.3 mg per day.  
Patient s with a documented medical reason that describes a contraindication to colchicine will receive 
ibuprofen 60 0 mg TID or an equivalent NSAID unless the patient  has a contraindication to NSAID. At the 
discretion of the Investigator, a proton pump inhibitor may be prescribed with the NSAID as gastric 
prophylaxis. Patient s with documented medical reasons that descri be contraindications to both 
colchicine and NSAIDs will receive no premedication for gout flare.  
Patient s who began receiving a NSAID as gout flare prevention medication due to a contraindication to 
colchicine should continue to receive the NSAID during study participation.  
As gout flares are expected to occur despite preventative premedication, incidents o f gout flare are to 
be recorded as an AE and treated at the discretion of the Investigator to provide adequate patient care.  
10.6.2  Premedication with Antihistamines and Steroids  
All patient s in the study will be pre -medicated with oral antihistamines and steroi ds as follows  for 
prevention of infusion reactions : 
• Prednisone (40 mg) oral  (PO)  approximately 24 ( ± 12) hours prior to dosing  
• Fexofenadine (180 mg) oral (PO) approximately 12 (± 2) hours prior to dosing  
• Fexofenadine (180 mg) oral (PO) approximately 2 (± 1) hours prior to dosing  
• Methylprednisolone (100 mg) (or equivalent) up to 125 mg, depending on patient weight, IV 
approximately 1  (± 0.5) hours prior to dosing  
Refer to Section 12.2.1.5  for guidance on reducing the risk of infusion reactions and for managing 
infusion reactions.  
10.7 Administration  
Before administration of study drug, patients will be premedicated with antihistamines  and steroids as 
described in Section 10.6 . The timing of premedication and study drug administration are presented 
graphically in Appendix E , Appendix F  and Appendix G .

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE 60 OF 109 
Patients will receive treatment with study drug on Day 0 of each tr eatment period for a total of 12 doses 
of study drug.  
All study drugs should be administered through the same IV access. All blood samples should be drawn 
from an alternative venous access.  
The reconstituted  SEL-110.36  will be withdrawn from the vial and dosed via IV infusion with a syringe 
infusion pump  utilizing an appropriately sized syringe . SEL-110.36 will be infused at a rate of 1.5 mL/hr 
for the first 30 minutes, then at a rate adequate to deliver the remaining d ose volume over a period of 
60 minutes concurrently with 125 mL normal saline. If an infusion reaction occurs during the 
administration of SEL -110.36, the infusion may be slowed, or stopped and then restarted at a slower 
rate at the discretion of the Inves tigator. Following the infusion of SEL -110.36, the main IV line must be 
flushed with normal saline prior to the start of the SEL -037 infusion. Refer to the Study Operations 
Manual for instructions regarding infusions for patients with medical history invol ving cardiovascular 
comorbidities.  
SEL-037 infusion will start up to 30 minutes after completion of the SEL-110.36  infusion. SEL-037 will be 
infused via infusion pump over a time period of no less than 120 minutes. If an infusion reaction occurs 
during the  administration of SEL -037, the infusion may be slowed, or stopped and then restarted at a 
slower rate at the discretion of the Investigator . Following the infusion of SEL -037, the main IV line must 
be flushed with normal saline.  
The Investigator is permit ted to modify the infusion parameters (decrease the rate of infusion  or 
interrupt the infusion) if medically warranted in response to an AE. The Investigator will notify the 
unblinded medical monitor  of any changes in infusion parameters.  Detailed instruct ions for modifying 
the infusion parameters are included in the Study Operations Manual.  
If an infusion reaction occurs, Investigators are permitted to use concomitant medications or treatments 
deemed necessary to provide adequate patient care. Investigator s should also utilize the infusion 
reaction lab kit (samples for: chemistry, hematology, coagulation, histamine, serum tryptase, and 
anti-uricase) provided in the Study Operations Manual to collect additional blood specimens. In the case 
of a Grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction occurring during an infusion, the administration of study drug should 
be immediately discontinued, and the affected patient should be treated according to the clinical trial 
site’s protocol for infusion reactions (e.g., monitoring, admini stration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, 
fluids and epinephrine, as clinically indicated). The patient should be withdrawn from subsequent study 
drug treatment.  
10.8 Study Drug Accountability  
Study drug will only be used as directed in the protocol. Study p ersonnel will account for all vials of 
study drugs received, dispensed , and used for each patient , and vials returned. The date and time of 
reconstitution and dilution will be recorded. Used vials should be traceable back to the patient . The 
Investigator is responsible for the study drug accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance.

11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
11.1 Activity Assessment  
11.1.1  Serum Uric Acid A ssessment  
The primary endpoint of this study is the comparison in the percentage  of patient s treated with two 
different dose levels of SEL -212 compared to placebo who achieve and maintain reduction of sUA < 6 
mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Treatment Period 6.  
Serum s amples for measurement of sUA will be collected according to the schedu le described in 
Appendix A  and Appendix C . Methods  used for processing samples and for measurement of sUA levels 
are described in the Study Operations Manual.  
11.1.2  Uricase Activity  
Serum samples for measurement of uricase activity will be collected according to the schedule described 
in Appendix A  and Appendix C . Validated methods will be used for processing samples and for 
measurement of uricase activity as described in the Study  Operations  Manual.  
11.2 Gout Assessment  
11.2.1  Tophus Assessment  
Assessment of tophi will be performed according to the schedule described in Appendix A  and Appendix 
C. 
Baseline photographs of the hands and feet of each patient  will be obtained using a standardized  
method in all patient s (whether or not a prevalent tophus was identified by the Investigator a t Baseline ), 
together with photographs of up to two other representative sites of tophaceous  disease. The baseline 
photographs will be assessed by a Central Reader to prospectively identify sites of tophaceous disease 
present at the start of treatment. The Central Reader will be blinded to patient treatment assignment 
and to the Investigator’s identification (or lack of identification) of a tophus to control for potential bias. 
Up to five tophi in the photographs will be chosen by the Central Reader for mea surement over the  
course of therapy. The Central Reader will assess the photographs for size of each target tophus  using 
the image analysis software . To be considered measurable, tophi  are required to be ≥ 5 mm in the 
longest dimension at Baseline and to have borders distinguishable to the Central  Reader.  Up to two 
tophi (approximately >  10 mm in the longest dimension at Baseline) representative of the patient ’s 
tophus burden but unable to be accurately meas ured (e.g., due to location, shape,  or other factors), may 
also be evaluated at the Central Reader’s discretion. Once the Central Reader completes the assessment 
of photographs from a patient ’s study visit, the Central Reader will not be permitted to chang e the 
evaluation.  
Individual response for measurable  and unmeasured tophi will be assessed by the Central Reader by 
comparing the tophus area  (approximated for unmeasured) to its baseline measurement using 
assessment categories  described in Table 2.

The HAQ -DI will be administered accor ding to the schedule described in Appendix A  and Appendix C . 
The HAQ -DI is an instrument that assesses fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities 
of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both the upper and lower extremities.  Standard 
scoring takes into account the use of aids and devices or assistance from another person. There are 20 
items in 8 categories that represent a comprehensive set of functional activities: dressing, rising, eating, 
walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and  usual activities. The stem of each item assesses a patient’s functional 
ability using their usual equipment during the past week. Each category contains at least 2 specific sub -
category questions. For example, under the category “walking,” patients are as ked about their ability to 
walk outdoors on flat ground and to climb up 5 steps.  The HAQ -DI includes a patient global assessment 
of disease and a visual analog scale for pain assessment.  
11.3.2  Provider Global Assessment of Disease Activity  
The Provider Global As sessment of Disease Activity (PrGA) will be conducted according to the schedule 
described in Appendix A  and Appendix C . The PrGA will be administered to assess the severity of the 
patient’s disease on a scale from 0 (patients feels “very well”) to 100 (pati ent feels “very poor”). Lower 
scores indicate less severe disease.  
11.3.3  Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF -36) 
The SF -36 will be administered according to the schedule described in Appendix A  and Appendix C .  
The SF -36 is a 36 -item scale constructed to survey health status and quality of life ( Ware 1992 ). The SF -
36 assesses 8 health concepts: limitations in physical activities because of health problems; limitations in 
social activities because of physical or emotional problems; limitations in usual role activities bec ause of 
physical health problems; bodily pain; general mental health (psychological distress and well -being); 
limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; vitality (energy and fatigue); and 
general health perceptions. The standard fo rm of the instruments asks for patient s to reply to questions 
according to how they have felt over the previous week.

second test is positive for COVID -19, then the patient will be excluded from enrollment. If the  second 
test is negative for COVID -19, then the patient must be tested a third time at least 24 hours after the 
second test  to confirm the negative result . 
On Study:  
Once a patient is enrolled in the study , the investigational site will manage the patient according to its 
institutional standards and procedures  established for COVID -19. During the study, a  patient presenting 
with both symptoms  (only severe and critical illness  as per definitions below ) of COVID -19 and positive 
COVID -19 test results will be d iscontinued from study treatment . The patient will be permitted to 
resume study visits for continued assessments (but not treatment with SEL -212 or placebo ) according to 
the institutional standards and/or procedures of the investigational site.  
Patients wi th mild -moderate  COVID -19 illness (as per definitions below) will be allowed to  resume study 
visits (on treatment with SEL -212 or placebo ) after resolution of acute symptoms of clinical disease 
(except for loss of smell and taste) and meeting quarantine re quirements  so long as their subsequent 
dose occurs ≤90 days from their prior dosing day as per section 7.4.1.1 . Patients with mild -moderate 
COVID -19 illness can continue non-dosing study visits  as per protocol mandated visit window prior to 
resolution of acute symptoms according to the institutional standards and/or procedures of the 
investigational site.  
Enrolled p atients in the study with mild -moderate  COVID -19 illness can be treated with anti-SARS -CoV-2 
monoclonal antibodies .  These p atients will be allowed to resume study visits (on treatment with SEL - 
212 or placebo) after 2 weeks of receiving monoclonal antibod ies, and confirmation of resolution of 
acute symptoms of clinical disease  (except for loss of smell and taste) , and meeting quarantine 
requirements so long as their subsequent dose occurs ≤90 days from their prior dosing day as per 
section 7.4.1.1.  
Regardl ess of COVID -19 disease severity, enrolled patients in the study who are  treated for COVID -19 
with anti-viral therapy (including R emdesivir ), anti -cytokine therapies (including anti -IL-6 or anti -IL-1 
therapy), or JAK -inhibitors will be discontinued from st udy treatment . These patients  will be permitted

12.1.8.9  Drug Screen  
Urine drug screen will include amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,  cocaine, and opiates.  
12.1.8.10  Pregnancy Screen  
Samples for urine pregnanc y testing (hCG) will be obtained.  
Male patient s of reproductive potential who are having intercourse with female partners of childbearing 
potential must agree to use 2 forms of contraception, 1 of which must be a barrier method, during the 
study and for 4 months  after the last study drug administration. Acceptable barrier methods include a 
condom and diaphragm. Acceptable forms of birth control for female partners of childbearing potential 
are non -hormonal and hormonal intrauterine devices, hormonal birth control pills, hormonal birth 
control patches, hormonal birth control injections, hormonal birth control implants . Spermicide used 
alone is not an acceptable method and must be used with another acceptable form birth control 
method. Abstinence is acceptabl e if consistent with the patient ’s normal lifestyle.  
Female patient s are required to have negative hCG test results throughout the study. If a  female patient  
becomes pregnant  after she begins taking study drug, the procedures in Section 12.2.2.7  should be 
followed.  
In addition, for any reported case of delayed menstrual period (over 1 month between menstruations) 
and for those women with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycles, con firmation of absence of 
pregnancy should occur.  
12.1.8.11  Definition of Childbearing Potential and Acceptable Contraceptive Methods  
A woman is considered of childbearing potential ( i.e., fertile), following menarche and until becoming 
post -menopausal unless permanen tly sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE 70 OF 109 
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for > 24 months without an alternative medical cause. 
A high follicle stimulating hormone  (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. 
However, in the absence of > 24 months of amenorrhea, one confirmatory FSH measurement must b e 
obtained  or documented . 
For female partners of childbearing potential, the following methods of contraception, when used 
consistently and correctly, are considered reliable for participation  of male patients  in the study:  
• Combined (estrogen and progesto gen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, or transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, 
injectable,  or implantable  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal; occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner  and that vasectomized 
partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success)  
• Sexual abstinence (refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire study period; the 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to th e duration of the clinical 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient)  
12.1.9  Premedication Regimen  
Refer to Section 10.6  for procedures about premedication regimens to prevent infusion associated 
reactions and gout flare.  
12.2 Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1  Definition of Adverse Events  
Definitions in this section are in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.   
12.2.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
An A E is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug (i.e., study drug) in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug and does not imply any judgment about causality. An AE can arise with use of any drug or 
medicinal product. A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE that starts or worsens at any time after 
initiation of study drug on Day 0 of Treatment Period 1  until the End of Study Visit ( 30 days after 
completion of the last dose of study drug ).  
Patient s will be considered enrolled in the study upon  signing the IC F. During the Screening Phase (from 
time informed consen t is signed to immediately before dosing) any clinically significant changes in the 
patient ’s health will be recorded in the patient ’s medical history  and will not be considered as AEs . AEs

(and thus SAEs) will be collected from the time the patient  is dos ed (infusion is started) until the end of 
the End of Study Visit.   
12.2.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any AE that occurs irrespective of study treatment assignment, if it satisfies any of these 
criteria:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life-threatening;  
• Require s inpatient hospitalization ≥ 24 hours or prolongs existing hospitalization;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions;  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;   
• Is an important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeo pardize 
the patient or patient  may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
12.2.1.3  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is an AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the A E. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than adverse reactio n, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
12.2.1.4  Unexpected Adverse Events and Unexpected Suspected Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction (an AE where there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the event; suspected drug related) is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the SEL-212 
Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specifi city or severity that has been observed.  
12.2.1.5  Infusion Reactions  / Adverse Events of Special Interest  
A study drug -related AE that occurs within 24 hours after initiation of study drug infusion will be 
assessed as an infusion reaction. An infusion reaction susp ected to be anaphylaxis will be assessed 
according to the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis based on the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) / Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) Symposium 
criteria.  (Sampson 2006 ). 
Infusion reactions will be managed  and treated  as described below . In addition to premedication with 
antihistamines and steroids ( Section 10.6.2 ), the following steps will be implemented in this protocol to 
either reduce the risk of infusion reactions or manage infusion reactions.  
• Patients with prior exposure to uricase therapy will be ineligible  
• Patients with a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions, history of severe atopy, 
angioedema, or previous infusion reactions will be excluded from the trial.

• In case of infusion reaction, sites will perform specific assessments as spec ified in the Study 
Operations Manual.  
• Each patient will be observed for infusion reactions after dosing of study drug in the clinic for 
approximately 4.5 hours from the start of study drug infusion. Patients will be informed about 
the signs or symptoms of infusion reactions and will be instructed to notify the Investigator 
immediately if they believe they are experiencing a reaction.  
• Each patient shall remain for a minimum of 1 hour after the completion of infusion of study drug 
for a period of safety obser vation.  
• All patients will be contacted approximately 24 hours after infusion to determine whether any 
infusion reaction AEs occurred.  
• Patients who experience an infusion reaction will be contacted approximately 24 hours after the 
event as follow -up. 
• Only s ites with immediate capability to appropriately respond to a reaction of this severity will 
be allowed to participate in the trial to reduce the risk to any patient.  
• Infusion Reactions (an AESI) will be reported to Parexel Safety in the same manner as SAEs  using 
the same form but ticking the AESI box rather than the SAE box.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be recorded specifically for occurrences of: gout flares, 
infections, malignancies, viral infections, interstitial lung disease, stomatiti s, infusion -related reactions 
including anaphylaxis, thrombosis (e.g., deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), and the 
following laboratory tests, if deemed clinically significant by the PI: hyperlipidemia, worsening of renal 
function tests, proteinur ia, and leukopenia.  
12.2.2  Recording Adverse Events  
Patient s will be encouraged to spontaneously report any changes in health from the time of signing the 
ICF through completion of the study. Study staff will also inquire about any changes in the patient ’s 
healt h.  
All AEs will be recorded in the source document and the CRF. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) for the 
presence of AEs and for a complete evalua tion of known AEs.   
At minimum for each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the event name/term/description, 
onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), event severity/intensity, relationship to study drug, 
action taken in regards to study  drug, whether the event is an SAE, and whether or not it caused the 
patient to discontinue the study. The event time is only required while the patient  is in the clinic.   
During the Screening Phase (from time informed consent is signed to immediately befo re dosing) any 
clinically significant changes in the patient ’s health will be recorded in the patient ’s medical history and 
will not be considered as AEs.

12.2.2.1  Adverse Event Term/Name/Description  
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of each AE based on signs, symptoms, and/or other 
clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be the AE term used to document the AE/SAE and 
not the individual signs/symptoms.   
12.2.2.2  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the  relationship between study drug and the occurrence of each 
AE. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as 
natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal 
relationship of the event to the study drug will be considered and investigated. The Investigator will also 
consult the SEL-212 Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product Information for marketed products in the 
determination of his/her assessment . 
The Investigator will assess causality as to whether the event is related or not related to study drug 
based on the following definitions:  
• Not Related: If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship to study drug or the AE was 
more likely expla ined by causes other than study drug.  
• Unlikely to be Related: Onset of the event has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug 
administration and although a causal relationship is unlikely, it is biologically plausible.  
• Possibly Related: Onset of th e event has a strong temporal relationship to administration of the 
study drug and a causal relationship is biologically plausible  
• Related: The study drug dosing and AE were closely related in time and the AE may be explained 
by exposure to study product: e.g., known pharmacological effect or recurrence on re -challenge.  
There may be situations, particularly when an SAE has occurred, where the Investigator has minimal 
information to make an assessment in an initial SAE report. However, it is very important that the 
Investigator always make s an assessment of causality for every SAE prior to transmission of the SAE 
report. The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, 
amending the SAE report accordingly. Any assess ment of causality made by the Investigator should also 
be documented in the patient ’s source medical record.  
12.2.2.3  Adverse Event Intensity/Severity Grading  
AEs will be classified according to the Rheumatology Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0 ( Woodworth 
2007 ).  
• Grade 1 (mild): AE that is usually transient of short duration; or involves mild or minor 
symptoms which are of marginal clinical relevance; or is asymptomatic consisting of clinical or 
diagnostic observations alone; no intervention or only minimal treatment with non -prescription 
intervention was required. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living.  
• Grade 2 (moderate): AE that is usually alleviated with additional s pecific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living (e.g., shopping, laundry, 
 PHASE 3 STUDY : SEL-212/301  
VERSION : 6.1   EFFECTIVE DATE

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE 74 OF 109 
transportation, or ability to conduct finances), causing discomfort but poses no significant or 
permanent risk or harm to the patient . 
• Grade 3 (severe): AE that is medically significant/important but not life -threatening; may require 
brief hospitalization to prevent the event from worsening; interrupts usual activities of daily 
living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may requir e intensive therapeutic intervention.  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): An AE, and/or its immediate sequelae, which is associated with an 
imminent risk of death or which is associated with physical or mental disabilities that affect or 
limit the ability of a per son to perform activities of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, 
etc.); disability may be persistent or result in significant disability, incapacity or limitation of self -
care activities.  
For an assessment of anaphylaxis, the clinical criteria fo r the diagnosis of anaphylaxis will be based on 
the N IAID/FAAN Symposium criteria  (Sampson 2006 ).  
12.2.2.4  Assessment of Outcome  
The result or conclusion of the AE will be assessed and recorded by the Investigator as:  
• Fatal  
• Not reco vered/not resolved (the AE has not improved , or patient  has not recuperated).  
• Recovered/resolved (the AE has improved , or patient  has recuperated)  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae (recuperated but retained pathological conditions resulting 
from the AE)  
• Recovering/resolving (the patient  is improving but the AE has not yet resolved)  
• Unknown (not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused)  
12.2.2.5  Action Taken with Study Drug 
The action taken regarding  study drug will be assessed by the investigator as:  
• Dose not changed (dose completed)  
• Dose interrupted (IV infusion was temporally modified by temporarily stopping the infusion; 
slowing of the rate of infusion should also be classified as interrupted)  
• Drug withdrawn (IV infusion was modified through termination of the infusion)  
A response option for increasing or decreasing the dose is not an available course of action in this study.  
12.2.2.6  Laboratory and Diagnostic Abnormalities as Adverse Events  
Clinically sign ificant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal diagnostic assessments (e.g., ECGs, 
vital signs) that are detected in dosed patient s or that significantly worsen relative to baseline in dosed 
patient s will be reported as AEs. Clinical significan ce is based on the I nvestigator ’s judgment but will 
typically include findings that results in study withdrawal, result in active management of the patient , or 
are associated with clinical signs and symptoms. Since the study requires patient s with elevated or 
abnormal sUA levels, abnormal sUA levels will typically not be an AE unless judged by the Investigator as 
being more severe than expected for the patient .

12.2.2.7  Pregnancy  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, any pregnancy complication or electiv e termination 
of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE and followed. The outcome of all 
pregnancies must be followed up and documented even if the patient  is no longer a study patient . 
The Investigator, or his/her designee, will collect  pregnancy information on every female who becomes 
pregnant while enrolled in this study and on every female partner of a male patient  who becomes 
pregnant while the male partner is enrolled in this study. The Investigator will report to the Sponsor or 
Sponsor’s designee within 24 hours of learning of a patient ’s or female partner of a patient ’s pregnancy. 
In the case of a female partner of a male participant enrolled in the study becoming pregnant while the 
male patient is enrolled in this study, a separate pregnancy partner informed consent form will be 
completed by the patient’s partner. The patient  or fe male partner of a patient  must also be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be 
forwarded to the Sponsor or Sponsor Designee, as appropriate. Follow -up on the child will be to the first 
well-child visit. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
A spontaneous abortion  or congenital abnormalities/birth defects will be considered SAEs and will be 
reported as such. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy and is 
considered reasonably related to the study drug by the Investigator, will be reported to the Sponsor.  
12.2.3  Reporting Adverse Events  
12.2.3.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which AEs must be reported is from the time the patient  is dosed until the 30 (± 
1) days after the last infusion of study drug.  During the Screening Phase (from time informed consent is 
signed up to the time of dosing) any clinically significant changes in the patient ’s health will be recorded 
in the patient ’s medical history  and will not be considered as AEs .  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study patient s. However, if the 
Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient  has been discharged fr om 
the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study drug, the Investigator should 
promptly notify the Sponsor.  
12.2.3.2  SAE Reporting Procedures  
On discovery, all SAEs should be immediately reported (latest within 24 hours of knowledge of t he 
event) to PAREXEL Safety Services by:  
Completing the SAE report form and faxing the documents to PAREXEL Safety Services, using the 
appropriate regional PAREXEL SAE fax numbers below:  
                                                                             NA (Billerica): +1 781 434 5957

In the event that the site is unable to complete the SAE form to report the event within 24 hours of their 
knowledge of the event, the investigators ma y report the SAE over the telephone via the SAE answering 
service, and then provide the completed SAE form via fax or email . If questions arise regarding the 
reporting procedures or the specifics of the reporting of an event, sites may call utilizing the f ollowing 
numbers:  
                                                                         NA (Billerica): +1 781 434 5010  
The Investigator will complete the SAE form and provide all case information available at the time of the 
initial report. The investi gator must include the following mandatory case information:  
1. The patient  identification number  
2. The event description  
3. The seriousness criteria  
4. The Investigator’s causality assessment  
The reporting Investigator must send the written and signed SAE report by facsimile or email, within 24 
hours of observing, notification of, or learning of the SAE to PAREXEL Safety Services  as described above. 
Follow -up information regarding an SAE and the supporting da ta, including laboratory findings and 
discharge summaries, should be sent by facsimile or email to PAREXEL Safety Services within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, the Investigator w ill not wait to 
receive additional information before completing as much of the form as possible and notifying the 
safety group. The form will be updated when additional information is received. The Investigator will 
always provide at minimum: 1) AE term o r event name/description, 2)  patient  identifier, 3) an 
assessment of causality ( Section 12.2.2.2 ).  
12.2.3.3  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
The Sponsor or Sponsor representative will report fatal or life -threatening SAEs that are unexpected 
suspected adverse reactions to the relevant regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days, and non -fatal 
or life -threatening SAEs that are unexpected suspect ed adverse reactions within 15 calendar days as 
Investigational New Drug (IND) Safety Reports, in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. Prompt notification of 
SAEs by the Investigator to the appropriate project contact for SAE receipt is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other patient s are met.

12.2.3.4  Reporting Safety Information to the IRB /IEC   
The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the applicable 
local regulatory re quirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) /Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC). 
All Investigators involved in studies with this drug will receive a copy of each IND Safety Report. When 
an Investigator receives an IND  Safety Report or other safety information (e.g.,  revised Clinical 
Investigator’s Brochure/Investigator’s Brochure), the responsible person according to local requirements 
is required to promptly notify his or her IRB /IEC. 
12.2.4  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is required to proactively follow each patient  and provide further information regarding  
AEs and SAEs. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until 30 (+4) days after the last dose of study drug, 
resolution  of the event , until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the 
patient  is lost to follow -up, whichever occurs earlier . Once resolved, the appropriate CRF entries and 
event reporting forms will be updated, as appropriate.  
All AEs an d SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits/contacts. The Investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation 
with other health care professionals.  
The Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee may request that the Investigator perfo rm or arrange for the 
conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The Investigator is obligated to assist. If a patient  dies during 
participation in the study or du ring a recognized follow -up period, the Sponsor will be provided with a 
copy of any post -mortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE forms, with all changes 
signed and dated by the  Investigator. This information will also be entered into the CRF.

13. STATISTICS  
Details of the statistical methods outlined in the protocol for this study, including the hierarchical 
ordering of the secondary endpoints, will be documented in a Statistical A nalysis Plan (SAP), which will 
be finalized prior to database lock. The SAP may add additional exploratory analyses; modifications to 
the planned analyses will be identified as such in the final SAP.  
13.1 Sample Size Determination  
The primary efficacy criterion in this study is defined as the percentage  of the patient s who achieve and 
maintain reduction of sUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Treatment Period 6  by Day 28 .  
The sample size estimation is based on the main  estimand for the primary efficacy criterion  from  version 
5.0 of the protocol . This estimand consider ed all patients who discontinue study treatment due to lack 
of efficacy (e .g., meeting stopping rule) , due to treatment -related  or non -treatment related  AE as 
treatment failures , as well as initiating  prohibited medication that lowers sUA, withdrawal of consent or 
lost to follow up for reasons other than COVID -19. 
Based on the results in the Phase 2 study (SEL-212/201) with SEL -212, the responder rate in all 
randomized and dosed patients is assumed to be 45% in SEL -212. For placebo,  a responder rate of 5% is 
assumed. Considering a randomization ratio of 1:1:1 for SEL -212A and SEL -212B against placebo, a 
statistical power of 90%, a two-sided alpha -level of 2.5% and using the Chi -square test with continuity 
correction for the 2 pairwise comparisons of each SEL -212 dose group against placebo, 32:32:32 
randomized and dosed patients will be required for each treatment group. Considering the potential 
that some randomized patients will terminate the study early (approx. 8%), the number of the patients 
required to be randomized and dosed  in total is 105 (i.e., 35:35:35) to demonstrate efficacy. 
Randomized but not treated subjects will be re placed. For the sample size estimation, the Chi-square 
test is used instead of the Mantel -Haenszel test, although the randomization will be stratified for tophus 
presence (yes/no), as there is no valid assumption of the distribution of this stratification variable within 
the eligible patient population.  
From an amendment in version 6.0 of the protocol , the main estimand for the primary efficacy criterion  
was updated to include patients who presen t a positive COVID -19 test along with severe or critical 
sympt oms  of COVID -19, and patients who missed all assessments of sUA during Treatment Period 6 , as 
treatment failures. As th ese are expected to be  unrelated to the treatment then assuming  that the 
number of additional treatment failures  to each arm would be roughly equal, the difference in  response 
rates can still be assumed  to be 40% , unless the treatment failure rate due to positive COVID -19 tests 
along with severe of critical symptoms of COVID -19 is sufficiently high that a difference  of 40% cannot 
be observed (I.e. the treatment failure rate in the active arms is >60%, so even if the responder rate for 
the placebo group is 0%, a difference of 40% cannot be observed) .  
To mitigate this risk, a n additional 15 patients have been added to  the study sample size to account for 
potential treatment discontinuations that may occur due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic as a result 
of the emergence of COVID -19 variants which were not accounted for in the sample size calculations

resulting in appro ximately 120 patients (i.e., 40:40:40) to be randomized and dosed to demonstrate 
efficacy.  
Sample size calculations were performed with the software package nQuery 8, Version 8.5.0.0.  
13.2 Analysis Populations  
13.2.1  Screened / Randomized Set  
The Screened Set will include all patient s who signed an informed consent. The Randomized Set will 
include all patient s randomized  and will be used for the presentation of patients in all patient listings . 
Randomized but not treated subjects will be replac ed. 
13.2.2  Safety Set (SS)  
The Safety Set will include all patient s who were administered a ny amount of study drug . Patient s will 
be analyzed according to treatment received.  The SS will be used for all analyses of safety endpoints . 
13.2.3  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Set  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Set will include all randomized  and dosed patients. Replaced subjects will not 
be included in the ITT. Patients will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  The ITT will be used 
as primary population for analyses of efficacy e ndpoints.  
13.2.4  Modified ITT  
The modified ITT will include all randomized patient s who were dose d, except those who discontinue 
treatment due to a COVID -19 infection as defined in section 12.1.8. 7 or do not  have at least 2 sUA 
measurements 7 days apart in TP6 due to a/multiple missed visits due to a COVID -19 infection or 
subsequent complications as defined in section 12.1.8.7 . Patient s will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment.   
13.2.5  Per Protocol Set  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include all patient s who were administered at least one complete dose of 
study drug , who have at least one post -baseline assessment of sUA, who have sufficient data to assess 
the primary efficacy endpoint, and who have no major Protocol deviations affecting the primary efficacy 
assessments. Patient s will be analyzed according to randomized treatment. The PPS will be defined for 
the double -blind  treatment phase of the study only. Criteria for exclusion from the PPS will be provided 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
13.2.6  All randomized  Set

All protocol deviations related to study inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the trial, patient  
management, dosing, and sampling procedures or patient  assessment will be listed. The list of protocol 
deviations will be reviewed by the Sponsor, the p rincipal investigator  and the study statistician and 
finalized before database lock.  
13.4 Efficacy Analyses  
Only efficacy endpoints of the double -blind treatment phase will be tested in a confirmatory way. 
Estimands are defined for the confirmatory analysis of efficacy in the double -blind treatment period.  
Most of the efficacy endpoints from the double -blind treatment period will be assessed during the 
double -blind extension period, also. However, only descriptive summaries and comparisons will be 
provided for the extension period.  
13.4.1  Primary Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as:  
• Percentage of patient s on SEL-212 versus placebo who achieve and maintain reduction of sUA < 
6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Treatment Period 6  by Day 28  
The main estimand for the primary efficacy endpoint is defined as follows:  
• Targeted population: Of all patients with gout refractory to conventional treatment defined by 
the study inclusion / exclusion criteria, the analysis population will include patients who were 
randomized to study treatment and who were dosed (ITT population).  
• Variable: Binary variable indicating the treatment response  status,  whereby a responder is 
defined as a patient who has sUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Treatment 
Period 6. 
• Population -level summary: Difference in the percentage of treatment responders of each 
SEL-212 treatment group versus placebo.  
• Intercurrent events:  
o Intercurrent events which lead to a discontinuation of study treatment due to lack 
of efficacy  (includes meeting the stopping criteria)  will be defined as treatment 
failures according to the composite strategy . 
o Premature stopping of study treatment due to  treatment -related or 
non-treatment -related AE, with the exception of a positive COVID -19 test result 
along with severe or critical symptoms of COVID -19 will be defined as treatment 
failures according to the composite strategy . 
o Premature stopping of study treatment  due to a positive COVID -19 test result along 
with severe or critical symptoms  of COVID -19 will be defined as treatment failures 
according to the composite strategy . 
o Death  will be considered as treatment failures according to the composite strategy .

o Use of prohibited medication that lower sUA levels  will be considered as treatment 
failures according to the composite strategy . 
o All other intercurrent events (e.g. use of prohibited medication that do not lower 
sUA levels but are classified as a major protocol deviation ) will be treated using the 
treatment policy strategy i.e. the assess ment of the sUA in TP6 up to Day 28 will be 
used . 
Further estimands of interest for the primary efficacy will be provided in the SAP.  
Frequency table of the treatment responders for the main primary efficacy estimand and further 
estimands of interest will be provided by treatment group , and the difference between each SEL -212 
treatment group and placebo will be presented together with 97.5% confidence intervals.  
The statistical testing of each SEL -212 treatment group versus placebo in all estimands of prima ry 
efficacy will be performed using the Mantel -Haenszel (MH) estimate and test for common risk difference 
considering the randomization stratum of tophus presence (yes/no) with a two -sided type 1 error rate α 
= 2.5% to adjust for the two comparisons agains t placebo. Only the test results of the main estimand will 
be considered as confirmatory.  
 
All above described analyses will be repeated on the mITT , all randomised  and on the PP population as a 
supportive analys is. 
The sUA time curve with assessments at Day 0 pre -treatment (0 h), Day 0 post -treatment (4.5 h), Day 7, 
Day 14, Day 21, and Day 28 will be used to estimate the proportion of time that the sUA level is  below 6 
mg/dL. Based on the serum samples collected during Treatment Period  6, an  estimate of the time with 
sUA < 6 mg/dL by Day 28 can be determined by connecting each two  neighboring data points with a 
straight line. If the sUA time curve goes above 6 mg/dL the  linear interpolation method will be used to 
estimate the point in time at which the sUA time  curve intercepts the line between the last sUA value < 
6 mg/dL and the first value ≥ 6 mg/dL.  The proportion of time that the sUA level is < 6 mg/dL will be 
comput ed by taking the ratio between the time during which the sUA level remains < 6 mg/dL (if 
necessary, using the linear interpolation method) and the entire time interval within Treatment Period 6 
by Day 28, or the last available assessment before Day 28. Act ual times will be plotted on the time 
curve, but only the interpolation of actual times up to Day 28 will be used. If a point at Day 28 is not 
available on the curve (possibly due to an extension of TP6 for reasons such as presenting mild -
moderate COVID -19 symptoms), then the next available assessment between Day 28 and up to, and 
including Day 0, pre -treatment (0 h) in Treatment Period 7 will be used to interpolate the curve up to 
Day 28. This can include the use of unscheduled sUA assessments. If there ar e no such assessments 
available, but the use of unscheduled assessments allows the extension of the time curve from the last 
scheduled assessment prior to Day 28 then these can also be used. If only 2 or fewer assessments are 
available (allowing for the us e of assessments after Day 28 up to, and including Day 0, pre -treatment (0 
h) of Treatment Period 7, and further unscheduled assessments prior to Day 28), and the first and last

attended assessments are less than 7 actual days apart, then the response eval uation of  Treatment 
Period 6 will be missing.  Otherwise,  the response evaluation will be derived from the available data 
points.  
The proportion of time that the sUA level is < 6 mg/dL, i.e., percentage of non -hyperuricemic time, will 
be computed by taking the ratio between the time during which the sUA level remains < 6 mg/dL (if 
necessary, using the linear interpolation method) and the entire time interval within Treatment Period 6  
by Day 28  (or last available assessment prior to Day 28 if no assessments a re available from Day 28 up 
to, and including Day 0, pre -treatment (0 h) in Treatment Period 7) . 
For a patient  who has completed Treatment Period 6 to be considered a responder, the proportion of 
time that the sUA level is < 6 mg/dL (i.e., percentage of no nhyperuricemic time) during Treatment 
Period 6 by Day 28 must be at least 80%.  
Frequency table of the percentage of responder in Treatment Period 6 (patient s who achieve and 
maintain reduction of sUA  < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time  in Treatment Period 6 ) will be provided 
by treatment group. Additionally, a summary table with the total time a patient  has sUA values < 6 
mg/dL in Treatment Period 6  will be provided by treatment group.  
Summary table of  the actual values and change from baseline for sUA results will be provided for each 
scheduled sampling time point by treatment group.  
Additionally, mean sUA level, reduction in mean sUA and percent reduction in mean sUA from baseline 
during Treatment Period 6 will be presented by treatment group.  
• Mean sUA level is defined as the area under the sUA time curve (computed using the linear 
trapezoidal rule during Treatment Period 6) divided by the corresponding time interval.   
• Reduction in mean sUA is compute d by subtracting baseline sUA level from mean sUA during 
Treatment Period 6.  
• Percent reduction in the mean sUA from baseline is computed as the mean sUA level during 
Treatment Period 6 minus baseline sUA level divided by baseline sUA level multiplied by 1 00%. 
13.4.2  Key Secondary Efficacy  
Hierarchical testing of key efficacy:  
If the superiority of both (one) SEL -212 treatment group(s) against placebo for the main estimand of the 
primary efficacy is shown with a p -value ≤ 0.025, the hierarchical testing approach will continue to the 
testing of the main estimands of the key secondary efficacy comparing pairwise both (one) SEL -212 
treatments against placebo. Only the main estimands of the key secondary efficacy will be tested in the 
successive order of the key secon dary efficacy endpoints listed below.  The test result of the nth key 
secondary efficacy estimand will be considered as confirmatory if the p -value of the two -sided test of 
the previous estimand resulted in a value less or equal 0.025.

17. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING  
17.1 Data Management  
17.1.1  Case Report Forms  
Data for this study will be recorded via an EDC system  using eCRFs. It will be transcribed by the site from 
the paper source documents onto the eCRF.  
The information collected on eCRFs must be identical to the corresponding information appearing in 
original source documents. There are no exceptions to this ru le. In general, source documentation will 
be found in a chart maintained by qualified medical personnel in a hospital, clinic, or physician’s office. 
(The eCRF is not considered as source data for this trial).  
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross check of the eCRFs against 
the Investigator’s records by the study monitor (source document verification), and the maintenance of 
a drug dispensing log by the Investigator.  
As a matter of regulations, the Investigator is r esponsible for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical 
and laboratory data entered onto eCRFs. Prior to submission, each completed eCRF must be reviewed 
for accuracy by the Investigator, corrected as necessary, and then approved and e -signed. The 
Investigator’s e -signature serves to attest that the information contained on the eCRFs has been 
reviewed by the Investigator and is true and accurate.  
The eCRFs should be completed by the Investigator or a qualified designee from the site as soon as the 
data  are available. Instructions for the completion of eCRFs will be provided.  
The eCRFs will be considered complete when all missing, incorrect, and/or inconsistent data have been 
accounted for.  
17.1.2  Retention of Records  
An Investigator must maintain adequate records to include the disposition of the study drug (s) and 
adequate and accurate source documentation that record all observations and other data pertinent to 
the investigation on each patient in the study. These rec ords are to include the case report forms (CRFs), 
source documentation, and supporting data, including, for example, signed and dated informed consent 
forms and medical records (including progress notes by the physician and/or other qualified medical 
perso nnel, the patient’s hospital and clinic chart[s], and the nurses’ notes).  
The FDA (21 CFR §312.62[c]) states that the Investigator shall retain the required records:  
a. For a period of 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the dru g for 
the indication for which it is being investigated; or  
b. If no application is to be filed or if the marketing application is not approved for such indication, 
until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA is notified.

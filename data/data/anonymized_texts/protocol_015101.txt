Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. SYNOPSIS 
Study Title:  
 A randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging, placebo -controlled Phase  2a evaluation of 
the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PLN -74809 in participants with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (INTEGRIS -IPF) 
Study Number:  PLN -74809 -IPF-202 
Study Phase:   2a 
Objectives:  Primary:   
• Assessment of the safety and tolerability of PLN -74809  
Secondary:  
• Assessment of pharmacokinetics (PK) of PLN -74809  
Exploratory:  
   
   
  
  
Study Design:  This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, 4 -part, randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging, 
placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of once -daily 
(QD) treatment with PLN -74809 in participants with idiopathic pul monary fibrosis 
(IPF).  
Each study part consists of an up to 28 -day screening period, a 4 -week (Part A), 
12-week (Parts B and C), or at least 24 -week (Part D) treatment period, and a 2 -week 
(±3 days)  post-treatment follow -up period.  Part A enrollment has b een completed, so 
is not further described herein; no further participants will be enrolled or treated in this 
part of the study. Part B enrollment has been completed; no further participants will be 
enrolled or treated in this part of the study.  Part C en rollment was initiated following 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of the clinical data supporting the 
evaluation of 40 mg dosing. The DSMB recommended continuation of Study 
PLN -74809 -IPF-202 to evaluate doses of 80 mg and 160 mg without modificat ion. 
Part D enrollment will initiate following DSMB review of the 80 mg and 160 mg 
clinical data from Part C. The dose level of Part D is supported by the clinical data 
from study  and the duration is supported by the chronic toxicology 
data.  
Potential participants who provide written informed consent will be screened for study 
eligibility up to 28 days before administration of the first dose of study drug.  
In Parts B, C and D, eligible participants will be randomized on Day 1 (Visit 2). 
Rando mization will be stratified by use of standard of care (SoC) IPF therapy 
(pirfenidone or nintedanib) (SoC use; yes or no).  
In Part B, 29 eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio (active:placebo) and 
treated for 12 weeks.  
In Part C, approximatel y 56 eligible participants will be randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio 
(80 mg PLN -74809:160 mg PLN -74809:placebo) and treated for 12 weeks in parallel 
treatment groups.  
In Part D, an additional PLN -74809 dose of 320 mg is planned for evaluation based on 
the follow ing criteria:  
 Part C has been completely enrolled (i.e., 56 participants have been randomized  

Protocol PLN- 74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 3  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Pending favorable review by the DSMB of:  
o All available safety and PK data from this study (Part C)  
o Safety and PK data from study , an ongoing Phase 1  
study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 
PLN -74809 at multiple doses ranging from 80 to 320 mg in healthy 
participants, as described in the Investigator’s Brochure   
In Part D, approximately 28 eligible participants will be rando mized in a 3:1 ratio 
(320 mg PLN -74809:placebo) on  Day 1 (Visit 2). Randomization will be stratified by 
use of SoC IPF therapy (pirfenidone or nintedanib) (SoC use; yes or no). Study 
treatment will be administered for at least 24 weeks. Treatment will con tinue for all 
participants in Part D until the last participant enrolled in Part D reaches Week 24. 
Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 
12 weeks (Parts  B and C) or at least 24 weeks (Part D) of treatment will b e asked to 
remain in the study to complete all remaining assessments; if this is not feasible, they 
will be asked to return to the clinic for an Early Termination (ET) visit for follow -up 
evaluations.  
The DSMB will assess participant safety at predetermine d intervals during the study, 
including prior to  initiating Part D and following the enrollment of the last participant 
in Part D.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. 1 INTRODUCTION 
Pliant Therapeutics Inc. (Pliant) is developing PLN-7 4809 for the treatment of idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).  
IPF is a rare condition, usually of the elderly, characterized by dyspnea and progressive loss 
of lung function leading to death, with median survival of 3.8  years after diagnosis based on 
2014 data in the United States (US). The hallmark honeycomb appearance of IPF on 
high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) is the result of extensive fibrosis 
. Although not completely understood, IPF has been proposed 
to stem from ongoing microinjury to alveolar epithelial cells. Injured epithelium results in 
upregulation of profibrotic factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF- β), which 
promote fibroblast recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation into fibrogenic 
myofibroblasts . As the disease progresses, 
actively proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts organize into fibroblastic foci and 
produce excessive fibrillar collagen that results in scarring of the lung which, in turn, leads to 
distortion of the tissue architecture and loss of function . 
As has also been indicated to be the case for other fibrotic conditions, signaling mediated by 
αv integrins is central to the control of fibrosis in the lungs. Specific roles proposed for α vβ6 
in epithelial cells and α vβ1 in myofibroblasts for induction of fibrosis are summarized in the 
Investigator’s Brochure for PLN -74809. 
PLN- 74809 is a small molecule and a selective dual inhibitor of α vβ6 and α vβ1 integrins 
(50% inhibitory concentration [IC 50] , respectively). Additionally, 
integrin-ligand binding assays have demonstrated that PLN- 74809 is highly selective for α vβ6 
and α vβ1 over other integrin receptors, including those leukocyte-expressed integrins where 
therapeutic inhibition has previously been associated with significant toxicities (e.g., 
vedolizumab [ 47 inhibitor; increased risk of infections, potential risk of progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); ] and 
natalizumab [ 41 and 47 inhibitor; increased risk of PML;  
]). PLN-74809 reduced collagen synthesis in mice with bleomycin-induced lung 
injury, a commonly used experimental model for IPF ( ). In ex vivo human 
IPF lung tissue (precision cut lung slices), treatment with PLN-74809 significantly decreased 
collagen type 11 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels after a 3-day 
incubation period, providing an indication of antifibrotic activity in IPF. Mice completely 
deficient for α vβ6 function live a normal lifespan ( ), suggesting that even 
full inhibition of such integrins is well tolerated.  
1.1 Summary of Clinical Development 
PLN-7 4809 is currently being investigated for the treatment of IPF and PSC.  
Seven Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy participants have completed clinical conduct 
(Including Part 1 of Study ), with safety data, pharmacokinetic (PK) data, 
and preliminary pharmacodynamic ( PD) data available.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. 1.2 Study Rationale for PLN-74809 -IPF-202 
PLN- 74809 is a selective, small molecule antagonist of integrins α vβ6 and α vβ1, with 
antifibrotic activity. PLN- 74809 prevents α vβ6 and α vβ1 from binding to the 
arginine-glycine-aspartate sequence of the latency associated peptide of the TGF- β precursor 
protein, thereby blocking the release of the activated form of TGF- β1 and preventing binding 
to its receptors and activation of pathways relevant to fibrogenesis. PLN-74809 was 
demonstrated to be a potent and selective inhibitor of α vβ6 and α vβ1 integrins (human and 
murine) exhibiting geometric mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of  and 
 against the human receptors, respectively. 
Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) generated from IPF patient lungs collected during transplant 
were used to evaluate the ability of PLN-74809 to block TGF- β activation and collagen gene 
expression in fibrotic human lung tissue ex vivo. Following 7 days incubation with 
PLN-74809 ( ), collagen gene expression and SMAD2 phosphorylation (a 
marker of TGF- β signaling) in IPF patient PCLS were significantly reduced by 
approximately . Further studies with bleomycin-injured mouse PCLS also showed 
significant reductions in collagen gene expression observed at concentrations of PLN-74809 
as low as .  
In vivo efficacy studies of PLN-74809 were performed using the bleomycin mouse model of 
pulmonary fibrosis. In a prophylactic treatment study (PLN -74809  administered orally or via 
minipump from  post -bleomycin challenge), PLN -74809 significantly decreased 
Ashcroft score, total hydroxyproline levels in lung tissue, and phosphorylation of  in 
lung tissue, confirming inhibition of collagen d eposition and TGF - signaling.   Similar 
effects were observed with therapeutic treatment with PLN -74809 in the bleomycin model 
(oral administration from  days post -bleomycin challenge). Lung hydroxyproline 
levels were significantly reduced and morph ometric analysis of lung tissue showed a dose -
dependent and significant reduction in interstitial fibrillar collagen deposition in mice treated 
with PLN -74809.  
The main purpose of the current study is to confirm that PLN-74809 is well tolerated by 
participants with IPF, whether as monotherapy or as an add-on to standard of care (SoC), and 
that the drug concentrations are similar to those previously found in healthy participants.   
 
 
 
  
 
Part D of the study will evaluate approximately 28 participants at the 320 mg dose for at least 
24 weeks to further characterize the safety profile of PLN-74809.  In Part D, ongoing safety 
and  assessments will continue until the last participant reaches 24 weeks of the study; 
therefore, safety and  assessments may extend to 48 weeks in participants randomized 
earlier in the study.

* Treatment will continue for all participants in Part D until the last participant enrolled in Part D reaches 
Week 24. All participants will complete visits every 8 weeks after the Week 24 visit until such time as the last 
participant enrolled has completed the Week 24 visit. At this time, all participants will be contacted to return 
and complete the Final On-Treatment Visit. All participants will have a Week 26 visit, which will be considered 
the End of Treatment Visit for the last participant to complete the Week 24 Visit.  
  
Potential participants who provide written informed consent will be screened for study 
eligibility up to 28 days before administration of the first dose of study drug.  
In Parts B, C and D, eligible participants will be randomized on Day 1 (Visit 2). 
Randomization will be stratified by use of SoC IPF therapy with pirfenidone or nintedanib 
(SoC use; yes or no). 
In Part B, 29 eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio (active:placebo) and treated 
for 12 weeks. 
In Part C, approximately 56 eligible participants will be randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio (80 mg 
PLN-74809:160 mg PLN-74809:placebo) and treated for 12 weeks in parallel treatment 
groups.  
In Part D, an additional PLN-74809 dose of 320 mg is planned for evaluation based on the 
following criteria:  
• Part C has been completely enrolled (ie, 56 participants have been randomized) 
• Pending favorable review by the DSMB of: 
- All available safety and PK data from this study (Part C) 
- Safety and PK data from study

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. In Part D, approximately 28 eligible participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio (320 mg 
PLN-74809:placebo) on  Day 1 (Visit 2). Randomization will be stratified by use of SoC IPF 
therapy (pirfenidone or nintedanib) (SoC use; yes or no). Study treatment will be 
administered for at least 24 weeks. Treatment will continue for all participants in Part D until 
the last participant enrolled in Part D reaches Week 24. 
In Parts B and C, study drug will be administered at the investigational site on Day 1 and at 
Weeks 4 and 12. In Part D, study drug will be administered at the investigational site on 
Day 1 and at Weeks 4, 12, and 24. Participants will self-administer the study drug on an 
outpatient basis on all other days. In Parts B and C, participants will return to the study site 
for on-treatment evaluations on Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (see Schedule of Events 
in Appe
ndix 1 ).  
 
In Part D, participants will return to the study site for on-treatment evaluations on Day 1 and 
at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 20, 24, 26, and every 8 weeks after Week 24 until the last participant 
enrolled in Part D has completed this Week 24 visit. At this time, all participants will be 
contacted to return and complete the Final On-Treatment Visit (see Schedule of Events in 
Appendix 2 ). Blood and urine specimens for safety laboratory assessments will be collected 
after at least an 8-hour fast. A final study visit will be conducted 2 weeks ± 3 days after the 
last dose of study drug (Week 14 ± 3 days for Parts B and C; 2 weeks after the final 
On-Treatment Visit [± 3 days] for Part D), when participants will undergo a final  
measurement, as well as follow-up end of study (EoS) evaluations.  
Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 12 weeks 
(Parts B and C) or at least 24 weeks (Part D) of treatment will be asked to remain in the study 
to complete all remaining assessments; if this is not feasible, they will be asked to return to 
the clinic for an Early Termination (ET) visit for follow-up evaluations. 
 measurements will be obtained via spirometry and will be performed using 
study-standardized equipment and according to international guidelines (American Thoracic 
Society [ATS]/ European Respiratory Society [ERS]/ Japanese Respiratory Society [JRS]/ 
Latin American Respiratory Society [ALAT]). Spirometry reading will be centralized. 
 
  
The DSMB will assess participant safety at predetermined intervals during the study, 
including prior to initiating Part D and following the enrollment of the last participant in 
Part D.  
 
The total number of participants enrolled in Parts B, C, and D of the study will be 
approximately 112, with approximately 84 receiving PLN-74809 and 28 receiving placebo. 
3.2 Rationale for PLN-74809 Doses and Control Group 
This study will be the first to characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of PLN-74809 in 
participants with IPF, with or without co-administration with SoC (pirfenidone or 

Protocol PLN- 74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 25  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. nintedanib). The proposed randomized, double-blind study design allows a reduction in bias 
in the assessment of drug safety and tolerability. Stratification for background treatment with 
SoC will ensure a similar proportion of participants in each treatment group. The proposed 
sample size and 12-week treatment duration of Parts B and C are expected to provide 
meaningful PK information in the IPF population, as well as allow for preliminary evaluation 
of dose-dependent treatment effects on  study endpoints, comparing PLN-74809 
to placebo.  
The evaluation of  PLN-74809 40 mg in Part B of this study is supported by the 13-week 
toxicology data, safety and PK data at these doses from study , as well as 
the PD findings from study , where this dose led to reduction of TGF- β 
activation in the lungs of healthy participants following 7 days of dosing, as assessed by 
reduction in phosphorylated SMAD2 (pSMAD2)/SMAD2 ratio in BALF (See PLN-74809 
Investigator’s Brochure for more details).  
The evaluation of PLN-74809 80 mg and 160 mg doses in Part C is supported by all 
available safety and PK data from Parts A and B, as well as safety and PK data evaluating 
higher doses (80 and 160 mg) from study .  
The evaluation of PLN-74809 320 mg in Part D is supported by all available safety and PK 
data from Parts B and C, as well as safety and PK data evaluating the higher dose (320 mg) 
from study .  
In Study , PLN -74809 showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in 
healthy participants after single doses of up to  mg and after 7 days of treatment at doses 
of up to  mg ( Section 1.1.2 ). The safety margins determined after single doses of  
 mg and multiple doses of  mg were calculated using the NOAEL observed in 
toxicology studies in  for both area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
time zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24) and C max for the measured  of 
PLN-74809. At all dose levels studied, there was a  between the unbound 
AUC 0-24 and  no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). See the PLN-74809 
Investigator's Brochure for more details. 
Comparison of the unbound AUC 0-24 across all doses studied in the relevant dose escalation 
Phase 1 studies (i.e., ) demonstrates that doses 
ranging from  in the SAD and  in the MAD remain  
 the NOAEL established in the  toxicology studies. 
The higher dose of 320 mg to be evaluated in Part D of this study provides a reasonable 
escalation and separation from the 80 and 160 mg doses evaluated in Part C, allowing for 
appropriate dose ranging  (please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure for f urther details).  
Emerging data indicate that a 320 mg QD dose of PLN -74809 achieves  
exposure,  expected to provide greater levels of α vβ6 target engagement, PD response and 
potential clinical benefit. Interim findings from an ongoing investigation measuring uptake 
kinetics of the α vβ6 knottin PET radiotracer in the IPF lung indicate > 90% target saturation 

Protocol PLN- 74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 26  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. at single doses of  mg PLN-74809 (Study PLN-74809-201). In addition, 
preliminary data investigating PK and PD effects in BALF from healthy participants 
demonstrate a dose- and concentration- dependent reduction of SMAD2 phosphorylation (a 
marker of reduced TGF- β signaling) when PLN-74809 was dosed at  mg QD for 
7 days (Study ). These dose-dependent PD responses were associated with 
 PLN-74809 concentrations that exceeded the cell- based α vβ6 IC50 (protein binding-
corrected) for 6 hours (at  mg) or 24 hours (at  mg). A greater PD response is expected 
from a 320 mg dose, which is projected to achieve  concentrations that approach  
αvβ6 IC80 at steady-state. These higher  exposures achieved with a 320 mg QD dose 
are expected to elicit increased α vβ6 target engagement and additional PD response,  leading 
to reduced TGF- β signaling in the lung  and potentially slowing the clinical progression of 
pulmonary fibrosis. 
Part D initiation will be contingent on DSMB review of the above-mentioned data from 
Part C.  
Findings from this study will inform dose selection for future IPF studies. 
3.3 Study Duration  
The duration for Parts B and C of the study will be up to 18 weeks each (up to 4 weeks of 
screening, 12 weeks of treatment with study drug, and 2 weeks of follow up). 
The duration for Part D of the study will be variable depending on the study enrollment rate; 
i.e. the time between enrolling the first and last participant. The minimum duration of 
participation will be up to 30 weeks for the last participant enrolled (up to 4 weeks of 
screening, 24 weeks of treatment with study drug, and 2 weeks of follow up) and a maximum 
of up to 54 weeks for the first participant enrolled (up to 4 weeks of screening, up to 
48 weeks of treatment with study drug, and 2 weeks of follow up).  
The end of study will commence once the last participant reaches 24 weeks of treatment. At 
that time, all study participants will complete their next scheduled visit (End of Treatment 
[EoT]) and the 2 weeks of follow up (End of Study [EoS]).

PLN-74809 will be supplied by Pliant . Study drug will be 
taken once daily at approximately 24-hour intervals.  
6.2 Dose Modifications and Interruptions 
There will be no dose modifications of the study drug. If the study drug needs to be 
interrupted for safety or tolerability issues, this should happen, as feasible, in consultation 
with the Medical Monitor and Study Director, who together with the Investigator will assess 
and decide whether the study drug interruption should be temporary or permanent on a case-
by-case basis. Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion 
of 12 weeks of treatment will be asked to remain in the study to complete all remaining 
assessments; if this is not feasible, then they will be asked to return to the clinic for an early 
termination visit. 
Dose modifications or interruptions of pirfenidone or nintedanib treatment may be 
implemented only for safety and tolerability reasons  
, in accordance with their corresponding prescribing information and in 
c
onsultation with the Medical Monitor and Study Director. This should not affect the 
administration of the study drug or the continuation of participants in the study.  
6.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Participant 
Participants will be encouraged to take their study drug at the same time of the day, each day. 
Participants will take  
) and will drink up to 240 mL (~1 cup of water)  
.  
 
A dose will be considered missed if the participant cannot take the dose within 12 hours of 
their regular dosing time.  
• If a participant has missed a dose of study drug and is still within 12 hours of the time it 
is usually taken, the participant should take a dose of the missed drug as soon as possible. 
The participant may then continue the usual dosing schedule. 
• If the participant has missed a dose of study drug more than 12 hours after the time it is 
usually taken, the participant should not take the missed dose and should resume the 
usual dosing at the next scheduled time. The participant should not take a double dose to 
make up for a missed dose.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. 6.4 Method of Assigning Participants to Treatment Groups 
Up to approximately 112 participants may be enrolled in study Parts B (n = 28), C (n  = 56) 
and D (n = 28). The randomization for each of the dose cohorts in Parts B, C, and D will be 
3:1 (active:placebo). Randomization will be stratified by use of SoC IPF therapy (pirfenidone 
or nintedanib) (SoC use; yes or no). 
• In Part B, 28 eligible participants were randomized on Day 1 (Visit 2) in a 3:1 ratio 
(40 mg PLN-74809:placebo). 
• In Part C, 56 eligible participants will be randomized on Day 1 (Visit 2) in a 3:3:2 ratio 
(80 mg PLN-74809:160 mg PLN-74809:placebo).  
• In Part D, 28 eligible participants will be randomized on Day 1 (Visit 2) in a 3:1 ratio 
(320 mg PLN-74809:placebo).  
 
Assignment will be performed in a blinded manner using interactive response technology 
(IRT) based on a previously generated randomization code. Randomization will occur 
immediately prior to dosing on the morning of the first dose (Day 1). 
6.5 Blinding 
The placebo treatment will resemble the active treatment . This 
ensures that the participant, Investigator, clinical site staff, and Sponsor are unaware of the 
treatment allocation during the conduct of the study. The PLN-74809 or placebo will be 
provided as blinded kits and will be assigned to participants using a randomization code. 
Procedures will be in place to allow prompt breaking of the blind by the investigator if 
needed for the safety management of a participant. Unblinding at the study site for any other 
reason will be considered a protocol deviation. The investigator is strongly encouraged to 
contact the sponsor’s Study Director before unblinding any participant’s treatment 
assignment, but must do so within one working day after the event. A written explanation of 
the reason for unblinding should be provided to the sponsor within 24 hours of breaking the 
blind. Refer to the IRT User Guide for a description regarding how investigators may access 
treatment information via the IRT system.  
6.6 Concomitant Therapy 
6.6.1 Allowed Medications 
During screening, all medications including over the counter medications and herbal 
supplements taken during the 30 days prior to screening will be recorded and reviewed by the 
Investigator in consultation with the sponsor Study Director to determine whether the 
participant is suitable for inclusion. For other concomitant medications needed during the 
study conduct, the Investigator should consult with the sponsor Study Director as soon as 
feasible.  

Protocol PLN- 74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 34  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. Only treatment with approved SoC for IPF (nintedanib or pirfenidone) is allowed. These 
drugs must have been given at a stable dose for at least 3 months before initiation of 
screening and be expected to remain unchanged during the study. In addition, for participants 
receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone, the time of drug administration should be collected each 
day samples are obtained for assessing PLN-74809 PK. Treatments to address IPF disease 
symptoms, (e.g., cough, gastroesophageal reflux disease, etc.) are allowed. 
Preliminary results from a  
 
. 
Other medications to provide reasonable patient care of comorbidities are allowed during the 
study; however, these should only be used if necessary because, at this stage of development, 
limited formal drug-drug interaction studies with PLN-74809 have been performed. If used, 
all concomitant medications including both prescription and nonprescription drugs should 
first be discussed with the Investigator and Sponsor's Study Director before administration. 
This requirement does not apply in the case of urgent, necessary treatment of AEs. In all 
cases, medications, including over the counter medications and herbal supplements, taken by 
participants during the course of the study will be recorded using the generic name of the 
medication.  
Prolonged treatment with high doses of

Female Participants of Childbearing Potential 
Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to use a contraceptive method with a 
failure rate of <1% per year or remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) 
during the treatment period and for 1 month after the last dose of study treatment.   
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if:   

Protocol PLN- 74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 36  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  She has not reached a postmenopausal state, defined as ≥12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause or 6 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels 
>40 mIU/mL 
 She has not undergone surgical sterilization, defined as hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy 
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include: 
 Bilateral tubal ligation  
 Male sterilization (>3 months from Day 1 or provide a zero sperm count) 
 Hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation (initiated >3 months from Day 1) 
 Hormone-releasing intrauterine devices (initiated >3 months from Day 1) 
 Copper intrauterine devices (initiated >3 months from Day 1) 
Male Participants 
Male participants, including those who are surgically sterile, must agree to use contraceptive 
measures as defined below, or alternately to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual 
intercourse)   
 Male participants, with female partners of childbearing potential, must use a condom 
plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% 
per year or remain abstinent during the treatment period and for at least 3 months 
after the last dose of study treatment. 
 Male participants with pregnant female partners are excluded from this study  
 Male participants whose female partners become pregnant during the study must stop 
the medication immediately as outlined in Section 8.6 
 
 
Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those with a failure rate of < 1% per 
year  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception. Complete abstinence is considered a highly effective 
method when refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study treatment.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  8 SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 Timing  
In this study, AEs will be collected from the time the participant signs the ICF until the 
participant's last study visit.  
8.2 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any event, side effect, or other untoward medical occurrence that occurs in 
conjunction with the use of a study drug in humans, whether or not considered to have a 
causal relationship to this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and  
unintended sign (that could include a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug. Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been presen t prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or 
a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reporte d as an AE/SAE). Events 
that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
- Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
- Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, so cial and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
- Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• If there is evidence of an AE through report or observation, the Investigator or designee 
will evaluate further and record the following information:  
- Time of onset and resolution  
- Severity  
- Causality/relation to study treatment  
- Action taken regarding study drug  
- Outcome  
 
Protocol PLN- 74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 45  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. 8.3 Severity of an Adverse Event 
Grading the severity of AEs will use the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) grading system (  as described below. The clinical significance of the 
AE is determined by the Investigator. The Investigator is encouraged to consult with the 
Study Director.  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death r elated to AE.  
A semi- colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
*Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, 
using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden. 
 
 
 
8.4 Causal Relationship of an Adverse Event 
The Investigator will assess the relationship between study drug and the occurrence of each 
AE. The Invest igator’s assessment of the relationship of each AE to study drug will be 
recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. Alternative causes, such as medical history, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study drug should be considered and investigated, if appropriate. The following definitions 
are general guidelines to help assign grade of attribution.  

Protocol PLN -74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 ( version 3.0)  Page 46  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  The relationship or association of the AE to a study drug (PLN -74809 or placebo) should be 
assessed usi ng clinical judgment and the following considerations:  
No  
(not related):  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug. For 
SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (eg, pre -existing condition, 
underlying disease, intercurre nt illness, or concomitant medication).  
Yes 
(related):  A temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and administration of the 
study drug that cannot be readily explained by the participant’s clinical state 
or concomitant therapies. Furthermore, the  AE appears with some degree of 
certainty to be related, based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic 
actions or AE profile of the study drug. In case of cessation or reduction of 
the dose, the AE abates or resolves and reappears upon re -challenge.  
 
The relationship to study procedures (such as venipuncture) should be assessed using the 
following considerations:  
No 
(not related):  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study procedure.  
Yes 
(related):  The AE occurred as a result of protocol -mandated procedures.  
 
8.5 Outcome  
The outcome of an AE will be recorded on the AE eCRF as follows:  
• Recovered / Resolved  
• Recovering / Resolving  
• Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae  
• Not Recovered / Not Resolving  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
 
8.6 Pregnancy  
A pregnancy is not an AE. If a female participant or the female partner of a male study 
participant becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study following administration of study 
drug and within 30 or 90 days, respectively, after administration of the last  dose of study 
drug, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator learning of the

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. pregnancy. Administration of study drug will be discontinued immediately, and the 
participant or the female partner of a male study participant will be followed through the 
outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator is required to provide all the relevant information 
to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Information Form to do so. 
The pregnancy will be followed through delivery. If the pregnancy results in a congenital 
anomaly/birth defects/miscarriage, this will be considered and reported as an SAE as per 
definition detailed in Section 8.8. 
8.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (eg, , vital signs) per se are not reported as AEs. However, those 
abnormal findings that are deemed clinically significant or are associated with signs and/or 
symptoms must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE, as described in 
Section 8.2 (or recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious, as described in 
Section 8.8). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other abnormal findings that are 
detected after consent or that are present at baseline and worsen after consent are included as 
AEs (and SAEs if serious). 
The Investigator should exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. 
Usually, the abnormality should be associated with a clinically evident sign or symptom, or 
be likely to result in an evident sign or symptom in the near term, to be considered clinically 
significant. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical 
symptoms may jeopardize the participant and may require intervention to prevent immediate 
consequences. For example, a markedly low serum glucose concentration may not be 
accompanied by coma or convulsions, yet be of a magnitude to require glucose 
administration to prevent such sequelae. 
8.8 Serious Adverse Events 
8.8.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Is life-threatening 
- An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the opinion of either the Investigator or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Results in death  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization (ie, admission) or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization. Except: 
- An emergency room visit without hospitalization is not considered fulfilling the 
serious criteria of hospitalization. 

Protocol PLN- 74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 48  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. - Planned hospitalization or surgical procedures for an illness or disease which existed 
before the participant was enrolled in the clinical trial is not considered an SAE 
unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect/miscarriage 
• Is an important medical event 
- An event that does not fulfill any of the serious criteria above, but is considered to be 
clinically significant and may jeopardize the participant, or when medical or surgical 
intervention may be required to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
- Examples of such events include but are not limited to: laboratory abnormalities 
  
 that lead to permanent study drug discontinuation, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment at an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.8.2 Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open 
question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. Any clinically 
relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE 
and must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF. When possible, signs and 
symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive 
event.  
8.8.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In order to meet the requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific 
requirements to applicable regulatory authorities and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/ 
Independent Ethics Committee (IECs)/ Research Ethics Boards (REBs), all SAEs must be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours from the time site personnel first become aware of 
the event by completing the SAE form and emailing it to the below:  
 
Initial notification of an SAE by telephone must be confirmed in writing within 24 hours by 
completing the SAE form. As further information regarding the SAE becomes available, such 
follow up information should be documented and sent to  
All SAEs must be followed by the Investigator to resolution or medical stabilization. 

Protocol PLN -74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 ( version 3.0)  Page 49  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Withdrawal from the study in the event of a SAE and therapeutic measures taken shall be at 
the discretion of the Investigator. A full explanation for the discontinuation from the study 
should be made i n the eCRF.  
8.8.4 Reporting SAEs to Regulatory Authorities and IRB/IEC/REB  
The reporting of any SAEs to applicable regulatory authorities will be the responsibility of 
the Sponsor in compliance with applicable country regulations. All SAEs must be reported to 
the IRB/IEC/REB by the Investigator in accordance with their regulations.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  12 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 General Considerations  
This is a safety study with exploratory efficacy and biomarker assessments; as s uch, no 
statistical hypotheses are being tested. In general, data will be summarized using statistical 
summary methods; graphic presentations of data may also be prepared. The contract research 
organization (CRO) will be responsible for the preparation of tables and listings and will 
assist in the preparation of figures, which may be done by Sponsor personnel. A statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), prepared and agreed before final database lock, will describe the 
analytic approach and methods in more detail.  
12.2 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of approximately 21 participants receiving PLN -74809 per dose level is 
expected to provide a meaningful evaluation of PLN -74809 safety, tolerability and PK in the 
target population.  
12.3 Analysis Populations  
Safety P opulation:  All randomized participants who receive at least one dose of study drug 
will be included in the safety analyses.  
PK Analysis Population:  All randomized participants who have sufficient PLN -74809 
concentration data for PK calculation will be included in the PK analyses.  
PD Analysis Population:  All randomized participants who receive any amount of study drug 
and who have results from Baseli ne and from at least one post -baseline PD assessment will 
be included in the PD analyses.  
Efficacy Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : All randomized participants.  
Efficacy Per Protocol Population:  Subset of the ITT population who complete the study 
without  any major protocol violations.  
12.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Data will be summarized using statistical summary methods.  
12.5 Primary Endpoints  
12.5.1  Primary Safety Endpoint  
• Nature and proportion of AEs between PLN -74809 and placebo groups (descriptive)  
 
Safety data from all participants who received at least one dose of study drug will be 
incorporated into the final safety analysis. Further details of the safety analyses will be 
Protocol PLN- 74809 -IPF-202, Amendment 3, 19 October 2021 (version 3.0) Page 58  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. provided in the SAP. AEs will be collected from the time the participant signs the ICF until 
the last study visit. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that 
emerged or worsened in severity after the first administration of study drug. 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). All 
AEs will be graded for severity per the CTCAE grading scale and listed by participant and 
summarized by last treatment taken at onset of AE. All AEs will be listed by participant and 
summarized by last treatment taken at onset of AE. 
The incidence of AEs, the incidence of TEAEs, the incidence of treatment-related AEs, and 
the severity of AEs will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, and maximum 
severity. In cases where a participant reports multiple occurrences of the same even t 
(preferred term), the greatest severity will be included in the summary. The number and 
percentage of participants with SAEs and treatment-related SAEs and participants who 
withdraw prematurely due to an AE will be tabulated by study treatment and dose. 
Clinical laboratory test parameters will be graded using the CTCAE grading scale for 
individual participants and values outside the reference ranges will be flagged. The incidence 
of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by severity and treatment 
group. For each parameter, summary statistics will be calculated for each measure and 
summarized by treatment and dose. 
Individual results will be listed for each participant. Summaries of  by treatment 
and dose will include changes from baseline for each parameter. 
Vital sign measurements other laboratory tests, concomitant medications, medical history and 
changes in physical examinations at each time point will be listed by participant. The number 
and percentage of participants with abnormal  will be summarized by treatment and 
dose. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the most current World Health Organization 
drug dictionary available. 
12.6 Secondary Endpoints 
12.6.1 Secondary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
Plasma PLN-74809 concentrations ( ) at each sampling 
timepoint will be presented in listings and descriptive summary statistics by dose and visit. 
The data will also be presented graphically.  
Further details of the analyses will be provided in the SAP to be prepared and agreed prior to 
final ‘database lock’ at the end of the study. The PK analysis plan and report may be 
prepared separately from the SAP as appropriate.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. 12.6.2 Secondary Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
Urine, plasma and serum samples will be analyzed for biomarkers (presence or actual 
concentration). These samples will be used to determine the levels of these markers in 
participants and the relationship between these markers. Results will be presented by listings, 
descriptive summary statistics and in graphical form by treatment and dose and expressed as 
the relative change (and or absolute) for each participant.  
In addition, relationships between PK and PD may be evaluated in an  
and presented in graphical manner.

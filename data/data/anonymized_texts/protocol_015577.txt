2PRÉCIS
Background:
Mature T-cell cancers are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of malignancies which 
constitute 10-15% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Patients with 
relapsed/refractory T cell lymphomas have limited therapeutic options, making new 
therapeutic approaches extremely important.
The immunologic effects of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15), a stimulatory 
cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and long-
term CD8+ memory T-cells, has been assessed in several Phase 1 trials in cancer patients.
Avelumab is an anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) fully human IgG1 antibody that 
inhibits PD1/PD-L1 interactions while leaving the PD1/PD-L2 pathway intact and 
enhances immune activation against tumor cells. It has received U.S. FDA accelerated 
approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and 
urothelial carcinoma. 
Unlike other approved anti-PD-L1/PD1 antibodies, avelumab induces lysis of tumor cells 
via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), indicating an additional 
mechanism of action. However, avelumab has not shown ADCC against normal immune 
cell subsets in humans.
A significant number of T-cell malignancies express PD-L1, and since the anti-PD-L1 
antibody avelumab has shown ADCC activity in vitro, agents that may enhance ADCC by 
increasing number and activity of Fc-binding effector cells — such as rhIL15 — could 
improve efficacy of avelumab in these diseases.  
Objectives:
To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
continuous intravenous infusion (civ) rhIL-15 administration in combination with standard 
intravenous (IV) avelumab treatment
Eligibility:
Age ≥ 18 years of age
ECOG performance status of ≤ 1  
Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory T-cell lymphoma 
other than adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell 
lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma T follicular helper phenotype (PTCL-
TFH), and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). 
Adequate organ and marrow function 
Design:
Open-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase 1 study
Standard “3 + 3” design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated rhIL-15 with 
fixed dose avelumab with a small expansion cohort at the MTD
Maximum 6 cycles (28-day cycle) of combination therapy

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.2.1 Mature T-cell malignancies
Mature T-cell cancers are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of malignancies which constitute 
10-15% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL)(1). Excluding a small proportion of indolent 
subtypes, they are treatment-resistant and are associated with poor prognosis(2). The most 
common mature T-cell malignancies in the United States are: peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL, 
including the angioimmunoblastic variant and anaplastic large cell lymphoma - ALCL), cutaneous 
T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), with incidence ranging 
from 0.09/100,000 for ATLL to 1/100,000 for PTCL(3-6).

81.2.2 Treatment of relapsed/refractory PTCL
Three agents, pralatrexate, belinostat and romidepsin have received accelerated FDA approval for 
treatment of relapsed or refractory PTCL based on overall response rate (ORR) shown in Phase 2, 
single-arm studies. Pralatrexate is an antifolate investigated in 115 patients, 109 of whom were 
evaluable. ORR was 29% (95% CI, 21-39%), with 12 complete responses (CRs - 11%) and 20 
partial responses (PRs- 18%)(7). Median duration of response was 10.1 months (range 1-673 
days), median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, and median overall survival (OS) 
was 14.5 months. Seventy-four percent of patients had a grade 3 or 4 adverse event, most of which 
were hematological (19% grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 16% grade 3 anemia, 14% grade 3 
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia).
Belinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) studied in 129 patients, 120 of whom were 
evaluable. ORR was 26%, with 12 CRs (10%) and 19 PRs (16%)(8). Median duration of response 
was 8.4 months (range NR-36 months). Median PFS was 1.6 months, and median OS was 7.9 
months. Sixty-one percent of patients had a grade 3 or 4 adverse event. 22 patients died during 
treatment, of which 10 deaths (7.8%) were due to treatment-emergent adverse events arising within 
30 days of the last belinostat dose.  Romedepsin is another HDACi studied in 130 patients with 
PTCL.  ORR was 25% including 15% CRs (19 of 130).  Median PFS was 4 months(9).
A meta-analysis of available treatments for relapsed/refractory PTCL showed that, even though 
approved, belinostat and pralatrexate were less effective and less safe than several other regimens 
(Figure 1). Most effective of these regimens was the anti-CD30 immunotoxin brentuximab 
vedotin in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ORR 86%), although, when given to unselected patients 
with PTCL-NOS, the ORR was significantly lower (ORR 41%)(6).

1.2.3 Treatment of relapsed/refractory CTCL
There are five FDA-approved drugs for relapsed/refractory CTCL: bexarotene, romidepsin, 
vorinostat, mogamulizumab and brentuximab vedotin (for CD30-positive disease).
Bexarotene, a retinoid receptor X (RXR)-selective retinoid agonist, was given at two different dose 
levels to 94 patients with stage ≥IIB  CTCL, of whom 31% had erythroderma and 10% had visceral 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
9involvement( 10). Only 16% of patients had ≥15% circulating Sézary cells, though 27% had 
detectable Sézary cells . ORR was 45-55%, with 1-5 CRs. One of five patients with circulating 
Sézary cells had a substantial decrease in counts. Six of 19 patients (32%) with generalized 
erythroderma, and four of 17 (24%) with Sézary Syndrome (SS) had a response. The most common 
grade 3 or 4 AEs were hyperlipidemia (34-45%) and pruritus (8-14%). One of 17 deaths were 
judged to be possibly drug related, that of a patient who developed liver failure with coagulopathy.
The HDAC inhibitor vorinostat was investigated in a phase IIB multicenter trial of 74 patients, 61 
with advanced (stage ≥IIB) disease, including 30 with SS. ORR was 29.7% (1 CR, 21 PRs), 
including 10/30 patients with SS(11). Grade 3 or 4 AEs were seen in 28% of the patients, with the 
most common being fatigue (5%), pulmonary embolism (5%), thrombocytopenia (5%), and nausea 
(4%). Another HDAC inhibitor, romidepsin, was investigated in two concurrent Phase 2 trials with 
a combined total of 167 patients, 130 of whom with stage ≥IIB  disease(12, 13). ORR was 34-38%, 
and a total of 10 patients (6%) had CRs, three of whom had SS. Reports of grade 3 or 4 AEs varied 
between the studies, with lymphopenia ranging from 21% to <10%, neutropenia 14% to <10%, 
and thrombocytopenia 6% to none. There were 10 deaths which occurred within 30 days of 
receiving the last dose of the drug, two from sepsis, one from hypertrophic cardiac disease, and 
the rest from disease progression.
Mogamulizumab is an anti-CCR4 antibody recently approved by the U.S. FDA, based on an open-
label phase III study of 372 patients, with vorinostat as the control arm.  ORR assessed by 
independent reviewers was 23% for mogamulizumab and 4% for vorinostat. Median PFS was 6.7 
months in the mogamulizumab group versus 3.8 months in patients receiving vorinostat. The most 
common treatment-emergent AEs in the mogamulizumab group were infusion-related reactions, 
drug rash, diarrhea, and fatigue(14).
Chemotherapy, including CHOP-based regimens, have the highest response rates (50-88%), but 
duration of response is <6 months and high toxicity is associated with the treatment. More recently, 
a Phase 3 trial comparing brentuximab vedotin to methotrexate or bexarotene in CD30+ CTCL, 
reported improvement in proportion of patients achieving an objective global response lasting at 
least 4 months (ORR4) at a median follow-up of 22.9 months, which was 56.3% with brentuximab 
vedotin vs. 12.5% with methotrexate or bexarotene(15).
1.2.4 Treatment of relapsed/ refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
Brentuximab vedotin is the only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of CD30+ systemic 
ALCL relapsed after or refractory to chemotherapy. In a Phase 2 trial of 58 patients, 57% 
achieved CR and 29% achieved PR, with a median time to response of 5.9 weeks (which was the 
time of the first CT)(16). Median response duration was 12.6 months overall, and 13.2 months 
for patients who achieved CR.
1.2.5 Immune checkpoint inhibitors in T-cell malignancies
A Phase 1b trial of nivolumab in patients with relapsed and refractory hematologic malignancy 
involved 15 patients with CTCL (2 with mycosis fungoides and 2 with SS), 5 patients with PTCL 
and 3 with other forms of T-cell lymphoma(17). PD-L1 testing by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
and molecular analysis was not done on all patients, and expression was not required for eligibility. 
There were no differences in AE frequency or severity between the B-cell and T-cell groups. Four 
patients (2 with CTCL and 2 with PTCL) had a PR, making the ORR 17%. Three of them had an 
ongoing response after 24.3, 50, and 78.6 weeks of follow-up, while one of the patients with PTCL 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
10progressed after 10.6 weeks. Ten patients had stable disease (SD; median duration of 11 weeks), 
and the remaining 9 progressed during treatment.
The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab was given to 24 patients with MF/SS in a CITN 
multicenter Phase 2 study(18). The majority of patients had stage IIB or higher disease, and 15 
had stage IVA SS. ORR was 38% (1 CR, 8 PR), with six patients having ≥90% improvement in 
skin disease as measured by the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT). Median 
TTR was 11 weeks, and 8 of 9 responses were ongoing at the time of the report. Notably, there 
was no association between response and skin tissue expression of PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, or 
infiltrating CD8+ T cells. A “skin flare” was reported in 40% of patients with SS. Two treatment-
related SAEs were grade 2 pneumonitis and grade 3 diarrhea secondary to steroid-refractory 
duodenitis.
There is preclinical and clinical evidence to suggest that immune checkpoint inhibition may 
precipitate rapid progression in some forms of T-cell lymphoma, most notably those that are PD-
1 (but not PD-L1) positive. In a phase II trial of nivolumab in patients with PTCL, ORR was 33%, 
with two CRs and two PRs among the 12 patients treated.(19) However, one of six patients with 
AITL progressed after the first dose, and three more experienced significant progression after the 
second or third dose of nivolumab. Notably, AITL tumor cells were shown to have high levels of 
PD-1(20), which may act as a tumor suppressor in T-cell lymphomagenesis.(21) PTCL with T 
follicular helper phenotype (PTCL-TFH) is another form of PTCL in which tumor cells are PD-1 
positive, as is ATLL.  A trial of single-agent nivolumab for ATLL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was suspended 
for interim analysis when the first 3 patients enrolled developed accelerated disease progression 
within the first two doses of the drug.( 22)
There are several ongoing Phase 2 trials that have yet to report results: nivolumab for 
relapsed/refractory PTCL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), pembrolizumab after auto-SCT for any HL, DLBCL, 
and T-NHL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); pembrolizumab for CTCL in combination with romidepsin 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), radiation therapy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and decitabine and pralatrexate 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], which also includes patients with PTCL); atezolizumab for relapsed/refractory 
CTCL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); and avelumab for relapsed/refractory PTCL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
1.2.6 Recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15)
IL-15 is a 14-15kDA member of the 4-alpha-helix bundle family of cytokines that acts through a 
heterotrimeric receptor involving IL-12/IL-15R beta subunit shared with IL-2, the common 
gamma chain (γc) shared with IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-21, and IL-15 specific receptor subunit IL-15R 
alpha (CD215)(23-27). IL-15 acts as a cell-surface molecule as part of an immunological synapse 
with IL-15 and IL-15R alpha produced in trans on adjacent mononuclear cells like monocytes and 
DCs which have been stimulated with interferon and/or CD40 ligation.  IL-15 has been shown in 
many model systems to be a potent stimulator of T and NK-cell functions and in contrast to IL-2 
does not activate Tregs and participates less in the capillary leak syndrome. Several studies in 
murine models highlighted the potential value of IL-15 therapy for neoplasia.  The safety of IL-15 
was evaluated in rhesus macaques. A 12-day bolus intravenous administration of 20 µg/kg/day of 
IL-15 to rhesus macaques was associated with a 4 to 8-fold increase in the number of circulating 
NK cells.  When administered by continuous intravenous infusion (civ) at 20 µg/kg/day for 10 
days, a 10-fold increase in the number of circulating NK cells, a 15-fold increase in the number of 
circulating monocytes and a massive 80 to 100-fold increase in the number of circulating effector 
memory CD8 T-cells was observed.  Subcutaneous infusions at 20 µg/day for 10 days led to a 10-

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
11fold expansion in the number of circulating effector memory CD8 T-cells.  On the basis of animal 
and laboratory trials of IL-15, great interest was generated among leading immunotherapeutic 
experts participating in the NCI Immunotherapy Agent Workshop who ranked IL-15 as the most 
promising unavailable immunotherapeutic agent to be brought to therapeutic trials.   
1.2.7 Clinical trials using IL-15 monotherapy in the treatment of cancer
We initiated, executed and reported a first in-human Phase I study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of bolus 
administered intravenous rhIL-15 in adults with refractory metastatic malignant melanoma and 
metastatic renal cell cancer(23) . This study was initially planned as a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial 
starting with an initial dose of 3 mcg/kg/day for 12 days. However, after the initial patient 
developed grade 3 hypotension, and another patient of the 5 patients at dose level 3 mcg/kg/day 
developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia, the protocol was amended to add the two lower doses of 1.0 
and 0.3 mcg/kg/day. Two of four patients given 1.0 mcg/kg/day dose developed persistent grade 
3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations that were dose 
limiting. All 9 patients with IL-15 at 0.3 mcg/kg/day received 12 doses without a DLT, and the 
MTD of rhIL-15 was defined as 0.3 mcg/kg/day. There was a consistent temporal pattern of post-
treatment adverse events in patients receiving 3 mcg/kg/day doses of IL-15 with fever and rigors 
beginning 2 ½ to 4 hours following the start of IV infusions, and a drop in blood pressure 5 to 9 
hours after the infusion to a nadir approximately 20 mm/Hg below pretreatment levels. These 
changes were concurrent with a maximum of 50-fold elevations of circulating IL-6 and IFn-γ 
concentrations.
Flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients receiving 3 mcg/kg/day revealed a 
dramatic efflux of NK and memory CD8 T-cells from the circulation within minutes of IL-15 
administration, followed by an influx and hyperproliferation yielding a 10-fold expansion in the 
number of NK cells that ultimately returned to baseline. There was a modest effect on the 
number of CD8+ T-cells but by day 8 of the infusion virtually all CD8+ T-cells expressed high 
levels of Ki67, CD38 and HLA-DR.  In this first-in-human Phase 1 trial there were no responses, 
with stable disease as the best response. However, 5 patients manifested a decrease of between 
10% and 30% of their marker lesions and 2 had clearing of lung lesions.
1.2.8 Clinical trials involving IL-15 administered by alternate dosing strategies 
Ultimately, we concluded that it proved too difficult to administer IL-15 as an intravenous bolus 
infusion because of clinical toxicities produced by intense cytokine secretion that occurred within 
the first 2 hours after treatment. There were exceedingly high IL-15 C max levels initially after bolus 
infusions that were sufficient to signal through the IL-2/IL-15R beta and γc receptor pair that IL-
15 shares with IL-2, thereby contributing to the toxicities observed. To reduce the C max and toxicity 
and to increase the period of time when IL-15 is at an optimal concentration for high-affinity IL-
15 receptors we evaluated alternative dosing strategies, first in rhesus macaques. By administering 
IL-15 by civ or subcutaneously to these nonhuman primates the exceedingly high C max observed 
by bolus infusion was avoided. In particular, with bolus intravenous infusions to rhesus macaques 
at 20 mcg/kg/day, the C max was 720 pg/mL, in contrast with subcutaneous infusion of 20 
mcg/kg/day the C max was 50 pg/mL and with continuous infusion at 20 µg/kg/d the IL-15 C max was 
between 2 and 4 pg/mL throughout the 10-day study period.
1.2.8.1 A Phase I Study of Subcutaneous Recombinant Human IL-15 (rhIL-15) in Adults with 
Metastatic Cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])
To translate this observation in collaboration with the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
12(CITN), we completed a Phase I trial of subcutaneous recombinant human IL-15 in cycles 
consisting of 5 daily injections of rhIL-15 given Monday-Friday for 2 weeks, then 2 weeks of 
observation with potential for additional cycles. Three patients each were enrolled in 0.25, 0.5, 
1.0, and 2.0 mcg/kg/day dose levels and six patients were evaluated at 3.0 mcg/kg/day.  Eighteen 
patients completed at least one cycle with one DLT at 3.0 mcg/kg/day and one serious adverse 
event, pancreatitis, at 2.0 mcg/kg/day. Flow-cytometry data indicated a consistent increase in the 
frequency of CD56bright CD3- negative NK cells peaking at day 15 (day 12 = last dose). The 
mean fold increase with 3 mcg/kg/day of IL-15 in circulating NK cell numbers peaked at 10.8-
fold.  The maximum fold increase in circulating CD8 + T cells was 3.3-fold. It was concluded that 
subcutaneous IL-15 was well tolerated and that the 3 mcg/kg/day dose level was safe for outpatient 
use. 
1.2.8.2 Protocol ID Number:  NCI-12-C-0113 A Phase I Study of a Continuous Intravenous 
Infusion of Recombinant Human Interleukin IL-15 (rhIL-15) in Adults with Metastatic 
Cancers ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])
In a parallel clinical trial that we performed in the Clinical Center NIH, rhIL-15 was administered 
at progressively increasing doses (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mcg/kg/day) to groups of 3 patients 
each, with metastatic malignancy by civ for 10 days. Two dose-limiting toxicities were observed 
at 4.0 mcg/kg/day, hepatotoxicity and visceral arterial ischemia. Therefore, an expansion group 
study of 9 patients at the MTD of 2.0 mcg/kg/day was completed. This 2.0 mcg/kg/day dose level 
was well tolerated. None of the patients had an immune response to the IL-15. The 
pharmacokinetic pattern when IL-15 was administered by civ was quite distinct from that observed 
with bolus infusion. With bolus infusions of 3 mcg/kg/day the arithmetic mean C max of 30,420 
pg/mL was observed at the onset of the IL-15 administration, followed by a rapid decline in serum 
IL-15 levels. When IL-15 was administered by subcutaneous infusion the C max at 4 hours after the 
subcutaneous administration of 3.0 mcg/kg/day was 6,480 pg/mL. With continuous intravenous 
infusion, there was a progressive increase of serum IL-15 levels with a C max at 12 to 48 hours of 
1,510 pg/mL, markedly lower than that observed with bolus infusions. The lower C max observed 
with subcutaneous and civ was paralleled inversely by a 10-fold greater MTD at these levels 
compared to that with the bolus infusion. In the civ trial following the C max at 12 to 48 hours there 
was a gradual decline to 8% of the maximum level by days 8-10 despite the fact that the IL-15 
infusions were continued. We hypothesized that a factor for this decline in serum IL-15 
concentration was the IL-15-induced increase in the number of IL-15 receptor bearing cells as well 
as the number of receptors (especially IL-2/IL-15Rβ  [CD122] receptors) per cell that acted as a 
sink, binding some of the IL-15 administered.
The time course of the increase in host lymphoid cells showed an interesting pattern with civ. 
Within 1 to 3 days of the infusion initiation there was a rapid decline in the number of circulating 
NK cells, followed by a gradual increase until the termination of infusions.  Of interest, during the 
1 to 3 days immediately following termination of the infusion there was a dramatic 30-fold increase 
in the number of circulating NK cells and an over 350-fold increase in the number of CD56bright 
NK cells (Figure 2). The rate of proliferation of different subsets of NK cells assessed by Ki67 
was consistent with their levels of CD122 (IL-2/IL-15Rβ) expression with CD56bright > 
CD56dim, CD94high, > CD56dim, CD94low. The functional capacity of the dominant 
CD56bright subset was augmented following IL-15 administration and was associated with an 
increase in their expression of perforin and granzyme. Furthermore, although the specific lytic 
activity of CD56bright cells was not as great as that of CD56dim cells, their lytic activity was 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
13markedly increased by IL-15 treatment including activity associated with antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), as assessed in vitro by their cytotoxicity against target cells, anti-
CD20 antibody coated Raji cells, K562 cells (natural cytotoxicity mediated by NKp30 and NKp46) 
and C1R-MICA cells (NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity)(28). These observations on the effect of 
IL-15 on NK subsets and their function support the proposed trials described below that involve 
the combinations of IL-15 with antitumor monoclonal antibodies to increase their ADCC and 
antitumor efficacy. 
A trial of IL-15 by civ for 5 days has been initiated, and in the 10 patients studied following 
treatment there was a 21 to 44-fold increase in the number of circulating NK cells, and up to an 
8.9-fold increase in the number of CD8+ T cells (Figure 2, Table 1).
Figure 2:  Increase in lymphocytes, predominantly NK cell count, during continuous infusion of rhIL-
15. rhIL-15 was administered at progressively increasing doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mcg/kg/day 
by 10-day civ infusion (A) and 5-day civ infusion (B) to patients with metastatic malignancy. Patients 2-4 
received 0.125 mcg/kg, patients 5-7 received 0.25 mcg/kg, patients 8-10 received 0.5 mcg/kg, patients 11-
16 received 1.0 mcg/kg and patients 17-19 received 2.0 mcg/kg. Following termination of the treatment 
(red arrow) there was a dramatic 30-fold increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes predominantly 
NK cell count and an over 350-fold increase in the number of circulating CD56bright NK cells in the 10-
day cohort, and an up to 44-fold increase (33-fold mean increase) in the number of circulating NK cells in 
the 5-day cohort.

1.2.9 Avelumab 
Avelumab is a fully human IgG1, anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody that inhibits 
PD1/PD-L1 interactions while leaving the PD1/PD-L2 pathway intact and enhances immune 
activation against tumor cells(29-36). Avelumab (Bavencio®) received U.S. FDA accelerated 
approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)(34) and 
urothelial carcinoma(30). Unlike other approved anti-PD-L1/PD1 antibodies, avelumab induces 
lysis of tumor cells via ADCC, indicating an additional mechanism of action. However, avelumab 
has not shown ADCC against normal immune cell subsets in humans(31). PD-L1 is found 
predominantly on tumor cells and binds to PD1, which like CTLA-4 is found primarily on T cells. 
When overexpressed in tumors, PD-L1 is a negative prognostic marker, most likely due to T-cell 
anergy induced by the binding of PD-L1 to PD1(37, 38). The standard therapeutic dose and dosing 
strategy involves 10 mg/kg IV infusion of avelumab given every 2 weeks(30).
1.2.9.1 Experience with avelumab in refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma
Sixty-six patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma were studied with avelumab(30). An 
independent central review assessment resulted in a confirmed ORR of 18.2% including 5 patients 
(11.4%) with a complete response (Figure 3). Three patients (6.8%) had a partial response and 15 
patients had stable disease as best response. Patients' responses were predominantly found in those 
with PD-L1 positive tumors.  Seven of eight responding patients (87.5%) had PD-L1 positive 
tumors whereas only 4.7% (1 of 24) of patients with PD-L1 negative tumors had a response. The 
median time to response was 13.0 weeks. The median duration of response was not reached.
1.2.9.2 Experience with avelumab in ovarian cancer
A total of 124 relapsed ovarian cancer patients were treated with avelumab resulting in a response 
rate of 9.7% comprised of 12 partial responses with 6 ongoing. Stable disease was observed in 
44% yielding a disease control rate of 54% (unpublished data). 
1.2.9.3 Experience with avelumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
In a Phase 1b trial of 184 patients, objective responses were observed in 22 (12%) patients, 1 CR, 
21 PRs, and stable disease was found in 70 patients (38%)(39). Overall, 50% of patients achieved 
disease control. The most common treatment-related AEs of any grade were fatigue (25%), 
infusion reactions (21%), and nausea (13%). Grade 3 or worse treatment-related AEs occurred in 
13% of patients, with the most common being infusion reactions (2%) and increased lipase level 
(2%).
1.2.9.4 Experience with avelumab in breast cancer
Avelumab was studied in 168 patients with locally advanced breast cancer or MVC refractory to 
or progressing after standard of care. Response rate in the entire cohort was 5.4% (9 patients) with 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
151 complete and 8 partial responses. Stable disease was observed in an additional 40 patients 
(23.8%) yielding an overall disease control rate of 29.2%. Responses were predominantly in PD-
L1 expressing tumors (unpublished data).
1.2.9.5 Experience of with avelumab in Merkel cell carcinoma
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. The 
proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 28/88 (31.8%) including 8 
complete and 20 partial responses(34).
Further trials of avelumab for mesothelioma, gastric cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma and renal 
cancer are ongoing.

1.2.9.6 Immune related risks
In addition, some clinically relevant irAEs were reported after the data cutoff or outside of the
Pooled Safety Dataset. These included: 3 events of nonfatal graft versus host disease (2 in the 
liver and 1 in skin) and 1 event of immune thrombocytopenic purpura in Study B9991007 
(avelumab in subjects with cHL), 4 events of myasthenia gravis/myasthenic syndrome in the 
clinical studies, and overall 15 events of pancreatitis including one case of fatal pancreatitis 
necrotising in Study B9991003 with the combination of avelumab with axitinib in subjects with 
RCC (Investigator Brochure, 29May 2020).
1.2.10 Rationale of Study 
1.2.10.1 PD-L1 expression in T-cell malignancies
Several IHC analyses have demonstrated that T-cell lymphomas express PD-L1. In a series of 26 
cases of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), virtually all stages showed staining for PD-L1 in 
the majority of atypical lymphocytes (>50% in 5/7 stage I/II, 6/6 stage III, and 11/11 stage IV)(40). 
An older series of 11 patients with CTCL (stage unspecified), and 65 patients with peripheral T-
cell lymphoma-NOS reported 17-27% PD-L1 positivity by immunohistochemistry with a cutoff 
of 30%( 41). Low prevalence of PD-L1 expression in PTCL-NOS was confirmed in a series of 11 
patients, with three (28%) being positive using a ≥5% cutoff(42).
Eighteen of 24 patients with ALK-negative ALCL showed PD-L1 expression as assessed by IHC 
using SP142 antibody (Ventana). Interestingly, FISH analysis showed no PD-L1 gene 
amplification, but in silico analysis of the PD-L1 and PD-L2 gene promoters identified multiple 
potential binding sites for STAT3 and MYC(43). Multiple other analyses of the T-cell lymphoma 
genomic landscape did not find mutations or gene copy alterations of the PD-L1-encoding PDCD1 
gene(44-48). Some studies found alterations in the PD-1 encoding PDCD1 gene in 8-36% of 
patients with T-cell lymphoma.
Since a significant number of T-cell malignancies express PD-L1, and since the anti-PD-L1 
antibody avelumab has shown ADCC activity in vitro, agents that may enhance ADCC by 
increasing number and activity of Fc-binding effector cells — such as rhIL15 — could improve 
efficacy of avelumab in these diseases. 
1.2.10.2  Preclinical Trials of IL-15 with Anticancer Monoclonal Antibodies to Augment their 
ADCC
While the in vivo effects of IL-15 in cancer patients are still not entirely clear, the initial clinical 
data has demonstrated that to achieve its full potential in the treatment of cancer, IL-15 will have 
to be used in combination with other therapeutic agents. In light of the data from preclinical animal 
models and clinical trials of the capacity of IL-15 to increase the number of activated NK cells, T 
cells and monocytes, this information supports the administration of IL-15 with antitumor 
monoclonal antibodies to augment their ADCC against tumor cells. To further investigate this 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
17strategy, the Waldmann Laboratory used an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model of B-cell 
lymphoma to investigate the combination of IL-15 with rituximab. Wild-type CD56 and BL/6 mice 
were inoculated intravenously with EL4-CD20 cells, a mouse lymphoma line transfected with 
CD20. The mice were distributed into 4 treatment groups (control, IL-15 alone, rituximab alone 
and the combination) of 10 mice each. IL-15(5 µg/mouse) was administered 5 x per week for 4 
weeks beginning 3 days after EL4-CD20 inoculation. In cohorts receiving rituximab, the 
monoclonal antibody was given once per week for 4 weeks starting 5 days after EL4-CD20 
inoculation. As seen (Figure 4), IL-15 or rituximab monotherapy prolonged survival of mice when 
compared to the control group (p < 0.05) but the combination of IL-15 and rituximab showed the 
greatest prolongation of survival compared to monotherapies (< 0.01), such that 75 days after 
tumor inoculation 90% of the combination treatment group were still alive in contrast to 30% 
survival from the monotherapy groups and no surviving mice in the control group (Figure 4). In a 
parallel preclinical trial, the Waldmann Group administered a combination therapy of 
alemtuzumab with rhIL-15 in the MET-1 bearing xenograft model in wild-type SCID/NOD mice 
(Figure 5). Again, there was an augmentation of survival of the combination of IL-15 with 
alemtuzumab compared to either element alone. The efficacy was lost in FcRγ-/- mice, further 
supporting the hypothesis that the efficacy was due to augmented ADCC.
Additionally, Jochems C, et al. analyzed the in vitro ADCC capacity of an IgG1 anti-PD-L1 
antibody structurally similar to avelumab with and without IL-15, and compared it to that of a 
fusion protein consisting of the anti-PD-L1 and a TGF-beta trap(49). IL-15/IL-15R alpha IgFc 
enhanced the ADCC capacity of both molecules, making them equal.
Figure 4:   Addition of IL-15 increased ADCC and antitumor efficacy of cancer-directed monoclonal 
antibodies.EL4 leukemic cells were transfected with human CD20 and administered intravenously into 
immunologically intact mice. Mice treated with either IL-15 alone (yellow) or rituximab (anti-CD20) alone 
(red) showed modest prolongation of survival. This prolongation was markedly augmented when the two 
agents were administered together (green).

212.1.2.7 Patients with known CNS involvement should be excluded from this clinical trial because 
of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic 
dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events 
2.1.2.8 Patients with previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy within the last 
5 years with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical 
carcinoma in situ 
2.1.2.9 Patients with history of any organ transplantation, including allogenic stem cell 
transplantation 
2.1.2.10 Received a live vaccine within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab. Vaccination with a 
live vaccine while on trial is prohibited. NOTE: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection 
are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza 
vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed
2.1.2.11 Patients with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or 
biologic composition to rhIL-15 or avelumab

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
In patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell malignancies, IL-15 will be administered by 
continuous intravenous infusion in a dose-escalation 3 + 3 system with a starting dose of 1 
mcg/kg/day, a second dose level of 2 mcg/kg/day, a third dose level at 3 mcg/kg/day, and a fourth 
dose level at 4 mcg/kg/day on days 1-5 of each of six cycles. Avelumab (IV over 1 hour) will be 
administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 8 and 22 of the cycle. Treatment will continue for a 
maximum of 6 cycles or until toxicity (i.e., dose limiting toxicity as found in Section 3.1.1 or 
toxicity requiring hold as defined in Section 3.3) or progressive disease.
Day of cycle: 
3.1.1 Dose-Limiting Toxicity
A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as:  any grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity if not incontrovertibly 
due to disease progression or an extraneous cause, and deemed possibly, probably or definitely 
related to IL-15 or avelumab by the PI or designee during the first 28 days of treatment, with the 
following exceptions.:
3.1.1.1 Hematologic exceptions 
Grade 3 or 4 lymphocytopenia without clinical signs of infection grade 2 or above.
orhIL-15 and avelumab will be continued in the event of asymptomatic grade 3 
or 4 lymphocytopenia, unless there are clinical signs of significant infection 
(persistent fevers, labile blood pressure, localized complaints or findings on 
physical examination, hypoxia or organ dysfunction).
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia without clinical signs of infection grade 2 or above.
orhIL-15 and avelumab will be continued in the event of grade 3 neutropenia 
unless there are clinical signs of significant infection, as listed above.
Grade 3 leukocytosis (WBC > 100,000/mm3) in the absence of signs of leukostasis or 
other toxicities possibly related to the expansion of activated cells 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
273.1.1.2 Non-Hematologic exceptions
Transient (< 24 hours) grade 3 hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, 
hyponatremia or hypophosphatemia which responds to medical intervention. rhIL-15 
and avelumab will be continued while the metabolic abnormalities are corrected by 
intravenous or oral supplementation 
Non-sustained (< 7 days) grade 3 liver function test (ATL, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
total or direct bilirubin) abnormalities deemed unrelated or unlikely related to 
avelumab, in the absence of clinical signs of hepatic dysfunction (lethargy, confusion, 
anorexia, pruritus, tremor); for patients with baseline grade 1 elevations, any increase 
≥ 10 x baseline will be considered dose-limiting and these patients will be closely 
monitored for liver function abnormalities. rhIL-15 and avelumab will be continued as 
long as these abnormalities do not persist for more than 7 days or the patient does not 
exhibit findings consistent with hepatic toxicity
Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in 
Section 3.3. Occurrence of any DLT-defining toxicity after the first 28 days of treatment will lead 
to permanent discontinuation of protocol therapy; however, will not be deemed a DLT for purposes 
of dose escalation.
3.1.2 Dose Escalation
Dose escalation will proceed according to the following schedule (Table 2). Dose escalation will 
follow the following guidelines (Table 3:  Dose Escalation ). DLT is defined above. Dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT) is defined above. Each patient will continue treatment at the dose level they were 
enrolled – there will be no intra-patient dose escalation.
The MTD is the dose level at which no more than 1 of up to 6 patients experience DLT during the 
DLT evaluation window(s), or the dose below that at which at least 2 (of ≤6) patients have DLT. 
The protocol will be amended to note the MTD once determined.

>2 Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be 
declared the maximally administered dose (highest dose 
administered).  Three (3) additional patients will be 
entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients 
were treated previously at that dose.
1 out of 3 Enter at least 3 more patients at this dose level.
If 0 of these 3 patients experience DLT, proceed to 
the next dose level.
If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose 
escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared the 
maximally administered dose.  Three (3) additional 
patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level 
if only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose.
≤1 out of 6 at highest dose level below 
the maximally administered doseThis is generally the recommended phase 2 dose. At 
least 6 patients must be entered at the recommended 
phase 2 dose.
3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
Each cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). The minimum window between initiation of new cycles is 26 
days; a cycle delay due to scheduling or other administrative reasons (i.e., reasons other than 
toxicity/dose management as defined below) is 7 days. 
Treatment will be administered on an inpatient basis during week 1 of the first cycle, and as 
outpatient during subsequent weeks and cycles unless decided otherwise by the principal 
investigator based on clinical judgment. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described 
in Sections 14. Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 3.3. No investigational or 
commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the 
intent to treat the patient's malignancy. See Table 4 below for description of drug regimen.

29For a full detailed product description and administration guidelines, see Section 14. Infusions may 
be done peripherally or via central venous access device (if present; not required to be placed by 
the study). When administered on an outpatient basis, rhIL-15 will be infused via an ambulatory 
infusion pump.
3.2.1 Prophylactic and supportive care for IL-15
Patients will be given acetaminophen 500-650mg IV or orally, 30-60 minutes prior to each IL-15 
infusion (including bag changes) as first line. Ibuprofen 400 or 600mg orally may be given in 
addition to or instead of acetaminophen, depending on reactions with acetaminophen as 
premedication. 
3.2.2 Prophylactic and supportive care for avelumab
In order to mitigate infusion related reactions, a premedication with an antihistamine and with 
acetaminophen 30 to 60 minutes prior to the first 4 infusions of avelumab is mandatory (e.g., 25-
50 mg diphenhydramine and 500-650 mg acetaminophen IV or orally). At the discretion of the 
investigator, famotidine 20 mg PO or IV (or other H2 receptor blocker of equivalent efficacy) may 
also be administered 30 minutes prior to avelumab. Premedication should be administered for 
subsequent avelumab infusions based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior 
infusion reactions. 
3.2.3 Other modalities or procedures
Patients will be observed in the day hospital or the inpatient unit for at least 30 minutes 
after administration of avelumab for potential infusion-related reactions
Avelumab should be administered in a setting that allows for immediate access to an 
intensive care unit or equivalent environment and administration of therapy for 
anaphylaxis, such as the ability to implement immediate resuscitation measures.  Steroids 
(dexamethasone 10 mg), epinephrine (1:1,000 dilution), allergy medications (IV 
antihistamines), bronchodilators, or equivalents, and oxygen should be available for 
immediate access. 
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS
If one study agent is held, the other must be held as well.  The maximum time agents may be 
held cannot exceed 6 weeks.  Patients who exceed 6 weeks must be removed from the study 
(section 3.7).
3.3.1 rhIL-15-specific Adverse Events
Please refer to the Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risk list (CAEPR) for rhIL-15 
presented in Section 14.1.2.
Dose of rhIL-15 is based on the dose level and patient’s weight at the beginning of each cycle and 
can only be modified for rounding and/or consistency with prior cycles, and not for adverse events 
or renal/hepatic dysfunction. Infusion may continue during correction of electrolyte and other 
laboratory abnormalities listed in Section 3.1.1. Infusion may be interrupted for up to two hours 
each day, but treatment should end 120 (±1) hours after initiation on Day 1.
Note: IL-15 should not be administered within 1 week of steroid administration when steroids are 
given to treat avelumab toxicities as listed in the Section 3.3.2.

indicated; intervention not indicated.Decrease the avelumab infusion rate by 50% 
and monitor closely for any worsening.
Grade 2 – moderate
Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (for 
example, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV 
fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for  24 h.Temporarily discontinue avelumab infusion.
Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate 
once infusion-related reaction has resolved 
or decreased to at least Grade 1 in severity, 
and monitor closely for any worsening.
Grade 3 or Grade 4 – severe or life-threatening
Grade 3: Prolonged (for example, not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief 
interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms 
following initial improvement; hospitalization 
indicated for clinical sequelae.
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.Stop avelumab infusion immediately and 
disconnect infusion tubing from the subject.
Subjects have to be withdrawn immediately 
from study avelumab and must not receive 
any further avelumab treatment.
NOTE:  If avelumab infusion rate has been decreased by 50% or interrupted due to an infusion reaction, it must 
remain decreased for the next scheduled infusion.  If no infusion reaction is observed in the next scheduled 
infusion, the infusion rate may be returned to baseline at the subsequent infusions based on investigator’s 
medical judgment.
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subject must be treated according to the best available medical practice.

3.4 ON STUDY EVALUATIONS
Prior to avelumab administration (Day 8 and 22), pre-dose assessments must be performed (up to 
3 days prior). After Cycle 1, pre-dose assessments may be performed up to 3 days prior to a cycle 
except where otherwise noted. The results from all procedures/tests must be reviewed prior to 
initiation of each cycle of treatment for consideration of dose modifications and delay of therapy. 
Treatment with rhIL-15 and avelumab will continue for six cycles or until disease progression, 
unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or other reasons outlined in Section 3.8.1.
Refer to the Study Calendars (Section 3.6) for a complete list of procedures to be performed at 
each scheduled study visit. See also Section 5 for all samples to be collected for correlative 
research. During treatment, it is expected that all laboratory and clinical assessments be conducted 
at the NIH (including post-treatment imaging evaluations); results from outside NIH will only be 
accepted at the discretion of the investigator.

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
383.5 POST-TREATMENT EVALUATIONS
Post-treatment evaluations (i.e., End of Treatment Visit) will be performed approximately 30 days 
after the last dose of protocol treatment in all subjects. If a subject initiates a new anti-cancer 
therapy within 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment, the 30-day safety follow-up visit must 
occur before the first dose of the new therapy.  If the patient cannot return to the Clinical Center 
for this visit, a request will be made to have a local physician or laboratory collect a CBC with 
differential and send the results. If this is not possible, patients may be assessed by telephone for 
symptoms.
Unless otherwise noted for subjects who come off treatment without evidence of disease 
progression, follow-up will occur at the following time point: every 60 days (± 7 days) for 6 
months; then every 90 days (± 14 days) for 2 years; then every six months (± 28 days) for 2 years, 
then annually (±6 weeks) at the discretion of the investigator. See Section 3.5.3.  Any other 
evaluations and tests should be performed as clinically indicated. 
Upon disease progression or initiation of other anti-cancer therapy, contact will be for survival 
only (i.e., every 3 months [±4 weeks]) until the subject is off study; unless otherwise clinically 
indicated. See Section 3.5.4 and the Study Calendar (Section 3.6) for additional information. Any 
adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation should be followed in accordance 
with the safety requirements.  
3.5.1 Safety Follow-Up Visit
The safety follow-up visit should occur 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of trial treatment, or 
before the initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever comes first. Required testing is as 
noted in the Study Calendars (Section 3.6). All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow-Up Visit 
should be recorded.  Patients with an ongoing, treatment-related AE of Grade > 1 will be followed 
until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0-1, stabilization of the AE in the opinion of the investigator, 
or until the beginning of a new anti-neoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.  SAEs that occur 
within 30 days of the end of treatment or before initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment should 
also be followed and recorded. 
3.5.2 Extended Safety Follow-up
Given the potential risk for delayed immune-related toxicities, safety follow-up must be performed 
up to 90 (+14) days after the last dose of avelumab administration. This may be performed either 
via a clinic visit or via a telephone call with subsequent clinic visit requested in case any concerns 
are noted during the telephone call.
3.5.3 Follow-Up Visits- Prior to Disease Progression 
Patients who complete trial treatment without evidence of disease progression will move into the 
Follow-up Phase and may be assessed every 60 days (± 7 days) for 6 months; then every 90 days 
(± 14 days) for 2 years; then every six months (± 28 days) for 2 years, then annually (±6 weeks) 
after finishing treatment by radiologic imaging or other clinical assessments to monitor disease 
status. Imaging assessment will be performed at each scheduled post-treatment follow-up visit for 
up to 3 years. Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease status until the 
start of new anti-neoplastic therapy, disease progression, death, or end of the study If the patient 
cannot return to the Clinical Center for any of these visits, a request will be made to have a local 
physician or laboratory collect a CBC with differential and send the results. If this is not possible, 
patients may be assessed by telephone or email for symptoms.

Version Date:  09/23/2021
393.5.4 Follow-Up Visits – Survival/Post-Disease Progression
Once a subject experiences confirmed disease progression or starts a new anti-cancer therapy, the 
subject moves into the survival follow-up phase and should be contacted (e.g., phone, email, etc.; 
in-person visit not required) at least every 3 to 6 months to collect information on new anti-cancer 
treatments received and to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end 
of the study, whichever occurs first (see Study Calendar).

421 30 days (±7) following last dose, and 90 days (+14) after last dose of avelumab (via clinic or phone). If initiating new anti-cancer therapy within 30 days after last dose of 
avelumab, 30-day safety follow-up visit must occur before first dose of new therapy.
2 Screening and Baseline evaluations should be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment and dosing, respectively, unless otherwise noted and with the following exceptions:  
Confirmation of diagnosis (no time limit); HIV antibody, HTLV-1/2 serologies, Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C antibody, EKG, and bone marrow aspiration/biopsy 
(all within 3 months)  NOTE: Any screening tests performed within the specified time frame for baseline do not need to be repeated.
3 Within 14 days prior to dosing on C1D1, with the following exceptions:  Pregnancy test (within7 days of dosing; must be negative).
4 ± 4 days, from date of prior assessment. Confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. After completion of 
treatment, imaging assessment will be performed at each scheduled post-treatment follow-up visit for up to 3 years.
5 To be done at end of treatment (30 days after last dose of study treatment; may be combined with 30 day safety follow-up, if timing coincides). If subject to initiate new anti-
cancer therapy assessments should occur before the first dose of the new therapy.
6 Follow-up to occur about every 60 days (±7 days) for first 6 months, every 90 days (±14 days) for 2 years, then every 6 months (± 28 days) for another   2 years and then annually 
(± 6 weeks) until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy. After completion of treatment, imaging assessment will be performed at each scheduled post-
treatment follow-up visit for up to 3 years.
7 After disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, contact for survival about every 3 to 6 months (±4 weeks).
8 Pathologic review/confirmation of diagnosis by Laboratory of Pathology, NCI (no time limit). If archival sample is not available, a fresh tumor biopsy and/or peripheral blood 
sample will be obtained.
9 Physical exams to include medical history (i.e., complete at Screening/Baseline; interim on study and in follow-up), vitals, weight, and height (screening only). ECOG to be recorded 
at least once per cycle, on day 1, 8, and/or 22.
10 Chemistry panels include:  Acute care, Hepatic, and Mineral.
11 Diffusing capacity/alveolar volume (DLCO/VA), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) for patients with significant pulmonary or smoking history.
12 At screening a CT scans of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed (with IV and PO contrast, unless patient is allergic or has renal insufficiency; other imaging may 
be substituted at the discretion of the investigator). Other body areas may be imaged if clinically indicated. MRI of the brain is only required in patients with suspected involvement 
of CNS. Also, at screening, a FDG-PET/CT torso (extremities to be included if there is confirmed or suspected disease involvement). At baseline one or more of the following 
studies: CT, MRI, FDG-PET/CT and or clinical photography.
13 Patients with neurological symptoms or signs should undergo MRI scan of the brain and lumbar puncture.
14 Baseline bone marrow aspiration/ biopsy with flow cytometry must be done within 3 months prior to starting treatment. During post-treatment follow-up, repeat bone marrow 
aspiration/ biopsy needed only to confirm a CR.
15 Peripheral blood flow cytometry may be done for disease evaluation of patients who had circulating leukemic cells detected at baseline, and for patients with CTCL regardless of 
their baseline results.
16 To be performed in selected patients with cutaneous disease (as determined by PI or AI).
17 Dermatology assessment and Global/mSWAT scoring will be used instead of or in addition to radiologic evaluation for patients with predominantly cutaneous disease
18 Samples for correlative research are to be collected as indicated in Section 5. Prior biopsy specimen blocks will be used for PD-L1 staining if available. If archival tissue is not 
available or adequate, baseline punch biopsy of the skin or core needle biopsy of a lymph node/visceral lesion is required, otherwise this is optional.

433.7 COST AND COMPENSATION
3.7.1 Costs
NIH does not bill health insurance companies or participants for any research or related clinical 
care that participants receive at the NIH Clinical Center.  If some tests and procedures performed 
outside the NIH Clinical Center, participants may have to pay for these costs if they are not 
covered by insurance company.  Medicines that are not part of the study treatment will not be 
provided or paid for by the NIH Clinical Center.    
3.7.2 Compensation
Participants will not be compensated on this study.
3.7.3 Reimbursement
The NCI will cover the costs of some expenses associated with protocol participation.  Some of 
these costs may be paid directly by the NIH and some may be reimbursed to the 
participant/guardian as appropriate.  The amount and form of these payments are determined by 
the NCI Travel and Lodging Reimbursement Policy.   
3.8 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY C RITERIA
Prior to removal from study, effort must be made to have all patients complete a safety visit 
approximately 30 days following the last dose of study therapy. Additional safety visits and follow-
up will continue as per Section 3.5.
3.8.1 Criteria for removal from protocol therapy
Patients who meet the following criteria should be discontinued from protocol therapy:
Completion of protocol therapy (i.e., up to 6 cycles) 
Confirmed disease progression
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment
Unacceptable toxicities as listed in Section 3.1.1 or those toxicities listed in Section 3.3 
that require treatment to be stopped
More than 6 weeks has elapsed since the patient received protocol therapy
Subject’s request to withdraw from protocol therapy
Investigator’s decision to withdraw the patient
Subject’s non-compliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements that requires 
removal in the opinion of the PI
Pregnancy
The drug manufacturer can no longer proved the study agent
Study is cancelled for any reason 
3.8.2 Off-Study Criteria
Subject requests to be withdrawn from study
Subject is lost to follow-up
Death

Version Date:  09/23/2021
44Study is cancelled for any reason
3.8.3 Lost to Follow-up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to return for two consecutive 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site staff. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:
The site will attempt to contact the participant within 3 business days to reschedule the 
missed visit, and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s 
medical record or study file. 
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.
4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during 
the ongoing trial, with the exception of oral or parenteral steroids if they are administered more 
than 7 days before the start of or more than 7 days after the end of IL-15 infusion (Note: 
Dexamethasone for treatment or prophylaxis of avelumab-associated infusion reactions may be 
administered at any time). If there is a clinical indication for a prohibited medication/ measure 
during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy may be required.
For premedication and supportive care measures, see Section 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.
4.1 ACCEPTABLE M EDICATIONS
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be administered 
at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care.  All 
concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, 
over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications.   If changes occur during the 
trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the 
CRF.
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment and 
30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded.  
4.2 PROHIBITED MEDICATIONS
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during treatment on this trial:
Other therapy for the disease under study not specified in this protocol, unless specifically 
noted as permitted
Investigational agents other than rhIL-15 and avelumab

45NOTE: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion may be allowed at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating 
in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: 
measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, typhoid vaccine and 
FluMist. 
Patients who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study treatment. Patients may 
receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.
5 CORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RESEARCH
5.1 BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION
This study will attempt to use rhIL-15 to increase NK cell number and activity, thereby enhancing 
the ADCC of avelumab in treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory mature T-cell 
malignancies. ADCC capacity of ex vivo PBMCs will be tested on PD-L1-expressing cell lines 
before, during and after protocol treatment. Differences in immune cell subsets associated with 
administration will be followed throughout treatment to both study the effects of combined rhIL-
15/avelumab therapy on the immune system, and to identify potential biomarkers that would be 
predictive of response.

5.2.6 Tissue Samples
5.2.6.1 PDL-1 testing for immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Archival block(s) or slides (i.e., at least 15 unstained slides, 5-microns) is required at 
baseline. Patients with prior skin, lymph node, or visceral biopsies performed at NIH or 
outside institutions must make specimen blocks available to the NCI Pathology 
Department for analysis. If no prior biopsies are available at the time of screening, patients 
with Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and other lymphoma with skin involvement will undergo 
a punch biopsy of a skin lesion, performed by an NIH Clinical Center dermatologist. 
Patients with lymph node and/or visceral involvement will undergo an 18g core biopsy 
performed by the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences’ Interventional 
Radiologists (IR). An optional biopsy may be performed in the same manner prior to the 
second dose of avelumab (Cycle 1, Day 22).
Prior specimen blocks will be sent to NCI Pathology Department via Fedex. For patients 
with no prior samples who undergo biopsy as part of screening (if needed for diagnosis) or 
baseline, core tumor tissue (or bone marrow aspirate/biopsy) samples will be collected and 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
49placed in appropriate media (e.g., RPMI 1640 with 10% human serum and antibiotics, and 
formalin) and processed per established techniques.  As indicated (Sections 5.1 and 5.2), 
samples will be sent to the Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM)/ NCI Laboratory 
of Pathology (LP) for concurrent routine histologic analysis and reporting and IHC testing 
for PD-L1 expression by tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells in addition to 
research testing (i.e., Waldmann Lab).
5.2.7 Other Samples
5.2.7.1 Germline DNA
Germline DNA will be collected by blood, buccal swab, and/or saliva samples (preferred).  These 
will ideally be collected at baseline; however, may be collected at any point on study based on 
supplies.  Standardized, commercial collection kits or tubes will be used (e.g., 1, 5-10 mL K 2EDTA 
tube for blood; Isohelix SK-1 for buccal swabs; Salviette/Oragene® for saliva).  In the case of 
buccal swabs, two (2) samples may be collected in order to ensure adequate DNA collection.    
The samples will be processed and DNA extracted/isolated per kit instructions and established 
techniques. 
5.3 BIOMARKER AND RESEARCH METHODS
The technology platforms that are able to interrogate genomic structure and function are constantly 
in flux; therefore, the exact nature of the methodologies that will be employed will be assessed at 
the time that the samples are collected and ready for analysis. The protocol will be amended at that 
time, if needed, to describe the intended techniques prior to initiating the analyses
The following are technologies that are currently in use for each planned analysis:  
5.3.1 Molecular Profiling
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, including FISH and/or PCR testing, will take part in tumor 
tissue samples, including but not necessarily limited to CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD14, 
CD16, CD20, CD25, CD38, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD56, CD62L, CD69, CD79a/CD79b, CD122, 
Foxp3, perforin, gamma/delta, CXCR3, CCR4, and NKG2D.
5.3.2 Immune Subset Analysis
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be assessed using multiparameter flow cytometry 
for immune subsets including but not necessarily limited to CD8+ T-cells, CD4+Foxp3- T-cells, 
Tregs, T ex, Th1, Th2 and Th17+ CD4+ T-cells, NK cells and subsets, monocyte subsets, MDSC 
subsets. Assessment may include functional markers, i.e. PD-1, Tim-3, CTLA-4, PD-L1, HLA-
DR, Ki67 and/or CD40.
5.3.3 ADCC Analysis
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) should be isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque Density 
Gradient Centrifugation. The viable cells should be viably frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. 
The ADCC assay will be performed on the same occasion for all samples of a given patient. Vials 
of frozen cells will be thawed using standard procedures 18 hours before the assay in accord with 
our experience with normal donors. 1.5 million of patient’s PBMCs obtained before and on day 
15 following IL-15 injection will be tested in aliquots as follows:  
Tested alone

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
50Tested with untreated PD-L1-expressing Raji cells, and with the Raji cells coated with 
avelumab for 5 hours. 
In addition, we may utilize an ATL cell line in addition to Raji cells.  These cell populations 
will be stained with CD107, CD3, CD56, and CD94.
5.3.4 cfDNA/ctDNA and PBMC banking
Since the methods of molecular monitoring in the peripheral blood is an emerging field with 
numerous technologies under development, the storage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC), serum, and plasma will all be performed allowing for future comparison of the different 
compartments for analytes that include cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and RNA 
sequencing of circulating tumor cells. Studies to be performed on these samples include: 
cfDNA/ctDNA for liquid genotyping as a non-invasive dynamic monitoring of disease as well as 
monitoring for individual molecular aberrations that herald progression or disease transformation; 
specifically, amplification and sequencing of the VDJ segment of the immunoglobulin receptor is 
planned. Germline DNA obtained from saliva, blood, or buccal mucosa will be used to 
discriminate somatic from germline mutations during cfDNA and ctDNA analyses. Keeping in 
mind a recent report of immune checkpoint inhibition in a patient with a solid tumor being 
associated with T-cell lymphomagenesis (50), and with our own group’s experience with rapid 
progression in 3 patients with ATLL treated with ICI (22, 51), special attention will be paid to 
following T-cell clonality using amplification and sequencing of the complementarity determining 
region 3 (CDR3) in both cfDNA and banked PBMCs. 
5.3.5 DNA/RNA Sequencing 
Genomic DNA and total RNA will be extracted from tumor samples using a Qiagen All-prep kit. 
For individual target genes that are recurrently mutated in T-cell malignancies, classical Sanger 
sequencing will be performed on PCR amplicons, using primers surrounding the known sites of 
mutation. To broadly assess mutations, next generation sequencing (e.g., on an Illumina HiSeq 
2000 platform) will be employed, using a paired end sequencing strategy of libraries constructed 
from tumor DNA. DNA will either be sequenced in its entirety from a whole genome library or 
will be first enriched for exonic sequences using the Agilent Sure Select system, aiming for 30X 
or 100X average coverage per base, respectively. The sequence fragments will be mapped back to 
the genome using the BWA algorithm. Of sequences overlapping a particular base pair in the 
genome, the percent mutant calls greater that 20% with a minimum of 25X coverage will be 
considered as an arbitrary threshold for single nucleotide variants (SNVs). SNVs that are not 
present in the matched normal sample will be considered candidate somatic mutations. 
A related technology, RNA-Seq, utilizes RNA from the tumor specimen to create a cDNA library 
for high-throughput sequencing. RNA-seq will be performed using Illumina kits followed by high-
throughput sequencing on an Illumina HighSeq 2000 machine. The cutoffs for coverage and 
percent mutant calls mentioned above will also be used to identify putative SNVs. RNA 
sequencing will also be used to read out digital gene expression across the genome as described.
Recent advances in genomic technologies enable GEP at the single cell level, a distinct advantage 
over conventional GEP which cannot always distinguish tumor vs non-tumor gene expression.  
Single-cell approaches allow identification of the evolution of rare populations of resistant tumor 
cells, as well as identification of TME cells critical for the survival of the tumor. The Center for 
Cancer Research (CCR) has recently opened a single cell analysis core facility with expert staff 
headed by Dr. Michael Kelly within the CCR Genomics Core.  This facility has the ability to take 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
51purified viably frozen cells banked from patient biopsies and prepare them, using well-validated 
10X Genomics technology, for single-cell RNA sequencing.  This core is directly integrated with 
the NCI Sequencing core facility to provide high-quality, deep-sequencing of the single cell RNA-
SEQ samples, as well as ‘first-pass’ data processing and analysis.  Data will then be transferred to 
lymphoma researchers and bio-informaticians for further analysis of gene expression patterns and 
cellular population dynamics.
5.3.6 Other Analyses
Other analyses include the following:
Cell analysis and histological (e.g., H&E), immunohistochemical review and analysis per 
standard and established research techniques (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 expression [Dako], FISH 
for del(17p), and other IHC analyses in blood and tissue).
Cytokine analysis (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, interferon beta, TNF-alpha)
5.3.7 Future Use
Any blood, tissue, or other products or portions leftover from other analyses will be stored for 
future research.  
5.4 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING, AND DISPOSITION
5.4.1 General
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system. 
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed. Samples 
will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/ or agreements, if required.
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens that are 
remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described below. The 
study will remain open so long as sample or data analysis continues. Samples from consenting 
subjects will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent 
for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed. 
If the patient withdraws consent the participant’s data will be excluded from future distributions, 
but data that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be able to be 
retrieved.
The PI will record any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples as a deviation.  Reporting will 
be per the requirements in section 7.2.  
5.4.2 Lymphoid Malignancies Branch – Waldmann Laboratory
Under the direction of Dr. Waldmann, all samples processed by the laboratory will be uniquely 
barcoded, with data entered using a secure computerized database and backup hardcopy process 
per standard laboratory practice.  
Samples are stored in labeled boxes in secured freezers (i.e., -20ºC to -80ºC, or other, as 
appropriate) according to stability requirements; these freezers are located onsite.  Access to stored 
clinical samples is restricted and limited to research personnel for approved analyses only (as per 
the IRB approved protocol).

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
52Upon completion of planned analyses by the Waldmann lab, leftover samples may be stored for 
future analyses at the Clinical Support Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.in Frederick, 
MD (see below).
5.4.3 Clinical Support Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. in Frederick, MD

cryopreserves samples in support of IRB-approved, NCI clinical trialsThe laboratory is CLIA 
certified for anti-IL15 and certain cytokine measurements, and all laboratory areas operate under 
a Quality Assurance Plan with documented Standard Operating Procedures that are reviewed 
annually. Laboratory personnel are assessed for competency prior to being permitted to work with 
patient samples. Efforts to ensure protection of patient information include:
The laboratory is located in a controlled access building and laboratory doors are kept 
locked at all times. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by laboratory 
staff at all times.
Hard copy records or electronic copies of documents containing patient information are 
kept in the locked laboratory or other controlled access locations.
An electronic database is used to store information related to patient samples processed by 
the laboratory.
The database resides on a dedicated program server that is kept in a central, locked 
computer facility.
The facility is supported by two IT specialists who maintain up to date security features 
including virus and firewall protection.
Program access is limited to specified computers as designated by the laboratory director. 
Each of these computers has a password restricted login screen.
The database sample entry program itself is accessed through a password protected entry 
screen.
Upon specimen receipt each sample is assigned a unique, sequential laboratory accession 
ID number. All products generated by the laboratory that will be stored either in the 
laboratory freezers or at a central repository facility are identified by this accession ID.
Inventory information will be stored at the vial level and each vial will be labeled with both 
a sample ID and a vial sequence number.
Vial labels do not contain any personal identifier information.
Samples are stored inventoried in locked laboratory freezers and are routinely transferred 
to the NCI-Frederick repository facilities for long term storage.
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Investigators establish sample collections 
under “Source Codes” and the Principal Investigator who is responsible for the collections 
specifies who has access to the collection. 
Specific permissions will be required to view, input or withdraw samples from a collection. 
Sample withdrawal requests submitted to approved laboratory staff by anyone other than 
the repository source code owner are submitted to the source code owner for approval. The 
repository facility will also notify the Source Code holder of any submitted requests for 
sample withdrawal.
It is the responsibility of the Source Code holder (the NCI Principal Investigator) to ensure 
that samples requested and approved for withdrawal are being used in a manner consistent 
with IRB approval.
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
53The Clinical Support Laboratory does perform testing services that may be requested by 
clinical investigators including, but not limited to, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry 
and cytokine testing using ELISA or multiplex platforms.
When requests are submitted by the NCI investigator for shipment of samples outside of 
the NIH it is the policy of the laboratory to request documentation that a Material Transfer 
Agreement is in place that covers the specimen transfer. The laboratory does not provide 
patient identifier information as part of the transfer process but may, at the discretion of 
the NCI investigator, group samples from individual patients when that is critical to the 
testing process.
The NCI investigator responsible for the sample collection is responsible for ensuring 
appropriate approvals and/ or agreements are in place, if required, prior to requesting the 
laboratory to ship samples outside of the NIH.
5.4.4 Hematopathology Section of the Laboratory of Pathology (Tissue samples)
Archival and/or freshly collected and processed tumor tissue may be stored in the 
Hematopathology Section of Laboratory of Pathology until ready for planned and/or future 
research assays if the patient has agreed to allowing specimens to be used in future research studies.  
IRB approval will be obtained before using any samples to conduct studies that are not described 
within this protocol.  Samples will be stored under conditions appropriate to the type of sample 
and processing (e.g., ambient or frozen).
Tissue that is given to the technician will be assigned an accession number (HP#) in the HP Case 
Logbook; sample tracking also takes place with a FileMaker Pro data base called HP Patient 
Information and Specimen Inventory.   A Patient background sheet may be filled out and filed with 
any accompanying paperwork, with final reports and any supplemental reports that follow added 
as completed.
5.5 SAMPLES FOR GENETIC/GENOMIC ANALYSIS
5.5.1 Description of the scope of genetic/genomic analysis
The research correlates for this study are expected to include DNA/RNA sequencing of tumors, 
including circulating tumor (ct) DNA. In addition, whole exome sequencing may include 
evaluation for known lymphoma mutations. For any genetic studies performed, the results will be 
deposited in a database such as dbGaP per NIH requirements.  Although there is controlled access 
to such a database, such a submission carries theoretical risks of revealing the identity of the 
subject.  This is discussed in the consent.
5.5.2 Description of how privacy and confidentiality of medical information/biological 
specimens will be maximized
Confidentiality for genetic samples will be maintained as described (Section 5.4.2).  In addition, a 
Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained for this study.
5.5.3 Management of Results
Subjects will be contacted if a clinically actionable gene variant is discovered. Clinically 
actionable findings for this study are defined as disorders appearing in the American College of 
Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for the return of incidental findings that is 
current at the time of primary analysis. (A list of current guidelines is maintained on the CCR 
intranet: https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/CCRCRO/Incidental+Findings+Lists ).

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
545.5.4 Genetic Counseling
Subjects will be contacted with a request to provide a blood sample to be sent to a CLIA certified 
laboratory.  If the research findings are verified in the CLIA certified lab, the subject will be offered 
the opportunity to come to NIH to have genetic education and counseling to explain this result; at 
the time of any such event(s), these activities will be funded by the NCI/CCR in consideration of 
the specific circumstances.  If the subject does not want to come to NIH, a referral to a local genetic 
healthcare provider will be provided (at their expense).
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No 
interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis.
6 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION
6.1 DATA COLLECTION
6.1.1 Summary
The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into an in-house password protected 
electronic system (C3D) and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness. The principal 
investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted data manager will assist 
with the data management efforts. Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that 
research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant.
All adverse events (AEs), including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory 
evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of 
event.   
Document AEs from the first study intervention through 30 days after the last study intervention 
was administered.  Beyond 30 days after the last intervention, only adverse events which are 
serious and related to the study intervention need to be recorded.
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA regulations, and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable. 
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, this will be reported expeditiously per 
requirements in section 7.2.
6.1.2 Data Collection/Recording Exceptions
6.1.2.1 Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE only if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following:

_X_ Before publication.
_X_ At the time of publication or shortly thereafter.
6.2.2 Genomic Data Sharing Plan
Unlinked genomic data will be deposited in public genomic databases such as dbGaP in 
compliance with the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy.
6.3 RESPONSE C RITERIA
6.3.1 Response Assessments 
Tumor response will be assessed by the investigator using the RECIL 2017 criteria (52) for all 
patients with T-cell lymphoma other than CTCL. Global Response Score (53), and modified 
severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) (11) will be used for patients with CTCL. Patient 
will be re-evaluated for response as outlined in the Study Calendar, Section 3.6.
6.3.2 Response Criteria for PTCL and ALCL
RECIL 2017 criteria (52) use the Deauville five-point scale for assessment of response via FDG-
PET. The five-point scale (5-PS) has been validated for use at interim staging and at the end of 
treatment and was adopted as the preferred reporting method at the First International Workshop 
on PET in Lymphoma in Deauville, France (i.e., Deauville criteria), and in several international 
trials.

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
56The 5-PS PS scores the most intense uptake in a site of initial disease:
1. if present, as follows: no uptake or no residual uptake (when used at interim)
2. slight uptake, but below blood pool (mediastinum)
3. uptake above mediastinal, but below or equal to uptake in the liver
4. uptake slightly to moderately higher than liver
5. markedly increased uptake or any new lesion (on response evaluation) 
The sum of longest diameter (SLD) is used for assessment of tumor burden. In patients with 
disseminated disease, a maximum of three target lesions should be selected and used to estimate 
tumor response. Target lesions should be selected from those with the largest size that can be 
reproducibly measured and preferably representing multiple sites and/organs. In most cases, lymph 
nodes can be considered target lesions if the lymph node longest diameter measures ≥15 mm. A 
lymph node measuring between 10 and 14 mm is considered abnormal but should not be selected 
as a target lesion. Lymph nodes measuring <10 mm in diameter are considered normal. In certain 
anatomical sites (inguinal, axillary, and portocaval), normal lymph nodes may exist in a narrow, 
elongated form, and such nodes should not be selected as target lesions if alternatives are available. 
Extranodal lesions are selected as target lesions if they have soft tissue component, based on their 
size, and the ease of reproducibility of repeated measurements, with a minimum measurement of 
the longest diameter of ≥ 15 mm. All other lesions should be identified as nontarget lesions and 
should be recorded at baseline, without the need to measure them. Nontarget lesions should be 
followed and reported as present, absent, or clear progression.

576.3.3 Response Criteria for CTCL
Global Response (GR) score (APPENDIX C ) will be used for assessing response in patients 
with CTCL (53). GR score incorporates separate responses in each component of the TNBM 
staging (i.e., skin, nodes, viscera and blood; APPENDIX C ). No patient with a global OR should 
have less than a PR in the skin.
The mSWAT (11) is an instrument utilized to track the skin tumor burden in MF/SS. It measures 
the percentage total body-surface area (TBSA, %) involvement separately for patches, plaques, 
and tumors within 12 body regions using the patient's palm and fingers representing 1% of TBSA. 
Patients with erythroderma are assessed for percentage of TBSA involved with patches and/or 
plaques. The percentage of TBSA for each lesion type is multiplied by a number (patch = 1, plaque 
= 2; tumor = 4) and summed to derive the mSWAT score. The mSWAT for each patient will be 
determined by the same individual at all study visits.
A complete response (CR) requires 100% clearing of skin disease and a partial response (PR) 
requires ≥ 50% reduction in the mSWAT score compared with baseline. CR/PR requires 
confirmation by repeat assessment after ≥ 4 weeks. Stable disease is defined as less than 50% 
reduction to less than 25% increase in the mSWAT score compared with baseline. PD is defined 
as ≥ 25% increase in the mSWAT score from baseline or ≥ 50% increase in the sum of the products 
of the greatest diameters of pathologically positive lymph nodes compared with baseline.
Time to response is the time from the first treatment dose until the patient first meets the criteria 
for a 50% decrease in the GR score. The duration of response (DOR) is the time from first CR/PR 
until the GR score is increased from nadir to more than 50% of the difference between the baseline 
and nadir scores. Time to progression (TTP) is the time from start of treatment until PD. If patients 
goes off treatment for any purpose, this date is used for determination of TTP and/or DOR.
As “skin flares” have been described in patients with SS receiving the anti-PD-1 antibody 
Pembrolizumab (18), patients with SS whose only sign of PD is an increase in mSWAT score (i.e., 
who have normal/decreasing number of circulating Sézary cells) will continue treatment and be 
re-evaluated in 2-4 weeks to confirm disease progression. Patients whose PD is not confirmed on 
re-evaluation will be noted to have had a skin flare

1 Any size lesion without induration or significant elevation above the surrounding uninvolved skin; poikiloderma 
may be present
2 Any size lesion that is elevated or indurated; crusting, ulceration, or poikiloderma may be present.
3 Any solid or nodular lesion > 1cm in diameter with evidence of deep infiltration in the skin and/or vertical 
growth.
6.3.4 Rapid progression
As recent preclinical data has shown that PD-1 may act as a tumor suppressor in T-cell 
malignancies(21), and three patients with ATLL who received the anti-PD-1 antibody Nivolumab 
experienced progression of disease shortly after receiving the first dose ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
unpublished data), rapid progression will be followed as a distinct outcome. Rapid progression is 
defined as any PD within 14 days of the first avelumab administration (i.e., up to and including 
Cycle 1, Day 21), excluding skin flares. Patients who are suspected of having a skin flare during 
this period but have confirmed PD on re-evaluation will be noted to have had rapid progression.
6.3.5 Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.
6.3.6 Duration of Response
The duration of response (DOR) is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR 
or PR (whichever is recorded first) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started), death, or, in the absence of PD, date of last assessment.
6.3.7 Progression-Free Survival
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from the date of study enrollment 
until time of disease relapse, disease progression, or death, whichever occurs first.
6.3.8 Overall Survival
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment until time of death 
from any cause.
6.3.9 Event-Free Survival
Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the duration of time from the date of study enrollment until 
time of disease relapse, disease progression, alternative therapy for lymphoma given (such as 
radiation), or death, whichever occurs first.
6.4 TOXICITY CRITERIA
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each 
patient while on the study.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common

608 SPONSOR SAFETY REPORTING
8.1 DEFINITIONS
8.1.1 Adverse Event
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product (ICH E6 (R2)).
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
Death,
A life-threatening adverse event (see 8.1.3)
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
oA hospitalization/admission that is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospitalization for pre-existing 
condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, without a serious deterioration 
in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.
oA hospitalization/admission that is solely driven by non-medical reasons (e.g., 
hospitalization for patient or subject convenience) is not considered a serious 
adverse event.
oEmergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in admission 
to the hospital would not be considered a serious adverse event. The reason for 
seeking medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other serious 
criteria.
Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions
A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
8.1.3 Life-threatening
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32).

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
618.1.4 Severity
The severity of each Adverse Event will be assessed utilizing the CTCAE version 5.
8.1.5 Relationship to Study Product
All AEs will have their relationship to study product assessed using the terms:  related or not 
related.  
Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse event. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study product and the adverse event.
Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
product caused the event.
8.2 ASSESSMENT OF S AFETY EVENTS
AE information collected will include event description, date of onset, assessment of severity and 
relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product), date of 
resolution of the event, seriousness and outcome. The assessment of severity and relationship to 
the study product will be done only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis 
and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.  AEs 
occurring during the collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless 
of relationship.  AEs will be followed through resolution.
SAEs will be:
Assessed for severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related 
to study product) by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site 
principal investigator or sub-investigator.
Recorded on the appropriate SAE report form, the medical record and captured in the 
clinical database.
Followed through resolution by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 
as the site principal investigator or sub-investigator.
For timeframe of recording adverse events, please refer to section 6.1.  All serious adverse events 
recorded from the time of first investigational product administration must be reported to the 
sponsor with the exception of any listed in section 8.4.
8.3 REPORTING OF SERIOUS A DVERSE EVENTS
Any AE that meets protocol-defined serious criteria or meets the definition of Adverse Event of 
Special Interest that require expedited reporting must be submitted immediately (within 24 hours 
of awareness) to OSRO Safety using the CCR SAE report form.  Any exceptions to the expedited 
reporting requirements are found in section 8.4.
All SAE reporting must include the elements described in section 8.2.
SAE reports will be submitted to the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at: 
OSROSafety@mail.nih.gov and to the CCR PI and study coordinator.  CCR SAE report form and 
instructions can be found at:

Version Date:  09/23/2021
62Following the assessment of the SAE by OSRO, other supporting documentation of the event may 
be requested by the OSRO Safety and should be provided as soon as possible.
8.4 WAIVER OF EXPEDITED REPORTING TO CCR
As death due to disease progression is part of the study objectives, and captured as an endpoint in 
this study, it will not be reported in expedited manner to the sponsor. However, if there is evidence 
suggesting a causal relationship between the study drug and the event, report the event in an 
expedited manner according to section 8.3.

Safety Reports submitted to the FDA should be forwarded electronically to 
CTEPSupportAE@tech-res.com (please provide protocol number in subject line).
9. Any abstracts, manuscripts, and publications.
Additional safety and efficacy data may also be requested by CTEP to facilitate the development 
of the Clinical Material across CTEP supported trials.
8.6 REPORTING PREGNANCY
All required pregnancy reports/follow-up to OSRO will be submitted to: 
OSROSafety@mail.nih.gov and to the CCR PI and study coordinator.  Forms and instructions 
can be found here: 
https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/CCRCRO/Forms+and+Instructions
8.6.1 Maternal Exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of 
when the Investigator becomes aware of it. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later 
than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy becomes known.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria (section 8.1.2) should be reported as 
SAEs. 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
64The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented.
8.6.2 Paternal Exposure
Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 30 
days after the last dose of rhIL-15 and/ or avelumab.
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until four months after the last 
dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented.
8.7 REGULATORY R EPORTING F OR S TUDIES C ONDUCTED UNDER CCR  SPONSORED IND
Following notification from the investigator, CCR, the IND sponsor, will report any suspected 
adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  CCR will report an AE as a suspected 
adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
product and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all 
investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to 21 CFR Part 312.32. 
All serious events will be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING 
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary and secondary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6 and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent 
verification of study data with source documentation focusing on:
Informed consent process
Eligibility confirmation
Drug administration and accountability
Adverse events monitoring
Response assessment.
The monitoring program also extends to multi-site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.
This trial will be monitored by personnel employed by a CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by training and experience to monitor the progress of clinical trials. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct. 
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS
Primary Endpoint(s): 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
65oMaximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rhIL-15 administered intravenously for 5 days 
in combination with avelumab for up to 6 cycles
oFrequency (number and percentage) of treatment-emergent AEs
Secondary Endpoint(s):
oOverall response rate (including CR and PR)
oOverall response rate in patients with ≥50% PD-L1-expressing tumor cells
oDuration of response
oProgression-free, event-free, and overall survival
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE D ETERMINATION
The MTD will be based on the assessment of DLT during the first cycle of treatment and will be 
defined as the dose level at which less than one-third of patients (0 of 3 or 0-1/6 patients) treated 
experience a DLT, with the next higher dose level demonstrating one-third or a greater number of 
patients (≥ 2-3 or ≥ 2-6 patients) having a DLT.  If a subject did not experience a DLT and did not 
finish one cycle of treatment (28 days) he or she will not be evaluable for determination of the 
MTD and would be replaced in the dose level.  An additional 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled at the 
MTD, so that a total of 9 patients will be treated at this dose. 
Using this dose-escalation scheme the probability of escalating to the next dose level will be based 
on the true rate of DLT at the current doses given by the following table (each group will be 
considered independently of the other); Thus, if the true underlying proportion of DLTs is 50% at 
the current dose there is a 17% probability of escalating to the next dose. 
True toxicity at a given dose 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%
Probability of escalating 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08
If all four dose levels are evaluated with 6 patients per dose level and 9 total patients at the MTD, 
a maximum of 27 evaluable patients will be enrolled. Similarly, if all dose levels are evaluated 
with 3 patients per dose level and 9 total patients at the MTD, the minimum number of evaluable 
patients required will be 18. To account of unevaluable patients, accrual ceiling will be set at 30. 
It is expected that the accrual can be completed in 24 months. 
A maximum of 30 patients will be enrolled over 24 months, at a rate of 1-2 patients per month.
10.3 POPULATION FOR ANALYSIS
10.3.1 Evaluable for toxicity: 
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with rhIL-15 and 
avelumab.
10.3.2 Evaluable for objective response: 
Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one 
cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. 
These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above, Section 
6.3. (NOTE:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of Cycle 1 will 
also be considered evaluable.)

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
6610.3.3 Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response:  
Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of 
measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-
evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target disease. The response assessment is based 
on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES
10.4.1 General Approach
The response rate will be determined and reported along with a 95% Agresti-Coull confidence 
interval (54). Other time-to-event outcomes will be reported using Kaplan-Meier curves.
10.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoints
Safety summaries will include summaries in the form of tables and listings. Reports will include 
the frequency (number and percentage) of treatment emergent AEs grouped by severity of the AE 
(per CTCAE, v5.0) and by relationship to study drug (e.g., either rhIL-15, avelumab, or both).
Laboratory shift tables containing counts and percentages will be prepared by treatment 
assignment, laboratory parameter, and time. Summary tables will be prepared for each laboratory 
parameter. Figures of changes in laboratory parameters over time will be generated.
Results of vital sign assessments, ECGs, and physical exams will be tabulated and summarized.
10.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
The duration of response (DOR; beginning at the date clinical response is first identified), overall 
survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), and progression free survival (PFS) will be estimated 
using Kaplan-Meier curves with appropriate confidence intervals reported.
Every report of response rates and time to progression should contain all patients included in the 
study. For the response calculation, the report should contain at least a section with all eligible 
patients. Another section of the report may detail the response rate for evaluable patients only.  
However, a response rate analysis based on a subset of patients must explain which patients were 
excluded and for which reasons.  95% confidence limits will be given.
10.4.4 Safety Analyses
The type, grade and frequency of toxicities will be reported.
10.4.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics (including means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables 
and proportions and CIs for discrete variables) will be used to summarize data as appropriate.
10.4.6 Planned Interim Analyses
No interim analyses are planned because of the single stage design of the trial.
10.4.7 Sub-Group Analyses
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed and reported separately according to the presenting 
diagnosis (PTCL-NOS, MF/SS, ALCL, or Other) and baseline PD-L1 expression (<1%, ≥1%, 
≥5%, ≥10%, ≥50%).  

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
6710.4.8 Tabulation of Individual Participant Data
None.
10.4.9 Exploratory Analyses
The exploratory objectives such as seeking to identify potential biomarkers or T-cell clones in 
peripheral blood which are associated with response, will be assessed using descriptive statistics 
as well as non-parametric methods such as exact Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The analyses will be 
done without formal adjustment for multiple comparisons, but in the context of the number of tests 
performed.
11 COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS
11.1 COOPERATIVE R ESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (CRADA)- EMD  SERONO
This study will be incorporated into an existing CRADA (#02666) between the National Cancer 
Institute and EMD Serono, the manufacturer of avelumab.
11.2 MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT (MTA)- CTEP
A MTA with Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) for the IL-15 was executed on 
June 8, 2018 .
12 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS
12.1 RATIONALE F OR S UBJECT SELECTION
All subjects from both sexes and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the 
eligibility criteria outlined in the protocol and provide informed consent to protocol participation. 
Subjects with HIV infection will be excluded due to potential toxicity and unknown effects of 
rhIL-15 and avelumab on the underlying HIV infection and interference with ART. Pregnant or 
nursing mothers are excluded because of the potential teratogenic effects of therapy. 
We expect men and women to be equally represented among the enrolled patients. 
12.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN
Subjects under the age of 18 are excluded because recurrent T-cell lymphomas are rare in young 
patients, and the inclusion of an occasional younger patient will not provide generalizable 
information that would justify their inclusion on this study. Additionally, because no dosing or 
adverse event data are currently available on the use of rhIL-15 in combination with avelumab in 
patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future 
pediatric trials.
12.3 PARTICIPATION OF S UBJECTS UNABLE TO GIVE C ONSENT
Adults who are unable to consent are excluded from enrolling in this study.  However,  re-consent 
may be necessary and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could become 
decisionally impaired.   For this reason and because there is a prospect of direct benefit from 
research participation (Section 12.5) and because overall survival is one of the secondary 
outcomes, all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill in their wishes for research 
and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care 
and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their 
medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course 

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
68of the study.  
Note: The PI or AI will contact the NIH Ability to Consent Assessment Team (ACAT) for 
evaluation to assess ongoing capacity of the subjects and to identify a LAR, as needed. 
Please see Section 12.6 for consent procedure.
12.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
The potential benefit of adding rhIL-15 to avelumab in treatment of mature T-cell malignancies is 
unknown, but single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown activity as outlined in 
Section  1.2.5. There is a risk of additive toxicity of the two drugs, in particular infusion reactions 
(including chills, fever, hypotension, headache, flushing, dizziness), fatigue, rash, Liver Function 
Test (LFT) abnormalities, and cytopenias.
Since fevers, rigors, lymphopenia, and LFT elevations occurred only during IL-15 infusion in the 
continuous IV trial, and since avelumab is not given concomitantly, these toxicities are not 
expected to overlap. Avelumab manufacturer recommendations for discontinuing therapy will be 
followed, including for grade 3-4 LFT elevations. Fatigue and rash are potential overlapping 
toxicities, and both will be monitored closely.
It has recently been shown that PD-1 may act as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor of T 
lymphocytes, with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade causing transient lymphoproliferation in 
ITK-SYK transgenic mice(21). Clinically, three patients with ATLL treated with the anti-PD-1 
antibody Nivolumab had rapid disease progression shortly after receiving the first dose (“rapid 
progression”). Additionally, four patients with AITL have experienced rapid progression after 1-
3 doses of nivolumab.(19) Patients with ATLL, AITL, and PTCL-TFH (which has a similar 
phenotype to AITL) are therefore excluded from this Phase 1 trial. Additionally, growth of 
malignant cells in enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is dependent on epithelial cell-
derived IL-15. Patients with EATL are therefore also excluded.  There are ongoing trials of 
different immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with other forms of T cell lymphoma with no 
reports of rapid progression. Study team will note any rapid and unexpected disease progression 
observed in patients on the trial as described in Section 6.3.4.
In addition to the tumor cells, PD-L1 is also expressed on normal immune cells. Since avelumab 
has potential for in vivo ADCC activity, immune cell subsets may change. However, when 123 
different immune cell subsets were analyzed in 28 patients with solid tumors who received 
avelumab during a Phase I trial, there were no changes at any of the time points in any of the 123 
subsets tested regardless of their PD-L1 expression before and during treatment(55). PBMC 
samples were obtained before avelumab, and after 1, 3, and 9 doses of the drug. A limited number 
of immune cell subsets will also be tested in our trial, both in PBMCs and optional tissue biopsies.
12.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
A significant number of T-cell malignancies express PD-L1, and since the anti-PD-L1 antibody 
avelumab has shown ADCC activity in vitro, agents that may enhance ADCC by increasing 
number and activity of Fc-binding effector cells — such as rhIL15 — could improve efficacy of 
avelumab in these diseases. Although the clinical benefit of these drug(s) has not yet been 
established, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and 
thus the patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to 
safety and tolerability.

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
69There have been no studies of IL-15 in patients with HIV on or off ART. Two non-human primates 
with SIV who were not on ART and received rhIL-15 on Study 2078-10804 both died, while 
subsequent animals who received viral suppression were seemingly unaffected. rhIL-15 may 
therefore contribute to morbidity/mortality in patients with a detectable viral load. Since potential 
toxicity of IL-15 and avelumab may interfere with ART adherence and optimal viral suppression, 
patients with HIV may be exposed to additional toxicity for unknown potential benefit of IL-15 
and should therefore be excluded in this study.
12.5.1 Risks related to CT and PET scans
CT and PET scans often use a contrast agent.  There is a small risk of having a reaction to the 
contrast and most often include nausea, pain in the vein where the contrast is given, headache, 
metallic and/ or bitter taste in the mouth and a warm, flushing feeling.  Rarely, some people have 
more severe allergic reactions to the contrast which may include skins rashes, shortness of breath, 
wheezing or low blood pressure.
12.5.2 Risks from Radiation Exposure
The procedures for performing the chest CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans will follow clinical 
policies, no special procedures apply to these additional assessments for research purposes.  In 
summary, subjects may receive additional radiation exposure from up to six (6) additional CT 
scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and three (3) additional 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. 
The total additional radiation dose for research purposes will be approximately 11.4 rem.
12.6 CONSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee(s) as applicable for review prior to consenting.  A designated study 
investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the 
associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time 
as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with 
friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study 
investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  Whether in person or remote, the privacy of 
the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, when 
in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted 
remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of the private nature of the discussion 
and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.  
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or as described below, with a manual 
(non-electronic signature) on the electronic document.  When required, witness signature will be 
obtained similarly as described for the investigator and participant.
Manual (non-electronic) signature on electronic document:
When a manual signature on an electronic document is used for the documentation of consent 
at the NIH Clinical Center, this study will use the following to obtain the required signatures:
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
70Adobe platform (which is not 21 CFR Part 11 compliant); or,  
iMedConsent platform (which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant)
During the consent process, participants and investigators will view individual copies of the 
approved consent document on screens at their respective locations (if remote consent); the 
same screen may be used when in the same location but is not required.  
Both the investigator and the participant will sign the document using a finger, stylus or mouse. 
Note: Refer to the CCR SOP PM-2, Obtaining and Documenting the Informed Consent 
Process for additional information (e.g., verification of participant identity when obtaining 
consent remotely) found here.
12.6.1 Consent Process for Adults Who Lack Capacity to Consent to Research Participation
For participants addressed in Section 12.3, an LAR will be identified consistent with Policy 403 
and informed consent obtained from the LAR, as described in Section 12.6. 
13 REGULATORY AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to study participants, 
investigator, the Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor and regulatory authorities.  If the study 
is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study 
participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for 
the termination or suspension.  Study participants will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed 
of changes to study visit schedule.
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:
Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants
Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping   
Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements
Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable
Determination that the primary endpoint has been met
Determination of futility
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed, and satisfy the sponsor, IRB and as applicable, Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
13.2 QUALITY A SSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological 
specimen collection, documentation and completion.  An individualized quality management plan 
will be developed to describe a site’s quality management.
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
71Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical 
trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, documented 
(recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., 
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)). 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, 
and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and 
regulatory authorities.
13.3 CONFLICT OF INTEREST P OLICY
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, such as by the 
pharmaceutical industry, is critical.  Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of persons who have 
a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and 
managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have 
such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the design and conduct 
of this trial.  The study leadership in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute has established 
policies and procedures for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will 
establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.
13.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND P RIVACY
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, 
their staff, and the sponsor(s). This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological 
samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. Therefore, 
the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized 
third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), and/or regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and 
records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records 
(office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical 
study site will permit access to such records.
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal 
use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location 
for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB, Institutional policies, or sponsor 
requirements.
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, 
will be d at the NCI CCR This will not include the participant’s contact or identifying information. 
Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique study 
identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by clinical sites 
and by NCI CCR research staff will be secured and password protected. At the end of the study, 
all study databases will be archived at the NCI CCR.
To further protect the privacy of study participants, a Certificate of Confidentiality has been issued 
by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This certificate protects identifiable research 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
72information from forced disclosure. It allows the investigator and others who have access to 
research records to refuse to disclose identifying information on research participation in any civil, 
criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local 
level. By protecting researchers and institutions from being compelled to disclose information that 
would identify research participants, Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve the research 
objectives and promote participation in studies by helping assure confidentiality and privacy to 
participants.

14.1.2.5 Mode of Action
IL-15 interacts with a private receptor subunit IL- 15R alpha as well as the IL-2/IL-15R beta 
chain shared with IL-2 and the common gamma chain shared with IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and 
IL-21.  IL-15 shares a number of biological activities with IL-2, including stimulation of the 
proliferation of activated CD4+, CD8+ as well as gamma-delta subsets of T cells.  IL-15 also 
stimulates the proliferation of NK cells and acts as a co-stimulator with IL-12 to facilitate the 
production of Interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha.
14.1.3 How Supplied
IL-15 is manufactured by the Biopharmaceutical Development Program (BDP) and distributed by 
the Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) ant CTEP. IL-15 is supplied as a sterile, frozen

14.2.1 Source / Acquisition and Accountability
Investigational supplies of Avelumab will be supplied by EMD Serono for use by subjects in this 
clinical trial. 
14.2.2 Toxicity 
Please refer to the IB for detailed toxicity information. In brief, in clinical studies thus far, most 
observed adverse events were either in line with those expected in patients with advanced tumors 
or with similar class effects of mAb blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Infusion-related reactions 
including drug hypersensitivity reactions and immune-mediated adverse reactions (immune-
related pneumonitis, immune-related colitis, immune-related hepatitis, immune-related 
endocrinopathies (thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, new onset type I diabetes mellitus, 
pituitary disorders), immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction and other immune-related 
AEs (myositis, myocarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, uveitis, pancreatitis and myasthenia 
gravis/myasthenic syndrome) have been identified as important risks for avelumab. Detailed 
guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse events and infusion-related reactions 
have been incorporated in this study protocol.

seal closure.
Each single-use vial contains 200 mg of avelumab as a preservative-free acetate-buffered solution 
(pH 5.2) containing Mannitol, and Polysorbate 20 (Tween 20).
For avelumab drug product, only excipients that conform to the current Ph. Eur. and/or the current 
USP are used.
14.2.4 Stability and Storage 
Supplies must be stored in a secure, limited-access location under the storage conditions specified 
on the label.  Receipt and dispensing of trial supplies must be recorded by an authorized person at 
the trial site. Supplies may not be used for any purpose other than that stated in the protocol.
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15 and Avelumab in R/R T-cell NHL
Version Date:  09/23/2021
81Avelumab drug product must be stored at 2°C to 8°C until use. Store diluted solution at room 
temperature up to 77°F (25°C) for no more than 8 hours from the time of dilution OR under 
refrigeration at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) for no more than 24 hours from the time of dilution. If 
refrigerated, allow the diluted solution to come to room temperature prior to administration. The 
storage condition is based on data from ongoing long term stability studies with avelumab. 
Avelumab drug product stored at room (23°C to 27°C) or higher temperatures for extended periods 
of time might be subject to degradation. Avelumab drug product must not be frozen. Rough 
shaking of the solution must be avoided.
14.2.5 Administration Procedures
For administration in clinical trials, avelumab drug product may be diluted with 0.9% saline 
solution (sodium chloride injection) supplied in 250 mL infusion bags, alternatively, a 0.45% 
saline solution can be used if needed. The chemical and physical in-use stability for the infusion 
solution of avelumab in 0.45% or 0.9% saline solution has been demonstrated for a total of 24 
hours at room temperature. However, from a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution 
should be used immediately. If not used immediately, it can be considered that the diluted product 
is sufficiently stable from a microbiological perspective for up to 8 hours when stored at ambient 
room temperature or up to 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C. The in-use storage times and conditions prior 
to administration are the responsibility of the user.
Prior to the preparation of the dilution for final infusion, allow each vial to equilibrate to room 
temperature. Use a disposable syringe equipped with a needle of suitable size to remove a volume 
of sodium chloride solution to be replaced by avelumab from the infusion bag and discard the 
removed solution. Use a new disposable syringe equipped with a needle of suitable size to inject a 
volume of avelumab drug product identical to the discarded volume of sodium chloride solution 
into the infusion bag. Gently invert the mixture 10 times. Infusion bags must not be shaken, in 
order to avoid foaming or excessive shearing of the protein solution. The preparation must be 
carefully inspected as it should result in a homogeneous looking clear solution, free of visible 
particles.
14.2.6 Returns and Reconciliations  
Unused investigational products will be destroyed per routine pharmacy procedure.

Relapse Any disease recurrence in those with complete response
Notes:
Percentages refer to mSWAT score.
A biopsy of normal appearing skin is unnecessary to assign a complete response. However, a skin 
biopsy should be performed of a representative area of the skin if there is any question of residual 
disease (persistent erythema or pigmentary change) where otherwise a complete response would exist. 
If histologic features are suspicious or suggestive of mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome, the response 
should be considered a partial response only.

† If a bone marrow biopsy was performed at baseline and determined to unequivocally be indicative of 
lymphomatous involvement, then to confirm a global CR where blood assessment now meets criteria 
for B 0, a repeat bone marrow biopsy must show no residual disease or the response should be 
considered a PR only.
‡ There is no PR in those with B 1 disease at baseline as the difference within the range of neoplastic 
cells that define B1 is not considered significant and should not affect determination of global 
objective response.

9216.4 APPENDIX  D:  IL-15 DILUTION INSTRUCTIONS
All dose preparations will be performed in a laminar flow hood in compliance with all legal 
requirements and in accordance with guidelines of recognized organizations.
0.1% human serum albumin (HSA) in 5% dextrose in water, USP (D5W), should be used for the 
dilutions listed below.
Please note: The dosing examples listed below are for the 147 mcg/0.3 mL in a 3mL vial size and 
dilution ONLY. The following dosing chart may be used as a reference, but doses should always 
be re-calculated at the time of preparation. In the future, different concentrations of IL-15 may be 
available and doses and dilutions will need to be recalculated.
Dose Level 1 (1 mcg/kg), Dose Level 2 (2 mcg/kg), Dose Level 3 (3 mcg/kg), and Dose Level 4 
(4 mcg/kg)
To prepare an IL-15 dose for Dose Level 1 (1 mcg/kg):
1. Thaw vial(s) of IL-15, 147 mcg/0.3 mL (490 mcg/mL) at room temperature.
2. Using a 27-gauge needle, slowly draw up the required dose in a 1 mL syringe. Doses should 
be rounded to the nearest 0.01 mL. 
3. Add the calculated volume of diluted IL-15 to 0.1% HSA in D5W in a PVC or polyolefin 
bag.
4. Label the bag with a 4-hour beyond-use date. The infusion may be started within 4 hours 
at room temperature, or within 24 hours if bag was kept at 2-8°C. The infusion must be 
completed within 24 hours of initiation.

9316.5 APPENDIX  E:  ASSAY FOR ANTIBODIES TO RHIL-15
Plates are coated with human IL-15 for 3 hours at 37°C, washed, blocked with 3% FBS 
and washed again.
A standard curve for assay quantitation and quality control is constructed using serial 
dilutions of a commercial affinity purified goat anti-human IL-15 that is diluted in heat-
inactivated normal human serum.  The standard curve samples are incubated for 2 hours at 
37°C and washed.
Biotin conjugated IL-15 is added to each well, incubated 2 hours at 37°C, and the plates 
are washed.
Alkaline phosphatase–conjugated streptavidin is added to each well for 2 hours at 37°C 
and then washed.
The assay is developed with the addition of diethanolamine buffer with p-Nitrophenyl 
Phosphatase for 1 hour at 37°C and then immediately read at 405 nm.
To detect antibodies to human IL-15 in test samples, serum from the test subject will be 
assayed in duplicate at dilutions of 1/3 and 1/9 concomitantly with the standard curve 
samples as above and the resultant OD obtained used to quantitate the level of antibody 
present.

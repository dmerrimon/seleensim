 V.  Main Hypothesis:  
Long term use Aggrastat ( 7 days) is safe in subjects with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemophage 
(aSAH ) and  has minimal symptomatic hemorrhagic risk conversions associated with 
ventriculostomy/VP -shunt placement.  
 
Aim 1:  To test the above hypothesis, we will assume that:  
A) The risk of symptomatic hemorrhage secondary to ventriculostomy/VPS placement   
     during the course of Aggrastat use is within 10% difference when compared to  
      control.   
B) The risk of asymptomatic hemorrhage secondary to ventriculostomy/VPS placement 
during the course of Aggrastat use is within 30% difference when compared to 
control.

 VI. Main Screening Criteria:  
We will recruit men and non- pregnant women of any ethnic background between the age ≥ 18 
and ≤ 85 years that have been treated for SAH caused by intracranial aneurysm.  
VII. Screening/Recruitment procedures:  
The study team will be notified by the neurosurg ery resident on call when a potential subject is 
seen in the ED for a possible aSAH.  Study team will review potential subject’s chart for possible 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. This pre -screening is done so that potential subjects and their 
families are n ot approached until the study team reviews and verifies that it would appear that the 
subject may qualify.   
Patients with aSAH will be taken to the OR for EVD placement and admitted to the SNICU.  An angiogram is performed within 24 hours of admission.  If following angiography, the patient meets inclusion criteria, t he study team will approach the potential subject and/or their Legally 
Authorized Representative (LAR) and tell them that the  patient  may qualify for a study and ask if 
they are interested in hearing about the study.  If the potential subject and/or their LAR are interested, the study will be explained to them in detail.  They will be encouraged to ask questions and talk it over with the treating physician and family members.  
If the potential subject and/or their LAR would like the potential subject to participate,  one of the 
members of the study team will go over the consent form with them, answering any questions 
they may have as the study team goes through the consent form. Once they have reviewed the entire consent form the study team will ask them once again if the y have any questions. Once 
any questions are answered they can choose to sign the consent form if they choose to participate 
or the LAR chooses to have the potential subject participate.  The potential subject or LAR  will 
have 24 hours post angiography wit h embolization  to decide if they would like to participate.  
To avoid any coercion all subjects are offered the opportunity to talk with the treating physician or family prior to signing a consent form. Study participation has no influence on the standard of care they would otherwise receive for their disease process . Once consent is obtained, the patient 
will be randomized to control vs. placebo. The LAR or subject can withdraw from the study at any time if he/she decides to.

AGGRASTAT® (tirofiban hydrochloride) injection, for intravenous use Initial U.S. Approval: 
1998 is approved as a platelet aggregation inhibitor indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events (combined endpoint of death, myocardial infarct ion, or refractory 
ischemia/repeat cardiac procedure) in patients with non -ST elevation acute coronary syndrome 
(NSTE -ACS).  It is currently not approved for   decreasing the risk of clinical vasospasm and 
delayed ischemic changes in patients who have been treated for SAH.  The most common risk associated with using AGGRASTAT® (tirofiban hydrochloride) intravenously is bleeding and 
thrombocytopenia.  Rare adverse reactions include: edema/swelling, pelvic pain, vasovagal 
reaction, bradycardia, coronary arter y dissection, leg pain, dizziness, sweating and severe allergic 
reactions including anaphylactic reactions.  
Concomitant use of fibrinolytics, anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs increases the risk of 
bleeding.  
 Patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency have decreased plasma clearance of AGGRASTAT.  
 The study is designed to reduce these risks by car eful pre -screening, monitoring and follow up 
visits.  If subject requires additional VP shunt placement, Aggrastat /placebo  will be discontinued 
for 6 hours prior to scheduled surgery and resumed 12 hours post -procedure.   
  The standard risks of IV injection include: local reactions, fever, local tenderness, abscess, tissue necrosis or infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or inflammation of the vein 
(phlebitis). The standard risks of phlebotomy include discomfort upon placement of an IV catheter, bruising at the site of blood draw, hypersensitivity to adhesives or surgical tape, 
irritation at the catheter site, as well as  a small risk of infection. It is also possible that subjects 
may feel lightheaded, dizzy, or nauseated during or after the  IV placement.  
The risk of the l oss of confidentiality : To reduce risk of a loss of confidentiality, precautions will 
be taken to ensure privacy. The PI and study team will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this study, in compliance with ICH E6 GCP, Section 4.9 and regulatory and institutio nal requirements for the protection of confidentiality of subjects. Research records 
generated in this study will be stored in file cabinets in a locked room and/or on a secure electronic database. Only authorized study team at the sites will have access t o the data. Imaging 
collected during the study will be identified by a subject number, IRB protocol number, and date of collection.  
The risk of MRI:  Subject may feel uncomfortable inside the MRI if they do not like to be in closed spaces (claustrophobia) .

 XIII.      Adverse Event Reporting:  
The University of Iowa requires Investigators to collect and report to the University of Iowa IRB 
if any of the following occur:  
 
• An unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others is any event or problem 
that: 
1) was unexpected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such 
as the IRB - approved research protocol and informed consent document; and 
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied AND  
2) suggests that the research places subjects or others (those not directly involved in the research such as research staff or family members) at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, ec onomic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized AND  
3) is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by t he procedures involved in the research). 
4) Serious adverse drug event (either expected or unexpected) occurring in a UI subject  
5) If a subject is enrolled by U/VAHCS investigators, the investigator must 
report to the UI IRB either serious adverse drug events or unexpected adverse drug events. By definition, these events must be associated with the use of the drug. 
6) An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug experience (associated with the use of the drug), the frequency, specificity, or severity of whi ch is not 
consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk information provided to the subjects and the IRB  
• A serious adver se drug event is any adverse drug experience (associated with the use of 
the drug) occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1) Death  
2) Life-threatening adverse drug experience  
3) Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hos pitalization  
4) A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6) Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug event when, 
  Protocol: iSPASM  
  Version 4.0 14 May 2020  
19 
 based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
• Receipt of new information  
During the course of a study, researchers may become aware of new information 
that would impact a subject’s decision to participate or  continue participating in 
the research study. For example, interim analyses of data may identify a trend which impacts th e safety of subjects or  may identify early efficacy (benefit) of 
one of the interventions under study. In addition, results from other research studies or changes in standards of practice or care may affect conduct of a study and would need to be communica ted to research subjects.  
 
• Noncompliance  
Noncompliance is a failure to follow the federal regulations with respect to protection of human subjects in research or failure to follow the determinations of the IRB with respect to conduct of the research as app roved by the IRB.  
 
Once per year, the IRB is required to review and approve all non- exempt research projects at 
intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once a year. This is called "continuing review.” Continuing review for non- exempt  research is required to occur as long as 
the research remains active for long -term follow -up of the research subject, even when the 
research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects and all subjects have completed all research -related inter ventions and to occur when the remaining research activities are limited 
to collection of private identifiable information.  
 
Adverse Event Collection:  
 The clinical research team is responsible for collecting and recording the research data.  As the results are collected, all adverse events will be identified  after an informed consent is signed by 
the subject or their legally authorized representative (LAR) and the medication is initiated.    Throughout the study, the 30- day phone call and during all follow -up visits, in addition to the 
medical chart review,  adverse events are to be elicited by the investigator (or designate) by 
asking the subject non- leading questions. All AEs and SAEs will be  reported to the principal 
investigator  (PI) and  the PI wi ll determine  the final relationship of the event to the 
investigational product.   AGGRASTAT® (tirofiban hydrochloride) has a half -life of approximately 2 hours.  Therefore , 
and according to the pharmacokinetics, the drug will be cleared by 24 hours. Therefore , any 
events after 24 hours are very unlikely related to the drug
. 
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded following the initiation of the study drug until 5 days after 
the la st dose of study medication  
 
  Protocol: iSPASM  
  Version 4.0 14 May 2020  
20 
 Starting 5 days after the last dose of study medication and up to the 30 day follow up, only the 
following adverse events of special significance  and primary serious adverse events associated 
with Aggrastat  will be recorded : 
 Adverse events of special significance are:  
- Bleeding events  
- Edema/swelling  
- Pelvic pain  
- Vasovagal reactions  
- Bradycardia  
- Coronary artery dissection 
- Leg pain  
- Dizziness  
- Sweating  
- Allergic reaction  
 The primary serious adverse events associated with Aggrastat ar e:  thrombocytopenia . 
 Following the 30 follow up, only primary serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded.  
 Occurrence of adverse events will be monitored throughout the trial and will cover all randomized subjects. Trial subjects will be provided wi th a 24- hour telephone number to contact 
trial personnel in case of an untoward reaction after hospital discharge  
 Adverse events that meet criteria of serious, unexpected, and attributed (possible, probably, or 
definite) to the IP must be reported to the FDA.  
 This study will also be monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. For non- serious 
adverse events, documentation must begin from the first day of study drug and continue through the 30- day follow -up phone call.  Routine adverse events will be reporte d by submission of an 
adverse events log to the DSMB at the time of the DSMB review.  Serious adverse events occurring during active therapy will require notification to the DSMB within 1 business day of learning of the event. The SAE capture window will be from the first administration of IP through the 30- day follow -up phone call.  Serious adverse events are reportable to the DSMB 
within 1 business day of learning of the event if the adverse event meet the criteria of serious, unexpected, and attributed ( possible, probably, or definite) to the IP.

 XVIII. Subject Safety:  
• To minimize risks all subjects are carefully pre -screened and screened trying to 
identify any factors that could contribute to increased risk.  
• All testing is completed at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics by a very 
experienced and well-trained  staff and monitored by the Principal Investigator. 
• All confidential information is kept in locked offices and password protected computers only available to study team members.  
• The participant has contact information and study team members available 24/7.   
XIX. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):  
A DSMB will be convened to assess the progress of the clinical study, the safety data, and critical efficacy endpoints.  Details regarding the DSMB can be found in the DSMB Charter Version 7.0 dated 03 December 20182018.  
 
XX. Safety stop -points ( per DSMB charter ):  
• The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is ≥ 10% when compared to control.  
• The risk of asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is ≥ 30% when compared to control.    
• The rate of thrombocytopenia (platelets <20,000) is ≥ 10% when compared to control. 
• The rate of  hemorrhagic bleeding requiring > 2 units of red blood cells transfusion is ≥ 
10% when compared to control  (ex: GI, retroperitoneal, etc).  
• The threshold of 20% as maximum al lowable symptomatic hemorrhage per each quarter.  
If the threshold is reached, the study will be stopped, and all adverse events are reviewed.  
• If all the symptomatic hemorrhage reported is due specifically to the agent being tested, 
then the DSMB will mak e recommendation to stop the study. 
 
XXI. Unmasking and safety:  
A. Stopping the medication. 
1) Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage  
2) Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage  
3) Thrombocytopenia <20 000 
4) Any new symptomatic hemorrhage requiring > 2 units packed red blood cells (ex: GI, 
retroperitoneal, etc).  
5) Any emergent or urgent procedure.  
  Protocol: iSPASM  
  Version 4.0 14 May 2020  
25 
 B. Unmasking. 
If any patient required an emergent surgery or if any information regarding the IP is needed for 
clinical decision, we will initiate  the unmasking protocol and the IP will be stopped. 
Furthermore, if surgery was required and the patient turned out to be on Aggrastat, the medication is stopped for 6h. For interventions that cannot be postponed for 6h, platelet 
transfusion and fresh froz en plasma will be given to subjects that have been unblinded and in the 
process it was determined that the subject was randomized to receive Aggrastat .

 XXII. Statistical design plan:  
 
The risk of symptomatic hemorrhage is expected to be within 10% difference when compared to 
control.  
The risk of asymptomatic hemorrhage is expected to be within 30% difference when compared 
to control.    
Given the above assumptions, the sample size calculation for the safety endpoint: the safety 
outcome will be symptomatic or asymptomatic bleeding during the hospital stay with an expected average of 3 weeks. We expect to observe 5% of the patients in the p lacebo group to 
experience the symptomatic or asymptomatic bleeding during the hospital stay. We assume the event rate in the dual antiplatelet therapy group to be not higher than 15%. With a two- sided chi -
square test with 0.05 type I error rate, the sampl e size of 212 Aggrastat and 70 placebo patients 
(282 patients total) would allow us to compare this safety outcome between groups with 80% 
power.

 XXIII.  Definitions:  
 
1. Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm defined as: clinical deterioration (focal neurological 
impairment;) in the setting of an angiographic vasospasm or a radiographic vasospasm based on CT perfusion of the corresponding territory, requiring rescue therapy.  
1.1. Focal neurological impairment: such as hemiparesis, aphasia, apraxia, or neglect), or a decrease of at least 2 points on the Glasgow coma scale (either on the total score or on one of the components) This should: a) last for at least 1 hour, b) not be apparent immediately after aneurysm occlusion, and c) not to be attributed to other causes by means of clinical assessment, CT, or MRI scanning of the brain, and appropriate lab studies)  
1.2. Radiographic vasospasm: Increase in mean transient time, decrease in cerebral blood 
flow with preservation of cerebral blood volume in the affected area compared to normal  
1.3. Angiographic vasospasm:  
1.3.1 Mild vasospasm: decrease in vessel diameter by ≤ 25% of normal artery diameter.  
1.3.2. Moderate vasospasm: dec rease in vessel diameter > 25% but ≤ 50% of 
normal artery diameter.  
1.3.3. Severe vasospasm: decrease in vessel diameter > 50% of normal artery diameter . 
2.Delayed Cerebral Ischemia: Defined as a symptomatic vasospasm with cerebral infarct.  
2.1. Cerebral infarction: presence of infarction on either: 1) CT and/or MRI 24 hours post procedure and not attributable to endovascular procedure (punctate infracts). Hypodensities on CT imaging resulting from EVD or intraparenchymal hematoma should not be regarded ce rebral infarction from DCI:  
2.1.1. Infarct on non- contrasted head CT: hypodensity ≥ 1 x 1 cm and not 
attributable to EVD/shunt, intraparenchymal hematoma, and/or endovascular procedure  
2.1.2. Infarct on MRI: area of the brain that appears on MRI as: 1) hyperintense area of the brain on Diffusion weighted Image (DWI) not attributable to infections, cysts, abscesses, or trauma, 2) same area as hyperintense area on T2FLAIR images, and 3) hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.  
3.Symptomatic hemorrhage from ventriculostomy/VPS: Any hemorrhage evident on non-contrasted head CT and/or MRI that is larger than ≥ 3cm in its largest diameter and associated with the track of the catheter used for EVD or VP shunt.  
  Protocol: iSPASM  
  Version 4.0 14 May 2020  
28 
 4.. Asymptomatic hemorrhage from ventriculostomy/VPS: Any hemorrhage evident on non-
contrasted head CT and/or MRI that is larger than < 3cm in its largest diameter and associated with the track of the catheter used for EVD or VP shunt.  
5. New Symptomatic hemorrhage: any new intracranial hemorrhage greater than  3 cm in the 
largest diameter, leading to worsening neurological exam, re- admission to the ICU, requiring 
surgery, associated with new -onset seizure, and/or leads to an increase sta y in SNICU or 
hospitalization.  
6. Worsening existing hemorrhage: Interval increase in the size of the hyper density on the CT 
scan for >2mm.  
7. Angio- negative Vasospasm: Clinical deterioration (focal neurological impairment) without 
evidence of radiographi c vasospasm, deemed by the treating physician team as due to vasospasm 
after ruling out other causes and requiring rescue therapy.  
8. New asymptomatic hemorrhage: interval development of a new hemorrhage, < 3cm in the largest diameter, that is not causing any neurological impairment.

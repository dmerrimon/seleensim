52 Synopsis
Name of Sponsor/Co mpany: Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences, a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North 
America, LLC
Name of Investigational Product:  IDP-122 Lotion
Name of Active Ingredients:  Halobetasol propionate (HP) 0.01% w/w 
Title of Study: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Doub le-Blind, Randomized, Vehicle Controlled Clinical Study to 
Assess the Safety and Efficacy of IDP-122 in the Treatment of Plaque Psoriasis 
Number of clinical centers:  Multicenter, approximately 12-16 investigational centers in North America 
Objective: 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical IDP-122 Lotion when applied once 
daily to adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque  psoriasis (defined as an Investigator’s Global 
Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4). The intent of the study is specifically to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
a once daily application of IDP-122 Lo tion in comparison with vehicle. 
Methodology: 
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of IDP-122 Lotion in comparison with vehicle. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at 
least 18 years of age and have a clinical diagnosis of modera te to severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 
3 or 4). 
Approximately 210 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) Lotion and IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion,  respectively. Two containers of the assigned study 
drug will be dispensed to the subject at the Baseline visit. The study drug will be applied topically to the affected areas (as determined by the investigator at baseline) once daily for 8 weeks. The initial application 
will be made by the subject per instruction from the stud y staff.  The subjects will be instructed to avoid 
exposure to direct sunlight, artificial ultraviolet light sources and to use prot ective clothing to  prevent sunburn. 
Subjects will apply their once daily treatments at home as  explained by the study coordinator or designee at 
each investigational center. 
The study coordinator, or designee at each investigational center will dispense 2 new containers of study drug 
to each subject at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, and 6. During post-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8) the 
subjects will be asked to return their containers of study drug which will be evaluated for drug usage 
compliance. Upon completion of the 8- week treatment period, all subjects will be asked to return to the 
investigational center 4 weeks later for a post-treatment cessation follow-up visit (Week 12). During the study, 
subjects will be allowed to use investigator approved non-medicated cleansers, mois turizers and sunscreens; 
no other skin care products will be permitted on the treatment areas. Th e investigator will assess the areas 
affected by psoriasis at each study visit. 
All areas affected by psoriasis (with an affected body surface area [BSA] of 3%-12%, inclusive) are to be 
treated with study drug. The affected areas (3%-12% BSA) will not include face, scalp, palms, soles, groin, 
axillae, and intertriginous areas. Informatio n on reported and observed advers e events (AEs) will be obtained 
at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Baseline, Week 8 (end of treatment), and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment ce ssation follow-up visit) for all subjects. 
Blood samples for complete blood count with differential (CBC/Diff) and serum chemistry will be collected 
from subjects at Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. For all female subjects of  childbearing potential, urine and 
serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screen ing. Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at 
Baseline (prior to randomization) and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit), and serum pregnancy 
testing will also be conducted at Week 4 and Week 8. 
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 8 assessments, as 
appropriate, prior to commencement of any alternative ther apy for psoriasis (if po ssible). Subjects who 
discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects may be asked to 
return for the 4-week follow-up vi sit after the last treatment visit.

6If signs or symptoms develop in the selected treatment areas during the treatment period that restrict daily 
activities or make continued application of the study drug difficult due to  discomfort, the investigator may 
instruct the subject to temporar ily interrupt use of the study drug and to resume application of the study drug 
once the signs/symptoms have subsid ed. The investigator should try to minimize study drug interruptions; and 
if needed, make best efforts to limit a “drug holiday” to 4 days. If th e study drug interruption does exceed 
4 consecutive days, the investigator sh ould consult with the medical monitor to determine a course of action. If 
the study drug is interrupte d, discontinued, or a concomitant medicati on is used to treat a sign/symptom, an 
adverse event shall be recorded. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study, due to clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or AEs will 
return for the 4-week follow-up  visit after the last treatment visit and w ill be instructed to follow-up with their 
primary care physician, if indicated. If any subject who has an AE, during the treatment period, the subject will be followed by the investigator until resolution (retu rn to normal or to the baseline state) or stabilization, 
as determined by the investigator. 
In addition, application of study drug ma y be delayed or halted at any time if ongoing safety data evaluations 
(including reports of local skin reactions, such as skin atrophy, or severe AEs) raise concern for subject safety. 
If the subject participation is suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by the medical 
monitor in conjunction with the inve stigator to determine course of action. 
Number of subjects planned: 
Approximately 210 adult subjects (approximately 15 subjec ts per investigational ce nter) with moderate or 
severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 3 or 4)  will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 
2:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that:

Investigational product, dosage  and mode of administration: 
IDP-122 Lotion, applied topically, once daily for 8 weeks. 
Application Instructions:  
The investigational center staff member will instruct the subject to apply the st udy drug to the affected 
treatment areas identified at the Baseline visit by the inve stigator. The staff member will instruct the subject on 
the proper application procedure during the Baseline visit. Subjects will be instructed to squeeze a small 
amount of study drug (about the size of a pea) onto a fingertip and then spread a thin layer of the study drug over the affected treatment area. If necessary, additional pea-sized amounts of study drug may be applied in 
increments to cover all affected treatment areas as designated by the investigator. In addition to the verbal 
instructions given during the visit, the subjects  will be provided with  written instructions. 
Subjects will be instructed to apply a thin layer of st udy drug to the entire selected treatment area(s) as 
indicated on the body diagram at home once daily up to th e Week 8 visit. Subjects will be advised to avoid or 
minimize exposure to direct sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light sources while in the study and to wash their 
hands before and after app lication of the study drug. 
The amount of study drug used by the subjects will be monitored by weighing each newly dispensed study 
drug container and re weighing each  returned study drug container at all applicable study visits. The maximum 
allowable weekly usage is 50 grams for this study. 
Duration of treatment:
8 weeks for all subjects

Criteria for evaluation: 
A summary of the study measurements follows. Note that for all efficacy measurements, the 
investigators/evaluators will be provid ed with training to ensure consis tent evaluations across investigational 
centers. To the greatest extent possible, the assessments for a particular subject should be performed by the 
same sponsor-approved evaluator at all study visits. 
Safety Measurements :
Local Skin Reactions: Tolerability will be evaluated thr ough assessments of selected local signs and symptoms 
(itching, dryness, burning/stinging ). In addition, the treatment areas w ill be examined at each visit by the 
evaluator for the presence or ab sence of significant kn own drug-related AEs; skin atrophy, striae, 
telangiectasia, and folliculitis. Any local skin reaction requiring use of a concomitant therapy or is a cause for 
study drug interruption or discontinuatio n should be reported as an adverse event. The scales to be used for 
assessing local skin reactions follow:

12 Statistical methods:
All subjects who are randomized and dispensed study drug will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis 
set. All subjects in the ITT analysis set who complete the Week 8 visit without any major protocol violations 
will be included in the per protocol (PP) analysi s set. All subjects who are randomized, receive at least 
1 confirmed dose of study drug, and have at least 1 post -baseline assessment will be included in the safety 
analysis set. 
The ITT analysis set will be considered primary for the evaluation of efficacy. The primary method of 
handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple 
imputation; no imputations will be  made for missing safety data. 
 
Efficacy :
Efficacy Endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints are intended to compare once daily application of IDP-122 Lotion and vehicle. 
Specifically, the efficacy endpoints include: 
x The percent of subjects with treatment success, defined as at least a 2 grade improvement from 
Baseline in the IGA score and an IGA score equating to “clear” or “almost clear” at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 
and Week 12 (4-week  follow-up), as summarized using descriptive statistics. 
x The percent of subjects with at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaq ue elevation, and scaling) at Week s 2, 4, 6, 8 and Week 12 (4 week 
FU), as summarized using descriptive statistics for the target lesion tr eated with study drug. 
Inferential Statistics 
Primary Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percent of subjects with treatment success, defined as at least a 
2-grade improvement from Ba seline in IGA score and an IGA score equating to “Clear” or “Almost Clear”. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be used to compare once daily application of IDP-122 Lotion with its vehicle. The percent of subjects w ith treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) tests stratified by analysis center.  
Secondary Efficacy 
Similar to the primary endpoint analyses, pairwise comparisons will be performed using CMH tests stratified 
by analysis center. The secondary efficacy endpoints will be: 
x Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear to Almost Clear at 
Week 12 for IDP-122 Lotion versus IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
x Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear to Almost Clear at 
Week 6 for IDP-122 Lotion versus IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
x Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear to Almost Clear at Week 4 for IDP-122 Lotion versus IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
x Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear to Almost Clear at Week 2 for IDP-122 Lotion versus IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
Evaluation of the secondary efficacy variables will use a gated sequential procedure starting with the 
comparisons of the first bulleted item and proceeding onto the next item. The process will terminate if a 
nonstatistically significant value is observed.

signs of psoriasis (erythema,  plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 8 for the target lesion 
x Percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema,  plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 6 for the target lesion 
x Percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema,  plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 4 for the target lesion 
x Percentage of subjects with at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline in the score for each of the 
signs of psoriasis (erythema,  plaque elevation, and scaling) at Week 2 for the target lesion 
Safety: 
Subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing AEs. Descriptions of AEs will include the 
dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), maximum se verity, seriousness, action taken regarding the study 
drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and investigator’s assessment of causality. All AEs will be recorded and 
classified using terminology from the Medical Dictiona ry for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported 
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study drug 
application, will be summarized by treatment group, the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ 
class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by severity or 
relationship to study drug, each subj ect will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred 
term using the event with the greatest severity or cau sality, respectively, within each category. All reported 
serious adverse events (SAEs) w ill be summarized by treatmen t group, the number of subjects reporting SAEs, 
system organ class, preferred term, seve rity, and relationship to study drug. 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject an d will include a verbatim 
description of the event as reported by the investigator, as well as the preferred term, system organ class, start 
date, stop date (if stopped), seriousness, severity, ac tion taken regarding the study drug, corrective treatment, 
outcome and relationship to the study drug. In addition, a listing of subjects who pre maturely discontinue from 
the study due to AEs will be provided as well as a listing of su bjects who reported an SAE. 
The frequency of local skin reactions including itching, dryness,  burning/stinging, skin atrophy, striae, 
telangiectasia and folliculitis will be summ arized by treatment group and visit.  Additionally, the percent of 
subjects who experience a local skin reaction (itching, drynes s, burning/stinging) graded at a level of 3, at any 
point in the study following the first application of st udy drug, will be tabulated by treatment group.  Changes 
from baseline in safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements w ill be summarized with descriptive 
statistics for each treatment group at all applicable study visits. 
Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values to summarize laboratory test results 
collected at Baseline and Weeks 4 and 8. Normal ranges established by the central laboratory will be used to 
determine the shifts. A listing of all out-of-range laborat ory test results at any assessment time point will also 
be provided. Determination of clinical significance for all out-of-range laboratory values will be made by each 
investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a listing of all clinically significant laboratory test results 
will be provided.

20 5 Introduction
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated disease that varies widely in its clinical expression. 
Disease severity ranges from mild (limited number of plaques) to very severe. Characteristic features of psoriasis include hyperproliferation of epidermal cells associated with dermal/epidermal inflammation, resulting in sharply demarcated red plaques, which may be covered by silvery scales affecting the skin and scalp. 
There are presently no curative treatments for psoriasis. Treatment options focus on relieving 
symptoms, reducing inflammation, induration, and scaling, and controlling the extent of the disease. Patient age, severity of disease, and the type and extent of body surface area (BSA) involvement are considerations in selecting therapy. 
Biologic treatments are now either available or in development to treat psoriasis. However, 
these treatments are not typically used for mild disease, and their safety profile is not entirely 
well understood. 
Topical therapies are used in all disease severities, but may be impractical when psoriasis 
involves a large BSA. The mainstay of psoriasis treatment is topical corticosteroids, which range in potency from superpotent to low potency (Class I to Class VII, respectively). Generally, the more potent corticosteroids are required for effective management of psoriasis.
Although topical corticosteroids are very effective, long-term safety remains a concern, 
particularly with the more potent ones. Adverse effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and potential hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression have been associated with higher potency topical corticosteroids and prolonged treatment. Ultravate
® cream and 
ointment (halobetasol propionate [HP] 0.05%) is currently on the market and are classified as super-high potency (Class I) corticosteroids indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  
Having a lower concentration product that is a Class I steroid might be advantageous for 
patients, as the steroid provides relief from inflammation, and may reduce the adverse 
reactions associated with a steroid (eg, skin atrophy). 
6 Study Objectives and Purpose 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical IDP-122 Lotion 
when applied once daily to adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (defined as an Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4). The intent of the study is 
specifically to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a once daily application of IDP-122 Lotion 
in comparison with vehicle.

21 7 Investigational plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study designed to assess the 
safety and efficacy of IDP-122 Lotion in comparison with its vehicle. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at least 18 years of age and have a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 3 or 4). 
Approximately 210 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to receive IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) Lotion and IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion, respectively. The assigned study drug will be applied topically to the affected area (as determined by the investigator at Baseline) once daily for 8 weeks. The initial application will be made at the investigational center during the day as per instruction from the study coordinator or designee. The subjects will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight, artificial ultraviolet light sources and to use protective clothing to prevent sunburn. Subjects will apply their daily treatments at home as explained by the study coordinator or designee at each investigational center. The study coordinator or designee at each investigational center will dispense 2 new containers of study drug to each subject at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, and 6. During post-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8) the subjects will be asked to return their used containers of study drug. Subjects will be asked to not apply study drug on day of 
clinic visit so that subject can apply during the visit after assessments are completed. Upon 
completion of the 8-week treatment period, all subjects will be asked to return to the investigational center 4 weeks later for a post-treatment cessation follow-up visit (Week 12). During the study, each subject will only be permitted to use Investigator approved non-medicated cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreens; no other skin care products will be permitted on the treatment areas. 
The investigator will assess the treatable areas affected by psoriasis at each study visit. All 
treatable areas affected by psoriasis identified at Baseline (with an affected BSA of 3%-12%) are to be treated with study drug. The treatable affected areas will not include the face, scalp, 
palms, soles, axillae, and intertriginous areas. If palms and soles are affected, study drug may 
be applied at the discretion of the investigator; however, these areas will not be included in treatable BSA or efficacy assessments. 
Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Baseline, Week 8 (end of treatment), and Week 12 (the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit) for all subjects. 
Blood samples for complete blood count with differential (CBC/Diff) and serum chemistry 
will be collected from subjects at Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, urine and serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening and 
Protocol V01-122A-302, IDP-122 Phase 3  Valeant Research & Development

22 confirmed at baseline with a urine pregnancy test prior to randomization. Serum pregnancy 
tests will also be conducted at weeks 4 and 8, and an additional urine pregnancy test will be performed at Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire (DLQI) questionnaire will be 
administered to subjects at Day 0 (Baseline), Week 4, Week 8/End of Treatment and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 8 
assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects may be asked to come back for the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit.

26 8.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Reasons for withdrawal may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
x Psoriasis flare, as determined by the investigator, which requires treatment with a 
disallowed therapy. 
x Either at the investigator's request, for tolerability reasons (e.g., severe adverse 
reactions), or at the subject’s request. 
x When the requirements of the protocol are not followed. 
x When a concomitant therapy likely to interfere with the results of the study is 
reported, or required by the subject (the investigators will report all such 
information on the source documents/electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and decide, in accordance with the sponsor, whether the subject is to be withdrawn). 
x When a subject is lost to follow-up. The investigators will try twice to reach the subject by telephone and will send a follow-up letter by certified mail before 
considering that the subject is lost to follow-up. These actions will be reported on 
the End of Study eCRF and a copy of the follow-up letter maintained in the investigator's file. 
All premature discontinuations and their reasons must be carefully documented by the investigator on the final eCRF, and, if need be, on the AE form. In any case, no subject who has been included and has a study number assigned can be replaced by another if they discontinue prematurely for whatever reason. All data gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to the sponsor. 
Reasons for study completion/discontinuation as listed on the final report form are defined as 
follows: 
Normal Study Completion – Subject completes the study as planned in the protocol. 
Adverse Event  – Complete AE form. 
Subject Request  – Consent withdrawal, subject moved, schedule conflicts. 
Protocol Violation  – Contact the Sponsor or designee before making decision. 
Lost to Follow-Up – Document with 2 phone calls and a certified letter. 
Pregnancy  – Subject will discontinue study drug immediately, but will be followed to 
term. Complete pregnancy form. 
Worsening Condition  – Subject requires alternate treatment for psoriasis before the end 
of the study and the investigator determines it is not due to lack of efficacy. 
Lack of Efficacy  – Subject requires alternate treatment for psoriasis after at least 2 weeks 
of study drug treatment and the risk of continuing the subject in the study outweighs the benefit as determined by the investigator. Other  – Specify in comments section of final eCRF.

27 Subjects who terminate treatment early will be asked to complete all Week 8 assessments 
prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects will be asked to come back for the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit. 
All subjects are free to withdraw from participating in this study at any time and for whatever 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. No constraints will be placed on ordinary subject management, and subjects, when appropriate, will be placed on other conventional therapy upon request or whenever clinically necessary as determined by their physician.
9 Treatment Plan 
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
This is a double-blinded study, in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to investigator/evaluator and subjects, as well as all individuals closely associated with the study.
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 study drug groups in a ratio of 2:1 (IDP-122 
[HP 0.01%] Lotion: IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion). Each screened subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit study subject number assigned by the investigational center, which will consist of the 3-digit investigational center/site number (pre-assigned by sponsor/designee) and the 3-digit chronological screening order number, starting with 001 (e.g., 101001, 101002). The study drug kit will be assigned to subjects based on a randomization code and kits will be dispensed to the subjects at Baseline.  A study drug log will document the inventory and dispensing of study drug at each investigational center. 
9.2 Randomization and Blinding 
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly to the subjects entering the study within each investigational center. Study drug supplies will be distributed to the investigational centers to maintain the randomization ratio within each investigational center. 
As a double-blinded study, the investigators, the site staff, the sponsor, and the clinical 
monitors will not be aware of the treatment assigned to the individual study subjects. Delegated staff members at each investigational center will dispense the study drugs and will collect all used and unused study drug containers as scheduled.

28 9.3 Unblinding
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the 
conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are verified, entered into the database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and entered into the database; and the database is locked. 
In the case of a medical emergency, the investigator can break the blind for the subject 
involved preferably by first discussing the situation with the medical monitor and the sponsor (or designee) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contacted with unblinding information by a sponsor representative. The investigator will record the code break in the subject’s source documents. 
9.4 Prior and Prohibited Concomitant Medication or Therapy 
Subjects in this study must not have psoriasis that was previously nonresponsive to prescription medications, per the Investigators’ best clinical judgment. Subjects must also not be using lithium or Plaquenil. Any concomitant therapy stopped for washout as indicated below is to be recorded. As noted in the exclusion criteria, there are mandatory washout periods and restrictions during the study. Specifically: 
x Received treatment with any topical antipsoriatic drug product within 14 days 
prior to the Baseline visit 
x Within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit, subjects must not have used any phototherapy (including laser), photochemotherapy, or non-biologic systemic 
psoriasis therapy (such as newer oral psoriasis medications (eg Otezla), systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, retinoids or cyclosporine) 
x Has used immunomodulatory therapy (biologics) known to affect psoriasis within 3 months of the Baseline visit 
x Within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit, subjects must not have had prolonged 
exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation 
x Within 60 days or 5 drug half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the Baseline visit, subjects must not have received treatment with any investigational drug or 
device and may not be concurrently participating in another clinical study with an investigational drug or device 
Subjects are allowed only the use of investigator approved non-medicated cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreens in the treatment areas. Protocol excluded areas (face, scalp, axillae, and intertriginous areas) may be treated with OTC 1% hydrocortisone cream, tar shampoos or allowed moisturizers.

 CONFIDENTIAL 
29 Protocol excluded areas of palms and soles may be treated with study drug but will not be 
included in the BSA or IGA assessments. If palms and soles are treated, they may be evaluated by the investigator for improvement. 
Subjects using concomitant therapies during the course of the study that could interfere with 
the interpretation of the study results (including but not limited to those listed above) should not be withdrawn, but the use of the concomitant product should be discontinued. No other topical treatment (except as noted above) other than the study drug will be permitted for psoriasis.
Information on concomitant therapies will be recorded in the Prior and Concomitant 
Medication or Therapy source document. Any therapy used by the subject will be considered concomitant medication or therapy (e.g., aspirin, Tylenol, birth control pills, vitamins, moisturizers, sunscreens). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant therapy dosing constant during the study. Any change to concomitant therapy should be noted on the Concomitant Therapy source document and eCRF. 
9.5 Treatment Compliance 
Each subject will be instructed on the importance of returning his or her study drug at each applicable study visit. If a subject does not return his or her study drug, he or she will be instructed to return it as soon as possible. The subjects will bring the containers dispensed at each on-site treatment visit to the next subsequent study visit. The maximum allowable weekly usage is 50 grams for this study. Each container will be weighed by a study coordinator or designee prior to dispensation and after collection. The subject will also be asked to complete a diary calendar and questioned regarding the study drug use since the 
previous visit in order to judge the subject’s compliance with applying the study drug. A 
subject who deviates significantly from the prescribed application amount will be counseled. Any missed applications of study drug will be noted by subject on the diary, which will be collected and placed in the appropriate source document. Missed applications will be documented in the eCRF. 
9.6 Protocol Deviations and Violations 
The investigators must read the protocol thoroughly and must follow the instructions exactly.  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by the sponsor and the IRB/IEC and agreed to by the investigator. Deviations usually have an impact on individual patients or a small group of patients and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria. 
Protocol V01-122A-302, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
30 A protocol violation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol that results in a 
significant, additional risk to the patient, when the patient or investigator has failed to adhere to significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the patient was enrolled without prior sponsor approval, or when there is nonadherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH GCP guideline. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the patients’ source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patients without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required. 
10 Study Drug Materials and Management 
The study drug will be dispensed by an appropriately qualified member of the study staff assigned by the investigator to this task 
10.1 IDP-122 Lotion and IDP 122 Vehicle Lotion

10.1.3 Administration 
The investigational center staff member will instruct the subject on the proper application 
procedure of the study drug to the affected treatment areas identified at the Baseline visit by the investigator. Subjects will be instructed to squeeze a small amount of study drug (about the size of a pea) onto a fingertip and then spread a thin layer of the study drug over the affected treatment area. If necessary, additional pea-sized amounts of study drug may be applied in increments to cover all affected treatment areas as designated by the investigator. 
The maximum allowable weekly usage is 50 grams for this study. In addition to the verbal instructions given during the visit, the subjects will be provided with written instructions (See Appendix 17.1).
Subjects will be instructed to apply a thin layer of study drug to the entire selected treatment 
area(s), as indicated on the body diagram. Subjects will be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to direct sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light sources while in the study and to wash their hands before and after application of the study drug.

32 It is suggested that subjects do not apply study drug on day of clinic visits so that this may be 
done by the subject at the clinic after study assessments are completed and to confirm proper 
application technique and retrain as necessary. 
10.2 Study Drug Accountability 
Upon receipt of the study drug, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the 
investigational center staff member will conduct a complete inventory of study materials and assume responsibility for their storage and dispensing. In accordance with federal regulations, the investigators must agree to keep all study materials in a secure location with restricted access. The investigator will keep a record of the inventory and dispensing of all study drug. This record will be made available to the sponsor’s monitor for the purpose of accounting for all clinical supplies. Any significant discrepancy and/or deficiency must be recorded with an explanation. 
All supplies sent to the investigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Each tube will be weighed (with the cap on) before dispensing to and upon return by the subjects, and weights will be recorded on the pharmacy log and appropriate eCRF. All used and unused supplies will be returned to the sponsor/designee for destruction at the conclusion of the study. 
11 Study Procedures and Evaluations 
All subject information and data obtained during the study visits will be recorded in the source documents, applicable study logs, and eCRFs. 
Evaluators must have appropriate, documented experience and training, or obtain approval 
from the sponsor based on experience (or through additional training organized by the sponsor).
At each study visit, every attempt should be made to ensure that the same 
investigator/evaluator assesses the same subject. 
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations and Procedures

11.3.2 Medical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination 
A medical history will be taken at Screening, and confirmed and revised if needed, at 
Baseline. Medical histories having resolved 2 or more years before Baseline need not be collected unless considered relevant by the investigator. 
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of weight and vital signs 
(blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and oral temperature) will be performed at Baseline, Week 8, and Week 12 (post-treatment follow-up visit). Height will be measured at Baseline only.  Any abnormal physical exam findings will be recorded. 
11.3.3 Safety Laboratory Tests 
Routine safety laboratory tests (CBC/Diff and serum chemistry) will be performed at 
Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. Any out-of-range laboratory result that is considered clinically significant by the investigator will be recorded as an AE and should be confirmed by repeat testing at the discretion of the investigator. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at any visit will be followed to resolution (return to normal or to the baseline state) or until clinically stable as determined by the investigator.

42 11.3.4 Pregnancy Tests 
All female subjects of childbearing potential will undergo serum pregnancy testing at 
Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. In addition, urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening and prior to randomization at Baseline, and at Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
11.4 Other Evaluations 
11.4.1 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
The DLQI questionnaire will be administered to subjects at Day 0 (Baseline), Week 4, Week 8/End of Treatment and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
11.5 Adverse Events 
11.5.1 Definition of Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. AEs include any unfavorable and unintended illness, sign, symptom, clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. The collection of nonserious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) should begin following the subject's completion of the consent process to participate in the study. 
11.5.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of 
the study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject at each study visit. 
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit 
must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered drug-related. All AEs, whether in response to a query, observed by the study site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject, will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate eCRF: 
x Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
x Onset date and end date 
Protocol V01-122A-302, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
43 x Maximum intensity (severity) 
x Seriousness
x Action taken regarding study drug 
x Corrective treatment, if given 
x Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded. 
Vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clin ically significant (for 
example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion). 
11.5.3 Serious Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or nonserious. 
An SAE or serious adverse reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at 
any dose: 
x Results in death 
x Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) 
x Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective surgery for a baseline condition is not considered an 
AE)
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the above listed outcomes 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE, and must be reported to the sponsor/designee within 24 hours of your awareness of the event.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
44 11.5.4 Assessment of Severity 
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by the maximum severity of the AE. 
The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs: 
x Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
x Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
x Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospitalization or prolongation of current 
hospitalization possible; may be incapacitating or life threatening 
11.5.5 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either “Related” or “Not Related”. The following should be taken into account when assessing SAE causality: 
x Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was 
withdrawn and the SAE resolved or the event recurred after re introduction. 
x If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or concomitant illness. 
x Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy. 
x No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists. 
x If the AE is directly related to study procedures or there is a lack of efficacy. 
11.5.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor 
or designee within 24 hours of investigational center notification to comply with regulatory requirements. 
All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to study drug, must be immediately reported to the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written SAE report form signed by the investigator within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.

45 The fax number for reporting an SAE is: 
 
 
           
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Medical Monitor of an SAE. If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospital records and autopsy reports should be provided to Sponsor/designee as soon as they are available. Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to investigational product) that occurs within 30 days after stopping the study drug, the SAE must be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, 
notably he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has left the study, and that additional investigations may be requested by the sponsor. 
11.5.7 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports 
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not 
reported in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or severity. 
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document 
(Investigator Brochure or Package Insert) and are related (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study drug. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory reporting agency(ies). Valeant Pharmaceuticals will 
notify regulatory authorities of these AEs and all participating investigational centers in 
writing for submission by the investigator to the IRB/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the Investigator Brochure (i.e., “15-day letter”). 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information. 
11.5.8 Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
If an AE should require laboratory testing in addition to that required by protocol, the results 
of the test(s) must be obtained by the investigational center and filed with the subject’s source documentation. Any laboratory test result that meets the criteria for an SAE must also be reported to the sponsor/designee via written SAE report form signed by the investigator within 24 hours of investigational center notification.

46 11.5.9 Pregnancy
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth control 
during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of contraceptive failure is minimized. Abstinence is allowed as a birth control method. 
Before enrolling a female subject of childbearing potential in this clinical trial, the 
investigator must review the following information about study participation: 
x Informed consent requirements 
x Contraceptives in current use 
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or designee and the subject must sign the informed consent before study enrollment. 
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact 
the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
enrollment, the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy come s to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be 
submitted to the sponsor, initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery.
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor within 24 
hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed pregnancies must be reported via confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written Pregnancy Report form within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. 
12 Statistics
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim 
analyses are planned. Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two-sided and will be performed at the 0.05 level of significance. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. 
For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be presented. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Appropriate inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables.

47 The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. As a sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on-therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). No imputations will be made for missing safety data. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a 
separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
12.1 Assessment of Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percent of subjects with treatment success, defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline in IGA score and an IGA score equating to “Clear” or “Almost Clear”. 
12.1.1 Primary Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be used to compare once daily application of IDP-122 
Lotion and vehicle.
The percent of subjects with treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed using Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests stratified by analysis center. 
12.1.2 Secondary Efficacy 
Similar to the primary endpoint analyses comparisons will be performed using CMH tests 
stratified by analysis center. The secondary efficacy endpoints will be: 
x Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear 
to Almost Clear at Week 12 for IDP-122 Lotion verses IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
x Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear to Almost Clear at Week 6 for IDP-122 Lotion verses IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
x Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear 
to Almost Clear at Week 4 for IDP-122 Lotion verses IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
x Percentage of subjects who show at least a 2 grade improvement and reach Clear to Almost Clear at Week 2 for IDP-122 Lotion verses IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
Evaluation of the secondary efficacy variables will use a gated sequential procedure starting with the comparisons of the first bulleted item and proceeding onto the next item. The process will terminate if a nonstatistically significant value is observed.

12.1.4 Pooling Analysis 
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site with the intention of pooling the data for analysis. Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each study site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner such that a minimum of 15 subjects will be randomized and included in the ITT population (i.e., approximately at least 10 subjects in the IDP-122 arm and at least 5 subjects in the Vehicle arm) for any investigator. In the event that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm for an investigator, then the investigator’s data will be combined to achieve the desired sample size minimum per treatment arm. The combining of investigator data will be accomplished by taking the investigator with the smallest enrollment and combining it with the investigator with the largest, restricted to investigational sites that did not meet minimum 
enrollment. If there is a further need to combine data, then the data of the investigator with the second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrollment, and so on. This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a minimum of 15 subjects enrolled.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
49 The process of combining investigator data that have insufficient subjects per treatment arm 
will result in redefining the groups of investigators for the purposes of statistical analyses. These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses. 
The consistency of treatment response will be investigated across the analysis centers 
subsequent to combining the data as described above. Statistical tests will be conducted to identify if there are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of common statistical and clinical conclusions. For the purpose of testing consistency of treatment response, the primary efficacy variable will be considered. The percent of subjects with treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment group, analysis center, and the interaction term of treatment group by analysis center. Further examination will follow if the analysis results in a significant interaction term. 
In the event that the logistic regression interaction p-value is less than or equal to 0.10, a 
sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the extreme efficacy result will be performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect. On the other hand, if the analysis results in an interaction terms with p-value greater than 0.10, then the conclusions from the pooled data will be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis centers. 
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or 
centers that contribute to the statistical significance of the interaction term of the logistic regression. The process involves submitting subsets of analysis centers to the logistic regression and observing the interaction p-value for the subset. Subsets resulting in interaction p-values greater than 0.10 are considered homogeneous. 
The search for an extreme analysis center begins by analyzing all subsets that can be created 
by excluding 1 analysis center. If 1 or more of the subsets result in an interaction p-value 
greater than or equal to 0.10, then the analysis center excluded from the subset with the largest interaction p-value is deemed the extreme analysis center. 
If all subset interaction p-values are less than or equal to 0.10, then the process will analyze 
the interaction for all subsets that can be created by excluding 2 analysis centers. If 1 or more of these subsets generate interaction p-values larger than 0.10, then the analysis centers excluded from the subset with the largest interaction p-value are deemed the extreme analysis centers. 
Thus, the process of identifying the extreme analysis centers will continue in a stepwise 
manner by first excluding 1, then 2, then 3, etc, analysis centers until the logistic regression interaction p-value exceeds 0.10.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, 14 October 2015 
 CONFIDENTIAL 
50 Once the extreme analysis center or centers have been identified, then the treatment p-values 
of the remaining analysis centers will be computed. Inferences will be drawn from the treatment p-value, as well as any pertinent observations regarding the extreme analysis center or centers. Additionally, it is noted that this process excludes subjects from the analysis in a nonrandom manner and has an unpredictable impact on the power of the treatment effect test. In the event that the treatment effect of the remaining subset is not statistically significant, due consideration of the post hoc aspects of the process will be given when the results are interpreted. Conclusions will be presented by the sponsor as appropriate to the findings of the sensitivity analysis. Prior to investigating the treatment effect within the analysis centers, the magnitude of the site main effect will be investigated to determine if the main site-to-site variability is such that it could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior to pooling, the percent of subjects with treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment group, site, and the interaction term of treatment group by site. If the analysis is not computationally feasible due to some sites having very few subjects enrolled, the low-enrolling sites will be excluded from the analysis. 
12.1.5 Missing Efficacy Data Imputations 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. 
This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pattern of missing observations in 1 treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in another.
For each efficacy variable (IGA and psoriasis signs), the following steps will be performed to 
impute missing data: 
1. Calculate the number of missing Week 8 values to be estimated by MCMC in each 
treatment group. Let nmiss be the maximum number of missing Week 8 values 
among the treatment groups. 
2. For each treatment group, create a data set containing subjects with observed values 
and those needing estimation by MCMC. The missing efficacy data in each data set 
will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets. The resulting data set for each treatment group will be combined into 
1 complete data set for each imputation. Options will be included in each imputation 
process to prevent estimating values to be outside the range of expected values for the assessment. 
3. Imputed data will be used to determine dichotomized success/failure values. 
4. Each complete data set will be analyzed with the appropriate CMH test. 
5. CMH statistics will be normalized using the Wilson-Hilferty transformation. 
6. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC MIANALYZE.

In the first set of sensitivity analyses, missing IGA values will be imputed using LOCF. 
Treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed as it was in the primary analyses. Comparisons will be performed on imputed data using CMH tests stratified by analysis center. 
12.1.6.2 Repeated Measures Analysis on Observed Data 
As a second sensitivity analysis, treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed with a repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), with treatment success as the dependent variable and treatment, analysis center and visit (Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8) as independent factors. 
12.1.7 Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the ITT population for the following subgroups: 
Baseline IGA, sex, age, ethnicity, and race. Age will be dichotomized to less than the median age of subjects and greater than or equal to the median age of subjects. Subgroup analyses will be conducted on the primary efficacy endpoint and will contain only descriptive statistics. 
12.2 Assessment of Safety 
12.2.1 Adverse Events 
The primary analysis of safety will be conducted at Week 8.  There will be a tabulation, however, of the AE’s that start in the period post the Week 8 to Week 12 visit.  All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study 
drug application, will be summarized by treatment group and will provide the number of 
subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by severity or relationship to study drug, each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported SAEs will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting the event, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug.

In addition, a listing of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to AEs will 
be provided as well as a listing of subjects who reported an SAE. 
12.2.2 Local Skin Reactions 
The frequency of local skin reactions including itching, dryness, burning/stinging, skin 
atrophy, striae, telangiectasia and folliculitis will be summarized by treatment group and visit. Additionally, the percent of subjects who experience a local skin reaction (itching, dryness, burning/stinging) graded at a level of 3, at any point in the study following the first application of study drug, will be tabulated by treatment group. 
12.2.3 Safety Laboratory Values and Vital Sign Measurements 
Changes from Baseline in safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics for each treatment group at all applicable study visits. 
Shift tables will be presented for changes in  safety laboratory values to summarize laboratory 
test results collected at Baseline and Weeks 4 and 8. Normal ranges established by the central 
laboratory will be used to determine the shif ts. A listing of all out-of-range laboratory test 
results at any assessment time point will also be provided. Determination of clinical significance for all out-of-range laboratory values will be made by each investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a listing of all clinically significant laboratory test results 
will be provided.

12.8 Additional Statistical Considerations 
12.8.1 Analysis Populations 
Approximately 210 adult subjects with moderate or severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score 
of 3 or 4) will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 2:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that: 
x Approximately 140 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) 
Lotion 
x Approximately 70 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and the per 
protocol (PP) population. The ITT analysis set will be considered primary for the evaluation of efficacy. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. 
All subjects who are randomized and dispensed study drug will be included in the ITT 
analysis set. 
All subjects who are randomized, receive at least 1 confirmed dose of study drug and have at 
least 1 post-baseline safety assessment will be included in the safety analysis set. 
All subjects in the ITT analysis set who complete the Week 8 visit without any major 
protocol violations will be included in the PP analysis set. The PP population will include subjects in the ITT population who did not meet any of the following criteria: 
x Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
x Used an interfering concomitant medication 
x Did not attend the Week 8 visit 
x Missed more than 1 post-baseline study visit prior to Week 8 
x Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., subjects must apply 
80%-120% of the expected applications of study medication during participation 
in the study) 
x Out of visit window at the Week 8 visit by more than ± 5 days

One hundred forty (140) IDP-122 treated subjects and seventy (70) vehicle treated subjects 
will have greater than 95% power to detect a statistically significant outcome for a two-sided 
test with an alpha level of 0.05.
It was noted that the estimates extracted from the above studies are based on the LOCF 
method of handling missing values while the proposed Phase 3 analysis will account for missing values using multiple imputations. The power stated above sufficiently exceeds 95% which will compensate for the difference in handling of missing data. 
12.8.3 Handling of Missing Data 
The method of multiple imputation will be used (see  Section 12.1.4).

17.1 Subject Instruction Sheet 
A thin layer of study drug should be applied once daily  at about the same time each day over 
the affected treatment areas indicated by the investigator for 8 weeks As a reminder, the face, 
scalp, axillae (armpit) and intertriginous (skinfold) areas will be excluded.
Specifically, subjects will squeeze a small amount of study drug (about the size of a pea) 
onto a fingertip and then spread a thin layer of the study drug over the affected treatment area. If necessary, additional pea-sized amounts of study drug may be applied in increments (one pea size gently rubbed over a treatment area at a time) to cover all affected treatment areas. 
The amount of study drug used by the subjects will be monitored by weighing each newly 
dispensed study drug container and weighing each returned study drug container at all applicable study visits. The maximum allowable weekly usage is 50 grams for this study. 
Be sure to wash your hands after you apply the product (unless the study doctor has 
instructed you to treat your palms). 
Reminders: 
x On study visit days please wait until after your study assessments are completed before 
application of the study drug or any approved moisturizers. Any retraining can be provided by site staff, if needed. 
x Avoid contact with the eyes, inside the nose, mouth and all mucous membranes. 
x THE TEST MATERIAL SHOULD BE USED ONLY BY THE PERSON FOR WHOM IT WAS PRESCRIBED and it should be kept out of the reach of children or others of limited capacity to read or understand. 
Store this at room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) with excursions permitted 
between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).Containers of test material must be returned to the study facility, even if they are empty. 
Be sure to complete the diary calendar each day to document applications and also note any 
missed doses; and bring the completed diary to each study visit. 
Continue to use the same study doctor approved non-medicated cleansers, moisturizers and 
sunscreens throughout the study. Avoid or minimize unnecessary sun exposure. Also for further ultraviolet protection use protective clothing such as broad brimmed hats as needed.        It is important that you inform the study site about any medications (i.e., prescriptions, over-
the-counter medications, street drugs, or herbal medications) that you have taken during the 
study.

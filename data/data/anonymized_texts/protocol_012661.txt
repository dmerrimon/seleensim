2.0 Objectives  
 2.1 Primary Objectives  
The long- term goal  is to develop effective ways to improve glycemic control in 
youth with T1D. To that end, we propose to specifically evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and usability of two new interventions  in diabetes care: 
an economic incentive  (COIN2DOSE)  and an approach that uses an economic 
loss aversion (LOAN2DOSE) to promote patient engagement with mealtime insulin dosing behavior. If initially efficacious, our results will serve as the basis for an R 01 submission(s) to conduct a fully powered efficacy trial of  
COIN2DOSE  and LOAN2DOSE . This study is significant  as omission of 
mealtime boluses is one of the common reasons for suboptimal diabetes control in youth. This project is highly innovative because it will: 1) target youth who are predicted by artificial intelligence to experience a worsening in glycemic control,  2) use an economic incentive intervention to improve mealtime insulin dosing behavior  and 3) use an economic loss aversion to improve mealtime insulin 
dosing behavior.  
 2.2 Hypotheses  
Aim 1: To determine the impact of COIN2DOSE  and LOAN2DOSE as 
compared to control on the trajectory of glycemic control and treatment engagement among adolescen ts age 12- 17 years who are at risk for a near -
term rise in A1C.  
Hypothesis 1:  Use of COIN2DOSE  will result in a lower  rise in A1C  
compared to the controls. Hypothesis 2:  Use of COIN2DOSE  will improve engagement as measured 
by mealtime insulin BOLUS score compared to controls.  Hypothesis 3: Use of COIN2DOSE will yield sustained improvements in 
A1C  trajectory for 12 weeks after the intervention.  
Hypothesis 4: Use of COIN2DOSE will yield sustained improvements in 
BOLUS score for 12 weeks after the intervention.  
Hypothesis 5: U se of LOAN2DOSE  will result in a lower  rise in A1C  
compared to the controls.

 Page 6  of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  Hypothesis 6:  Use of LOA N2DOSE  will improve engagement as measured 
by mealtime insulin BOLUS score compared to controls.  
Hypothesis 7: Use of LOAN2DOSE will yield sustained improvements in 
A1C  trajectory for 12 weeks after the intervention.  
Hypothesis 8: Use of LOAN2DOSE will yield sustained improvements in 
BOLUS score for 12 weeks after the intervention.  
 
 
 
Aim 2: To determine the feasibility of COIN2DOSE  and LOAN2DOSE  
intervention s in adolescents age 12- 17 years who are at risk for a significant 
near- term rise in A1C. 
Hypothesis 9:  The COIN2DOSE intervention will be feasible as determined 
by 1) ≥ 75% of participants in the intervention group will  complete all study 
procedures for the  duration of the intervention and post -intervention study 
periods, 2) ≥75% of parents will endorse the feasibility of providing an equivalent economic incentive plan, and 3) no decrease in quality of life  at 
visit 2 compared to baseline (visit 1). 
Hypothes is 10: The LOAN2DOSE intervention will be feasible as 
determined by 1) ≥75% of participants in the intervention group will 
complete all study procedures for the duration of the intervention and post -
intervention study periods, 2) ≥75% of parents will endor se the feasibility of 
providing an equivalent economic loss aversion plan, and 3) no decrease in 
quality of life at visit 2 compared to baseline (visit 1).  
 
 
Aim 3:  To determine user satisfaction with the COIN2DOSE and 
LOAN2DOSE intervention in adolescents  age 12- 17 years who are at risk for 
a significant near -term rise in A1C. 
Hypothesis 11: COIN2DOSE will be usable as determined by using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (change version).  
Hypothesis 12: LOAN2DOSE will be usable as determined by using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (change version).  
 
 
 
3.0 Background  
 
3.1 Background  
Individuals with T1D can have a tremendous impact on their own health outcomes if they follow their T1D treatment regimen
 (2) (3) (4). Unfortunately, many adolescents do not 
adhere to their treatment and experience increased risk for both immediate medical emergencies, long -term T1D -related complications, and mortality (3) (5) . Diabetic 
ketoacidosi s (DKA)  occurs at a rate of 4.81/100 patient -years in individuals with 
established T1D and at a rate of 15.83/100 patient years in youth with an A1C  >9%
 (6). 
Adolescents who have poorly controlled T1D are much more likely to develop DKA (3) 
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 7  of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  (7).  While health care professionals can offer guidance and recommendations, it is clear 
that traditional clinical interactions are not sufficient to promote optimal self -care and 
adherence for many adolescents (8) with the majority not reaching A1C  targets (3). In fact , 
adolescents with T1D exhibit significant deterioration in glycemic control (aka rising A1C ) 
from age 8 to 18 (9), as shown below.  
 
 
 
A number of  behavioral interventions have demonstrated utility in improving adherence 
behaviors in youth with T1D13-19. Improved adherence behaviors are associated with better 
glycemic control and short and long- term health outcomes (3). On the other hand, lack of 
adherence can have serious consequences both acutely (DKA or severe hypoglycemic 
events) and long- term (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease) 
(3). Missed mealtime boluses can have devastating metabolic consequences (16).  
 Adolescence is a particularly  challenging time for individuals with  T1D, with average A1C  
values that are 5% higher than during other periods of childhood and 14% higher than adults ( 22) (2) . Glycemic control worsens from early childhood through age 16- 18 (23). It 
is critically important to develop interventions to prevent deterioration in glycemic control. 
High glycemic variability is also associated with increased  risk of long -term diabetes 
complications, such as microalbuminuria (24). Lack of adherence to diabetes treatment 
plans is one of the main causes of sub- optimal glycemic  control  (3) (25) (7).  A significant 
part of this non- adherence is omission of insulin for ingested carbohydrates at snacks and 
meals, both by missing boluse s entirely and by inaccurate carbohydrate counting (26) (16) 
(27) (28) (29). Studies have shown significant underestimation of carbohydrate content in 
meals of up to 20%  (26). Furthermore, greater than 33% of adolescents fail to give insulin 
for >15% of th eir meals and snacks  (16). Adolescents, on average, miss boluses for meals 
two times per week  (28). In one study, youth who omitted insulin at least one time per 
week had an A1C  of 8.8- 9.5%, while those who consistently took meal -time insulin had a 
signifi cantly lower A1C  of 7.8- 8.0%  (28) (30). This is of great significance  as poor 
glycemic control increases risk of both acute and chronic diabetes related complications  
(31). Meal bolus alarms on insulin pumps , which alarm at a preset time,  lead to transient , 
modest changes in dosing behavior (32) . “Lost focus” has been identified as a significant 
reason for missed meal -time boluses in adolescents  (33).  Exactly how to effectively 
maximize engagement with mealtime insulin dosing behavior among adolescents wit h T1D 
represents a critical gap in knowledge.  
 
3.2 Rationale  

SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 8  of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023   
There is an urgent need for a sustainable method that improves patient engagement with delivering mealtime insulin boluses. Improved engagement with mealtime boluses will lead to better glycemic co ntrol and will ultimately help reduce the risk of acute and chronic 
diabetes related complications.  
 
 
Recent evidence suggests that financial incentives can successfully increase adherence to blood glucose monitoring among adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes  with 
moderate to large treatment effect size. Specifically, one study of 10 adolescents evaluated a financial incentive program that delivered $0.10 per fingerstick blood glucose test, with b onus incentives for ≥4 tests per day and a maximum achievable incentive of 
$251.40 over 12 weeks. The authors found that SMBG increased from 1.8 ± 1.0 to 4.9 ± 
1.0 tests per day (P < 0.001) with 90% completing four or more tests per day; that mean 
A1C  fell from 9.3 ± 0.9% to 8.4 ± 1.5% (P = 0.05); and that adolescents and parents 
reported high satisfaction with procedures. In another study, 90 adolescents and young 
adults demonstrated that a $60 monthly incentive opportunity significantly increased 
adherence to glucose monitoring goals in the 90- day incentive period (50.0% vs 18.9%; 
adjusted difference, 27.2%; 95% CI, 9.5% to 45.0%; P = .003). The effect was not 
sustained during the post -interventional 90- day observation period (15.3% vs 8.7%; 
adjusted difference, 3.9%; 95% CI, - 2.0% to 9.9%; P  = .20) , and A1C  did not improve. 
The evidence to date suggests that it is feasible to increase adherence behaviors among 
adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes . It is unclear whether targeting blood 
glucose monitoring behaviors is always associ ated with an improvement in A1C . 
Whether financial incentives produce a sustained improvement in adherence is also an 
open question. These methods have not been applied to mealtime insulin dosing 
behaviors, so whether financial incentives improve adherence  to mealtime insulin dosing 
among adolescents and young adults is also unknown.  
 There is a strong rationale for targeting adherence to mealtime insulin dosing for improvement. Prior observational research suggests a 1.5% decrease in A1C  levels for 
every one -bolus increase in daily mealtime doses, supporting our premise that increasing 
mealtime insulin use might help youth who are at risk of increasing A1C (1).  
 The objective of the present study is to obtain pilot feasibility data to 1) determine whether COIN2DOSE and/or LOAN2DOSE show a preliminary trend for improvement in the 
outcomes of interest, 2) perform power calculations that will inform the design of a definitive trial(s) and 3) establish feasibility of the interventions and study procedures to inform the design of a definitive trial(s).

CGM) inserted 1 week after enrollment and at visit 1, and at visit 2. P articipant s will 
wear the CGM for 10 days  following each insertion. We will consider >120 hours (>50% 
of total possible capture) of CGM data to be analyzable, otherwise data will be  
considered missing. Percent time in range (70- 180), percent time >180, percent time 
>250, percent time <70, and percent time <54 mg/dL will be collected.  
 
Participants who already have their own CGM will wear and use it as usual. They will not require a blinded Dexcom.  
 For patient -reported outcomes, questionnaires  may be completed on iPad for in- perso n 
visit or via email or text via Twilio  for remote visits .  If completing by email or text, a 
link to REDCap will be sent to participant.  
  
Quality of Life  will be assessed using the MIND Youth Questionnaire (My- Q), which is a 
valid measure of quality of life for teenagers with diabetes (49).  
 
Acceptability  will be assessed based on treatment satisfaction scores using the Diabetes 
treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, DTSQ -Teen, which has been validated for use in 
youth with T1D (50).  
  
Trust in provider : Will be measured as a change score (visit 2 -visit 1; visit 3-visit 1)  with 
10-items from the validated Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale (58).  
 
Perceived Involvement in Care : Will be measured as a change score (visit 2 -visit 1; visit 
3-visit 1) with 13 -items from the Perceived Involvement in Care Scale (59).  
 
Health -related empowerment:  Will be measured as a change score (visit 2 -visit 1; visit 3 -
visit 1) with 8 -items from the Health -related empowerment scale (60).  
 Covariate  Measures 
 
Demographics:  Age, sex, race, duration of diabetes .  
 
Depression  will be measured as a covariate  using the validated PHQ -A (which is the 
Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ -9, adapted for adolescents) (51). Note: no notification 
of medical personnel is necessary if adolescents endorse depressive symptoms because a) the surv ey does not ask about current suicidal ideation, and b) adolescents in the 
Children’s Mercy Diabetes Center are monitored for depression symptoms at every clinical encounter, with clinical encounters occurring every 3 -4 months typically. 
  
5.0 Study Intervention  
 
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 11 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  To identify an at- risk population for more intensive intervention opportunities,  the 
Children’s Mercy Diabetes Center now routinely use s a validated prediction model 
based on advanced machine learning  (random forest method)  and natural language 
processing to identify individuals  who are predicted experience a rise in A1C  in the 
next 90 days . The model analyzes all patients who presented for a diabetes visit in 
the prior week.  To accomplish this task, the complete health record for the CMH 
Diabetes Center registry is  analyzed. We will select patients from this cohort for 
recruitment into the present study.  
 
 
COIN2DOSE intervention : From one -week post -randomization to the 12- week  study 
visit, youth randomized to this treatment arm will receive p ersonalized feedback via 
monetary incentives for dosing insulin at mealtimes.  We will define mealtimes based on 
hour of the day and the presence of a carbohydrate entry associated with the insulin 
bolus. According to the methodology for calculating BOLUS (1) breakfast will be 0600-
1000, lunch will be 1100- 1500, and dinner will be 1600- 2200. Thus, w e will reimburse 
youth up to $0.50 per mealtime with at least one meal -associated (carbohydrate -
associated) insulin bolus completed (maximum $1.50/day). W e will of fer the opportunity 
for youth to earn a bonus reimbursement of up to $5.00/week for weeks during which 
they achieve at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. Finally, we will pay youth up 
to $2.00 per week for sharing their insulin use data at least t wo times per week with the 
study team during the three -month treatment phase (maximum $24.00). Therefore, 
maximum total incentive available is  $210.  
 
LOAN2DOSE intervention: From one -week post -randomization to the 12- week study 
visit, youth randomized to this treatment arm will receive personalized feedback via 
monetary deductions from a virtual bank of $210 for missed doses of insulin at 
mealtimes. P articipants will receive  a weekly email or text message using Twilio to 
communicate their current virtual bank balance. We will define mealtimes based on hour 
of the day and the presence of a carbohydrate entry associated with the insulin bolus. According to the methodology for calculating BOLUS  (1) breakfast will be 0600- 1000, 
lunch will be 1100- 1500, and dinner will be 1600- 2200. Thus, we will deduct $0.50 per 
mealtime with at least one meal- associated (carbohydrate- associated) insulin bolus 
missed (maximum - $1.50/day). Youth can also lose an additional amount of up to 
$5.00/week for weeks during which they don’t achieve at least 5 days of 3 mealtime 
insulin boluses. Finally, we will deduct the virtual account up to $2.00 per week for 
failing to share their insulin use data at least two times per week with the study team during the three -month treatment phase (maximum deduction of $24.00). Therefore, 
maximum total deductions is $210.

The study is an unblinded, 3- arm, randomized, controlled trial. After successful 
screening and consent, individuals will wear a blinded Dexcom G6 Pro CGM inserted 1 week after consent . Families who have previously used a CGM device 
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 12 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  will be allowed to insert the G6 Pro during a remote visit . At the baseline visit 
(visit 1; day 1), participants will be randomized to the COIN2DOSE, 
LOAN2DOSE, or control treatment arms and will be trained on the procedures appropriate to their treatment arm.  Participants will also complete baseline measures by  questionnaire.  Participants will complete procedures specific to their 
treatment arm weekly. Visit 2 will occur after 1 2 weeks  (90 days).  Participants  
will stop any treatment interventions after this visit. A1C  and questionnaire 
measures will be complet ed, and participants will again wear the Dexcom G6 Pro 
CGM for 10 days (the device will be returned by mail post -visit). Participants will 
receive no treatment intervention from week 13 to week 24. Visit 3 will occur 
after week 24 . Again, A1C  and questionnaire measures will be completed and 
participants will wear the Dexcom G6 Pro CGM for 10 days.  
Participants  who have their own CGM will wear it as usual and will not require a 
blinded Dexcom.  
 
All study participants will also have the option to participate in a focus group discussion (FGD) regarding study participation. 
 
Parents of children who meet inclusion criteria  and participate in the study may 
also elect to participate in a focus group.  
 
Study Visits  
Study visits may occur in -person or remotely (i.e., from home). Procedures will 
be adapted to accommodate both scenarios. 
 
7.0 Data and Specimen Banking  
 
Data Collection  
Demographic data: Demographic data will be collected from the participant via an electroni c data collection form in REDCap which shall serve as the s ource. 
Demographic data will be verified with review of electronic medical record data.  
For remote visits, a web URL  linking to the REDCap survey will be shared with 
participants.  
 
A1C  data: Partic ipants will use a capillary A1C kit to collect a fingerstick A1C  sample. 
An educational document and video (YouTube  https://youtu.be/e9loR3N4Rho ) 
have been created to educate approved study staff and participants on collection of 
the sample. The A1C  is analyzed in a CMH lab by automated high performance liquid 
chromatography (reference range 4.0 -6.0%, Tosoh 2.2, Tosoh Corporation, San 
Francisco, CA), which is a measurement method reliable to DCCT standards.  The 
CMH A1C  mail -in kit has excellent reliability to fresh samples (r=0.98). Samples will 
be delivered to the Broadway lab by approved study staff for in- person study visits; 
samples will be mailed to the Broadway lab by participants completing remote visits 
from home. Sample tubes will be pre- labeled by study staff with the participant’s 
study ID. If insufficient sample for analysis is collected at any time point, 
participants may be asked to repeat the sample co llection to rescue data collection.  
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 13 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023   
If participant does not return A1C mail -in-kit, point -of-care A1C or serum A1C may be 
used instead if available.  
 
CGM data: Participants will use the Dexcom G6 Pro in blinded mode for data collection purposes only. If insufficient data for analysis are collected at any time 
point, participants may be asked to replace the CGM device to rescue data 
collection. No treatment decisions will be based on G6 Pro data. Dexcom G6 Pro 
data will be uploaded from the Dexcom receiver  to Dexcom Clarity  using the 
participant’s personal, CMH -connected Dexcom Clarity account ; data will then be 
collected as a .csv file for analysis.  Files will be aggregated into a study database 
using MS Excel or equivalent software.  Participants with the ir own CGM will 
use it as usual. They will be asked to share their CGM information with the study team per the usual procedure for diabetes clinic visits.  
 Insulin delivery data: Participants will use their persona l, prescribed insulin 
delivery device thr oughout the study. Insulin delivery devices will be uploaded to 
Children’s Mercy -approved software compatible with the specific device. Data 
will be uploaded to the participant’s personal, CMH -connected account in the 
relevant upload system.  Data will the n be collected as a .csv file for analysis. 
Files will be aggregated into a study database using MS Excel or equivalent software. Insulin delivery systems and/or any date of system change will be noted 
at enrollment and on REDCap questionnaires.  
 Questionnaire data: All questionnaire data will be collected directly from participants via electronic (REDCap) . 
 Focus group discussions: Focus group discussions (FGD) will optional and 
stratified by intervention arm. As the ideal size for FGDs are 6 -8 participants, it is 
possible that we will conduct two FGDs per arm if there is enough interest among participants. Thus, we anticipate conducting 3- 6 FGDs. FGDs will be 
approximately 90 minutes in duration, conducted by a trained moderator using a semi -struc tured guide. Both youth and their parents will be invited to participate 
in the focus groups.  
 
FGDs will be conducted virtually on Microsoft Teams according to Standard Operating Procedures currently in pilot testing with the CMH Formative Research Team. De -
identified data will be transcribed using Teams software and uploaded into Dedoose software for analysis .

**Participants may choose to have in- person Dexcom insertion instruction at the PCRU 
or online via virtual instruction. If participant is Dexcom naive, they may insert Dexcom for the first time via online instruction, as it is a relatively simple procedure. If a participant is uncomfortable inserting the Dexcom for the for the first time virtually, they will have the option to do this with in- person instruction at the PCRU.  
 
The link that patients will be sent for learning to use Dexcom is: 
https://www.dexcom.com/ training -videos  
 
Participants with their own CGM  will not be anticipated to require training; however, this 
will be offered if needed.  
 
11.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria  
Individuals who have been predicted  via an artificial intelligence -intelligence based 
model  to experience a rise in A1C  in the near future ( 90 days) will be approached for 
recruitment. 36 participants will be recruited from the  Children’s Mercy  Diabetes Center  
(any clinic or hospital location ). Based on preliminary data review of our clinic 
population, there were at least 81 individuals who met inclusion criteria who were seen in clinic in the month of May 2019 alone. Patients will be randomized to , COIN2DOSE,  
LOAN2DOSE, or control group using a 1:1:1 randomization scheme .   
 
Inclusion Criteria:  1) Aged 12- 17.99 years  
2) The youth must have been diagnosed with T1D for at least 6 months  
3) The youth must have attended at least 2 routine T1D standard of care visits in the 
past 12 months  
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 16 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  4) The youth must be using an insulin delivery device capable of recording, storing, 
and downloading insulin bolus behaviors  (insulin pump or smart Bluetooth insulin pen 
that can be uploaded to standard clinic upload software) .  
5) The youth  must have a current A1C  >7.2% and /or be predicted to have a rise in 
A1C  in of 0.3% or higher  the next  90 days.  
6) Not pregnant or planning to become pregnant by self -report . 
 
 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1) Participants with any type of diabetes mellitus other than T1D  
2) Participant has any disease- causing anemia or affecting red blood cell physiology 
(which would impact A1C ) 
3) Participant has a physical disability, which  in the opinion of the investigator would 
interfere with individua l’s ability to feed themselves or use one’s hands to facilitate 
eating  
4) Participants with no internet access or ability to upload device(s) to data aggregation software that is accessible to study team.  
 For Focus Groups:  
 
Any parent or legal guardian whose child is participating in the study is invited to 
participate in a focus group discussion.  
 
 
12.0 Vulnerable Populations  
 
This study will include children. Parent /LAR permission will be sought before a child 
may be enrolled. Written a ssent of children 7 and older will be obtained per CMH policy; 
all children in this study will be above the age of assent and therefor e required to assent 
for participation.   
 
If a child subject reaches the age of majority (18 years old) during t he study, he or she 
will be asked to consent to further participation using an Adult Addendum .  
 Parents or legal guardians of youth who are eligible to participate in this study will be eligible to participate in a focus group. It is possible that a parent or legal guardian will be pregnant at the time of focus group participation.  
 
We will not enroll other vulnerable populations, i.e.  prisoners, neonates, and/or adults lacking capacity.  
 
Children’s Mercy Kansas C ity employees or children of employees will no t be 
recruited.  
 
13.0 Local Number of Subjects  
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 17 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  Target sample size is 36  adolescents.  The maximum number of subjects enrolled 
will be 72.  
 
Parents or legal guardians of youth eligible for inclusion in the study may choose to 
participate in a focus group. We may enroll up to 30 parents or legal guardians.  
 
 
14.0 Screening and Recruitment Methods  
 
Patients will be prescreened to see if they meet enrollment criteria by a member of the research team. Patients who appear to meet criteria may be contacted by telephone, email  or approached during a standard of care visit by a study team 
member and informed about this study.  Patients and their parent/leg al guardian 
will be given information about the study and they will determine if they wish to participate. Recruitment will also take place via telephone utilizing an IRB -approved 
telephone script.   
 
Flyers will be used as a means of advertising the study to help with recruitment.   IRB approved flyers will be used to advertise  via email invitation and  at all CMH locations.  
Recruitment will then be in person or via phone call.  A copy of the flyer is attached to the submission.  
 Parents/legal guardians of children who meet enrollment criteria and are approached for the study will be invited to participate in a focus group at the end of the study.  Recruitment for the parent/legal guardian focus group participation will occur at the same time and using the s ame method for recruiting the pediatric patient (i.e. by telephone or in 
person).  
 
Pres creening may involve either a review of clinic schedules or a report generated 
by IT that will  involve a review of the electronic medical record (EMR) system to 
generate a list of potentially eligible participants .  
 
A HIPAA waiver is requested for the purpose of generating a pre- screening list of 
qualified candidates for research recruitment as described above. Information collected to track recruitment will be included  in the  pre -screening log for 
determining and tracking eligibility and tracking clinic visits where participants may be approached about the study. PHI on non- participants will be kept until 
completion of enrollment . Upon the completion of enrollment, the study team will 
also request a de- identified, aggregate report containing demographic information 
on individuals who declined enrollment. This information will be used to compare recruited individuals to non- recruit ed individuals in dissemination work products 
(e.g., manuscripts, presentations) so that any biases in sampling the eligible 
population can be reported.  
 
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 18 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  15.0 Reimbursement, Payment and Tangible Property provided to 
subjects  
 
Participants  in all groups will be compensated a total of $120 for their time and 
participation. They will receive $40 for study visit attendance and questionnaire 
completion. The 40 participants will each participate in 3 visits. It is possible that we may need to enroll additional  participants if subjects withdraw, therefore additional funds for 
stipends for 4 additional subjects have been added.   Participants in the COIN2DOSE arm  may earn up to an additional $210 as incentive for 
completing mealtime insulin doses; the incentive p ayment is the intervention in this case.  
The total compensation for this group would be $330.   Participants in the LOAN2DOSE arm will begin the study with a virtual bank balance of $210 and will keep this amount if mealtime boluses and data sharing are completed as study activities are scheduled. They will also receive $40 for study visit attendance and questionnaire completion. The total compensation for this group could be $330.  Youth who are enrolled in the study and who elect to participate in a focus  group 
discussion will receive an additional $35 for doing this.    Parents/legal guardians who participate will also receive $35 for participating.  
 
16.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
Participants  may withdraw from the study at any time and this will not affect the ir 
medical care. No additional study related data will be collected on participants after 
withdrawal from the study, but previously collected information will be retained. All participants  who enroll into the study will be included in the  primary  analys is, with the 
exception of those who are withdrawn from the study for not meeting eligibility criteria.  
 
 
17.0 Risks to Subjects  
The overall risks of participation in this project are no more than minimal. Because the research requires the collection of personally identifying data, there is a risk breach of confidentiality. Participants will be requested to disclose information about their diabetes adherence, blood glucose values, regimen knowledge, and psychological and behavioral functioning. Disclosing this information may potentially lead to emotional discomfort. If a participant reports any concerning symptoms regarding his or her emotional stature, the participants and his/her parent/guardian will be provided with information on how to get help. 
If a participant has a positive screen on the PHQ -A (depression), social work will 
be notified and will see the participant during the study visit. Social work will assess the patient and develop a plan of action in conjunction with the attending physician bas ed on the  clinical situation. Participants may also feel 
inconvenienced by the time required to participate in the study. Participants may 
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 19 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  experience some discomfort with Dexcom insertion, which is similar to insulin 
pump site insertions. Participants will be instructed on proper care of the Dexcom 
site.   In the virtual focus group discussions, t here is minor risk of unauthorized 
disclosure of confidential information, which would be made known to 
participants and will be minimized by the research team’s efforts to ensure 
confidentiality  (see section 20.0) . Every effort will be made to keep data de -
identified , including having participants use pseudonyms for the discussion and 
being reminded not to respond in a way that might include personal identi fying 
information . Risks are greatly reduced by using secure files, storing data on 
secure computers, de -identification of data. Subjects and/or their parents/legal 
guardians  may choose not to participate  in the focus groups . There may be a risk 
that some of the questions make participants feel uncomfortable. Participants may 
skip a question or stop the study at any time.    
18.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
 Participants could benefit by responding to the financial incentives (COIN2DOSE  or 
LOAN2DOSE ) and impr ove their mealtime dosing behaviors. With improved insulin 
dosing behaviors, the participants may improve their overall glycemic control. It is possible that participants will not derive any benefit from participation.   Parents/legal guardians who choose to participate in the focus group may or may not gain useful information to help their child improve diabetes care. It is possible that parents/legal guardians will not derive any benefit from participation.

20.0 Data Management and Confidentiality  
  
20.1 Statistical Analysis  Plan  
 
Database construction and management will involve acquisition of data from each source 
(see above), imported into Microsoft Excel or an equivalent database program. All analys is will be completed using Stata/SE 15.1 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical 
Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC), SPSS version 20, SAS 
version 9.4, other statistical programs as needed. Univariate analysis will be performed on all dependent and independent variables. Analysis includes determining whether the variables have non- normal distributions or outliers. Determinations then will be made as 
to whether the data transformations are needed. For example, if variance heteroscedasticity , exists, data will be analyzed using log- transformed or other 
transformations ba sed upon Box- Cox approximations to normal distributions. Measures 
of other central de pendency and dispersion will be evaluated. Primary analyses will be 
modified intention to treat analysis. All individuals who are randomized will be included in the analys is. A secondary per -protocol analysis may also be performed. Multivariable 
regression models will be examined to estimate the effects of study variables on the primary outcome – predicted trajectory of glycemic control base on A1C  over 90 days – 
for this s ample of T1D patients’ data collected at three time points: baseline, 3 months, 
and 6 months. If the independent variables are highly correlated, we will explore General Linear Models (GLM) or other models. It is possible that Generalized Estimating 
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 21 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  Equati ons (GEE) will be explored for their  appropriateness in a larger study and/or for 
comparisons with the GLM results. Demographic and clinical variables will be entered 
into models following the independent variable: treatment group assignment. Since time effects may be important in the analyses due to treatments, censoring of data, time 
sequences, or other reasons, time of observation (i.e . visit 1[day 0], visit 2 [day 90], or 
visit 3 [day 180])  will also be explicitly accounted for in the regression models. All 
models will account for the clustering effect of participants having more than one clinic 
visit during the study timeframe. Additional variables will be collected as listed above. 
Statistical significance will be p<0. 5 (one -sided). 
 
 
20.2 Power analysis  
 To evalua te the primary outcome: glycemic control (measure s as predicted trajectory of 
A1C over 90 days), a multivariable regression model will be developed that accounts for 
seven independent variables: two primary – adherence and quality of life – and an additional five covariates: participant age, sex, insurance status, intervention/control group status, and time (52).  Using an F -test and significan t level (alpha) of 0.025, a  
sample of 20 T1D patients per treatment arm would  achieve 74% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.35  (53). Findings from this pilot study will be used as estimates in 
planning future studies including recruitment of enough patients to achieve a power of 
greater than or equal to 80% to evaluate glycemic control (54).  
20.3 Data security  
Study information will be collected electronically and stored on a secure division drive on the CMH network domain or on Microsoft OneDrive  or equivalent;  access will be 
restricted to research team members.  All the questionnaires listed above will be collected in REDCap  if possible . 
 Paper data collection forms will be stored in the Endocrine Re search Coordinator secure 
office where only research staff have access.  Research records containing PHI will be transported when necessary and will be transported in hospital approved PHI lockboxes per CMH policy.   A C ertificate of Confidentiality  has not been issued for this study.  
 
Data will be stored per the Record Retention a nd Management Policy
 and the 
Record Retention Schedule.  
 Approved study staff will have access to research records.  Lab & study  staff will 
have access to samples.  
 The PI is  ultimately  responsible for receipt or transmission of the data or specimens . 
Fami lies will mail in the A1C  kit which will only contain the Subject ID. When the 
sample arrives in the lab, research staff is contacted so that the sample can be matched to the MRN so that the sample can be resulted  as a “research result” in the 
electronic health record . 
 
 
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 22 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  Virtual focus groups will be conducted on a CMH Microsoft Teams channel. 
Parents /legal guardians  and/or participating youth may be in the focus groups.  
Participants will be instructed to not include any identifying information in their 
responses. After participants are instructed to change their screenname to a pseudonym, the meeting will be recorded and transcribed directly into the Teams folder, accessible only to the research team. Files will be scrutinized to ensure there is no PHI, censored if 
necessary, and uploaded directly into Dedoose for coding. 
 
21.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of Subjects  
N/A 
 
The proposed project is a new intervention, therefore we will recruit a Data Safety 
and Monitoring Board (DSMB) to oversee and monitor the treatment implementation 
and data collection. We proposed members of the DSMB will include an endocrinologist, a bios tatistician, and a certified diabetes educator. Members of the 
DSMB will be employees of CM H but will not be involved in this study in any way. As 
part of the DSMB oversight, we propose to meet by every 6 month during the conduct 
of the study . For each of the meetings, the PIs (Dr. Tsai and Dr. McDonough) and 
biostatistician (Mr. David Williams) will jointly prepare a summary of the following 
topics: performance monitoring (a report of subject recruitment/retention, protocol adherence, and quality of data c ollection procedures), safety monitoring (a review of 
safety of the participants, including confidentiality and any adverse events or side effects related to the study procedures).   
 
22.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Participation in  this research study is voluntary. Participants  and their parents /legal 
guardians  will be notified of the voluntary status of the research at the onset of the study 
enrollment and content in process. Any participant  or parent who declines to participate 
will not incur any penalty or loss of benefits to which they are already entitled. No 
change to the patient’s medical care will occur as a result of the participation, or 
nonparticipation in the study.  Prior to enrollment , participants and their parents /legal guardians  will have all risks and 
benefits clearly explained to them. After explanation for study and consent, subjects and their parents /legal guardians  will be offered an opportunity to discuss participation in 
private, without a st udy team member present, in order to avoid any potential feelings of 
bias or coercion. They will be given time to ask questions. They may come back to participate at a later date if they would like to take the study materials home for review prior to agreeing to participate in this study.  
 For subjects that enroll in the study, they will be informed that they may withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits. Any new information gathered during the course of the study that may impact the subject desire to continue in the study, will be revealed 
as soon as it becomes available.  
 
SHORT TITLE: HCT COIN2DOSE   IRB #STUDY00001086  
 
 Page 23 of 34  Version 5.08 dated 12.26.2023  All the study information will be kept confidential. Data collected as part of routine 
diabetes care is  protected by CMH’s Cerner Electronic Health Record (EHR) and 
associated polici es from the Health Information Management Department (HIM). Data 
collected specifically for this study will be stored securely as described above.  
Participation in this study will be recorded into the EHR in accordance for CMH policy. Any of the research data collected, with the exception of personal health information 
(PHI), maybe shared in aggregate form in presentations and publications. At the 
termination of the study, the enrollment, prescreening, and master logs will be destroyed.  
During the course of the study, the PHI (with the exception of name and MRN) that is collected on individuals who do not wish to participate will be deleted from the 
prescreening log. The name and MRN will be kept until enrollment is complete  so that 
individuals not interes ted in participating will not be re -approached for recruitment, and 
so that MIT can prepare a deidentified, aggregate report of demographic data on 
individuals who declined participation in the study.   Any PHI in the data collection files will be removed and/or converted to a deidentified number upon completion of the study. 
 
Name, initials, dates of service, date of birth, medical record number, hospital 
account number, street address, telephone number, and email address may be 
accessed and/or recorded fo r research purposes.  
HIPAA Authorization for research collection of PHI will be obtained with the 
permission assent/consent forms.   
Focus group participants will be instructed to not include any identifying 
information in their responses  and to use a  pseu donym . They will also be 
instructed not to talk about the discussion outside of the virtual focus group, 
particularly not to reveal the participation of any other participant that they might 
know or recognize. They the meeting will be recorded and transcri bed directly 
into the Teams folder, accessible only to the research team. Files will be uploaded directly into Dedoose for coding.

25.0 Permission/Assent/ Consent Process  
 
Permission Assent/Consent will be obtained in the CMH Endocrine Clinic , PCRU,  via 
telephone, or using a pproved Children’s Mercy teleconferencing platforms .  
 When obtaining consent via telephone, the study team will follow CMH “IRB Permission/Assent/Consent Policy” .  Permission Assent/Consent will be reviewed 
thoroughly and participants will be given the op portunity to ask questions.  Study 
staff will emphasize the voluntary nature of participating in research when obtaining consent.  CMH Research Policies will be followed.  
 
Assent of children 7 and older will be obtained per CMH policy.  Parental/LAR permis sion will be obtained for all participants  
 Parents or legal guardians who choose to participate in the focus group discussions will also sign an informed consent.  
Consent at 18 years of age, when minor subjects become adults  
 Participants who turn 18 while actively participating in study, will sig n an Adult 
Addendum if they choose to continue participation.  We are requesting a Waiver of Documentation of Consent for continued use of identifiable data for participants whose active participation has ended.  
This protocol, and any subsequent modifications, will be reviewed and approved by 
the Pediatric IRB at The Children’s Mercy Hospital & Clinics.  Qualifying patients will 
be identified by review of daily clinic schedules  by research team personnel.  Only 
study personnel will give details about the study to subjects and families.    The 
study will be explained briefly and subjects/parents /legal guardians  will be asked 
whether they are interested in the study.  All interested subjects and parents /legal 
guardians  will have the study thoroughly explained using the consent (or 
permission/assent form as applicable) including risks and benefits.  They will then be given copies of the consent to review without staff present so that they have time to discuss with each other.  Subjects and parents /legal guardians will also be given 
the opportunity to ask additional questions after they have read the consent.  If 
subjects and parent agree to participate then consent (or permission/assent form as 
applicable) will be signed by all required parties and a copy will be given to them. Alternatively, subjects and parents /legal guardians  will be given the opportunity to 
take consents home for further reading, discussion, and decision making at a later 
date.  No pressure will be placed on any subject or family to enroll.  A ll questions 
will be answered and signatures will be obtained by study staff form the parent 
before study enrollment.

Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (PCRU):  The PCRU, constructed in 2012 and opened 
in January 2013, is located on the ground floor of the Hall Inpatient Tower.  Occupying 
approximately 4,500 ft2, it was designed based on the pr imary goal of creating an ideal 
environment for all types of clinical research investigation.  The unit includes three 
private patient rooms and one larger three -bed room suited ideally for overnight and 
multiple sibling studies.   The layout of all patient  rooms was specifically designed to 
facilitate patient and family comfort throughout the duration of their stay.  The unit 
includes a large playroom, office space for clinical research faculty and staff members, 
an exam room, a small laboratory for process ing, nutrition room, medication room, 
soiled utility room, and significant storage space for both patient care supplies and clinical research documents.   Facilities are available for phlebotomy, urine collection, 
initial specimen processing, and temporary specimen storage prior to delivery to the research laboratory.   The space is in close proximity to other institutional resources 
such as the cafeteria, gift shop, and new 3,000 ft
2 Inter-Faith Chapel.   Recreational 
items such as games, crafts, TV, Nintendo , Playstation, and videos are available to 
entertain children during their stay. In addition, Child Life staff may assist with constructive activities for children.   The unit is located one floor below the Pediatric 
Intensive Care Unit which affords immedi ate proximity to critical care medicine 
services should they be required in emergent situations.  The unit has been constructed 
to meet all applicable FDA/ICH guidelines for an early phase study unit and fully meets 
accreditation standards by The Joint Com mission.  
 
General Computer and Network Infrastructure:  All faculty and staff have desk top 
computers running on Windows7 or Windows10 connected to a Children’s Mercy 
client/server LAN with word processing, spreadsheet, database, electronic mail, presentation, and graphical software. Hospital Information Services professional staff support the network, including security and regular backups.  
 
The Windows -based network is configured with security such that a user logging onto 
the system has a personalized desktop displayed and access to a personal directory on a server that is backed up daily, regardless of which computer in the hospital the user is using. Resources provide full support for electronic data collection, storage, analysis, and exc hange. The network is maintained by the Hospital Information Services 
professional staff.

 Children’s Research Institute:  
   Health Services and Outcomes Research :  
The department of Health Services and  Outcomes Research (HSOR) is committed to  
scientific discovery that enhances the delivery of evidence -based care and optimizes the 
outcomes that patients and parents /legal guardians  value most. Distinct from traditional 
biomedical research that relies solely on biomedical measures of success to de termine 
whether a health intervention is necessary and/or successful , outcomes researchers include 
a broader focus that includes the clinical outcomes that matter most to patients. In addition 
to disease outcomes, HSOR includes a focus on patients’ biopsyc hosocial functioning, 
quality of life, barriers to care and experience with care which are often key to addressing chronic disease, as well as, health disparities . A multi- disciplinary effort, HSOR focuses

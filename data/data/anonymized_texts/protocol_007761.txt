Study Population : 
Pediatric subject s (plus potentially  any pediatric subjec ts younger than 3 years of age in 
the antecedent substudy ) who completed Study  HGT -HIT-094, and meet the eligibility  
criteria may  enroll in this study .
Study Design:
This is an open -label, non -randomized study  for subject s who completed Study  
HGT -HIT-094; all subject s in this study  will be treated with intrathecal idursulfase -IT in 
conjunction with Elaprase therap y. 
Subject s who complete Visit Week 52 assessments of Study  HGT -HIT-094 and who meet 
the eligibility  criteria and for whom informed consent is provided will be enrolled in thi s 
extension study . 
All subject s will receive idursulfase -IT at the same dose and frequency  (10 mg once every  
28 day s) as selected for the HGT -HIT-094 study . Subjec ts who are younger than 3 y ears 
of age will continue to receive an adjusted dose. 
The assessments in this study  are similar to those performed in Study  HGT -HIT-094 and 
will be performed at regular intervals; the frequency of assessments will vary depending 
on the treatment phase of the study  (Initial Treatment Phase or Extended Treatmen t 
Phase) . 
Subjec ts who participated in the control arm (no treatment with idursulfase- IT) in 
Study HGT -HIT-094 will begin this study  in the Initial Treatment Phase . These subjec ts 
will have the IDDD implanted following enrollment in order to begin treatme nt with 
idursulfase -IT. These subject s will, during the Initial Treatment Phase of this study  (ie, the 
first 12 months), undergo treatment and assessments similar to those performed for 
subjec ts who were treated with idursulfase -IT in Study  HGT -HIT-094. Af ter completion 
of the Initial Treatment Phase and if there are no safet y concerns, subject s may  continue 
receiving monthly  idursulfase -IT in the Extended Treatment Phase of this study .
Subjec ts who received treatment in the HGT
-HIT-094 study  will begin this study  in the 
Extended Treatment Phase, which reflects a reduced frequency  of assessments compared 
with the schedule of assessments in Study  HGT -HIT-094. Standardized

idursulfase -IT [HGT 2310] 09 Oct 2018 
neurodevelopmental assessments and health economic and outcomes research assessments 
will be performed every  24 weeks and CSF assessments (other tha n standard chemistry ) 
andclinical laboratory  tests of blood and urine will be performed every  12 weeks. Brain 
MRI  and 12 -lead ECG will be performed every  48 weeks. A pharmacokinetic assessment 
will be performed once during this phase of the study. All subjec ts in the study  will 
undergo EOS procedures approximately  28 day s following their last administration of 
idursulfase -IT.
It is anticipated that the IDDD will be used to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples 
and to deliver all intrathecal (IT) injections of idursulfase -IT. If the IDDD appears to be 
non-functional, or if its use is precluded on a scheduled day  of dosing, site personnel will 
refer to the IDDD Manual(s), which provides details on the investigation and management 
of an y IDDD -related issues. This includes possible partial revision or complete 
replacement of the IDDD as indicated. If the IT space is not accessible via the IDDD, 
study  drug may  be administered and CSF sampled by  lumbar puncture (L P). General 
anesthesia or sedation may  be required for injections of study  drug and some evaluations, 
and can be used at the discretion of the Investigator as indicated in the study  manuals . 
Subjec ts wil l have the IDDD removed when they  discontinue from or complete the study , 
unless the subject is continuing to receive treatment through another mechanism (eg,
extension study , expanded access program).
Study Duration:
Subject s will participate in this ext ension study for a duration of 10years of treatment , 
unless they  discontinue the study or Shire discontinues the study .

Pharmacokinetic Variables:
Determination of idursulfase serum concentration- time profiles and serum 
pharmacokinetic parameters after IT administration. 
Measurement of idursulfase concentration in CSF samples obtained immediately  prior to 
IT administration (and at the EOS Visit) to determine the degree of accumulation of 
monthly  idursulfase -IT administrations in the CSF.
Pharmacodynamic Assessments:
Determination of the concentration of GAG in CSF and urine samples.
Efficacy Assessments:
Neurodevelopmental status will be assessed over time by  measuring cognitive and 
adaptive functions as follows:
•The DAS -IIwill be used to assess all subjec ts of age 2 years, 6 months or older . 
•Any subjec ts who cannot be assessed with the DAS -II due to a deteriorating condition 
or who are younger than 2 y ears, 6 months of age, will be assessed with the BSID -III. 
Spanish- speaking subjec ts will be assessed using the Spanish version of the DAS -II 
Early Years or DAS -II School Age . 
•The VABS -IIwill be used to assess adaptive behavior.
Brain structure volumes will be measured by brain MRI .
SOPH -A-PORT Mini S Device As sessments:
The SOPH -A-PORT Mini S will be evaluated using assessments of device implantation, 
device f unction, device longevit y, and AEs associated with the implant surgery  or device. 
This data will be collected on the subject ’s eCRF from the time of initial implantation.
Safety Assessments:
Safety  will be assessed by  AEs (by type, severity , and relationship to treatment

infusion, I V Elaprase and/or idursulfase -IT), changes in clinical laboratory testing (serum 
chemistry , hematology , urinaly sis), AEs determined from phy sical and neurological 
examination, vital signs, 12- lead ECG recordings, CSF laboratory  parameters 
(chemistries, cell counts), anti -idursulfase antibodies in CSF and serum (including 
determination of antibodies having en zyme neutralizing activity ).
Statistical Methods : 
Statistical analy ses will be performed by  the Biostatistics and Statistical Programming 
Department of Shire or its designee using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary , 
NC, USA) , unless otherwise specified. Anal ysis methods will be detailed in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) . 
Data from studies SHP609 -302 and HGT -HIT-094 will be integrated for efficacy  and 
safet y analyses. Baseline for the subjects previously  treated in HGT -HIT-094 will be the 
same as the baseline defined in HGT- HIT-094. Baseline for the previously  untreated 
subjects (ie, No IT treatment) in HGT -HIT-094 will be the closest available assessment 
prior to the initial I DDD implant date, which takes place in Study  SHP609 -
302, unless 
otherwise specified . This could potentially  include EOS visit data from Study  
HGT -HIT-094. The analy ses presented here will include the data measured at and after 
baseline . 
Safety  data descriptive summaries will be presented for the Earl y IT group, Delay ed IT 
group , and overall. The Early  IT group and Delay ed IT group designations are based on 
the treatment regimen (idursulfase- IT or No IT treatment) in the antecedent study
(HGT -HIT
-094
).The Early  IT group is defined as subjects who were randomized to the
idursulfase -IT treatment cohort in study  HGT -HIT-094 and continued IT treatment in 
study  SHP609-302. 
The Delay ed IT group is defined as subjects who were randomized to 
the control cohort (No IT treatment) in study  HGT -HIT-094 and began IT treatment in 
study SHP609-
302. Subjects who participated in the HGT -HIT-094 s ubstudy  will be 
included in the Early IT group.
Efficacy  data descriptive summaries will be presented separatel y for subjects who 
enrolled from the pivotal study  or substudy  of HGT HIT 094. For subjects enrolled from 
the pivotal study , descriptive statistics will be presented b y the Early IT group, the 
Delay ed IT group and overall. For secondary  efficacy  endpoints, the mean difference in 
the change at each time point between the 2 treatment groups (Early  IT group and 
Delay ed IT group) and the corresponding 90% confidence interval of the mean difference 
will be presented where appropriate. The mean values (±SD) for all efficacy endpoints 
will be graphed over time where appropriate.
Inferential testing is planned for some exploratory efficacy  
endpoints. The  main 
exploratory  efficacy  analy sis to examine the IT treatment effect will be 
rate of change 
(weighted) analyses of the exploratory  efficacy  endpoints from Visit Month 13/ baseline in 
study  SHP609 -302 to Visit Month 25/ Week 52 as estimated by  linear regression for DAS -
II Earl y Years GCA scores and selected neurodevelopment assessment scores .
Summary  statistics for continuous variables will include the n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, mini mum and maximum . Categorical variables will be summarized in a 
contingency  table b y the frequency  and percentag e of subjec ts in each category .

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter S yndrome)
Mucopoly saccharidosis II (MPS II) is a rare, X -linked, inherited disease that affects males nearly  
exclusively . Its estimated incidence is 1 in approximately  162,000 live births.1, 2Though 
typicall y appearing normal at birth, all MPS II patients suffer from a progressive, serious, life 
limiting disease.3, 4
The disease is caused b y the absence of, or deficiency  in, the activity  of the ly sosomal enzy me, 
iduronate -2-sulfatase which acts to cleave O-linked sulfate moieties from the gl ycosaminogl ycan 
(GAG) molecules dermatan sulfate (DS) and heparan sulfate (HS).4Insufficient activity  of 
iduronate -
2-sulfatase leads to progressive accumulation of GAG in nearly  all organs and body  
tissues . 
The central underl ying pathophy siological process leading to the clinical manifestations of 
MPS II is the chronic accumulation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate inside cellular 
lysosomes, resulting in cellular engorgement, organomegal y, tissue destruction, and organ 
system dy sfunction . Accumulation of GAG affects near ly all cell ty pes, tissues, and organs of the 
body  including the respiratory  tract, heart, liver, spleen, leptomeninges, bones, joints, 
orophary nx, head, neck, and central nervous s ystem (CNS).5Clinical manifestations include 
severe airway  obstruction, skeletal deformities, cardiomy opathy  and, in most patients, 
neurological decline.6Death may  occur in the first or second decade of life . Patients with 
attenuated disease may  survive into adulthood, with airway  obstruction and cardiac causes often 
contributing to death.4
Phenoty pic expression of the disease spans a wide spectrum of clinical severity . However, two 
extremes at either end of the continuum of MPS II have been identif ied based on cognitive 
status.4, 7The first is broadly characterized as an “attenuated” or milder form in which 
intellectual and neurodevelopment faculties are largel y intact, although somatic pathology is 
present . The term “se vere” has been adopted to describe a second broad phenoty pe of MPS II 
patients who suffer from neurodevelopmental impairment in addition to somatic manifestations 
of the disease . It has been estimated that approximately  three -quarters of MPS II patients wi ll 
develop CNS involvement and be characterized as “severe.”7Despite these characterizations, 
patients with predominantly  somatic involvement may  nevertheless have a life -limiting disease 
course . 
Although there is heterogeneit y with respect to disease progression, the onset of signs and 
symptoms ty pically  occurs at about 2 to 4 y ears of age.5-8An earlier appearance of clinical 
symptoms generally , but not alway s, predicts a more severe clinical course .4, 5, 9, 10Knowledge of 
the genoty pe is of limited value in predicting a patient’s clinical course with respect to CNS 
involvement . An exception is represented by children with complete absence of functional 
enzy me due to deletion/rearrangement of the iduronate -2-sulfatase (I DS) gene, who manifest 
severe neurodevelopmental impairment.11, 12

1.2 Unmet Medical Need
The currently  approved therapy  for Hunter s yndrome is Elaprase®(idursulfase), recombinant 
human iduronate -2-sulfatase for intravenous (IV) administration . Elaprase has provided clinical 
benefit with respect to somatic pathologies in patients with Hunter syndrome, and has a well 
characterized safet y profile . Although man y of the phy sical s ymptoms of the disease can be 
reduced or eradicated b y IV enzy me replacement,13-15Elaprase has not been evaluated 
specificall y regarding its i ndependent quantifiable impact on CNS pathology, due to the 
acknowledged impermeability  of the blood brain barrier to macromolecules such as idursulfase . 
In addition, Elaprase is formulated for IV use only and it is not intended for direct injection into 
the CNS . Thus, no approved therap y exists for the CNS pathologies of Hunter sy ndrome . 
Because intravenousl y administered idursulfase is unlikely to traverse the blood- brain barrier due 
to its impermeability  to large macromolecules such as proteins, there is an unmet medica l need in 
the population of MPS II patients with CNS disease to support clinical development of 
idursulfase -IT for intrathecal use . 
A distinct formulation, designated idursulfase -IT (HGT -2310), was developed specifically  for 
delivery  into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via intrathecal (IT) administration to access CNS 
tissues . The active ingredient of the idursulfase -IT product [recombinant human 
iduronate -2-sulfatase] is the same active ingredient as in commerciall y available Elaprase . In 
contrast to Elaprase, however, idursulfase- IT is speciall y formulated for, and compatible with, 
direct introduction into the CSF since it is isotonic and contains excipients suitable for IT use.
1.3 Overview of Results of Phase I/II Studies 
The safet y and tol erability of ascending doses (1, 10, or 30 mg) of intrathecally  administered 
idursulfase -IT were investigated in the first- in-human study  HGT -HIT-045, a randomized, 
open -label, no- treatment controlled Phase I/II study  in which idursulfase -IT was administer ed 
once monthly  to pediatric MPS II subject s via a surgically  implanted IDDD (PORT-A-CATH®II 
Low Profile™ Intrathecal I mplantable Access Sy stem [PORT -A-CATH]) for 6 months in 
conjunction with once weekl y IV infusion of Elaprase . Elig ible subject s who comp leted 
HGT -HIT-045 are receiving monthly  IT injections of idursulfase -IT, in conjunction with 
Elaprase therap y, in extension study  HGT -HIT-046. Across the HGT -HIT-045 and 
HGT -HIT-046 studies, long -term safety , pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacody namics (PD) 
(effect on GAG concentration in CSF) have been evaluated. Effects of IT administration of 
idursulfase -IT on neurodevelopmental health have been evaluated using standardized tests of 
cognitive and adaptive functions.
Based on the data available from HG T-HIT-045 and HGT -HIT-046, idursulfase -IT has been 
found to be well tolerated at all doses administered without safety  concerns related to the 
investigational product
. There have been no deaths or discontinuations due to adverse events in 
either study , and no serious adverse events related to idursulfase -IT. The majority  of serious 
adverse events in both studies have been associated with the PORT -A-CATH device, and 
designated as serious because of the requirement for overnight hospitalization for surgical 
revision/removal of the IDDD . The events related to the use of the IDDD included surgical 
removal and replacement of the device because of mechanical failures, primarily  connector pin

breaks and catheter slippage, to overnight admissions to the clinical sit e for a suspected device 
infection, and device removal because of wound issues. 
As a result of the device -related concerns in the Phase I/II program, additional guidelines and 
training materials were developed for implanting neurosurgeons concerning the s urgical 
implantation of the IDDD, and repeated lumbar punctures were permitted per protocol 
amendment as a means of IT delivery  of investigational product in the event of device 
malfunction . To address the frequent occurrence of device failures observed wi th use of the 
PORT -A-CATH IDDD in the Phase I/II studies, the SOPH -A-PORT Mini S is being used in the 
antecedent Phase II/ III study (HGT -HIT-094). The SOPH -A-PORT Mini S device is intended to 
address the frequent occurrence of device failures observed with use of the PORT -A-CATH 
IDDD in the Phase I/II studies.
Intrathecal administration of idursulfase -IT to MPS II subjec ts in studies 
HGT -HIT-045 and 
HGT -HIT-046 at the 10 and 30 mg dose regimens resulted in a pronounced pharmacod ynamic 
reduction from baselin e in the concentration of GAG in CSF; the 1 mg dose regimen induced a 
slower and less pronounced reduction in GAG concentration in CSF . Available results of 
neurodevelopmental assessments performed across HGT -HIT-045 and HGT -HIT-046 suggest 
the potential o f intrathecal delivery  of idursulfase -IT to halt or slow the progressive decline in 
neurodevelopmental status in this patient population. Several subjec ts at earlier stages of 
cognitive decline who received treatment with idursulfase -IT at the 10 mg and 30 mg doses 
showed evidence of stabilization or slowing of cognitive decline .
1.3.1 Rationale for Current Phase II/III Study
The current study  is an extension study  to the pivotal Phase II/III study , HGT -HIT-094. Study  
HGT -HIT-
094is a controlled, randomized, two- arm, open -label, assessor -blinded, multicenter 
study  to determine the effect on clinical parameters of neurodevelopmental status of monthly  IT 
administration of idursulfase -IT for 12 months in pediatric subjec ts with Hunter sy ndrome and 
early cognitive impairment who have previously  received and tolerated a minimum of 4 months 
of therap y with Elaprase . Subjec ts are randomized to idursulfase- IT treatment or no 
idursulfase -IT treatment . All subjec ts continue to receive Elaprase therap y.
The therapeutic strate gy in the ongoing, antecedent study (HGT -HIT-094) and this extension 
study , consisting of idursulfase -IT administered intrathecall y while the subject continues to 
receive Elaprase as standard of care, is intended to address both the CNS and somatic 
manifes tations of Hunter sy ndrome . Idursulfase -IT is intended for long -term treatment of Hunter 
syndrome in subjec ts with cognitive impairment to slow progression of cognitive and functional 
impairment. 
This study  serves to extend the treatment, as well as safet y and efficacy monitoring, for subjec ts 
who completed study HGT -HIT
-094, which is designed to include the 42 pediatric subject s 
randomized to receive idursulfase -IT monthly , or no IT treatment, plus potentially  a number of 
pediatric subjec ts younger than 3 years o ld in the open -label, single -armsubstudy also included 
in HGT -HIT-
094. Subjec ts in the substudy  follow a similar schedule of study  visits as subjec ts in 
the main st udy receiving idursulfase -IT.

The design of the antecedent study  (HGT -HIT-094), inc luding the neurodevelopmental 
assessment tools and endpoints, and the selection of idursulfase -IT 10 mg dose, were informed 
by the results of Phase I/II studies HGT- HIT-045 and HGT -HIT-046. Similar assessment tools 
and endpoints are employed in this study .
It is planned that the SOPH-A- PORT Mini S delivery  device will be used for IT administ ration 
of idursulfase -IT to MPS II subjec ts in this study . In contrast to IT administration via lumbar 
puncture (LP), the use of an IDDD does not always require full ane sthesia; in many  cases, 
sedation or local topical anesthetic may be appropriate . Multiple drug administrations, therefore, 
may require onl y a single episode of general anesthesia (for device implantation), in contrast to 
the multiple episodes of general an esthesia that would be required for repeated lumbar punctures 
in this subjec t population . 
Nonclinical experience with I T administration of idursulfase -IT has demonstrated wide 
distribution of idursulfase to the CNS tissues . Idursulfase -IT has been shown t o be well tolerated 
in several species and to be active in a murine disease model of idursulfase deficiency. 
In Pha se I/II clinical studies in MPS 
II subjec ts, idursulfase -IT has been generall y well tolerated . 
Stabilization or improvement in cognitive and adaptive functions has been noted in some of the 
children enrolled in the trials . The available data support the sponsor ’s hypothesis that a 
therapeutic benefit may  be expected in MPS II children with cognitive impairment.

concerning the safet y and clinical development of idursulfase- IT and for information concerning 
the SOPH -A-PORT Mini S delivery  device.

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overal l Study Design and Plan
This is an open -label, non -randomized study  for subjec ts who completed Study  HGT -HIT-094; 
all subjec ts in this study  will be treated with intrathecal idursulfase -IT in conj unction with 
Elaprase therap y. 
Subject s who complete Visit Week 52 assessments of Study  HGT -HIT-094 and who meet the 
eligibility  criteria and for whom informed consent is provided will be enrolled in this extension 
study . Subjec ts planning to continue in this extension study  will have written informed consent 
provided prior to completing the HGT -HIT-094 EOS assessments . The Visit Week -52 
HGT -HIT-094 assessments must b e completed prior to the first idursulfase -IT injection in this 
study .
Prior to conducting an y study -related procedures, written informed consent (signed and dated) 
must be obtained from the subject ’s parent(s) or legall y authorized guardian(s) (and 
consent/assent from the subjec t, if applicable). The nature, scope, and possible consequences, 
including risks and benefits, of the study  will be expla ined by  the investigator or designee in 
accordance with the guidelines described in Section 11.4. Documentation and filing of informed 
consent documents should be completed according to Section 11.4.
During Stud y SHP609 -302, subjec ts who exceed the age of enrollment eligibility  for Study  
HGT -HIT-094 and/or have reached the applicable legal age of consent to participate in a clinical 
study  will be allowed to continue participation in Study  SHP609- 302 until the end of the study .
The HGT- HIT-094 EOS visit is i ntended to be the same as the first visit for subject s enrolled in 
this study . Subjec ts enrolling in this study  are not required to participate in the s afety follow -up 
visit of HGT- HIT-
094. For subjec ts who were treated with idursulfase -IT in Study  
HGT -HIT
-094, the visit weeks in this study  are numbered continuousl y with visit weeks in Study  
HGT -HIT-094. 
All subjec ts will receive idursulfase -IT at the same dose and frequency (
10mg once every  
28days)as selected for the HGT -HIT-094 study . Subjec ts who are younger than 3 y ears of age 
will continue to receive an adjusted dose as specified in Section 6.3. As in Study  HGT -HIT-
094, 
subjec ts will undergo pre -treatment and safet y assessments on Day  1 and will receive an IT 
injection of idursulfase -IT onDay 2 of each IT Dosing Week, followed b y a safet y follow -up 
visit. From Week 28 onward, pre -treatment assessments may be performed on the same day  as 
IT administration of idursulfase
-IT, if the subjec t can arrive at the study  site earl y in the day  and 
ifthe investigator deems this clinically  appropriate. In addition (from Week 28 onward), and in 
the absence of an y safety concerns, subjec ts may  complete the safet y follow -up visit on the same 
day as IT administration prior to discharge.
The assessments in this study  are similar to those performed in Study  HGT -HIT
-094 and will be 
performed at regular intervals; the frequency  of assessments will vary  depending on the 
treatment phase of the study as described in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 for the Initial Treatme nt

Phase and Extended Treatment Phase, respectivel y.All subjec ts in the study will undergo EOS 
procedures approximately  28 day s following their last administration of idursulfase -IT.
4.1.1 Initial Treatment Phase –Only Subject s Not Treated with Idursulfase -IT in 
Study HGT -HIT-094
Subjec ts who participated in the control arm (no treatment with idursulfase- IT) in Study  
HGT -HIT-094 will begin this study  in the Initial Treatment Phase . These subjec ts will have the 
IDDD implanted following enrollment in order to begin treatment with idursulfase -IT. These 
subjec ts will, during the Initial Treatment Phase of this study  (ie, the first 12 months), undergo 
treatment and assessments similar to those performed for subjec ts who were treated in Study  
HGT -HIT-094. After comple tion of the I nitial Treatment Phase and if there are no safet y 
concerns, subject s may  contin ue receiving monthly idursulfase -IT in the Extended Treatment 
Phase of this study (Section 4.1.2).
The Schedule of Events for the Initial Treatment Phase is provide d in Appendix 1 . 
4.1.2 Extended Treatment Phase –All Subjec ts
Subjec ts who received treatment with idursulfase -IT in the HGT -HIT-094 study  will begin this 
study  in the Extended Treatment Phase, which reflects a reduced frequency of assessments 
compared with theschedule of assessments in Study  HGT -HIT-094. Standardized 
neurodevelopmental assessments and health economic and outcomes research assessments will 
be performed every  24 weeks and CSF assessments (other than standard chemistry ) and clinical 
laboratory tests of blood and urine will be performed every  12 weeks. Brain MRI  and 12 -lead 
ECG will be performed every  48 weeks . A PK 
assessment will be performed once during this 
phase of the stud y.
The Study  
Schedule of Events for the Extended Treatment Phase is provided in Appendix 2 , 
Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , Appendix 5 ,Appendix 6 , 
Appendix 7 , Appendix 8
, Appendix 9, 
Appendix 10
, Appendix 11, and Appendix 12.
4.1.3 Treatment Schedule
When a subjec t has re ceived and tolerated a total of 12 monthly  doses of idursulfase- IT across 
studies HGT -HIT-094 and SHP609 -302, the sponsor and 
principal investigator will consider the 
feasibility  of transitioning the subjec t’s monthly  IT dosing to local sites to reduce the burden 
imposed by  monthly  travel. The local sites will be selected and approved by  the Sponsor, and the 
subject must have no safety  or medical issues that would preclude transitioning to a local site 
(Note : the main site may  serve as a local site as neede d; and in this case, the main site will follow 
the assessment schedule for a local site). Exceptions include study  visits at which PK , MRI ,and
neurodevelopmental assessments are scheduled; these will take place at the main site. Subjec ts 
must provide a separate written informed consent/assent to participate in study  procedures to be 
conducted at the local site prior to the conduct of any  procedures.
Subject s will receive their monthly  doses of intrathecal idursulfase- IT at the main study  site or at 
a loc al site. All subjec ts will receive their weekl y IV infusions of Elaprase throughout the study . 
Elaprase infusions may  be administered at the main study  site, at a local site, or at a site

determined b y the subjec t’s phy sician or atthe subjec t’s home depending upon the standard 
location as determined for each subjec t (at the discretion of local laws and the treating 
physician) .
4.2 Intrathecal Drug Delivery
It is anticipated that the IDDD will be used to collect CSF samples and to deliver IT injections of 
idurs ulfase -IT and preservative -free saline flushes. No other medication will be administered 
through the device . If the IDDD appears to be non -
functional, or if its use is precluded on a 
scheduled day  of dosing, site personnel will refer to the IDDD Manual, wh ich provides details on 
the investigation and management of an y IDDD -related issues. This includes possible partial 
revision or complete replacement of the IDDD as indicated. If the IT space is not accessible via 
the IDDD, investigational product may be ad ministered by  LP. Should the IDDD become 
clogged, undergo mechanical complications or otherwise not be accessible, the CSF sample may  
also be obtained b y LP.
If there are medical contra -indications to the re-implantation of a new device, or if the subjec tso 
desires, repeat monthly  lumbar punctures may be considered as an alternative way  of delivering 
the study  drug and obtaining CSF samples under limited circumstances. If no safet y risks are 
identified by  the investigator, up to 12 consecutive LPsmay be performed across studies 
HGT -HIT-094 and SHP609 -302. Once a subjec t has reached the maximum of 12 consecutive 
lumbar punctures, a new IDDD may  be re -implanted for subsequent dosing, unless, in the 
opinion of the investigator and medical monitor, assessment of risk/benefit favors continued 
dosing via lumbar puncture.
Continued treatment via repeat LPbeyond the stipulated 12 consecutive monthly  doses can be 
considered onl y in individual cases of subjec ts where this treatment is very  well tolerated and the 
investigator has not identified an y safety concerns associated with repeat lumbar puncture and 
repeat sedation/anesthesia.
General anesthesia or sedation may  be required for injections of investigational product and 
some evaluations, and can be used at the d iscretion of the i
nvestigator as indicated in the s tudy 
manuals . It is anticipated that study  procedures such as LPand MRI will have to be performed 
with sedation/anesthesiology  support.
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will oversee both idursulfase -IT and device safet
y. The 
DMC will be notified of all I DDD failures and IDDD -related complications at times defined in 
the DMC charter (Section 11.8).
Subjec ts will have the IDDD removed when they  discontinue from or complete the study  unless 
the 
subjec t is continuing to receive product or treatment through another mechanism (eg, 
extension study , expanded access program).
4.3 Rational e for Study Design and Comparator Group

6 STUDY TREATMENT S
6.1 Description of Treatment s
6.1.1 Investigational Product
The investigational product to be used in this study  is idursulfase -IT for intrathecal use.
The idursulfase -IT drug product is an isotonic, sterile solution intended for IT administration. It 
is formulated as a 10 mg/mL  protein concentration in 154 mM NaCl, pH 6.0, 0.005% 
polysorbate 20. It does not contain an y preservatives and is intended for single use.
The active ingredient of the idursulfase -IT drug product is idursulfase (recombinant human 
iduronate -2-sulfatase) the same active ingredient in the commercia lly available drug Elaprase. 
However, Elaprase and idursulfase -IT are specifically  formulated for the IV and IT 
compartments respectively ; they  cannot be interchanged . 
In contrast to Elaprase, idursulfase -IT is speciall y formulated for, and compatible wit h, direct 
introduction into the I T space, because it is isotonic and contains excipients suitable for IT 
administration. 
6.1.2 Intrathecal Drug Delivery Device 
The drug product will be administered via the SOPH -A-PORT Mini S I mplantable Access Port . 
The SOPH -A-PORT Mini S is a sy stem intended for implantation by  physicians. The 
SOPH -A-PORT Mini S, once implanted, allows healthcare personnel to administer drugs 
indicated for intrathecal delivery  intermittently  over a long period of time . 
The device is CE 
Marked in the European Union (EU) and considered investigational in non- EU countries .
The SOPH -A-PORT Mini S comprise sthe following 7 components:
•One SOPH -A-PORT Mini S Access Port
•One intrathecal port closed- tip catheter
•One guidewire
•Two suture wings
•One 14-gauge Tuoh y needle
•One 22 -gauge non- coring Huber needle
•One Luer lock Connector
Further details are provided in the SOPH-A- PORT Mini S I nstructions for Use.

6.2 Treatments Administered
All subjec ts in this study  will receive idursulfase -IT and standard -of-care therap y with Elaprase 
during the stud y. Elaprase will not be provided by the s ponsor, but rather will be prescribed b y 
the subjec t’s phy sician in accordance with local prescribing information.
Subjec ts who did not receive treatment with idursulfase -IT in the antecedent study  
(HGT -HIT-094) will be scheduled to undergo surgical placement of the SOPH-A- PORT Mini S 
device . At least 14 day s will be allowed for recovery  following the placemen t of the IDDD 
before the administration of the first intrathecal idursulfase -IT dose . During this time, the subjec t 
will receive standard perioperative care . 
The investigational product (idursulfase -IT) will be administered through an IDDD. Refer to 
Secti on 4.2 for further details.
The initial implantation and any revision and/or explantation of the SOPH -A-PORT Mini S will 
be performed b y pediatric or general neurosurgeons or anesthesiologists who have experience in 
port and catheter implant procedures and intrathecal -access procedures and have completed 
training for the SOPH -A-PORT Mini S. Please refer to the Instructions for Use (IFU)for further 
details.
Investigational product administration will be performed in a clinical setting b y appropriatel y 
trained and skilled healthcare providers (nurses or phy
sicians) with knowledge of the subjec t’s 
drug regimen and experienced in accessing vascular or CNS ports or CNS infusion pumps . 
Subjec ts’and subject s’ families will not be directly  using the device to administer drugs and will 
have limited direct interaction with the device as there is minimal care required both during the 
immediate postoperative period as the implant site heals, and at times of drug administration.
The investigational product may  be administered on the same day  (ie, the same calendar day  or 
within a 24- hour period) as the Elaprase IV infusion. However, this can only  occur for subjec ts 
participating in the Extended Treatment Phase who have alread y completed at least 12 months of 
idursulfase -IT treatment in studies HGT- HIT-094 or SHP609- 302. If same -day dosing is elected, 
idursulfase -IT will be administered first and the Elaprase IV infusion will be administered 
second. Please refer to Section 7.7.1 for details.
6.3
Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subjec t
The doses (1 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg) of idursul fase-IT evaluated in the Phase I /IIstudies 
demonstrated equivalent safet y profiles. The clinical PK and PD profiles o f idursulfase -IT in 
subjects with MPS II indicated that the 10 mg dose provides a maximum pharmacologic 
response. The 10 mg dose of idursulfase- IT was therefore selected for the pivotal Phase II /III
study , HGT -HIT-094; the dose w ill remain the same in this extension study .

Subjec ts who are younger than 3 y ears of age will continue to receive an adjusted dose as 
follows based on reference brain weight16:
•>8 months to 30 months of age at dosing, idursulfase- IT 7.5 mg
•>30 months to 3 years of age at dosing, idursulfase -IT 10 mg
All subjec ts will receive idursulfase -IT monthly  (every  28 day s) via a surgically  implanted 
IDDD (SOPH -A-PORT®Mini S, I mplantable Access Port, Spinal, Mini Unattached, with 
Guidewire).
All subjec ts will also receive standard -of-care therap y with Elaprase during the stud y. Elaprase 
will not be provided by  the sponsor, but rather will be prescribed b y the subjec t’s phy sician in 
accordance with local prescribing information.
6.4 Method of Assigning Subjec ts to Treat ment Groups
All subjec ts will receive investigational product (idursulfase -IT).
6.5 Blinding
This is an open -label study  in whic hall subjec ts receive investigational product (idursulfase -IT).
6.6 Concomitant Medications, Therapies, and Medical/Surgical Interventions
Treatment with an y other investigational therapies at an y time during this study is prohibited.
All subjec ts are to receive Elaprase therap y throughout this study. Elaprase will be prescribed by  
the subjec t’s phy sician and will be administere d in accordance with local prescribing 
information . Elaprase will not be provided by  the study  sponsor.
All medications, therapies/interventions administered to and medical/surgical procedures 
performed on subjec ts will be regarded as concomitant and recorded on the subjec t’s eCRF as 
described in Section 7.14. 
6.6.1 Infusion Reactions and Management
Infusions of proteins can be associated with reactions to the infusion that may  or may  not be 
immune mediated (hypersensitivity  reactions) . Thus, potential reactions to the infusion of an 
investigational product, including idursulfase- IT,are unpredictable . 
It is often difficult to clinically  distinguish infusion reactions from hy persensitivity  reactions. 
Symptoms may  include headache, fever, sensory  paresthesias (including feeling of warmth, 
tingling, or pain), rash, pruritus, or autonomic symptoms, such as dry  mouth or gustatory  
abnormalities (including loss of smell and metallic taste). Changes in mental status or level of 
consciousness that are not caused by  pre-medication may  either occur acutely  or develop 
post-injection over time.

SHP609 -302 Protocol Am endment 4
idursulfase -IT [HGT 2310] 09 Oct 2018 
The management of infusion reactions and h ypersensitivity  reactions is similar. The following 
steps may  be taken, at the discretion of the investigator , in the event of a suspected infusion 
related/h ypersensitivity  reaction, and the management of such reactions should be based on the 
severit y of the reaction:
•Treatment with medications such as antihistamines, antipy retics, and/or corticosteroids
•Stopping and resuming treatment
•Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions in 
those cases where s ymptomatic treatment was required .
Infusion- related reactions have been observed in subject s receiving IV ERT wi th Elaprase, with 
symptoms including cutaneous reactions (rash, pruritus, and urticaria), py rexia, headache, 
hypertension, and flushing . Previous experience with Elaprase is fully  described in the Elaprase 
US Package Insert and the EU Summary  of Product Characteristics (SmPC) . Pretreatment with 
antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may  prevent subsequent reactions in those cases where 
symptomatic treatment was required . The safet y information reported from administration of 
Elaprase may  be relevant to manag ement of adverse events in relation to idursulfase- IT.
Successful management of Elaprase infusion- related adverse events included slowing or 
interrupting the infusion at the time of the event or pre -treatment with low -dose corticosteroids 
and/or antihistam ines. Most adverse events of this type were treated with antihistamines such as 
chlorpheniramine (IV administration preferred if available), ox ygen, or mild glucocorticoids 
such as h ydrocortisone and prednisolone . All were monitored closel y until symptoms of the 
reactions had subsided . In clinical trials of Elaprase, an apparent decrease in the overall rates of 
adverse events, and specifically  infusion -related adverse events, was observed over time, 
suggesting that subjec ts may  better tolerate infusions dur ing long -term therapy . 
The ongoing c linical studies with idursulfase- IT have not revealed adverse events of the severit y 
and frequency  consistent with infusion- related reactions sometimes observed with IV Elaprase 
infusion
. As of the date of this protocol
, there have been no significant concerns regarding 
infusion- related immune reactions following I T administration in studies HGT- HIT-045 and 
HGT -HIT-
046. Additionally , safet y assessments in the present stud y will evaluate the effect of 
same -day IV and IT r egime on the incidence and/or severit y of infusion -related adverse 
reactions, even if the subjec t had no prior such reactions on Elaprase alone. 
Note that an y subjec tswith prior experience of infusion- related anaph ylactoid event(s) or 
evidence of consist ent severe adverse events relat ed to treatment with Elaprase were excluded 
from participating in the antecedent study .

7.5 Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram will be performed as part of the study  entry  assessments . This procedure will 
not be necessary  if the subjec t has had an echocardiogram performed within 3 months of study  
entry , the data are available, and deemed satisfactory  for evaluation of anesthesia risk.
7.6 Device -Related Procedures
7.6.1 Intrathecal Drug Delivery Device Implantation and Revision
The IDDD will be surgically  implanted or revised at the clinical site. Procedures for implantation 
and revision are detailed in the device’s IFU. Standard hospital procedures for surgery  will be 
followed; the subjec t will be under general anesthesia for th is procedure.
An additional medical device, the catheter passer, is necessary  for the implantation procedure . 
The catheter passer is a sterile, single use device that will be used in the subcutaneous placement 
of the catheter. The Phoenix Neuro Disposable Catheter Passer, manufactured by  Sophy sa,is CE 
marked in the EU and cleared under K853370 in the US and may  be provided; however, use of 
other catheter passers compatible with the SOPH -A-PORT Mini S is allowed.
Details of the implantation/revision and mal functions/failure will be documented on the subject ’s 
eCRF.
If at the time of a scheduled dosing, due to a device- related issue it is not possible to aspirate 
CSF prior to dose administration, administer a full medication dosage using the standard 
administ ration steps detailed in the device’s IFU, or flush the system following dose 
administration, the I DDD will be declared a device malfunction. If the device malfunction is 
irreversible and cannot be corrected without a partial or full device revision or rem oval, the 
IDDD will be declared a device failure, starting from the date of the initial malfunction.
The IDDD will then be surgically  removed or revised and a new device and/or device 
components will be re -implanted at the earliest possible opportunity , preferabl y at the same time.
7.6.2 X-ray Verification of Intrathecal Drug Delivery Device Placement 
A postoperative X -ray check of the IDDD will be performed following surgery  to verify  proper 
installation and confirmation of I DDD placement at the mid -thoracic le vel. The X -rays may  be 
performed to check placement of the device, as needed, throughout the study, and will be 
performed at the end of the study  (to verify  that the IDDD is in the correct position). At a 
minimum, the date of the X- ray verify ing correct ID DD placement will be documented on the 
subject ’s eCRF. If the device requires revision or replacement during the study , additional X-
rays will be taken to document proper positioning of the device. If an IDDD malfunctions, an X -
ray will be performed to ass ess the potential cause of malfunction. Fluoroscopy  should be used 
during device implantation procedures.

SHP609 -302 Protocol Am endment 4
idursulfase -IT [HGT 2310] 09 Oct 2018 
7.6.3 C erebrospinal Fluid Sampling Procedure
Cerebrospinal flui d will be sampled via the IDDD . If this is not possible, and if CSF sampling is 
necessary , either for adherence to the protocol, or to investigate clinical concerns, an LP may  be 
performed to sample CSF, either with or without administration of drug afterwards.
7.6.4 Device Revision or Removal
If at the time of a scheduled dosing it is not possible to administer a full medication dosage using 
the standard administration steps detailed in the device’s IFU due to a device related issue, the 
IDDD will be declared a device malfunction. If the device malfunction is irreversible and cannot 
be corrected witho ut a device surgical intervention, the IDDD will be declared a device failure, 
starting from the date of the initial malfunction. 
The IDDD will then be surgically  removed or revised and a new device and/or device 
components will be re -implanted at the ear liest possible opportunity , preferabl y at the same time.
Subjec ts will have the IDDD removed when they  discontinue from or complete the study , unless 
the subject is continuing to receive treatment through another mechanism (eg, extension study , 
expanded ac cess progra m, commerciall y available ).
Details of the device removal will be recorded in the subjec t’s CRF.
7.7 Investigational Product Administration
It is planned that idursulfase -IT will be administered every  28 day s by means of the IDDD (or 
LP, refer to Section 4.2). A visual examination of both the port and catheter track will be 
performed before each IT injection . If the IT space is not accessible via the IDDD, stud y drug 
may be administered by  LP.
A 22 -gauge Huber non -coring needle is to be used for acce ss to the implanted port; standard 
hypodermic needles would damage the septum and may  cause leakage. If no needle -free 
connector is present, a stopcock or the Huber needle infusion set’s clamp is to be used to prevent 
CSF backflow and to mitigate the risk of air entering the s ystem. It is possible to use other 
brands of Huber non-coring needles, provided that their specifications are identical to that of the 
Huber needle supplied by  Sophy sa in a SOPH-A- PORT Mini S (22G).
The injection date, injection start/ stop time, planned dose, injection volume, and flush volume 
will be recorded on the subjec t’s eCRF . 
Intrathecal administration of investigational product will be preceded b y CSF sampling for 
laboratory  anal ysis, pharmacody namic anal ysis (GAG concentration ), and anal yses of 
idursulfase enz yme concentration and anti-
idursulfase antibodies. The total volume of 
investigational product and flush administered is targeted towards replenishing the volume of 
CSF withdrawn. Therefore, while the total volume of idurs ulfase -IT administered will be less 
than the total volume of CSF withdrawn, additional saline will be administered to ensure a 
balance between the amount administered and the amount withdrawn.
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 48
SHP609 -302 Protocol Am endment 4
idursulfase -IT [HGT 2310] 09 Oct 2018 
Specificall y, the investigational product will be administered in a volume of 1 mL  (1 mL of a 
10mg/mL  solution) ( Section 6.1.1). The minimal proposed flush volume is 2 mL , so the minimal 
volume administered will be 3 mL . Additional volume of preservative- free saline will be 
administered to add up to a total volume that is equal to that which was withdrawn.
This design was intended to mitigate an y risk of overfilling or underfilling the IT compartment 
as well as the risk of inducing acute intracranial hypertension or brain herniation.
Subjec ts will remain under the observation of study personnel in the hospital setting (eg, may  
include infusion center, post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU )(recovery  suite), observation unit, 
short stay  center) for 4 hours post administration of investigational pro duct for safet y 
assessments . Thereafter, if deemed clinically  stable by  the investigator , subjec ts may  leave the 
hospital setting (with exception of study  visit weeks at which serial blood sampling for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation is planned). 
For the first 6 months of treatment with idursulfase -ITin the Initial Treatment Phase , subjec ts 
must return to the clinic the day  after each IT administration for a safety  follow -up visit . Note 
that, under these circumstances, there is no requirement for an overnight hospital stay ; if a 
decision is made to keep the subjec t overnight for convenience, this hospitalization should not 
initiate a serious adverse event report. For the latter 6 months of treatment with idursulfase -IT in 
the Initial Treatment Phase and onward (ie, from Week 28 onward), and in the absence of an y 
safet y concerns, subject s may  complete the safet y follow -up visit on the same day  as IT 
administration prior to discharge.
7.7.1 Same -Day Investigational Administration with Elaprase Infusion
During the Initial Treatment Phase, on IT Dosing Weeks the IV infusion of Elaprase should be 
scheduled to occur a minimum of 48 hours after IT administration of idursulfase -IT. 
During the Extended Treatment Phase only, the i nvestigator will have the option of 
administering the IV Elaprase infusion and idursulfase- IT on the same day . 
If same -day dosing is 
elected , idursulfase -IT will be administered first and the Elaprase infusion will be administered 
second . Pharmacokinetic a ssessments are to occur at the first study  visit at which same -day 
dosing is elected. At this visit, administration of the Elaprase infusion should start within 
approximately  90 minutes of completion of idursulfase -IT administration.
Note that on the 
occasion of thefirst same -day administration ,theduration of IV Elaprase 
infusion is to be standardized to 3 hours .Thereafter, at subsequent visits on which the Elaprase 
infusion and idursulfase -IT are administered on the same day , the investigator may  use discretion 
in deciding the appropriate Elaprase infusion rate based on past experience with the subjec t, and 
the 
subjec t’s prior response to the same -day regime.
7.8 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood samples will be collected for determination of idursulfa
se serum concentration- time 
profiles and serum pharmacokinetic parameters after IT administration .
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 49
SHP609 -302 Protocol Am endment 4
idursulfase -IT [HGT 2310] 09 Oct 2018 
Idursulfase concentrations will be measured in CSF samples obtained immediatel y prior to IT 
administration (and at the EOS Visit) to determine the degree of accumulation of monthly  
idursulfase -IT administrations in the CSF.
The blood and CSF sampling schedules for pharmacokinetic assessments are provided i n the 
Schedule of Events (Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 , Appendix 3, Appendix 4, Appendix 5, Appendix

During the Extended Treatment P hase, blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments willbe 
collected on the occasion of the first same -day administration of idursulfase -IT and Elaprase . 
This pharmacokinetic sampling need onl y be scheduled once , and may  occur at Month 25 or at 
analternative visit during the Extended Treatment Phase ( see Appendix 13 for PK sampling time 
points associated with same -day administration ).
7.9 Pharmacodynamic/Bioma rker Assessments
7.9.1 C erebrospinal F luid Glycosaminoglycan
Cerebrospinal fluid will be collected for measurement of the concentration of GAG.
7.9.2 C erebrospinal F luid and Serum Albumin

.
7.10.1 Neurodevelopmental Assessment Tools
The study methodology will include standardized neurodevelopmental assessments to 
provide a quantifiable measure of subject neurodevelopmental status.5
Neurodevelopmental status will be assessed over time by measuring cognitive a nd 
adaptive functions as follows
and as summarized in Appendix 23 .
7.10.1.1 Cognition
The Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition (DAS -II),17will be used to assess all subject s of 
age 2 years, 6 months or older , including Spanish -speaking subject s who will be assessed with 
the Spanish version of the DAS -II. The DAS -II comprises 2 overlapping batteries . The Early  
Years battery  is designed for children ages 2 y ears,6 months, through 6 years ,11 months. 
The 
Early Years battery is furth er divided into the L ower Level for children ages 2 years, 6 months 
through 3 years, 5 months and Upper Level for children ages 3 years 6 months through 6 y ears, 
11 months. The School Age Battery  is designed for children ages 7 y ears,0 months through 17 
years,11 months. These batteries are full y co-normed for ages 5 y ears,0 months ,through 8

younger than 2 y ears, 6 mont hs, will be assessed with the BSID -III.18
7.10.1.2 Adaptive Behavior
The Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales, Second Edition (VABS- II)19will be used to assess all 
subjec ts. The VABS -II Expanded Interview For m will be used to measure the personal and 
social skills of subjects serially  over time; these scales are organized within a 3 -domain structure : 
Communication, Daily  Living, and Socialization. In addition, the VABS -II offers a Motor Skills 
Domain and an optional Maladaptive Behavior Index. The VABS -II Expanded Interview Form 
assesses what a subject actually  does, rather than what the subject is able to do.

7.11 Health Economics and Outcomes Research Assessments
7.11.1 Health Status Assessment
The health status of subjec ts will be assessed using the EuroQol-5D- 5L(EQ-5D- 5L) 
questionnaire, a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health status which is applicable
to a wide range of health conditions and treatments.20, 21The EQ-5D- 5Lprovides a descriptive 
profile and index value for health status.
Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, the EQ-5D-5Lprovides a 
descriptive profile and a single index value for health status which can be used in the clinical and 
economic evaluation of health care, as well as in population health survey s.
The EQ-5D- 5Lis designed for self- completion by respondents and is suited for use in clinics and 
in face -to-face interviews. The questionnaire takes only  a few minutes to complete. I nstructions 
to respondents are included in the questionnaire.
7.11.2 Healthcare Resource Utilization and Impact Questionnaires
Two questionnaires assessing healthcare resource utilization and caregiver impact (the HCUQ 
and CIQ) , developed specificall y for subject s with Hu nter syndrome , will be administered. Th ese
measure swill focus on collecting self -reported direct and indirect cost s of care for subjec ts with 
MPS II. 
The health economic and outcome research endpoints evaluate the key  healthcare 
resource utilization and impact variables, such as the number of emergency  room visits, 
caregiver emplo yment status (full time [FT], part time [PT], and not working [NW]), and the 
number of hours of additional paid help needed b y caregivers, over the course of the stud y.
7.11.3 Functional Outcomes for Clinical Understanding Scale
The functional status of subjec ts will be assessed using the HS-FOCUS . The parent version of
HS-FOCUS will be administered.
The HS -FOCUS evaluates functional status in 5 domains (walking/standing, grip/reach, 
school/work, activities, and breathing) using a parent- completed form. The individual items 
within each function domain are scored using th e following response scale:
•0 = With NO difficulty
•1 = With SOME difficulty
•2 = With MUCH difficulty
•3 = UNABLE to do
Higher scores thus correspond to a higher degree of incapacity  and available items are averaged 
within each domain to derive the 5 domain scores. If more than half of the items within a domain 
are missing or marked as “Does not appl y to me ,” the domain score is missing.

7.14 Concomit ant Medications, Therapies, and Medical/Surgical Interventions 
Assessments
All medications, therapies/interventions administered to and medical/surgical procedures 
performed on subject s from the time of informed consent through the follow- up contact are 
regarded as co ncomitant and will be recorded on the subjec t’s eCRF . 
Concomitant therapies such as speech therapy , ergotherap y, music therap y, and physical therap y 
are permitted, and will also be recorded on the subjec t’s eCRF during the study .
Non-permitted (per the exclusion criteria) medications, therapies, or surgical interventions will 
lead to exclusion from the study  or a possible protocol violation depending on when the 
non-permitted event occurs.
7.15 Adverse Events Assessments
7.15.1 Definitions of Adverse Event s and Serious Adverse Events
7.15.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, phy siologic, or 
metabolic function as indicated b y physical signs, sy mptoms, or laboratory  changes occurring in 
any phase of a clinical study , whether or not considered investigational product-related. This 
includes an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition . 
Adverse events include:
•Worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of conditions present at the onset of the 
study
•Intercurrent illnesses
•Drug interactions
•Events related to or possibly  related to concomitant medications
•Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  values (includes shifts from baseline within the 
range of normal that the investigator considers to be clinically  important)
•Clinically  significant abnormalities in phy sical and neurological examination, vital signs, 
ECG
Throughout the stud y, the investigator must record all adverse events on the AE case report form 
(CRF ), regardless of the severit y or rel ationship to investigational product. The investigator
should treat subjec ts with adverse events appropriately  and observe them at suitable intervals 
until the events stabilize or resolve . Adverse events may  be discovered through observation or 
examination of the subjec t, questioning of the subjec t or his parent(s)/legally  authorized 
guardian(s), complaint by the subjec t or his parent(s)/legally authorized guardian(s), or by  
abnormal clinica l laboratory  values or phy sical findings.

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 57
SHP609 -302 Protocol Am endment 4
idursulfase -IT [HGT 2310] 09 Oct 2018 
In addition, adverse events may  also include laboratory  values that become significantl y out of 
range . In the event of an out -of-range value, the laboratory  test should be repeated until it returns 
to normal or can be explained and the subjec t’s safety  is not at risk.
Additional illnesses present at the time when informed consent is given are regarded as 
concomitant illnesses and will be documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF . Illnesses first 
occurring or de tected during the study , and worsening of a concomitant illness during the study , 
are to be regarded as adverse events and must be documented as such in the CRF.
7.15.1.2 Elaprase -related Adverse Event 
All subjec ts will receive concomitant IV therap y with Elaprase throughout their participation in 
this study . Adverse events that are potentiall y related to IV Elaprase infusion will be captured . 
The most commonly  reported adverse events that have been assessed as related to Elaprase in 
subjec ts with Hunter s yndrome a re listed in Section 6.6.1. Note that, during weeks of IT dose 
administration in the I nitial Treatment Phase, the IV infusion of Elaprase should be scheduled to 
occur a minimum of 48 hours after IT dosing in order to help distinguish adverse events related
to IV compared to IT administration. 
7.15.1.3 Elaprase and/or idursulfase -IT-related Adverse Event
During the Extended Treatment Phase, the i nvestigator will have the option of administering the 
IV Elaprase infusion and idursulfase- IT on the same day . With same -day dosing, it may not be 
possible to distinguish idursulfase of IV-administered origin from that of IT-administered origin. 
Therefore, adverse events that are potentiall y related to IV Elaprase infusion and/or 
idursulfase -IT administration will be captured.
7.15.1.4 Intrathecal Drug Delivery Device -related Adverse Events 
Examples of AEs related to use of the IDDD include, but are not limited to, the following : device 
failure, device malfunction, incorrect connection of IDDD components, erosion of the 
portal /catheter through the skin, fibrin sheath formation around the catheter tip, hematoma, 
implant rejection, migration of the portal/catheter, occlusion of the portal/catheter, portal site or 
subcutaneous tract infection. A malfunction of the device (defined in Section 7.15.2.2) should 
not be entered as an adverse event unless it has physiological consequences. I n the event of a 
device failure (defined in Section 7.15.2.3), the device may  need to be replaced or repaired. If 
overnight hospitalization is require d for such a procedure (or the device failure meets an y other 
serious criteria, eg,medically  important), the device failure will be reported as a serious adverse 
event. Details of the cause of the IDDD malfunction or failure will be recorded on the device
malfunction and failure eCRF, and the serious adverse event ( SAE )form (where applicable). A 
list of the most common IDDD AEs is included in Appendix 24.
7.15.1.5 Device Surgical Procedure -related Adverse Events 
Examples of AEs related to device surgical procedur es include, but are not limited to, the 
following : events that occur during or shortl y following IDDD implant/explant, I DDD 
adjustment, full revision, partial revision, IDDD removal, and delay ed re -implantation after 
previous IDDD removal (such as complica tions of anesthesia, excessive bleeding, wound

idursulfase -IT [HGT 2310] 09 Oct 2018 
hematoma), and post -operative complications (such as post -operative infection) . These events 
are related to the surgical procedure itself.
7.15.1.6 Intrathecal Administration Process Adverse Events
Intrathecal administ ration process adverse events may  include those caused by  anesthesia during 
drug administration and other drug administration issues (eg, extravasation during infusion or 
hematoma due to Huber needle), or complications of lumbar puncture.
7.15.1.7 Serious Adverse E vent
AnSAE is any  AEoccurring at any  dose that results in any  of the following outcomes:
•Death
•Is life -threatening
•Requires hospitalization (Note, however, for the purpose of this study , overnight 
hospitalizations post intrathecal administration of idursulfase -IT that are based on practical or 
logistical considerations, rather than safet y will not result in a serious adverse event 
designation [ refer to Section 7.7])
•Requires prolongation of existing hospitalization
•A persistent or significant disabil ity or incapacity  
•A congenital anomal y or birth defect
Important medical events that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may  be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they  may jeopardize the subjec t and may  require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. A life -threatening adverse event is defined 
as an adverse event that placed the subjec t, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of 
death from the adverse event as it occurred (ie, this definition does not include an adverse event 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).
Hospitalization, which is the result of elective or pre viously  scheduled surgery  for pre -existing 
condition that has not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not result in a serious 
adverse event designation. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be clas sified as a serious adverse event; however, complication(s) resulting 
from a hospitalization for an elective or previousl y scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria 
must be reported as serious adverse event(s) . Furthermore, this does not apply  to device failures 
resulting in scheduled surgical revisions, which should be reported as serious adverse events.
7.15.1.8 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safet y or any life -threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associate d with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously  identified in 
nature, severity , or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary  plan or application), or any  other unanticipated serious pro blem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safet y, or welfare of subjec ts (21CFR812.3[s] or other regulatory  
requirements, as applicable).

7.15.2 Device -associated Definitions
7.15.2.1 Device Revision (Partial and Full)
Partial device revision : surgical re vision/replacement of 1 or more component(s) of the device; 
other component(s) of the original device remain implanted and are not affected (eg, port 
revision) .
Full device revision : the device isremoved (explanted) in its entirety  and a completely  new 
device is implanted.
7.15.2.2 Device Malfunction
The device does not perform as intended, based on the description in the device’s IFU, but does 
not require either a partial or full device revision.
7.15.2.3 Device Failure
The device irreversibly  fails to perform as intended and requires either a partial or full device 
revision or removal.
7.15.2.4 Device Adjustment
Device adjustment is s urgery  of the device which does not result in partial or complete revision 
or removal (eg, surgical exploration only  or placement of additional suture s, tissue glue, and/or 
fascial repair ).
7.15.3 Classification of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The severit y of AEs will be assessed b y the investigator based on the definition indicated in
Table 4. The severit y of all AEs and SAEs should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page to a 
severit y of mild, moderate, or severe.
Table 4 Adverse Event Severity
Severity Definition
Mild No limitation of usual activities.
Moderate Some limitation of usual activities.
Severe Inability to carry out usual activities.
7.15.4 Clarification between Serious and Severe
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity  (severit y) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe m yocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may  be of relatively  minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache) . This is not the same as “serious,” which is based 
on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or 
functioning ( refer to Section 7.15.1.7). Seriousness (not severit y) and causality  serve as a guide 
for defining regulatory  reporting obligations.

7.15.5 Relatedness of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Relationship of an AE or SAE to investigational product, IDDD, device surgical procedure, or IT 
administration process will be assessed b y the investigator as follows:
•Relationship to idursulfase -IT
•Relationship to I V Elaprase infusion will be assessed by  the investigator as described in 
Section 7.15.1.2
•Relationship to I V Elaprase infusion and/or idursulfase -IT as described in Section 7.15.1.3
•Relationship to the I DDD (examples of IDDD -related adverse events are listed in 
Section 7.15.1.4)
•Relationship to a device surgical procedure (surgical implantation of the IDDD, partial or full 
device revisi on as described in Section 7.15.1.5)
•Relationship to the I T administration process (examples of IT administration process -related 
adverse events are listed in Section 7.15.1.6)
The relationship to study  treatment will be categorized based on the definitions provided in Table

Table 5 Adverse Event Relatedness
Relationship Definition
Not Related Unrelated to investigational product, device, device surgical 
procedure, or IT administration process.
Possibly Related A clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of investigational product, the presence of 
the device, device surgical procedure, or IT administration process 
but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals.
Probably Related A clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of investigational product, the presence of 
the device, device surgical procedure, or IT administration process
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent disease or other drugs and 
chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable response on de -
challenge . The association of the clinical event or laboratory 
abnormality must also have some biologic plausibility, at least on 
theoretical grounds.
Definitely related The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the investigational product, the presence of the 
device, device surgical procedure, or IT administration process 
follows a known or suspected response pattern to the investigational 
product, is confirmed by improvement upon stopping the 
investigational product (de -challenge), and reappears upon repeated 
exposure (re -challenge) . Note that this is not to be construed as 
requiring re -exposure of the subject to investigational product; 
however, the determination of definitely related can only be used 
when recurrence of event is observed.
7.15.6 Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events
7.15.6.1 Adverse Event Monitoring and Period of Observation
Adverse events will be monitored continuously  throughout the study .
For the purposes of this study , the period of observation extends from the time at which the 
subjec t, the subjec t’s parent(s), or the subjec t’s legall y authorized representativ e gives informed 
consent until the subjec t’s final evaluation of the study . For safet y purposes, the final evaluation 
will be defined as the follow-up (EOS) evaluation performed approximately 28 day s after the last 
dose for subjec ts who complete the study .
If the investigator considers it necessary  to report an AE in a stud y subjec t after the end of the 
safet y observation period, he or she should contact the sponsor to determine how the AE should 
be documented and reported.

The device manufacturer will submit mandatory  medical device reports (MDRs) (ie, 
unanticipated adverse devic e effects ) to the relevant regulatory  agencies consistent with 
applicable regulations and Shire will submit MDRs to the I nvestigational New Drug application 
(IND). Shire will report expedited drug related events (serious, unexpected/unlisted, causally  
related) to the relevant regulatory  agencies consistent with applicable regulations.
It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to ensure that each investigator receives a copy  of an y 
CIOMS I/MDR report that has been submitted to the appropriate regulatory agenci es notify ing 
them of an unexpected drug -related serious adverse event or unanticipated adverse device effect 
(submitted by  the s ponsor or manufacturer, respectively ). The investigator must ensure that the 
IRB/IEC receives a cop y of the report and that a co py is also filed within their study  files.
7.16 Pregnancy
Not applicable .
7.17 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose , and Medication Error
Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product at a dose higher than 
prescribed per protocol (but below the dose defined for overdose) or when used for non -medical 
purpose (eg, altering one’s state of consciousness).
Misuse –Intentional or unintentional use of investigational product other than as directed or 
indicated at an y dose, which is at or below the dose defined for overdose (Note : This includes a 
situation where the investigational product is not used as directed at the dos e prescribed b y the 
protocol).
Overdose –Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of investigational product higher than 
the protocol -mandated dose . No clinical information on overdose is available. Idursulfase -IT has 
been well tolerated at the highe st once monthly  dose (30 mg) administered intrathecall y to 
pediatric subject s in clinical trials.
Medication Error –A mistake made in prescribing, dispensing, administration and/or use of the 
investigational product.
The investigator must report abuse, mi suse, overdose, and medication error to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet y Department AND to the Shire medical monitor on the SAE form . This form must be 
completed and FAXED or EMAILED within 24 hours of the investigator ’s learning of the event 
(refer to the con tact information for reporting of SAEs provided in Section 7.15.6.2).
7.18 Removal of Subjec ts from the Trial or Investigational Product
A subjec t’s participation in the study  may  be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator . 
The following may  be justifiable reasons for the investigator to remove a subjec t from the study :
•The subjec t exhibits non -compliance with the study  protocol that is considered disruptive to 
study  conduct.
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 64
SHP609 -302 Protocol Am endment 4
idursulfase -IT [HGT 2310] 09 Oct 2018 
•The subjec t was erroneously  included in the study .
•The subjec t develops an exclusion criterion.
•The subjec t suffers an intolerable adverse event.
•The study is terminated by  the sponsor.
The subjec t or the subjec t’s parent(s) or legall y authorized guardian(s) acting on behalf of the 
subjec t is free to wit hdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study  at any  time without 
prejudice to further treatment.
If the subjec t or the subject ’s parent(s) or legally  authorized guardian(s) acting on behalf of the 
subjec t discontinues participation in the study , or the subjec t is discontinued by  the investigator ,
reasonable efforts will be made to follow the subjec t through the end of study  assessments . The 
reason for refusal will be documented on the CRF. Any  adverse events experienced up to the 
point of discontinuation must be documented on the AE CRF. If adverse events are present when 
the subjec t withdraws from the study , the subject will be re -evaluated within approximately  
30days of withdrawal . All ongoing serious adverse events at the time of withdrawal will be 
followed until resolution.
7.19 Other Study Procedures
7.19.1 Safety -related Study Stopping Rules
This study  will be stopped and the safety  data reviewed if any subjec t experiences a 
life-threatening serious adverse event or a death occurs, if either is consid ered possibly , 
probably , or definitely related to the study  treatment (investigational product, the IDDD, device 
surgical procedure, or the I T administration process) . After review of the safety data, the status 
of the study  will be one of the following:
•Resumed unchanged
•Resumed with modifications to the protocol 
•Terminated
Subjec t safet y in this study will be monitored b y an independent DMC until the last subject
completes his last scheduled study  visit/assessment . The DMC will be an external group 
overseeing the safet y of the study treatment, including both the investigational product and the 
IDDD, and will operate according to a charter determining the scope of its activit ies and 
frequency  of meetings ( refer to Section 11.8 for additional details).
7.20 Appropriateness of Measurements
The measures of safety to be used in the study are appropriate for a long -term follow -up 
interventional study  in MPS II subjec ts. These include , but are not limited to, monitoring of 
adverse events and medication use, both stan dard parameters for the assessment of safet y
.
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints have been included for the purposes of providing additional data to 
support a long -term evaluation of efficacy  in follow -up to the antecedent study .

Cognitive impairment is a key  symptom of MPS II; however, clinical research in this area has 
been broadl y lacking, instead focusing on the biological and ph ysical aspects of the disease, and 
remains an unmet medical need . This highlights the need for a treatment that targets the 
cognit ive involvement of MPS II, and an endpoint strategy  that specifically targets the cognitive 
and behavioral sy mptoms associated with MPS II . The neurodevelopment measures planned for 
this study  will continue to assess cognitive and adaptive functions in chi ldren with MPS II . These 
assessment tools (DAS -II [BSID-III]and VABS -II) will provide a quantifiable measure of CNS 
neurodevelopment status and are appropriate for use in the target population.
The DAS -II has been found to be valid and reliable. Evidence from published studies and 
previous Shire clinical trials demonstrates that the DAS- II is able to detect both changes in a 
child’s ability  and stabilization of functioning over time following treatment . For the DAS -II, 
Spanish- speaking subjec ts will be assessed using the Spanish version of the DAS II-Early Years 
and the DAS -II School Year . The BSID -III will be used to assess subjec ts who cannot be 
assessed with the DAS -II. 
As in the antecedent study, an y subjec ts who cannot be assessed with the DAS -II due to a 
deteriorating condition or who are too young ( younger than 2 years, 6 months of age) will be 
assessed with the BSID -III. The BSID -III measure s the mental and motor development and test 
the behavior of infants from 1 to 42 months of age and has been us ed extensively  worldwide . 
The BSID -III consists of a core battery  of scales and is suitable for use in children from 1 to 
42months of age. Three scales (Motor [Fine, Gross], Language [Receptive, Expressive], and 
Cognitive) are administered with child interaction. The first item set of the 3 main subtests of the 
DAS -II (Verbal comprehension, Naming Vocabulary and Pattern Construction) will be 
administered initially . If the 
subjec t cannot complete these, the BSID -III will be used to assess 
cognition. The BSI D-III scale is recommended for low -functioning and nonverbal or preverbal 
children, and as such, is used primarily  during the study  to assess the neurodevelopmental status 
of subjec ts who are unable to complete the DAS -II.
The rating of the child by the pa rent format of the VABS -II via the Expanded Interview Form is 
consistent with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) 
Guidance, which states that caregiver reports must be based on observable behaviors onl y. 
The concepts meas ured by  the DAS -
II were mapped onto an MPS II conceptual model. 
The 
concept mapping exercise indicated adequate concept coverage across the three assessment tools, 
collectively . Following feedback from experts in the field of neurodevelopmental functioning, 
the concept mapping exercise was repeated for the VABS- II. The VABS -II was found to have 
strong concept coverage when combined with the DAS -II. Based on this evidence, the DAS -II 
(
orBSID-III) and VABS -II will be utilized as the primary  and secondary  assessment tools for 
efficacy .

As described in Section 4.1.3, w hen a subjec t has received and tolerated a total of 12 monthly  
doses of intrathecal idursulfase -ITacross studies HGT- HIT-094 and SHP609 -302, the sponsor 
and p
rincipal investigator will consider the feasibility  of transitioning the subjec t’s monthly  IT 
dosing to local sites to reduce the burden imposed by  monthly  travel . Exceptions include study  
visits at which PK, MRI , and neurodevelopmental assessments are scheduled; these will take 
place at the main site.
General anesthesia or sedation may be required for injections of investigational product and 
some evaluations, and can be used at the discretion of the investigator as indicated in the study  
manuals. It is anticipated that study  procedures such as lumbar puncture and MRI  will have to be 
performed with sedation/anesthesiol ogy support.

For the first 6 months of treatment with idursulfase-
IT (ie, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24), subjec ts 
must return to the clinic the day  after each IT administration for a safety  follow -up visit . Note 
that, under these circumstances, there is no requirement for an overnight hospital stay ; if a 
decision is made to keep the subjec t overnight for convenience, this hospitalization should not 
initiate a serio us adverse event report. For the latter 6 months of treatment with idursulfase -IT 
(ie, from Week 28 onward) and in the absence of any  safet y concerns, subjec ts may  complete the

10 STATISTICAL AN ALYSES
10.1 General Methodology
Statistical analy ses will be performed by  the Biostatistics and Statistical Programming 
Department of Shire or its designee using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary , NC, 
USA), unless otherwise specified. Analy sis methods will be detailed in the statistical analy sis 
plan (SAP). 
Data from studies SHP609 -302 and HGT -HIT-094 will be integrated for efficacy  and safet y 
analyses. Baseline for the subjects previously  treated in HGT -HIT-094 will be the same as the 
baseline defined in HGT- HIT-094. Baseline for the previousl y untreated subject s (ie, No IT 
treatment) in HGT -HIT-094 will be the closest available assessment prior to the initial I DDD 
implant date, which takes place in Study  SHP609- 302, unless otherwise specified. This could 
potentia lly include EOS visit data from Study  HGT -HIT-094. The analy ses presented here will 
include the data measured at and after baseline . 
Safety  data descriptive summaries will be presented for the Earl y IT group, Delay ed IT group, 
and overall. The Earl y IT group and Delay ed IT group designations are based on the treatment 
regimen (idursulfase -IT or No IT treatment) in the antecedent stud y (HGT -HIT-094). Subjects 
who participated in the HGT -HIT-094 substudy  will be included in the Early  IT group.
Efficacy  data descriptive summaries will be presented separatel y for subjects who enrolled from 
the pivotal study  or substudy  of HGT -HIT
-094. For subjects enrolled from the pivotal study , 
descriptive statistics will be presented b y the Early I T group, the Delay ed IT gro up, and overall. 
For secondary  efficacy  endpoints, the mean difference in the change at each time point between 
the 2 treatment groups (Early  IT group and Delay ed IT group) and the corresponding 90% 
confidence interval of the mean difference will be presen ted where appropriate. The mean values 
(±SD) for all efficacy  endpoints will be graphed over time where appropriate.
Inferential testing is planned for some exploratory efficacy  endpoin ts. The main exploratory  
efficacy  anal yses to examine the IT treatment effect will be rate of change (weighted) analyses of 
the exploratory  efficacy  endpoint sfrom Visit Month 13/ baseline to Visit Month 25/Week 52 as 
estimated by  linear regression for DAS -II Earl y Years GCA scores and selected 
neurodevelopment assessment scores .
Summary  statistics for continuous variables will include the n, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized in a contingency table b y 
the frequency  and percentage of 
subject s in each category .
Effic acy data for subjects enrolled from the HGT- HIT-094 substudy  will be presented in listings.
10.2 Determination of Sample Size
This is an open -label extension trial of Study  HGT -HIT
-094. Only  eligible subject s who 
participated in Study  HGT -HIT-094 may  enroll in SHP609 -302, and therefore no sample size 
calculation was performed.

10.3 Method of Assigning Study Subjects to Treatment Groups
SHP609 -302 is a non- randomized extensi on study  in which all enrolled subjec ts receive 
idursulfase -IT treatment.
10.4 Population Descriptio n and Exposure
10.4.1 Data Integration Strategy
Data from studies SHP609 -302 and HGT -HIT-094 will be integrated for data analyses. 
For safet y and efficacy descriptive summary analyses using integrated data, the 2treatment 
groups are the Early IT group and Delay ed IT group based on HGT -HIT-094 treatment regimen 
(idursulfase -IT or No IT Treatment) , defined as follows:
The Earl y IT group is defined as subjects who were randomized to the idursulfase -IT 
treatment cohort in stud y HGT -HIT-094 and continued IT treatment in study  
SHP609- 302. HGT- HIT-094 substudy  will be included in the Earl y IT group.
The Delay ed IT group is defined as subjects who were randomized to the control cohort 
(No IT treatment) in study HGT -HIT-094 and began IT treatment in study  SHP609 -302. 
Forexploratory  efficacy  anal yses, onl y data collected in study  SHP609- 302 will be used; the
2treatment groups are the Early IT group and Delay ed IT group. 
Visit Month 13 of the SHP609 -302 Extended Treatment Phase corresponds to the scheduled visit 
at which subjects in the Earl y IT group have completed 12 months of IT treatment in antecedent 
study  HGT -HIT
-094. The treatment regimen in HGT -HIT-094 comprised 1 month for surgical 
IDDD implantation at the beginning of the stud y followed b y 12 months of IT treatment during 
HGT -HIT-094.
Likewise, Visit Month 25 of the SHP609- 302 Extended Treatment Phase corresponds to the 
scheduled visit at which subjects in the Ear ly IT group have completed two 12- month periods of 
IT treatment, and comprises 1 month for surgical IDDD implantation at the beginning of HGT-
HIT-094, 12 months of IT treatment during HGT
-HIT-094, and a continued 12 months of I T 
treatment in the Extended Treatment Phase of SHP609-302. 
Visit Week 52 of the SHP609 -302 I nitial Treatment Phase is the scheduled visit at which 
subjects in the Delay ed IT group have completed 12 months of I T treatment in study  
SHP609 -302, and comprises 12 months of No IT treatment during HGT -HIT-094, 1 
month for 
surgical IDDD implantation at the beginning of SHP609-302, and 12 months of IT treatment in 
the Initial Treatment Phase of SHP609 -302. 
It is noted that Visit Month 25 and Visit Week 52 of SHP609- 302 are 4 weeks apart for t he Earl y 
IT and Delay ed IT groups. This difference is accounted for by  the need for subjects in the 
Delay ed IT group, who enrolled into the I nitial Treatment Phase of SHP609 -302 from the 
HGT -HIT-094 No IT treatment group, to undergo surgical implantation o f the device at the 
beginning of stud y SHP609 -302. 
Therefore, the first dose of SHP609 was administered 4 weeks

later to these subjects compared with subjects in the Earl y IT group who were randomized to I T 
treatment and underwent IDDD implantation in HGT -HIT-094 prior to enrolling in the Extended 
Treatment Phase of SHP609- 302. For evaluation of the long -term efficacy  of IT treatment in 
SHP609 -302, this 4 -week difference is considered to have minimal impact on 
neurodevelopmental assessment scores.
10.4.2 Analysis Populations
All descriptive summary  analyses of safet y and efficacy data will be based on the Safet y 
Population, which is defined as all subject s in s tudy SHP609 -302 who underwent IDDD 
implantation or received at least 1 dose of stud y drug (full or partial). 
The following nomenclature will be used to identify  “A”,“B”,“C”,and “D” in Figure 2.
Observation Groups A and C identify  the period of observation during study  
HGT -HIT-094, for subjects randomized to I T treatment and No IT treatment,
respectivel y. 
Observation Groups B and D identify  the period of observation during study SHP609 -302
up to completion of 1 year, for subjects who were randomized in HGT -HIT-094 to 
receive IT treatment and No IT treatment ,respectively , noting that all subjects in 
SHP609 -302 received ITtreatment . 
The subjects in “B” are the same subjects as in “A” with periods of observation from studies 
SHP609 -302 and HGT -HIT-094, respectivel y
, as we can view “B” as a continuation of “A”. The 
subjects in “D” are the sam e subjects as in “C” with periods of observation from studies 
SHP609 -302 and HGT -HIT-094, respectivel y,as we can view “D” as a continuation of “C” .
“D”subjects are therefore similar to 
“A” subjects since these subjects all transitioned from 
receiving weekl y IV infusion of Elaprase , to also receive monthl y IT idursulfase .More 
generall y,because study  SHP609 -302 did not have baseline GCA inclusion criteria, such as that 
employ ed for s tudy HGT -HIT-094, “B ” and “ D” subjects could differ with regard to the ir 
baseline GCA score at the beginning of the observation period. Therefore , for consideration of 
“B” and “ D”, only subjects meeting the key  inclusion criteria to HGT- HIT-094 will be included 
in inferential efficacy  analy ses,ie, with GCA scores between 55 and 85 inclusive at the 
enrollment of SHP609-302.
Theexploratory  efficacy  anal yses will be conducted on “HGT -HIT-094 Comparable Set ,”
“HGT -HIT-094 Comparable Set 1”,and “HGT -HIT
-094 Comparable Set 2”.The primary  
analysis population is HGT -HIT-094 Comparable Subs et 1, which may  be the subjec t population 
with the most potential to benefit from the idursulfase -IT treatment.
HGT -HIT-094 Comparable Set: subjects in the Safet y Population who met the key HGT -
HIT-094 inclusion criteri on
(baseline GCA score s
between 55 and 85 inclusive ) at 
enrollment in SHP609 -302 (Visit Month 13/ baseline) , ie, Safet y Population subjects with 
GCA scores between 55 and 85 inclusive at enrollment in SHP609-302

Device -related anal yses will be conducted in the subset of subject s in the Safety  Population who 
had the device implanted.
All pharmacokinetic data anal yses will be performed using the PK population. The PK 
population will be defined as all subject s who received study  drug and had sufficient serum 
samples collected to derive pharmacokinetic parameters.

protocol deviations will not be summarized; however, if applicable, protocol violations identified 
will be listed for the Safety  Population.
10.4.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic data and baseline characteristics wi ll be sum marized by  the Earl y IT group, the

Medical history  will be coded by  the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
version 16.0 or higher and will be similarly  summarized.
10.4.6 Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will besummarized by  the Earl y IT group, the Delayed IT group ,and 
overall for the Safet y Population . Treatment compliance is defined as : [(Number of Complete IT 
administrations) ÷(Expected Number of IT administrations)] * 100.
10.4.7 Extent of Exposure
The total number of doses of study  drug, the number of doses received via IDDD, the number of 
doses received via LP and the average duration of I T administration will be summarized by  the 
Early IT group, the Delayed IT group ,and overall for the Safet y Population. The duration of IT 
administration is calculated by subtracting the IT administration start time from the IT 
administration end time.

10.5.4 Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup descriptive summary  analyses of the secondary  efficacy  endpoints, change from 
baseline in GCA and ABC scores will be performed for baseline GCA groups (either ≤70 or >70) 
and baseline age groups (either <6 years or ≥6 years; <55 months or ≥55 months). Descriptive 
summaries within these subgroups and plots of mean values (±SD) over time will be presented.
The baseline is defined in Section 10.1.
Subgroup anal yses are planned for the rate of change (weighted) anal yses in GCA scores from 
the Earl y Years battery, GCA scores and ABC scores for GCA classification groups at Visit 
Month 13/ baseline (either ≤70 or >70), age groups at Visit Month 13/ baseline (either <6 years or 
≥6 years), and age groups at Visit Month 13/ baseline (either <55 months or ≥55 months).
10.5.5 Exploratory Analyses
The main exploratory  efficacy  anal yses to examine the IT treatment effect will be rate of change 
(weighted) anal yses of the exploratory efficacy  endpoints from Visit Month 13/ baseline to Visit 
Month 25/Week 52 in study  SHP609- 302 as estimated by  linear regression for the following 
neurodevelopmental assessment scores :
•DAS -II GCA scores from Early  Years battery
•DAS -II Earl y Years core subtests T scores: Verbal Comprehension, Picture Sim ilarities, 
Naming Vocabulary , Pattern Construction, Matrices, and Copy ing
•DAS -II Earl y Years battery standard cluster scores: Verbal, Nonverbal, Spatial, and SNC 
composite scores
•DAS -II GCA scores including both Early Years and School Age batteries
•VABS -IIABC scores
Complete details of the rate of change (weighted) anal ysis, including examination of premises of 
the rate of change (weighted) anal ysis, model diagnostics, and estimation and comparison of the 
treatment effects during observation periods “B” and “D” will be described in the SAP.
The descriptive summary of ordered categorical outcomes will be presented at Month 25/Week 
52 by  the Earl y IT group, the Delay ed IT group ,and overall using the SHP609
-302 data “B” and 
“D”.The definitions of ordered c ategorical outcomes for each subject are described in 
Section 3.3.
For each of the neurodevelopmental assessments, there may  be a “floor effect”, ie, the lower 
limitation of the assessment tool, below which the assessment may  not be reliable or meaningful.
Refer to the SAP for complete details .
Other e xploratory  anal yses may  include assessment of the correlation between PD and efficacy  
endpoints; and between composite scores and their components (ie, correlations between the 
GCA and ABC scores and their res
pective cluster/ domain scores) . Scatter plots may  be presented 
to explore the relationships among variables.

10.5.6 Health Economics and Outcomes Research Endpoint Analyses
The EQ-5D- 5Lmeasures 5 dimensions of health status : mobility , self -care, usual activities , 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression. For each dimension, there are 5 levels of response. The 
number and percent of subjec ts with each response will be presented b y dimension at each visit. 
The visual analog scale (VAS) records the subjec t’s parent/ca regiver -rated health on a 0 (worst 
health) to 100 (best health) scale. The VAS score, as well as the change from baseline will be 
summarized as each time point. 
HCUQ variables include the number of emergency  room visits, caregiver employ ment status 
(full time [FT], part time [PT], and not working [NW]), and the number of hours of additional 
paid help needed b y caregivers, over the course of the study. The CIQ question items measure 
social, emotional, physical,and financial impacts on the caregiver. Descri ptive statistics, 
including n, mean, median, and range (for continuous variables), and n and proportions (for 
categorical variables), for these key  HCUQ and CIQ variables will be presented.
The HS -FOCUS shortened form will be used to assess subjec ts. Domain scores from the 
5functional domains (walking/standing, grip/reach, schooling/work, activities, and breathing) 
will be summarized.
Additional pharmacoeconomic anal yses may  be performed b y the sponsor staff in the Health

10.6 Analysis of Pharmacokine tic and Pharmacodynamic Data
10.6.1 Pharmacokinetic Measurement and Parameters
The PK population will be used to perform the ana lysis of pharmacokinetic data. I dursulfase 
concentrations in all collected serum samples will be measured and reported . Individual subj ect 
idursulfase serum concentration -time profiles will be presented. Individual PK parameters will 
be derived b y a noncompartmental anal ysis and reported. The actual PK blood sample collection 
times will be used to determine the individual subjec t idursulf ase serum concentration -time 
profiles. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated if sufficient idursulfase 
concentration -time points exist to derive values. Individual subjec t CSF idursulfase 
concentrations at each collection time point will be reporte
d.
Pharmacokinetic parameters calculated will include:
•Maximum ob served serum concentration (C max)
•Time of C max(Tmax)
•Area under the serum concentration -time curve from time zero to the last sampling time at 
which serum concentrations were measurable (AUC 0-last)
•Area under the serum concentration -time curve extrapolated to infinity  (AUC 0-∞)
•Apparent terminal rate constant ( λz) derived from the slope of the log -linear regression of the 
log-linear terminal portion of the serum concentration -time curve.

•Termi nal half -life ( t1/2) calculated as 0. 693/ λz
•Mean residence time (MRT 0-∞), calculated as AUMC 0-∞/AUC 0-∞
•Clearance for IT-L administration (CL /F)
•Volume of distribution based on the terminal phase for IT -L administration (V z/F)  
The anal ysis of PK parameter data will be performed by  the Shire Clinical Pharmacology  and 
Pharmacokinetics department or its designee .
10.6.2 Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
The levels of GAG in CSF and urine are PD endpoints. Analy ses of PD endpoints will be 
performed in the Safet y Population. The observed values and changes from baseline in CSF 
GAG levels will be summarized for each asse ssment time by the Earl y IT group, Delay ed IT 
group ,and overall . A graphical plot of mean CSF GAG levels across time will be presented . The 
urine GA G levels will be anal yzed in a manner similar to that described for CSF data.
10.7 Analysis of Safety
All analy ses of safet y data will be descriptive and presented b y the Earl y IT group, Delay ed IT 
group ,and overall . The analy sis of safet y will be based on the Safety  Population.
10.7.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study . Adverse events will be coded using the 
MedDRA dictionary , version 16.0 or higher.
Treatment -emergent AEs, defined as all AEs from the time of initial intervention (fir st surgery  
for IDDD implantation ,including failed surgeries, or first dose if before first IDDD implant ation 
surgery ) to the EOS visit ,will be summarized by  the Earl y IT group, Delayed IT group ,and 
overall . 
The number and percentage of subject s having an AE and the number of events, by  system organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term will be presented . Treatment -emergent AEs will also be 
summarized by  severity  and degree of relationship to study  drug . An adverse event will be 
considered related if indicated to be “possibly ,” “probably ,” or “definitel y” related. In the case of 
multiple occurrences of the same AE (at the preferred term level) in an individual subjec t, the 
AE that is classified as the most severe (ie, maximum severity ) will be identified for the analy sis 
by severit y and the AE that has the closest relationship to study drug/procedure will be identified 
for the analy sis by  relationship . In general, an AE will be considered a treatment -emergent AE if 
it cannot be definitivel y categorized otherwise by documentation that its onset preceded either 
IDDD surgery  or first dose.
Serious adverse events will be similarly  tabulated according to SOC and preferred term and 
presented in a separate listing.

listing of the device failure/malfunction data will be display ed.
The rate of successful IDDD injections will be calculated for each subject and summarized 
descriptivel y. The success rate will be calculated as the number of IDDD injections given as a 
percentage of IDDD injections given plus an y malfunctions reported for inability  to dose. The 
corresponding 90% confidence interval for the mean rate will be est imated, where appropriate. 
Injections that are not administered for subject -related reasons (eg, subject uncooperative, 
competing medical issue, etc.) will not be included in the determination of the injection success 
rate.

10.8 Statistical/Analytical Issues
10.8.1 Adjustment for Covariates
The rate of change (weighted) anal ysis will adjust for GCA classification (either ≤70 or >70) at 
enrollment of SHP609- 302 in the weighted ge neralized linear model .
10.8.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data
In general, no imputation will be performed and analy ses will be based on available data. 
Missing or partial AE dates will not be imputed . However, a conservative approach will be 
adopted in such cases so that the AE will be deemed to be treatment emergent if it cannot be 
definitively  categorized to have occurred prior to surgery  for IDDD implantation. Similar logic 
will be applied to deal with missing and partial date for concomitant medications.
10.8.3 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
Interim anal yses may  be conducted before trial completion for safet y monitoring, regulatory 
reporting or general planning purposes . Anal yses will be descriptive in nature, with no formal 
comparisons planned and no hy potheses tested formally . An independent DMC will be 
established to provide an ongoing, independent review and assessment of subject safet y data 
(refer to Section 
11.8). An anal ysis of the data for DMC review will occur at specific times 
during the stud y as specified in the DMC charter.
10.8.4 Multicenter Studies
It is planned that the data from all centers that participate in this protocol will be combined so 
that an adequate number of subject s will be available for analy sis. Because of the potential for a 
relative ly large number of centers, and small numbers of subject s at some centers, no subset 
analyses by center are planned.
10.8.5 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity
No multiple comparison procedure or multiplicity adjustment will be performed.
10.8.6 Sensitivity Analyses
Given the design and objectives of the stud y, no sensitivity anal yses are planned.

Appendix 25 Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes
Amendment Summary and Rationale 
Amendment 4 (applicable to all countries): 
On 05 Mar 2018, Shire met with members of the FDA Division of Gastroenterology  and Inborn 
Errors Products (DGIEP) . Shire proposed to amend the s tudy SHP609- 302 protocol to include 
statistical testing of efficacy  data to provide a self -contained data set from 12 -24 months 
collected as part of the SHP609- 302 study . The Agency  recommended Shire to submit a formal 
Meeting Request and to submit the draft SHP609 -302 protocol amendment, draft SHP609-302 
SAP and draft ISE SAP as briefing documentation for written FDA feedback. Based on this 
feedback, c linical protocol SHP609- 302 was amended from the previous version to add the 
following:
•Exploratory efficacy  endpoint sto evaluate change from Visit Month 13/ baseline to Visit 
Month 25/Week 52 as estimated by  linear regression for DAS -II Earl y Years GCA and
selected neurodevelopmental assessment scores
•Other exploratory  efficacy  endpoints to evaluate change from Visit Month 13/ baseline to 
Visit Month 25/Week 52 as estimated b y ordered categorical outcomes
•Clarification regarding statistical methods and addition of inferential testing for the 
exploratory  efficacy  endpoints
•Strategy  for data integration
•Language regarding pl anned subgroup anal yses
•Description of lower and upper levels of the Earl y Years battery  for DAS- II
•Extension of the duration of treatment from a maximum of 5 y ears to a maximum of 10 y ears
•Clarification stolanguage regarding operational aspects of the st udy
Detailed Summary of Changes for the Amendment 4:

•DAS -II GCA scores including both Early Yea rs and School Age batteries
•VABS -II ABC scores
Note that the interval from  Visit Month 13/ baseline to Visit Month 25/Week 52 in study SHP609 -302 is 
defined as from  Visit Month 13 to Visit Month 25 in SHP609 -302 Extended Treatment Phase for subjects in 
the Early IT group (defined in Section 10.4.1), and from  baseline in study SHP609 -302 to Visit Week 52 in 
SHP609 -302 Initial Treatm ent Phase for subjects in the Delayed IT group (defined in Section 10.4.1). The 
Early IT group and Delayed IT group designations are based on the treatm ent regimen (idursulfase- IT or No 
IT treatm ent) in the antecedent study (HGT -HIT-094).
•Ordered categorical outcomes for each subject at study SHP609 -302 Visit Month 25/Week 52 are defined 
below. The definition for each response categ ory threshold is based on the standard error of 
measurement (SEM) for the DAS -II. The SEM for the GCA, based on test -retest reliability of the DAS -
II,17is approximately ±5 points. The ordered categorical outcom es will be defined for both DAS -II GCA

New  Text:
Data from  studies SHP609 -302 and HGT -HIT-094 will be integrated for data analyses. 
For safety and efficacy d escriptive summary analyses using integrated data, the 2treatm ent groups are the 
Early IT group and Delayed IT group based on HGT -HIT-094 treatm ent regimen (idursulfase -IT or No IT 
Treatm ent), defined as follows:
The Early IT group is defined as subjects who were random ized to the idursulfase -IT treatm ent 
cohort in study HGT -HIT-094 and continued IT treatment in study SHP609 -302. HGT -HIT-094 
substudy will be included in the Early IT group.
The Delayed IT group is defined as subjects who were randomized to the control cohort (No IT 
treatm ent) in study HGT -HIT-094 and began IT treatm ent in study SHP609 -302.
For exploratory efficacy analyses, only data collected in study SHP609 -302 will be used; the 2treatm ent 
groups are the Early IT group and Delayed IT grou p. 
Visit Month 13 of the SHP609 -302 Extended Treatment Phase corresponds to the scheduled visit at which 
subjects in the Early IT group have com pleted 12 m onths of IT treatm ent in antecedent study HGT -HIT-094. 
The treatm ent regim en in HGT -HIT-094 com prised 1 month for surgical IDDD implantation at the beginning 
of the study followed by 12 months of IT treatm ent during HGT -HIT-094.
Likewise, Visit Month 25 of the SHP609 -302 Extended Treatm ent Phase corresponds to the scheduled visit at 
which subjects in the Early IT group have com pleted two 12 -month periods of IT treatm ent, and comprises 1 
month for surgical IDDD implantation at the beginning of HGT -HIT-094, 12 m onths of IT treatm ent during

HGT -HIT-094, and a continued 12 m onths of IT treatm ent in the Extend ed Treatm ent Phase of SHP609 -302. 
Visit Week 52 of the SHP609 -302 Initial Treatm ent Phase is the scheduled visit at which subjects in the 
Delayed IT group have completed 12 m onths of IT treatment in study SHP609 -302, and comprises 12 m onths 
of No IT treatment during HGT -HIT-094, 1 month fo r surgical IDDD implantation at the beginning of 
SHP609 -302, and 12 m onths of IT treatm ent in the Initial Treatm ent Phase of SHP609 -302. 
It is noted that Visit Month 25 and Visit Week 52 of SHP609 -302 are 4 weeks apart for the Early IT and 
Delayed IT groups. This difference is accounted for by the need for subjects in the Delayed IT group, who 
enrolled into the Initial Treatm ent Phase of SHP609 -302 from  the HGT -HIT-094 No IT treatm ent group, to 
undergo surgical implantation of the device at the beginning o f study SHP609 -302. Therefore, the first dose of 
SHP609 was administered 4 weeks later to these subjects com pared with subjects in the Early IT group who 
were randomized to IT treatment and underwent IDDD implantation in HGT -HIT-094 prior to enrolling in 
the Extended Treatment Phase of SHP609 -302. For evaluation of the long -term  efficacy of IT treatm ent in 
SHP609 -302, this 4 -week difference is considered to have m inimal impact on neurodevelopm ental assessment 
scores.

Change: Text and figure added to describe the conceptual plot of treatment periods in Early IT and Delayed IT 
Groups in Studies HGT -HIT-094 and SHP609 -302
Rationale:  To enable statistical analysis of efficacy
Section impacted by this change: Section 10.4.2 , Analysis Populations
Revised Text:
All data descriptive summary analyses of safety and efficacy data will be based on the Safety Population, which 
is defined as all patients subjects in Study SHP609 -302 w ho underwent IDDD implantation or received at least 1 
dose of study drug (full or partial). 
The following nom enclature will be used to identify “A” ,“B”,“C”,and “D” in Figure 2.
Observation Groups A and C identify the period of observation during study HGT -HIT-094, for 
subjects randomized to IT treatm ent and No IT treatm ent,respectively . 
Observation Groups B and D identify the period of observation during study SHP609 -302 up to 
completion of 1 year, for subjects who were random ized in HGT -HIT-094 to receive IT treatm ent 
and No IT treatm ent respectively, noting that all subjects in SHP609 -302 received IT trea tment.
The subjects in “B” are the sam e subjects as in “A” with periods of observation from  studies SHP609 -302 and 
HGT -HIT-094, respectively as we can view “B” as a continuation of “A” .The subjects in “D” are the sam e 
subjects as in “C” with periods of observation from  studies SHP609 -302 and HGT -HIT-094, respectively as 
we can view “D” as a continuation of “C” .
“D” subjects are therefore similar to “A” subjects since these subjects all transitioned from  receiving weekly 
IV infusion of Elaprase, to also receive m onthly IT idursulfase. More generally, because study SHP609 -302 
did not have baseline GCA inclusion criteria, such as that em ployed for Stud y HGT -HIT-094, “B” and “D” 
subjects could differ with regard to their baseline GCA score at the beginning of the observation period . 
Therefore, for consideration of “B” and “D” ,only subjects m eeting the key inclusion criteria to HGT -HIT-
094 will be includ ed in i nferential efficacy analyses, ie , with GCA scores between 55 and 85 inclusive at the 
enrollment of SHP609 -302.
The exploratory efficacy analyses will be conducted on “HGT -HIT-094 Com parable Set” ,“HGT -HIT-094 
Comparable S ubset 1” ,and “HGT -HIT-094 C omparable S ubset 2” .The prim ary analysis population is

Appendix 21 Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes
Amendment Summary and Rationale 
Amendment 3 (applicable to all countries) : 
Clinical protocol SHP -609- 302 was amended from the previous version to introduce the option 
of same -day administration of IV Elaprase and idursulfase -IT for patients who have alread y 
completed at least 12 months of idursulfase- IT treatment in studies HGT -HIT-094 or SHP -609-
302, ie, those patients participating in the Extend ed Treatment Phase of the present stud y. Same -
day administration may  be elected at the investigator’s discretion and is intended to offer 
convenience to patients participating in the Extended Treatment Phase, who otherwise would be 
required to schedule an extra clinic visit in order to receive Elaprase at least 48 hours after their 
monthly  IT dose.
If same -day dosing is elected, idursulfase- IT is to be administered first and the IV Elaprase 
infusion will be administered second. Per this protocol amendment, additional pharmacokinetic 
assessments will be implemented to measure an y increase in total sy stemic exposure to 
idursulfase under the same -day administration regime. While, with same -day dosing, it will not 
be possible to distinguish idursulfase of IV -administered origin from that of I T-administered 
origin, pharmacokinetic and safet y assessments will evaluate the effect of the same- day IV and 
IT regime on total idursulfase exposure and on safety  parameters such as the incidence and/or 
severit y of infusion -related reactions, even if the patient had no prior such reactions on Elaprase 
alone. The clinical safet y profile of Elaprase is well understood. Based on the known 
pharmacokinetic properties and safety  profile of idursulfase -IT in pediatric MPS II patients also 
receiving Elaprase therapy, the contribution to total sy stemic exposure of IT -administered 
idursulfase in the setting of same -day IV Elaprase infusion is not expected to detrimentally  
impact patient safet y. With this amendment, a new category of adv erse event relatedness, related 
to IV Elaprase and/or idursulfase -IT, will be 
incorporated into the protocol to facilitate the 
collection and anal ysis of adverse events observed with same -day administration.
Note that, on the occasion of the first same -dayadministration, the duration of IV Elaprase 
infusion is to be standardized to 3 hours, corresponding to the recommended infusion rate for 
new Elaprase patients per product labeling. This cautious approach is in the interest of patient 
safet y, as well as t o promote 
the homogeneit y in data collection needed for the interpretation of 
pharmacokinetic data. Thereafter, at subsequent monthly  visits at which same -day administration 
of IV Elaprase infusion and idursulfase -IT are elected, the investigator may  use d iscretion in 
deciding the appropriate Elaprase infusion rate based on past experience with the patient, and the 
patient’s prior response to the same -day administration regime.

Change : Addition of adverse event rel ationship category
Section impacted by this change : 3.1Primary Endpoints
Revised Text: 
Safety will be assessed during the study by the following:
•Adverse events (AEs) (by type, severity, and relationship to treatment [idursulfase -IT, the IDDD, 
device s urgical procedure, or IT administration process], IV Elaprase infusion, IV Elaprase and/or 
idursulfase -IT)

Adverse Events; 10.7.1.1 Investigational Product
Change: Introduction of same -day dosing regime
Section impacted by this change: 6.2 Treatments Administered
Revised Text: 
The investigational prod uct may be administered on the same day (ie, the sam e calendar day or 
within a 24 -hour period) as the Elaprase IV infusion. However, this can only occur for patients 
participating in the Extended Treatment Phase who have already completed at least 12 m onth s of 
idursulfase -IT treatment in studies HGT -HIT-094 or SHP -609-302. If sam e-day dosing is elected, 
idursulfase -IT will be administered first and the Elaprase IV infusion will be administered second 
Please refer to Section 7.7.1 for details .
Other section s impacted by this change: 7 Study Procedures
Change: Clarification of safety assessment with same -day dosing
Section impacted by this change: 6.6.1 Infusion Reactions and Management
Revised Text: 
The ongoing clinical studies with idursulfase -IT have not revealed adverse events of the severity and 
frequency consistent with infusion -related reactions sometimes observed w ith IV Elaprase infusion. As of 
the date of this protocol, there have been no significant concerns regarding infusion -related immune 
reactions following IT administration in studies HGT -HIT-045 and HGT -HIT-046. Additionally, safety 
assessments in the present study will evaluate the effect of sam e-day IV and IT regime on the 
incidence and/or severity of infusion -related adverse reactions, even if the patient had no prior such 
reactions on Elaprase alone.

Change: Introduction of same -day dosing regime
Section impacted by this change: 7 Study Procedures
Revised Text: 
All patients will receive weekly IV Elaprase infusions as prescribed throughout the study. During the 
Initial Treatment Pha se, on IT Dosing Weeks the IV infusion of Elaprase should be scheduled to occur a 
minimum of 48 hours after IT administration of idursulfase -IT.

Change: Description of same- day dosing regime
Sectio n impacted by this change: 7.7.1 Same -Day Investigational Administration with Elaprase Infusion
Revised Text: 
During the Initial Treatm ent Phase, on IT Dosing Weeks the IV infusion of Elaprase should be scheduled 
to occur a minimum of 48 hours after IT a dministration of idursulfase -IT. 
During the Extended Treatment Phase only, the investigator will have the option of administering the 
IV Elaprase infusion and idursulfase -IT on the same da y. If sam e-day dosing is elected, idursulfase -IT 
will be adm inistered first and the Elaprase infusion will be administered second. Pharm acokinetic 
assessments are to occur at the first study visit at which sam e-day dosing is elected. At this visit, 
administration of the Elaprase infusion should start within approximately 90 m inutes of completion of 
idursulfase -IT administration.
Note that on the occasion of the first sam e-day administration, the duration of IV Elaprase infusion is 
to be standardized to 3 hours. Thereafter, at subsequent visits on which the Elaprase infusi on and 
idursulfase -IT are administered on the sam e day, the investigator m ay use discretion in deciding the 
appropriate Elaprase infusion rate based on past experience with the patient, and the patient’s prior 
response to the same -day regim e.
Other sectio ns impacted by this change: 7.8 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Change: Timing of CSF sample collection and PK sampling
Section impacted by this change: 7.8 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Revised Text: 
Blood samples will be collected for determination of idu rsulfase serum concentration -time profiles and 
serum pharmacokinetic parameters after IT administration .
Idursulfase concentrations will be measured in CSF samples obtained immediately prior to each IT 
administration (and at the EOS Visit) to determine the degree of accumulation of monthly idursulfase -IT 
administrations in the CSF.
The blood and CSF sampling schedules for pharmacokinetic assessments are provided in the Schedule of 
Events ( Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 , Appendix 3 , Appendix 4 , Appendix 5 , Appendix 6, Appendix 7 , 
Appendix 8 , Appendix 9 , Appendix 10 , Appendix 11 ,and Appendix 12 ) .
During the Extended Treatment Phase, blood samples for pharm acokinetic assessments willbe 
collected on the occasion of the first same -day adm inistration of idursulfase -IT and Elaprase. This 
pharm acokinetic sampling need only be scheduled once, and m ay occur at Month 25 or at an 
alternative visit during the Extended Treatment Phase (see Appendix 13 for PK sam pling tim e points 
associated with sam e-day administration).

Revised Text: 
During the Extended Treatment Phase, the investigator will have the option of adm inistering the IV 
Elaprase infusion and idursulfase -IT on the same day. With same -day dosing, it may not be possible 
to distinguish idursulfase of IV -administered origin from that of IT -administered origin. Therefore, 
adverse events that are potentially related to IV Elaprase infusion and/or idursulfase -IT 
administration will be captured.

[Due to duplication of footnote a in the list of footnotes shown below the schedule of assessments in 
Appendix 4, the sequential lettering of the listed footnotes should be readjusted to appear as follows:]
aNeurodevelop mental status will be assessed over time by measuring cognitive and adaptive functions as 
depicted in Appendix 8.
bThe 12 -lead ECG is to be performed within 4 hours after IT administration of study drug.
cGeneral anesthesia or sedation may be required for injections of investigational product and some 
evaluations, and can be used at the discretion of the Investigator as indicated in the Study Manuals. It is 
anticipated that study procedures such as lumbar puncture and MRI will have to be performed with 
sedati on/anesthesiology support.
dX-rays may be performed to check placement of the device, and as needed, throughout the study. An 
X-ray will be performed at the end of the study to verify that the IDDD is in the correct position.
eSerum samples for PK analysis w ill be collected w ithin 15 minutes (±5 minutes) prior to intrathecal 
administration of idursulfase -IT and at 30 minutes (±5 minutes), 60 minutes (±5 minutes), 120 minutes 
(±5minutes), 4 hours (±5 minutes), 6 hours (±5 minutes), 8 hours (±15 minutes), 12 h ours (±15 
minutes), 24 hours (±15 minutes), 30 hours (±15 minutes), 36 hours (±15 minutes) after the start of 
intrathecal administration.
fNote that, on IT Dosing Weeks, the IV infusion of Elaprase should be scheduled to occur a minimum of 
48hours after IT administration of idursulfase -IT.
gWhen a patient has received and tolerated a total of 12 monthly doses of intrathecal idursulfase -IT 
across studies HGT -HIT-094 and SHP -609-302, the Sponsor and Principal Investigator will consider 
the feasibility of trans itioning the patient’s monthly IT dosing to local sites to reduce the burden 
imposed by monthly travel.
hPre-treatment assessments may be performed on the same day as IT administration of idursulfase -IT, if 
the patient can arrive at the study site early in 
the day and if the Investigator deems this clinically 
appropriate . In the absence of any safety concerns, patients may complete the safety follow -up visit on 
the same day as IT administration prior to discharge.
iPatients will remain under observation in th e hospital setting (eg, may include infusion center, PACU 
(recovery suite), observation unit, short stay center) for 4 hours post IT injection for vital signs and 
other safety assessments. Vital signs will be collected at the follow ing time points (±10 minutes) in 
association with IT administration of idursulfase -IT: within 15 minutes prior to IT administration, 30 
minutes post end of IT administration, 60 minutes post end of IT administration, 120 minutes post end 
of IT administration, and 4 hours post end of IT administration. Thereafter, if deemed clinically stable 
by the Investigator, patients may leave the hospital setting (with exception of Visits at which serial 
blood sampling for pharmacokinetic evaluation is planned). The patient may need to be exam ined the 
following day.

Change : Clarification concerning infusion -related reactions
Section impacted by this change : 6.6.1 Infusion Reactions and Management
Revised Text: 
Infusions of proteins can be associated w ith reaction s to the infusion that may or may not be immune 
mediated (hypersensitivity reactions) . Thus, potential reactions to the infusion of an investigational 
product , including idursulfase -IT,are unpredictable. 
It is often difficult to clinically distinguish in fusion reactions from  hypersensitivity reactions. 
Symptoms may include headache, fever, sensory paresthesias (including feeling of warmth, tingling, 
or pain), rash, pruritus, or autonom ic symptoms, such as dry m outh or gustatory abnorm alities 
(including lo ss of smell and metallic taste). Changes in mental status or level of consciousness that are 
not caused by pre -medication m ay either occur acutely or develop post -injection over tim e.
The management of infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions is s imilar. The following steps 
may be taken, at the discretion of the Investigator, in the event of a suspected infusion 
related/hypersensitivity reaction and the m anagement of such reactions should be based on the 
severity of the reaction:
Treatment with med ications such as antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids
Stopping and resuming treatment
Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions in those 
cases where sym ptom atic treatment was required
Infusion -related reactions have been observed in patients receiving IV ERT w ith Elaprase, w ith symptoms 
including cutaneous reactions (rash, pruritus, and urticaria), pyrexia, headache, hypertension, and flushing. 
Previous experience with Elaprase is fully describ ed in the Elaprase US Package Insert and the EU 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may 
prevent subsequent reactions in those cases where symptomatic treatment was required. The safety 
informat ion reported from administration of Elaprase may be relevant to management of adverse events in 
relation to idursulfase -IT.

SHP -609-302Amendment 2 25May 2016
Successful management of Elaprase infusion -related adverse events included slowing or interrupting the 
infusion at the time of the e vent or pre- treatment with low -dose corticosteroids and/or antihistamines. Most 
adverse events of this type were treated w ith antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine (IV administration 
preferred if available), oxygen, or mild glucocorticoids such as hydroc ortisone and prednisolone. All were 
monitored closely until symptoms of the reactions had subsided. In clinical trials of Elaprase, an apparent 
decrease in the overall rates of adverse events, and specifically infusion -related adverse events, was 
observed over time, suggesting that patients may better tolerate infusions during long -term therapy. 
Because idursulfase IT is administered intrathecally, it is not expected that systemic blood levels will be 
high enough to cause an infusion -related reaction. C The ongoing clinical studies with idursulfase -IT have 
not revealed adverse events of the severity and frequency consistent with infusion -related reactions 
sometimes observed with IV Elaprase infusion. As of the date of this protocol, there have been no 
signif icant concerns regarding infusion -related immune reactions following IT administration in studies 
HGT -HIT-045 and HGT -HIT-046.

Simvastatin 1.2% Topical Dental Gel  
 
I. Introduction 
 
 
Peri-implant muc ositis is the precursor to peri -implant diseases 1 , which are responsible 
for many of the failures that affect dental implants2. Bacteria are reg arded as the main 
cause of  peri-implant diseases, however the host mediated inflammatory response is 
what causes the associated tissue destruction via inflammation.3-7 
 
Simvastatin ( SMV) , is a specific competitive inhibitor of 3 - hydroxyl - 2- methyl- glutaryl 
coenzyme A ( HMG -CoA) reductase.8 Research has shown that simvastatin use also 
reduces periodontal inflammation 9 and it has been shown that simvastatin reduces 
interleu kin IL -6 and IL- 8 ,10  both of which have been associated with diseased implants .11-
12  The use of s imvastatin as a subgingivally delivered gel in human subjects h as shown 
reduction of modified bleeding index (mSBI) probing depth ( PD), mean clinical attach ment 
loss ( CAL) as well as a decreased intrabony defect in patients with periodontitis .13 Animal 
studies on the use of topically applied statins resulted in greater bone densities around 
implants 14-15

II. Physical, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation  
 
Simvastatin is a synthetic derivative of a fermentation product of Aspergillus terreus  and 
is a methylated form of lovastatin.  Like lovastatin, simvastatin is a prodrug which requires hydrolysis for activation as an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor.
1,2,3 Our gel will be used 
topically for local anti- inflammatory  effect.  
 
Lecithin/isopropyl palmitate solution (Lipoil®) , Poloxamer 407 gel (Polox Gel 20%®) will be the gelling agent 
used.  Cellulose derivatives are considered virtually unabsorbed by the human digestive tract 
and are  non-allergenic.3 
 
The gel is a yellow , viscous gel.

III. Nonclinical Studies  
 
Sakoda et al. studied the anti -inflammatory effect of simvastatin in oral tissues, 
specifically the effect of simvastatin on a human epithelial cell line KB which has been 
extensively used as a model for the study of gingivalepithelial cells stimulated by IL- 1. 
Simvastatin was found to reduce IL- 1_-induced production of inflammatory cytokines IL-
6 and IL -8 by human oral epithelial cells  1

IV. Effects in Humans  
 
 
a. Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Humans 
 Simvastatin is FDA approved in therapeutic doses of 5 -80 mg/day per os as a 
hypolipidemic agent.  Simvastatin is a methylated derivative of lovastatin, both of 
which are prodrugs that must be activated in the liver.  After oral ingestion, 
simvastatin, which is an inactive lactone, is hydrolyzed to the corresponding beta -
hydroxyacid form.
1 This is an in hibitor of 3 -hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl- coenzyme A 
(HMG -CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG -CoA to 
mevalonate, which is an early and rate -limiting step in the biosynthesis of 
cholesterol.1 
 Orally administered simvastatin is metabolized in the liver via CYP3A4 with an 
extensive first -pass effect. Bioavailibility is <5%. Simvastatin and its active 
metabolite are  95% bound to plasma proteins. Approximately 60% of an orally 
absorbed dose is excreted in the feces and 13% in the urine.  The half- life is 1.9 
hours.
2,3 
 
Simvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 hepatic metabolism. Other drugs 
that inhibit CYP3A4 can result in increased HMG -CoA reductase inhibition and 
toxicity.  This is a dose -related phenomenon which usually occurs with repeated 
dosing of both interacting drugs and in the higher dosage range (maximum of 80 mg/day) of simvastatin. Simvastatin does not affect the metabolism of other CYP3A4 substrates.
2,3 Simvastatin is also a substrate and inhibitor of the P -gp 
transport system.2,3 
8 
Simvastatin 1.2% Topical Dental Gel  
 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 can cause at least a 5 -fold increase in plasma AUC 
values or more than an 80% decrease in clearance. These include protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), some macrolide antibiotic s 
(clarithromycin, telithromycin), some azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole),  an antidepressant (nefazodone).
4 
 Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 may cause at least a 2 fold increase in the plasma AUC values or a 20 -50% decrease in clearance. Moderat e inhibitors include some 
calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), a macrolide antibiotic (erythromycin), an azole antifungal (fluconazole), an antiemetic (aprepitant), 
valerian and bergamottin (found in grapefruit juice).
4 
 
 
b. Safety and Efficacy  
Simvastatin was first approved by the FDA in July 1998 and initially marketed under the trade name Zocor ® by Merck and Company, Inc.
1 The first generic versions were 
approved in December 2006. Simvastatin is listed as a core medication on the current World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines  for the global 
patient populatio n.
6 
 
Allergic reactions to HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors are rare, estimated to be 0.1%  
and the incidence of cross -reactivity is unknown .2,3.7 Allergic reactions to this drug  
when taken orally can include face and mouth swelling or severe skin rash. Other 
adverse reactions of simvastatin when taken in the normal oral dosage range 
include eczema, headache, edema, myalgia, nausea, gastritis and vertigo. These are most likely dos e-related reactions and not anticipated in this study.
2.3 
 It is anticipated that the topical application of 1.2 mg of simvastatin (0.15% of the maximum recommended daily dose) will not produce an allergic reaction. In case of an immediate allergic reaction, the subjects will be escorted to the University of 
Iowa Hospitals and Clinics emergency room, which is in close proximity to the 
College of Dentistry. In addition, all UI Dental Clinics are equipped with standard emergency supplies/devices should they become necessary, and ACLS trained 
practitioners will be on site.  
 Simvastatin is considered a pregnancy category X drug and should not be used in women of childbearing age unless conception is highly unlikely.  It is unknown if 
simvastatin is excret ed in breast milk and the drug’s use in women who are breast-
feeding is contraindicated by the manufacturer.

Simvastatin 1.2% Topical Dental Gel  
This study will administer a single topical dose of 1.2 mg simvastatin (0.15% of the 
maximum recommended daily dose) to healthy adult subjects,  so we do not 
anticipate any toxicity issues. Limited information is available on the acute toxicity 
of statins.8 If any reaction does occur, supportive and symptomatic treatment will 
be initiated and the patient will be closely observed and sent to the UI HC 
emergency room for evaluation and management.  
 Simvastatin has toxic potential similar to other statins. Increases in serum aminotransferase concentrations (AST [SGOT], ALT [SGPT] more than 3 times upper limits of normal have been reported with statins.  These increases are dose related 
and often transient, resolving in the majority of patients without a change in drug 
or dose. 
2,3,8  
 
Myopathy occurs in less than 0.7% of patients receiving statins and the risk is dose 
related and also higher in patients with renal or hepatic disease, uncontrolled hypothyroidism and geriatric patients.
2,3 
 A study by Pradeep et al. used subgingival 1.2% simvastatin gel along with scaling 
and root planning on 60 patients with periodontitis (inflammation of both bone 
and gums  around natural teeth). The study showed that on 1, 2, 4 and 6 month 
recalls, a statistically significant reduction in bleeding on probing, probing depths, clinical attachment loss, as well as increased bone regeneration .

V. Summary of Data  
Recent research has shown that simvastatin ( SMV ); a specific competitive inhibitor of 
3- hydroxyl- 2- methyl-glutaryl coenzym e A (HMG -CoA) reductase  FDA approved 
for lower ing cholesterol, also reduces periodontal inflammation (1,2,3, 4) . Simvastatin 
is has rare allergic reactions ( 5,6), and other complications are mainly dose dependent 
(6) .  The use of Simvastatin results in  reduction of the clinical parameters of gingival 
inflammation, like modified Bleeding index (mSBI) probing depth (PD) and mean clinical attachment loss (CAL) in patients with periodontitis (7).  Moreover, 
Simvastatin reduces the crevicular  levels of interleukin IL -6 and IL -8 (8) both of 
which have been associated with  implants with peri implant disease (9, 10 ).  
The anti- inflammatory effect of simvastatin on implants with peri- implant mucositis 
has not yet been tested, thus the purpose of the present study is to assess the anti - 
inflammatory action of locally delivered simvastatin in subjects with implants affected by peri-implant mucositis (defined as BOP and/or purulence but not signs of mesial/distal bone loss greater than 1mm from the accepted reference point on the implant system). the gel used will be used at 0.15% of the maximal recommended dose 
thus any adverse effects are not expected.

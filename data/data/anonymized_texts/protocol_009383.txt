be randomized and stratified via the IRT.  Please refer IRT user manual for details on other transactions 
with IRT.
6.Medication w ashout criteria should be checked before initiating any visit procedures.  If patient does 
not meet medication washout requirements, visit should be rescheduled.
7.Pulmonary function tests: v isit 1 measurements are to determine pati ent eligibility.   Schedule for serial 
spirometry measurements 
at visits 2 and 4 are p rovided in the table below thefootnotes .  At visit 3, 
only trough FEV 1 measurements are done.   At visit 2, the PFTs should be ginbetween 07: 00 a.m. and 
10:00 a.m.  At visits 3 and 4, PFTs should begin within ± 30 minutes of the time it started at visit 2.   
Pulmonary function tests must be completed befo re plethysmography in patients participating in the 
optional trial procedure.
8.Plethysmography to be done only at selected sites on selected patients .  Sites should have their own 
body plethysmography equipment.
  At the screening visit, an assessment will be completed to see if the 
patient can perform technically acceptable body plethysmography t ests.
9.Fasting is not required for safety labs.
10.eGFR will be derived from serum creatinine values, age, sex and race based on the CKD -EPIcr 
equation [R12 -1392].
11.Wom en of child -bearing potential: s erum pregna ncy test is to be completed at v isit 1.  Urine pregnancy 
test (dipstick) is to be completed at visits2, 3, and 4 (see section 5.2.3 )
12.If the interval betw een screening and randomization visits is less than one week, and the ECG 
recording obtained at the screening visit is normal, ECG will not be repeated at the randomization vis it.
13. must be dispensed at the screening visit along with the paper diary.  Patient must 
be trained on how the PIFR measurements wi ll be performed and recorded in the diary
(seesection 6.1).  At visits 2 and 3, the diary should be reviewed, and additional training provided to 
the patient if necessary.
14.Patients should be coached on how  PIFR measur ements are d one and recorded in the patient’s diary.  
Patients should be reminded to bring the diary to all future clinic visits.
15.PIFR measurements using med/low and high resistance in the will be collected in 
the clinic at visits 2, 3, and 4.  Measurements made at the screening visit are for training purpose only.   
For more details, see section 6 .1.
16.Rescue medication (salbutamol , also known as albuterol ) must be dispensed at the screening visit.  
Patient should bring the inhaler back to the clinic at all future visits.  Investigator should ensure that 
patient has adequate supply of rescue medication until th e next clinic visit.  Salbutamol will not be 
dispensed at EOT.   Supply of salbutamol will not be managed via IRT.
17.At the randomization visit, patient must receive adequate training on using the Respimat®device
(seesection 6.2.2 ).  If necessary, patient must be trained again at visit 3. Study sites wi ll have separate 
inhalers as training device.
18.PIFR measurement with med/low resistance will be used for stratification of optimal and sub -optim al 
groups.  Measur ements will be made i n triplicate and the highest value will be used for stratification.  
PIFR measurements made at the screening visit must not be used for stratification.
19.For unscheduled re -supply of study drug, refer to IRT user manual.
20.Please refer to section 4.3 for treatment compliance.
21.Follow -up visit will be completed by telephone.  Investigator w ill have the discretion t o bring the 
patient to do an in -clinic follow -up visit if any safety issues are identified at EOT.
(*****) After the Follow -up visit (=individual patient’s end of the trial) the investigator should report 
only any cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer and trial treatment related 
SAEs of which the investigator may become aware of and only via the BI SAE form, please see section 
5.2.6.2.1 .

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
The complementary  modes of action of tiotropium + olodaterol have previously  been 
demonstrated in phase II clinical trials and during the Phase IIIa program that led to the 
registration of tiotropium + olodaterol combination in the European Un ion(EU) , the Uni ted 
States and several other countries (P15-03349).
In the Phase III program the additional benefits of the tiotropium + olodaterol fixed dose 
combination (FDC) over its mono -components and placebo have been assessed on lung
function, quality  of life (St. George's Respiratory  Questionnaire - SGRQ), dy spnea (Transition 
Dyspnea Index -TDI), moderate and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD )
exacerbations and exercise endurance time (P15-03349 ).
Inhaled bronchodilat ors are a mainstay  of therap y for COPD, b ronchodilator therap y can be 
delivered via several modalities including dry powder inhalers (DPIs), soft mist inhalers 
(SMI s), nebulized solutions, and pressurized 
metered dose inhalers (pMDIs).  Drug delivery  
via inhalation devices is dependent on the inspiratory  flow rate generated by  the patient.  It is 
now widely  recognised that a successful treatment outcome in COPD depends as much on the 
inhaler device as it does on the drug (P06-04748).
The majority  of patients with COPD present with moderate to severe airflow obstruction at 
time of diagnosis.  In COPD patients expiratory  airflow limitation is ty pically  accompanied 
by decreased inspiratory  capacity , hyperinflation and respiratory  muscles impairment, which 
combined, result in reduced inspiratory  flow rates, which could diminish lower airway  
deposition of the drug ( P06-
04750).
Achieving the correct inhalation flow from an y inhalation device is critical in order for the 
patient to achieve therapeutic benefit from the inhaled drug. Patients with COPD may  use 
sub-optimal inhalation flows as they  may  not have the energy  generated by their inspired 
breath to achieve the effective inhalation flows that are required for some devices (R15-5362). 
However, inspiratory  flow rates or the patient´s ability  to perform the required inhalation 
maneuver are rarel y che cked in clinical practice before selecting an inhaler/treatment, 
increasing the risk of patients not receiving the full clinical benefits of the treatment 
prescribed.
The Respimat®Soft MistTM Inhaler actively  delivers a metered dose of medication , with 
minimal inspiratory  effort from the patient ,  as a fine slow moving, long lasting mist , with a 
high fine particle fraction, resulting in a high lung deposition and lower orophary ngeal 
deposition (P12-01215, P05- 10480, P06- 10775). Invitro data has demonstrated that
Respimat®Soft MistTMdelivers high lung deposition at low modelled flow rates and across 
disease severities, and requires only a very  low inspiratory  effort (P17-06338 ).
Dry powder inhalers have higher internal resistance than that of SMIs and pMDI s; as a result, 
the inspiratory  force necessary  to overcome the internal resistance of DPIs, to optimally

required for pMDIs and SMI s. The .) 
has been introduced as a simple, low cost method of measuring an individual’s inspiratory  
flow rate.  It is generall y accepted that a PIFR of 60 L /Min (optimal PIFR) is required for 
adequate drug delivery  by a DPI with medium internal resistance.  In previous studies of 
small cohorts, approximately  30-50% of patients are unable to generate the targeted PIFR of 
60 L/Min as measured by with medium or low resistance.  There is also 
evidence demonstrating that, at the time of discharge from an acute care hospital for 
treatment of a COPD -related hospitalization, one third of patients had a sub -optimal PI FR 
with medium or low resistance measured b y .  It has been demonstrated 
that sub
-optimal PI FR is a predictor of 90 -day readmission for COPD, days to all -cause 
readmissions and day s to COPD readmission. Multivariate analysis has de monstrated that 
age, gender, height, forced vital capacit y (FVC) % predicted and inspiratory capacity (I C) % 
predicted are independent predictors of sub -optimal PIFR. This evidence highlights the 
importance of inspiratory flow rate in the effective deliver y of inhaled therapies; yet, the 
evidence for the benefits provided b y currently available inhaled treatments for COPD 
according to the inspiratory  flow rates generated by  patients, is scarce.  
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Tiotropium + olodaterol combination
Tiotropium +olodaterol FDC is an aq ueous solution of tiotropium + olodaterol contained in a 
cartridge. It is administered by  using the Respimat® inhaler. One cartridge is used per 
inhaler, which is inserted into the device prior to first use.
Inthe pivotal stud ies(c017 35218-03, c01735249-03), tiotropium +olodaterol FDC showed 
statistically  significant improvements in Forced Expiratory  Volume in first second (FEV 1) 
Area under the curve (AUC 0-3h) response and trough FEV 1response after 24 weeks compared 
to the mono -components and these improvements were maintained up to 52 weeks. 
Tiotropium +olodaterol FDC showed statistically significant improvements in health -related 
qualit y of life (SGRQ) and d yspnea experienced during ev eryday activities [Transition 
Dyspnea Index (TDI)] after 24 weeks compared to the mono- components. More patients 
treated with the combination had an improvement in SGRQ total score and TDI focal score 
which exceeded the Minimal Clinic ally Important Difference .
Treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol FDC also resulted in reductions in both day time and 
night time rescue bronchodilator use compared to the mono -components. The
bronchodilatory profile of the combination was confirm edin a supportive 6 -week stud y 
(c02093555-02), in which the mean FEV 1improvements over 24 hours were superior to the 
monocomponents, with improve ments in FVC , inspiratory  capacit y (IC), and functional 
residual capacit y (FRC) ,supporting the results for FEV 1. 
Tiotropium +olodaterol FDC was shown to be safe and well tolerated over 1 y ear in a 
moderate to very  severe COPD population. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs), fatal AEs, freq uencies for cardiac events and m ajor adverse

mono -components. The nature and frequency  of AEs in general was consistent with the 
disease under stud y. There were no results in the clinical development program suggesting 
the need for absolute contraindications for the combination product.
Based on these observations, marketing authorization for tiotropium +olodaterol (5μg /5μg) 
FDC (total dail y dose) has been granted in US, Canada, Australia, in all European countries 
within t he decentralized procedure as well as in a number of other countries worldwide.
For a more detailed description of the drug profile refer to the current Summary  of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for Spiolto®or the United States Prescribing Information ( USPI )for 
Stiolto®which are included in the Investigator Site File (I SF).
Boehringer Ingelheim’s Respimat®inhaler will be used for administration of study  drug. The 
medication is provided as an aqueous solution in a cartridge, which is inserted into the device 
prior to first use. A propellant -free device, the Respimat®inhaler generates a soft mist which 
is released over a period of approximately  1.5 seconds. The fraction of fine particles 
acces sible to the lungs and airway s is very  high compared with many  metered dose aerosols 
or dry  powder devices. The use of the Respimat®inhaler has been shown to be safe with 
regards to paradoxical bronchoconstriction during chronic use in patients with COPD 
(P05-08465). The Residual Effect P eriod (REP) of tiotropium +olodaterol FDC is 21 day s.
Salbutamol used as rescue medication in this trial is a short- acting, selective beta 2-adrenergic 
receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD.  Salbutamol is a bronchodilator 
that opens up the airway s affected by  bronchoconstriction, therefore relieving the wheezing 
and shortness of breath.  Salbutamol can be used as a fast- acting rescue medication that 
provides quick relief..
1.3 RATIONAL EFOR PERFORMING THE T RIAL
Despite evidence supporting the efficacy  of tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat®(R19-2073) in 
a broad COPD population, data demonstrating the effectiveness of tiotropium + olodaterol 
Respimat®on pulmonary function (trough FEV 1, FEV 1AUC) in individuals stratified by  
optimal and sub- optimal PIFR is lacking.  Spirometry  data from the tiotropium + olodaterol 
clinical development program include mostly  lung function and volumes from an expiratory  
maneuver , which does not allow to measure PIFR; when an inspiratory  maneuver has been 
performed, it is performed against no resistance from the spirometer, which makes it not 
possible to measure the PIFR simulating the resistance of an inhaler.  Furthermor e, since the 
measurement of PIFR is not routinely  performed in daily  clinical practice, the effectiveness 
of tiotropium + olodaterol 
Respimat®according to the patients´ PIFR from real world use has 
not been assessed.
Data from this study  may facilitate the clinician´s decision when choosing a treatment and 
delivery  system, as it could provide certainty  that the treatment selected will be effectivel y 
delivered independentl y of the patient ability  to generate sufficient energy  through the 
inhalation effort .

1.4.1 Benefits
Clinical trials conducte d to date have shown tiotropium +olodaterol (5μg/5μg) fixed dose 
combination to be a safe, well tolerated and efficacious combination therapy  according to 
treatment guidelines in a moderate to very severe COPD population.  The OTEMTO studies, 
demonstrated improvements in lung function with tiotropium + olodaterol over placebo and 
tiotropium after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe COPD 
(P15-
08379), the population to be included in this study
1.4.2 Risks
Potential risks associated with administration of the combination of tiotropium + olodaterol 
include the listed (expected) adverse events for tiotropium / olodaterol (5μg/5μg) fixed dose 
combination asdescribed in the USPI /EU SmPC.
Women of childbearing potential may  be included in clinical trials for tiotropium +olodaterol
(5μg/5μg) fixed dose combination provided appropriate precautions are taken to minimiz e the 
probability  of becoming pregnant.  These precautions include pregnancy  testing and use of a 
highl y effective method of birth co ntrol.  Continued testing and monitoring during the trial 
should be sufficient to ensure compliance with the measures not to become pregnant during 
the period of dr ug exposure .
A placebo group is included in the trial to provide an appropriate control for the assessment 
of the effects of the tiotropium + olodaterol FDC on lung function (FEV 1) according to the 
inspiratory  flow rate (PIFR) the patients can generate.  In order to minimize the risk for the 
study  patients, a number of population and design measures have been put in place, namely :
The duration of the treatment period including placebo is limited to 4 weeks.
The population for this study  excludes patients with very  severe COPD and patients 
currentl y treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
Patients with a recent exacerbation (6 weeks prior to visit 1) or with a history  of 
frequent exacerbations (two or more exacerbation requiring treatment with sy stemic 
glucocorticoids, antibiotics or both, or an exace rbation that required hospitaliz ation 
within one y ear prior to visit 1) are also excluded.
The study  does not include a long washout period.  I n order to shorten the time of 
placebo treatment; patients will 
continue to receive the ir presc ribed treatment until 
three days before randomization.
Patients will receive salbutamol as rescue medication.
Within the four -week treatment period, a stud y visit in the clinic has been added after 
two weeks of treatment as a n opportunity  for assessment of the patients’ condition by  
the investigators.
Boehringer Ingelheim will provide open -label salbutamol asrescue medication for all 
patients during the course of the trial .

Tiotropium +olodaterol FDC delivered via the Respimat®device was shown to be effective 
in improving lung func tion, quality  of life and dyspn ea as well as improve exercise tolerance.  
It has also shown to be safe and well tolerated over 1 y ear in a moderate to very  severe 
COPD population; howev er, there is currently  no clinical data available from randomized 
controlled trials or from real world studies to demonstrate whether COPD patients can benefit 
from t iotropium +olodaterol Respimat®independently  of the inspiratory  flow they  can 
generate.  
Data from this study  will provide this evidence and therefore help in the personaliz ation of 
treatment sel ection for COPD patients.  Considering a placebo arm is included in the study , 
the treatment and follow-up period has been kept short, and includes a clinic visit after two 
weeks of t reatment to assess the patients’ condition.  Further measures are in pl ace to 
minimiz e the risk for the study  population are the exclusion of the most sever e COPD 
population, the population treated with inhale d corticosteroids, those patients with a very  
recent COPD exacerbation, or with a history  of frequent COPD exacerbations and at risk of 
COPD exacerbations.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN 
This trial is a ra ndomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, parallel study  
designed to assess efficacy  of tiotropium +olodaterol delivered b y Respimat®on FEV 1
AUC 0-3h, and trough FEV 1in patients with moderate to severe COPD, stratified by  optimal 
and s ub-optimal PIFR.  The study  will consist of a screening period of up to 2 weeks , a 
4-week randomiz ed treatment period and a three week follow -up period.   An overview of the 
trial design is presented in Figure 3.1: 1.
Figure 3.1: 1 Trial Design
Approximately 200 patients will be randomized (1:1) to either the active arm (tiotropium + 
olodaterol, FDC) or the placebo arm. The random ization will be stratified by optimal 
(≥60L/min) or sub- optimal (< 60 L/min) PIFR as measured with the set 
at med/l ow resistance. Each strata will be capped to a total of approximately  100 patients.  
An interactive response technology (IRT) will be used for ran domization and stratification.
After signing informed c onsent and completing the screening visi t,patients will enter a 
screening period of 3 to 14 day s. During the screening period , patients will continue to 
receive the ir COPD maintenance treatment, except for the medication washout requirements 
required before the randomization visit ( see Table 4.2.3.1: 1 ).  Patients will be randomiz ed 
into the 4 -week treatment period in which they  will be randomly  assigned to one of two 
treatment s: tiotropium + olodaterol FDC or matching placebo.  The randomization visit (visit 
2) will be followed b y a clinic visit in 2 wee ks(visit 3) and end of treatment (EOT) visit (visit 
4) will be 4 weeks (28 day s) after randomization .  A follow -up visit by  telephone will be 
scheduled three weeks after the last dose of stud y medication.  Study  proc edures to be 
performed at each clinic v isit are presented in theFlow Chart .  The timing of the pulmonary  
function tests with serial spirometry  at baseline (v isit 2 ) and at EOT ( visit 4)isprovided in
the table below the Flow Chart.
Patients will be washed out of COP D medications for approximately  72 hours before 
randomization.  Patients will be allowed to use salbutamol as rescue medication during this

via Respimat®inhaler or matching placebo.  Al l patients will receive salbutamol for use as 
rescue medication ,as needed ,from screening visit until EOT .  At the conclusi on of EOT 
visit, patients can resume taking their regular COPD medications.  At the 
EOT visit,
investigator should advise the patients on appropriate care during the follow -up period and 
after completion of the study .  During the follow -up period, patients will not receive stud y 
medication.  Rescue medication will not be dispensed at EOT visit for use during the follow -
up period.  
Patients on I CS maintenance therapy (monotherapy  or combination with 
bronchodilators) will not be eligible to participate in this stud y.
Body pleth ysmograph y measurements will be an optional trial procedure at visit 2 and will be 
done only  at selected sites on selected patients.  A pproximately  30 (15%) patients are 
expected to participate in th is procedure.  Patients participating in this optional trial procedure 
will have to sign a separate informed consent. At the screening visit, an assessment will be 
completed to see if the patient can perform technically acceptable bod y plethy mograph y 
meas urements.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP
Currently , data on the impact of PIFR on the effectiveness of treatments/inhalers available for 
COPD is not consistent or not available, and available data on existing treatments/ inhalers 
cannot be extrapolated to the population of interest.  A comparison with placebo was 
considered the best approach to assess the effect of tiotropium + olodaterol FDC in this 
population.
There is no previous data or knowledge of the treatment effe ct of tiotropium + olodaterol on 
spirometri c parameters in the two PIFR populations (< 60 L/min and ≥ 60 L/min) . Therefore 
the trial will need to enroll a sufficient number of placebo patients in order to make an 
assessment of efficacy  between treatment and placebo.  A 4 -week treatment period is 
considered sufficient to evaluate the effects of tiotropium + olodaterol FDC in patients with 
COPD (P19-
01878).
It is ant icipated tha t with 200 patients randomized 1:1 in the trial and, a duration of 4 weeks,
there is ade quate statistical power to detect an effect of the treatment vs placebo in each of 
the PI FR sub populations.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
Recruitment of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trialwill stop at all 
sites once a sufficient number of patient s have been screened to randomize 200 patients.   
Approximately  40 study  sites are expected to participate in this study .  Approximately  300 
patients are expected to be screened.  Patients in screening at the time when a decision is 
made to stop further screening will be allowed to continue and 
may be randomized in the 
study  if eligible.

3.3.4 Withdrawal of patient s from treatment or assessments
Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent fortrial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) . Please see sections 3.3.4.1 and 3.3.4.2 below.
Every effort should be made to keep thepatients in the trial, if possible ontreatment .  
Measures to control the withdrawal rate include c areful patient selection, appropriate 
explanation of the trialrequir ements and procedures prior to trial enrol lment ,as well as the
explanation of the procedures if the patient withdraws from the trial .  The decision to 
discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent totrialparticipation ,andthe reason must be 
documented in the patient files and 
electronic case report forms ( eCRF ).  If applicable,
consider the requirements for adverse e vent collection and reporting ( sections 5.2.6.2.1 and 
5.2.6. 2).
3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
An individual patient will di scontinue trial treatment if:
The patient wants to discontinue trialtreatment , without the need to justify  the decision.
The patient has repeatedly  shown to be non -compliant with important trialprocedures 
and, in the opinion of both, the investigator and sponsor representative, is not willing or 
able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future.
If a patient experi ences a COPD e xacerbation ( moderate, or severe) during the treatment 
period, patient will be discontinued from the stud y (section 6.2.2 ).
The patient needs to take concomitant medication that interfere s with the investigational 
medicinal produ ctor other 
trialtreatment ( section 4.2.3.1)
The patient can no longer receive trial treatment for medical reasons ( such as surgery , 
adverse events, other diseases, or pregnancy ).  In ca se of a temporary  reason, trial 
treatment should be restarte d if medicall y justified .
In terms of discontinuation of trial treatment, the following criteria must also be taken into 
account:
Trial treatment must be stopped immediately  if a paradoxical bronchospasm or an allergic 
reaction of the immediate ty pe occurs. 
If two or more ey e symptoms (triggering or aggravation of narrow angle glaucoma, ey e 
pain or discomfort, temporary  blurred vision, ey e halos or altered color perception 
associated with reddened ey es due to conjunctival conge stion or corneal edema) occur, 
trial treatment should be discontinued and the patient should consult a specialist 
immediately . 
For safet y reasons, the investigator may  decide that the patient should discontinue trial 
treatment.

benefit -risk- assessment and, if ne eded, pause or discontinue the trial treatment for all patients 
or take an y other appropriate action to gu arantee the safet y of the trial pat ients. 
Even if the trial treatment is discontinued, the patients remain in the trial and, given their
agreement, will undergo the procedures for early  treatment discontinuation and follow -upas 
outlined in the Flow Chart and section 6.2.3 . 
3.3.4.2 W ithdrawal of consent totrial participat ion
Patient smay withdraw their consent to trial participation at an y time without the need to 
justify  the decision.
If a patient wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should be involved in the discussion 
with the patient and explain the difference between trial treatment discontinuation and 
withdrawal of consent totrial participation , as well as explain the options for continued 
follow -upafter trial treatment discontinuation , (section 3.3.4.1 ).
3.3.4.3 Discontinuation of the trialby the s ponsor
Boehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the trialoverall or at a particular trial
site at any  time for the following reasons:
1.Failure to meet expected enroll ment goals overal l or at a particular trialsite.
2.Emergence of an y efficacy /safet y information invalidating th e earlier positive benefit-risk 
assessment that could significantly  affect the continuation of the trial.
3.Deviations from Good Clinical Practice (GCP ), the trial protocol , or the contract 
impairing the a ppropriate conduct of the trial.
The investigator / the trialsite will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(17.0)/Saved on18Mar 20194.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
After the assessment of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, each eligible patient will be 
stratified based on PIFR (optimal vs. sub- optimal) and randomiz ed to one of the two 
treatment arms: tiotropium + olodaterol FDC or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio at visit 2via
IRTusing each strata . The PIFR will be measured with the set at 
med/l owresistance.  PIFR m easurements with med/l ow resistance will be done in triplicate 
the highest PIFR will be used for stratification.  Note that the medication number is different 
from the patient number (t
he latter is generated during screening via the IRT Sy stem ).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Dispensing trial medication
At visit2 the I RT will assign two Respimat®kits(one for tre atment and one as reserve).  At 
visit 3 the patient will bring in all treatment kits (including the reserv e kits) that were 
dispensed at v
isit 2.  I f the reserve kit dispensed at v isit 2 was used by  thepatient, a new 
reserve kit can be dispensed at visit 3.  Each treatment kit will have a unique me dication ID 
number.  Trial medication will be dispensed to the patien t by the investigator or a qualified 
site staff at these visits.  The amount of trial medication dispensed will be recorded on the 
drug accountability  forms.   Patients must return all Respimat®kits at visit 4 which is the end 
of treatment period
The reserve kits allow the patient the flexibility  of not having to return to the clinic 
immediately  to replace a lost or malfunctioning inhaler. In the event that a patient may  need 
additional inhalers and cartridges due to rescheduled visits, inhaler loss or malfunction, these 
will be supplied on an ‘on demand’ basis. Dispensing of these extra inhalers will also be 
managed via the IRT.
At home, i
f the patient forgets to take the m orning dose of trial medication , the patient can 
take the morning dose up until 12:00 midnight . After 12:00 midnight, thepatient should skip 
thedose for that day  and take the next dose the following morning.
Priming of the Respimat®Inhaler
Each newl y assembled Respimat®Inhaler has t o be primed.  Priming should not take place in 
the same room where the patient is inhaling trial medication.  The inhaler should be primed 
by actuating it until an aerosol is visible plus three additional actuations.  All priming 
actuations should be directed to the ground.
Once assembled, the shelf- life of the Respimat®Inhaler with trial medication is 3 months.  
Therefore ,it is important to alway s enter the date of the cartridge insertion on the medication 
label of the Respimat®Inhaler immediatel y after the cartridge is inserted.
Dispensing r escue m edication
Salbutamol will be dispensed to all patients when th ey complete the screening visit, and are 
eligible to enter the screening period.  Patients will receive adequate suppl y of rescue 
medication until the end of treatment period .  Rescue medication will not be provided for the 
follow -up period.  Before using for the first time, one actuation should be re leased into the air 
to ensure the device is working .

4.1.5.1 Blinding
Patient s, investigator s,and every one involved in trialconduct or analy sisor with an y other
interest in this double -blind trialwill remain blinded with regard to the random izedtreatment 
assignments until after database lock.   The access to the randomiz ation code will be kept 
restricted until its release for anal ysis.
4.1.5.2 Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT .  It must only  be used in
an emergency situation when the identity  of the trialdrug must be known to the investigator
in order to provide appropriate medic al treatment or otherwise ensure safety  of trial
participants. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source doc uments and/ or 
appropriate eCRF page.
In case the automated unblinding option via the IRT sy stem is malfunctioning, the IRT 
service provider can be contacted (24 hours a day  coverage) and the treatment allocation can 
be obtained.  IRT support has direct access to the database and the treatment information can 
be manuall y obtained. Details about this process will be included in the I SF. 
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs), it may  be necessary  for a repr esentative from Boehringer Ingelheim ( BI)
Pharmacovigilance group to access the ran domiz ation code for individual patient s during trial
conduct.  The access to the cod e will onl y be given to authoriz ed pharmacovigilance
representatives for processing in th
epharmacovigilance database s ystem and not be shared 
further. 
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling , and re -supply
The investigational medicinal product s will be pr ovided by  BI.  They  will be packaged and 
labelled in accordance with the principles of G
ood Manufacturing Practice .Re-supply  to the
sites will be managed via an I RT s ystem, which will also monitor expiry  dates of supplies 
available at the site s.  For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the 
ISF.
4.1.7 Storage conditions
Drug supplies willbe kept in their original packaging and in a secure limited access storage 
area according to the recommended 
storage conditions on the medication label. A
temperature log must be maintained for documentation. If the storage conditions are found to 
be ou tside the specified range, the 
Clinical Research Associate ( CRA ), as provided in the list 
of contacts in the ISF ,must be contact edimmediately .
Further d etails are provided in the “storage conditions for trial medications” document and on 
the country -specific labels, a sample of which will be part of the ISF.

Patients must abstain from male-female sex. This is defined as being in line with the 
preferred and usual lifesty le of the patient. Periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, declaration of abstinence for the duration of 
exposure to study  drug ; and withdrawal are not acceptable.
4.3 T REATMENT COMPLIANCE
Patients are requested to bring all remaining trial medication including empty  package 
materia l with them w hen attending v isits 3 and 4. Trial medication adherence should be 
reviewed b y the investigator and reported in the eCRF.
Estimating compliance to trial medication
Knowing the time interval between clinic visits, it is possible to calculate the number of puffs
that should have been administered by  the patient. The Respimat®Inhaler contains 60 
actuations (30 daily doses). The dose indicator shows approximately  how much medication is 
left. The dose indicator scale is divided into 4 quarters. One quarter used accounts for 7 day s 
of treatment (14 actuations). When the pointer enters the red area of the scale, there is 
approximately  medication for 7 days (14 actuations left) .  Once the dose indica tor has 
reached the end of the red scale (i.e. all 30 daily  doses have been used) the Respimat® inhaler 
is empty .  Patient compliance should be estimated using the dose indicator.
The acceptable medication compliance should have an overall value in the ra nge 80% to 
120%. Ifthe compliance is outside this range, patient needs to be re -trained.
Randomiz ed patients should not be discontinued for lack of medication compliance without
prior discussion
with the sponsor .

5.1 A SSESSMENT OF EFFICAC Y
This study  is designed to demonstrate the efficacy  of inhaled tiotropium + olodaterol 5µg/5µg 
via Respimat®on lung function in patients with moderate to severe COPD with optimal 
(≥60L/min) and a sub- optimal (<60 L /min) PIFR.
5.1.1 Pulmonary function testing
 spirometers will be provided to sites for the o n-site spirometry  
measurements.  The spirometers and their use, including dail
y calibration on test day s, must 
meet American Thoracic Society  (ATS ) and European Respiratory  Society  (ERS)criteria
(P05-12782). Spirometry  will be conducted with the patient in a se ated position, and it is 
preferable that the same trained individual performs the PFTs for a given patient. The best of 
three efforts will be defined as the highest FEV 1and the highest FVC ,each obtained on any  
of three blows meeting the ATS criteria (with a maximum of five attempts). The highest 
FEV 1and FVC will be selected regardless of whether they  come from different spirometric 
maneuvers or from the same maneuver . The 24- hour clock time of the first maneuver for each 
PFT time point will be recorded. 
The clock time of the start and end of inhalation procedure of trial medication will be 
captured b y the  spirometer.
At the screening visit , pulmonary  function tests will be performed to determine patient 
eligibility (inclusion criteria 3, section 3.3.2 ).At visit 2, the PFTs should begin between 
07:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.  At visits 3 and 4, PFTs s hould begin within ± 30 minutes of the 
time it started at visit 2.   At visits 2and 4, PFT swill be measured up to 3 hours with serial 
spirometry (specified time points are provided in the Flow Chart ).  At visit 3, only  trough
FEV 1measurements are performed.
5.1.2 Peak inspiratory flow rate measurements
The  a hand held device to measure PIFR will be provided to each 
patient.  At the randomization visit the optimal and sub -optimal groups will be determined

5.2.6 A ssessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse event
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavo rable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The followin g should also be recorded as an AE in the eCRF andBI SAE form 
(if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  the 
investigator .
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in t he eCRF .

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(17.0)/Saved on18Mar 20195.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse event
A SAE is defined as an y AE,which fulfils at least one of the following criteria:
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe,
-requires inpatient hospitaliz ation orprolongation of existing hospitaliz ation
- results in persistent or signif icant di sability  or incapacity ,
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopard izethe patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitaliz ation or development of dependency  or abuse. 
5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the electronic data capture ( eDC)
system. A cop y of the latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. 
These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described in section 5.2.6.2 .
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer mus t be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in 5.2.6.2, subsection s“AE Collection ”and“AE r eporting to sponsor and 
timelines ”.
5.2.6.1.4
Adverse events of special interest
No adverse events of special interest have been defined for this trial.
5.2.6.1.5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated .
Moderate: Suffici ent 
discomfort to cause interference with usual activity .
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(17.0)/Saved on18Mar 20195.2.6.1.6 Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judg ement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between the adverse event and the given stud y treatment , considering all 
relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -
challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, con comitant diseases and 
relevant history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The event is known to be caused b y or attribute d to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No medicall y sound alternative etiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dos e is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is noreasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pr e-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned) .
Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despite removing the original trigger.
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation 
(e.g. situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more 
likely  explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
5.2.6.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
5.2.6.2.1 AE Collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriat e eCRF(s) by  the 
investigator :
•From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual patient ’send of trial
(completion of follow- up period) : 
all AEs (serious and non -serious) .

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(17.0)/Saved on18Mar 2019•After the individual patient’s end of trial: the investigator does not need to activel y 
monitor the patient for new AEs but should only  report any  occurrence of cancer and trial 
treatment related SAEs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of 
communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be re ported on the BI SAE form 
(section 5.2.6.2.2 ),but not onthe eCRF.
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelines referring
The investigator must report SAEs and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the reported 
SAE on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the s ponsor’s unique entry  
point (country
 specific contact details will be provided in the I SF). The same timeline applies 
if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions ,the investigator could 
inform the s ponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete 
and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial 
information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient ’s end of trial must 
be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no 
further information can be obtained.
5.2.6.2.3 Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trialand has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure 
during pregnancy  in a trial participant immediately  (within 24 hours ) by means of Part A of 
the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Studies to the sponsor .
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnan cy Monitoring 
Form for Studies (Part B).  The I SF will contain th e Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Studies
(Part A and B) .
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an ac company ing SAE , 
only the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Studiesand not the SAE form is to be completed. If 
there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy  an SAE form must be completed in addition.
5.2.6.2.4 COPD Exacerbation
For the purpose of this study , a COPD exacerbation is defined as a complex of lower 
respiratory  events / sy mptoms (increase or new onset) related to the underl ying COPD, with
duration of three day s or more, requiring prescription of antibiotics and/or sy stemic steroids
and/or hospitalization:
A complex of lower respiratory  events is defined as at least two of the following:
Shortness of breath
Sputum production (volume)
Change in sputum color

Exacerbation ”will be decided by  the investigator based on clinical judgment.
Exacerbations will be classified as follows:
Moderate: patient receiving an exacerbation -related prescription of oral corticosteroids
and/ or antibiotic not requiring hospitaliz ation.
Severe: COPD -related hospitali zation
If a patient experiences a moderate, or severe COPD exacerbation, thepatient will be

5.6 OTHER ASSESSMENTS
Body Plethysmography
Patients participating in this optional trial procedure will have to sign a separate informed 
consent.  Relative lung volumes can be measured by  spirometry .  The absolute volumes of air 
in the lung can be measured b y bod y pleth ysmography , where the residual volume, functional 
residual capacit y, and total lung capacity can be determined.
The site’ s own equipment will be used for the body  plethy smograph y measurements. The 
volume -constant bod y plethysmograph y devices and their use, including daily  calibration, 
must meet ATS/ERS criteria [R08-1121; R98- 1487].  Body  plethy smography  will be 
conducted with the patient in a seated position and it is preferable that the same trained 
individual performs the measurements for a given patient. The bod y plethysmograph y 
measurements for assessment of FRC, total lung c apacit y (TLC ), Residual Volume ( RV)and 
IC should be performed as linked maneuver (i.e. without the patient coming off the 
mouthpiece prior to the completion of the 
maneuver; refer to Appendix 10.1 ) and to the bod y 
pleth ysmograph y manual in the I SF.

volume of gas present in the lung and airway s at the average end -expiratory  level. At least 
three technicall y acceptable FRC values should be obtained which agree within 5% (i.e. the 
difference between the highest and the lowest value divided by  the mean is smaller or equal 
to 0.05).  If this repeatability  is not accomplished, i.e. the observed deviation is larger, 
additional values should be obtained until the repeatability  criterion is achieved or a 
maximum of six efforts have been performed.  If repeatability  is not accomplished after the 
maximum of six efforts, no more efforts should be performed and mean FRC data will be 
regarded as accep table, as long as they  fulfill technical satisfactory  quality  criteria.  All 
acceptable efforts must be used for calculation of mean values of FRC (and ERV), and 
exclusion of tests for the sake of achieving repe atability  is not permitted. The mean FRC 
value should be reported.  L inked to technicall y acceptable ERV and Inspiratory  Vital 
Capacity  (IVC)maneuver , mean FRC value is used for calculating the RV and TLC.
Please refer to Appendix 10.1 and to the body  plethy smograph y manual in the I SF for further 
details in calculation of Resid ual Volume (RV), TL Cand Inspiratory  Capacity  (IC).
The 24-hour clock time of the first maneuver for each body  plethy smography  measurement

activities and clock of body  plethy smograph y system should be sy nchronized.
5.7 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS
Spirometry
Pulmonary  function tests are a validated and well established meas urement tool for lung
function testing. Pulmonary  function tests will be conducted at clinic visits using
standardiz ed spirometry  equipment. FEV 1is a standard measurement for the assessment of
lung function.
Peak inspiratory flow rate measurements
The is a hand held device to measure PIFR.  It is commonly  used in 
patients diagnosed with lung diseases like COPD and asthma.  Clinicians use this device to 
train the patients on the correct inspiratory technique to be used when inhaling the
medications from the device the patient will use to take the prescribed medication. 
is calibrated by the manufacturer to ensure accuracy .  Each patient will be 
provided an and a sufficient quantity  of disposable mouthp
ieces for 
daily  use.
Body Plethysmography
Pathology  of COPD is not only  characterized by progression in airflow limitation but also by  
progressive destruction of supporting tissues and elastin fibers of the lung. This results in 
progressive air trapping distally  with increased RV, FRC and TLC and a decrease in IC.  
Hence ,evaluation of static lung volumes (such as FRC, TL C, RV and I C) using body

6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECT ED VISITS
6.2.1 Screening period
To keep the number o f screen failures as low as possible, patients should be very  carefull y 
selected for this trial. Therefore, investigators should make a preliminary  check of major 
inclusion and exclusion criteria when considering patients for enrol lment in the trial.
Patient number s will be assigned in the IRT s ystem an d transferred toEDC, thereby  creating 
the subject in EDC.   Details of an y patient who is screened for the trial but is found to be 
ineligible must be entered in the e nroll
ment log and documented in the eCRF.
Notrial procedures should be performed until the patient has consented to take part in the 
trial.  Each patient will b e assigned a unique patient number and enrol lment will be recorded.
Baseline conditions, medical history , and eligibility  criteria will be assessed at visit 1 .  
Concomitant therap y and AE (if an y) will be r ecorded.  At the conclusion of v isit 1, patients 
should receive instructions on procedures to be followed during the screening period.
If the patient is expected to meet all the eligibility  criteria, r andomizatio n visit (visit 2) will 
be scheduled.  Rescue medication (salbutamol) will be dispensed with instructions for use.
Patientswill receive the to measure the PIFR at home during the 
screening period.  Patient will also receive a paper diary  with instructions on how to record 
the PIFR obtained from the   Patients will c omplete the PIFR 
measurements each evening.  The PIFR measurements will be done in triplicate at the 
med/low resistance level .  Patients should be reminded that they  can take breaks in between 
measurements ,if needed.  Adequate training should be provided to the patients before they  
leave after the completion of the screening visit.  Patient will be asked to bring the device to 
each clinic visit.
PIFR measurements obtained at the screening visit must not be used for stratification at the 
randomization visit. PI FR value is not an eligibility  criteria.  However, there is cap of 
approximately  100 patients in each strata ( section 
3.1).  Once the cap in a particular strata is 
reached, additional patients cannot be randomized in this strata.  Once a cap in a particular 
strata is reached, PIFR values at the screening visit will be used to determine eligibility  for 
the study .  If th e PIFR value obtained at the screening visit will make the patient eligible for 
the strata that is closed, patient will be screen failed at the screening visit.
Screening period may  be extended by  two weeks for administrative reasons after consultation 
with the Clinical Trial Manager.  Total screening period should not exceed 4 weeks 
(informed consent to randomization) unless written approval is obtained from the Clinical

necessary , test samples should be drawn and sent to the cen tral laboratory . 
Discontinuation during the screening period
Ifpatients discontinue from the study  during the screening period, no additional clinic visits 
are required, and they  will be marked as screen failures.
If there is an y indication during the screening period that the patient is not stable enough to 
complete the trial or that the patient will be non- compliant with the trial medication or 
restrictions, the patien t should not be randomized, and should be screen failed.
Rescreening and retesting
Patients may be rescreened once with approval from the sponsor .  This includes p atients who 
met all the inclusion criteria but were screen failed due to acute medical conditions that have 
since been resolved or those who were screen failed for ad ministrative reason s (e.g., extende d 
travel, life events).
If the investigator believes that an ineligible lab test result is the result of an error or
e
xtenuating circumstance, then that lab test can be retested once without the patient having   
to be rescreened.
6.2.2 Treatment period
Patients who meet all the protocol criteria will be randomized at visit 2.  After randomization, 
patients will sta rt the 4-week treatment period.  All visits during the treatment period should 
preferabl y be on the same day  of the week.   Procedures to be completed at each visit can be 
found in the Flow Chart .
At the randomization visit (v isit 2), patients will be adequatel y trained to use the Respimat®
inhaler.  Patients will inhale the study  medication in the mornings.  Medication should be
taken approximately  on the same time of the day  during the 28 -day treatment period.  Site 
should ensure patient has adequate suppl y of stud y medication at visit 3. Patients should be 
instructed not to take their dose of stud y medication at home on the day of visits 3 and 4.
Investigator should ensure that patient has adequate supply  of rescue medication for the 
treatment period.  The intake of rescue medication (number of puffs) will not be collected.
PIFR measurements will be done at home (evenings) by the patient during the treatment 
period.  Measurements will be completed and readings will be recorded in the paper diary  as 
described in Section 6.2.1 .
At the beginning of each visit, the investigator and site personnel should ensure the 
well-being of the patient, and complete the following:
•Any adverse events and changes in concomitant therapies will be recorded.

• Before dosing with trial medication site personnel should ensure that the patient knows 
how to inhale properl y from the R espimat®Inhaler .
•At the close of each visit during treatment period, the investigator and site personnel 
should ensure that the patient is provided with all instructions for the next visit.
• Patient will be instructed at each visit to bring all rescue medication to the site.
• Patient will be instructed to bring the stud y medicati on (both inhalers including the 
reserve) at visits 3 and 4.
Unscheduled clinic visits may  be arranged if necessary  and the procedures completed during 
the unscheduled visit will depend on the circumstances under which the visit was scheduled, 
and will be at the discretion of the investigator.
After completion of the treatment phase (visit 4), all patients will enter the 3- week follow -up 
period.
Discontinuat ion during the treatment period
If patients discontinue from the s tudy during the treatment period for an y reason, study  drug 
should be stopped, and the patient will complete the EOT visit (visit 4) ,and thefollow -
up 
visit by telephone should be scheduled 3 weeks after t he last dose of stud y drug.  The 
investigator may  schedule the follow -up visit as a clinic visit if deemed necessary .
6.2.3 Follow -upperiod and trialcompletion
The three -week follow -up period ends with a visit by  telephone.  Procedures to be completed 
at the follow -up visit can be found in the Flow Chart .  Patients will not do the PIFR 
measur ements at home during the follow -up period.  Adverse events andconcomitant 
therapies will be reviewed and recorded .  At the end of this follow - upvisit,patient should be 
advised to continue with their regular COPD medi cation.

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
Design
This is a randomi zed, double -blind, placebo -controlled , multicenter, parallel group , study  
designed to assess efficacy  of tiotropium +olodaterol delivered b y Respimat®on FEV 1
AUC 0-3hand trough FEV 1in patients with moderate to severe COPD and in the subgroups of 
patients with peak inspiratory  flow rate less than and greater than or equal to 60 L /min.
Objective
The primary  objective of the trial is to describe the efficacy  of inhaled tiotropium + 
olodaterol via Respimat®on lung function i n patients with moderate to severe COPD and in 
the subgroups of patients with optimal and a sub -optimal PIFR.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNA TIVE HYPOTHESES
The following h ypotheses will be tested in the study on the primary  and key secondary  
endpoints . Each h ypotheses will be tested in hierarchical order at 5% level of significance 
(two-sided) to protect the overall ty pe I error at 5% (two- sided). The baseline value will be 
the measurement made prior to the first dosing at Visit 2.

Each of the tests will only  be considered confirmatory  if all previous tests are successful, 
i.e.the hy potheses tests were significant at 2 -sided 5% level and the treatment effect favo red 
tiotropium +olodaterol over placebo in each PIFR subgroup . 
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
The efficacy anal ysis will be performed in all randomized patients who were documented to 
have received an y dose of trial medication and who have both baseline and any evaluable 
post-baseline measurement for at least one of the efficacy  endpoints. This set will be called 
Full Anal ysis Set (FAS). The FAS definition will be fully  specified or updated in the trial 
statistical analy sis plan ( TSAP ).
Forefficacy  and safet y analyses, patients will be anal ysed according to their planned 
treatment group.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
The primary  endpoint will be anal ysed using a nANCOVA model including the fixed, 
categorical ef fect of treatment and the fixed co ntinuous effe ctof baseline .
Significance tests will be based on adjusted means using a two- sided α = 0.05 (two- sided 
95% confidence intervals).
The primary  anal ysis will be performed on the FAS within the optimal and sub -optimal PI FR 
groups, respectively . Patients will be anal ysed according to the PIFR stratum to which the y 
belong (regardless of an y mis assignment to treatment based on identification of the wrong 
stratum), as such an error occurs before randomiz ation and is therefore consistent with 
regulatory  guidance.
To assess the homogeneity
 of the treatment effect on the primary  endpoint across the levels 
of PIFR subgroups , the same ANCOVA model as in the primary  anal ysiswill be fitted in the 
overall population but replacing the treatment term by  a treatment -by-PIFR subgroup term. A

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(17.0)/Saved on18Mar 2019descriptive p- value of treatment effect homogeneity  at week 4 will be calculated. No overall 
treatment effect will be estimated from this model as it is not interpretable.
Similarly , the same ANCOVA model as in the primary  anal ysis will be fitted in the overall 
population but replacing the treatment term b y a treatment -by-continuous baseline PIFR term. 
A descriptive p
-value of treatment effect homogeneity  at week 4 will be calculated. No 
overall treatment effect will be estimated from this model as it is not interpretable.
The results of the anal ysis of the primary  endpoints for tiotropium +olodaterol FDC within 
the optimal and sub- optimal PIFR groups will be presented in a forest plo t and the treatment 
byPIFRsubgroup interaction p-value will be provided. Sensitivity  anal ysis will be performed 
by including additional covariates such as severity, gender and age in the model to adjust for 
potential differences in prognostic factors bet ween sub
-optimal and optimal PIFR subgroups.
7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
The key secondary  endpoint will be analy sed using the restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML ) based approach using a mixed model with repeated measurements (MMRM) .The 
analysis will be performed on the FAS within the optimal and sub optimal PIFR groups, 
respectivel y.
The anal ysis will includ e the fixed, categorical effect of treatment at each visit 
and the fixed 
continuous effect of baseline at each visit. Visits will be treated as repe ated measures with an 
unstructured covariance structure used to model the within- patient measurements.
The Kenward- Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom 
and adjust standard errors. Significance tests will be based on least-squares means using a 
two-sided α = 0.05 (two -sided 95% confidence intervals).
A select edset of anal yses as that of the primary  endpoint will be performed on the key 
secondary  endpoint as well.
7.3.4 S afety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All 
adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP , a period of 
21days after the last dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the treatment period for 
evaluation. All randomized patients who have taken at least one dose of study  drug (i.e., the

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(17.0)/Saved on18Mar 2019treated set) will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safety  anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end 
of the residual effect period will be considered ‘treatment-emergent’. The residual effect 
period is defined as 21 days. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate
under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment- emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current ve rsion of MedDRA .
All treated patient s will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned.
Laboratory  data will be analy sedboth quantitatively  as well as qu alitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory
 data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be summariz ed. 
Treatment groups will be compared descriptivel y with r egard to distribution parameters as 
well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patient s with abnormal values or clinicall y 
relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end -of-trialevaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings befo re start of treatment.
7.3.5 Interim Analyses
An interim anal ysis is not planned in this clinical trial .
7.4 HANDLING OF MISS ING DATA
Missing completel y at random is assumed for the primary endpoint as very little missing data 
is expected and no imputation will be performed. The REML -based MMRM model described 
in section 7.3.2 will handle missing data due to early  drop outs or missing data in between 
visits which are assumed to be missing at random. Additional details on the imputation of 
missing data will be specified in the TSAP prior to unblinding.
7.5 R ANDOMIZ ATION
Approximatel y 200 p atients will be randomiz ed in blocks to double -blind treatment stratified 
by PIFR optimal and sub- optimal subgroups Approximately  equal numbers of patients will be 
randomiz ed to each treatment group (50 in tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat®and 50 in
placebo Respimat®for each PIFR sub group) . BI will arrange for the randomi zation and the 
packaging and labelling of trialmedication. The randomi zation list will be generated using a 
validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo -random number generator so that the resulting 
treatment will be both reproducible and non -predictable. The block size will be documented 
in the C linical Trial Report . Access to the codes wil l be controlled and documented .

From previous studies, an approp riate estimate of the standard deviation (SD) for change 
from baseline in FEV 1AUC 0-3h(Δ FEV 1AUC 0-3h) and trough FEV 1(ΔTFEV 1)is 210 mL 
(c02098902-03, c02037872 -05). Based on an assumed treatment difference of 260ml in 
ΔFEV 1AUC 0-3hand 140 ml in ΔTFEV 1between tiotropium +olodaterol Respimat®and 
placebo Respimat®, two- sided alpha of 0.05 and SD of 210 ml, a total of 98 patients will 
provide 99% p ower within the optimal and sub- optimal PI FR subpopulations for FEV 1. 
AUC 0-3hand 90% power for trough FEV 1.The results of power c alculations are shown in 
Table s 7.6: 1and 7.6: 2.  From previous studies ( c02098902 -03, c02037872 - 05), the 
discontinuation rate is assumed to be low within the first 2 -4 weeks.
Therefore, a sample size of 200 patients overall with 1:1 randomiz ation ratio and 100 within 
each subpopulation (100 in optimal PIFR and 100 in sub- optimal PIFR ) will provide 
adequate power to detect a treatment difference of 260 ml for FEV 1AUC 0-3handto detect a 
treatment difference of 140 ml for trough FEV 1.

A risk- based approach isused for trialqualit y management . It is initiated by the assessment 
of critical data and processes fortrial subject protection and reliabilit y of the results as well as 
identification and assessment of associated risks.   An Integrated Qualit y and Risk 
Management Plan documents the rationale and strategies for risk management during trial 
conduct including monitoring approaches, vendor management and other processes focusing 
onareas of greatest risk .
Continuous risk review and assessment may lead to adjustments in trial conduct, trial design 
or monitoring approaches. 
A qu ality assurance audit/inspection of this trialmay be conducted b y the sponsor ,sponsor ’s 
designees ,or by IRB /IECor by  regulatory  authorities. The quality  assurance auditor will 
have access to all medical records, the investigator ’s trial-related files and correspondence, 
and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial .
8.3 RECORDS
Electronic C RFsfor individual patient s will be provided by  the 
sponsor . See section 4.1.5 .2
for rules about emergency  code breaks. For drug accountability , refer to section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory  requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trialrecords that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trialpatient . Source data as well as reported 
data should follow the “ Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate
(ALCOA )principles” and be attrib utable, legible, contemporaneous, original and accurate. 
Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).   Data reported on the eCRF must be 
consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained.
The current medical history  of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trialand the 
investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case ,the investigator must make every attempt to retrieve previou s 
medical records .
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action e.g. re -training must be 
documented in the patient file.

10.1 BODY PLETHYSMOGR APHY MEASUREMENT TEC HNIQUE
Detailed instructions on the procedures will be provided in a body plethysmograph y manual 
in the I SF.  The body  plethy smograph y procedures will be performed in “linked” maneuver, 
i.e. without the patient coming off the mouthpiece prior to the completion of the maneuver s.
Quiet tidal volume breathing, ensuring stable End- expiratory  Lung Volume (EELV), 
followed b y
Shutter closing at EELV and panting with hands over cheeks, followed b y
Opening of the shutter and return to quiet tidal breathing (ensuring stable EEL Vs, 
which are at the same position as those prior to shutter closing), followed by
An ERV maneuver , followed b y a slow IVC maneuver .
Note:
The term “bod y pleth ysmograph y” is being used to specificall y refer to body 
plethy smograph y system procedures that are performed with sy stem´s door closed.
Spirometry  (FEV 1, FVC) will not be performed using the bod y pleth ysmography  system, but 
rather with a stand -alone  spirometer supplied by  a vendor designated b y 
the sponsor.
Calculation of RV, TLC and IC:
Residual Volume (RV) is the volume of gas remaining in the lung at the end of a full 
expiration. The reported value for RV is the rep orted value for FRC minus the mean of 
technicall y acceptable ERV measurements, linked to technicall y acceptable FRC 
determinations (a maximum of six efforts).
Total Lung Capacity (TLC) is the volume of gas in the lung at the end of a full inspiration.  
The reported value of TLC is the reported value for RV plus the largest of the technically  
acceptable IVCs. A good quality  IVC is thus required for the calculation of TL C. For IVC, 
the two best efforts (of at least three) MUST NOT differ b y more than 150 mL .If 
repeatability  is not achieved after three efforts, additional efforts up to a maximum of six 
need to be performed.
Inspiratory Capacity (IC) is the maximal volume which can be inspired from FRC. I C is 
calculated for each individual effort as the diffe rence between IVC and ERV. At least three 
efforts must be performed, and the individual efforts must lie within ±6% of their mean. If 
repeatability  is not achieved after three efforts, additional efforts of up to a maximum of six 
need to be performed.

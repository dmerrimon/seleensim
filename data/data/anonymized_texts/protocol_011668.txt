CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 16 of 146  1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
 Synopsis 
Protocol Title:  A Multi-arm, Phase II, Open-La bel, Multicentre Study to Assess  the 
Preliminary Efficacy of RXC004 i n Monotherapy and in Combinatio n with Nivolumab, in 
Patients with Ring Finger Pr otein 43 (RNF43) or R-spondin (RSPO ) Aberrated, Metastatic, 
Microsatellite Stable , Colorectal Cancer who have Progressed fo llowing Therapy with Current 
Standard of Care (PORCUPINE study)
Short Title:  Phase II Study to Assess Efficac y of RXC004 +/- Nivolumab in R NF43/RSPO 
Aberrated mCRC MSS after Progression on SoC.   
Rationale: The Wnt signalling pathway plays a n important role in tumourige nesis and has been shown to 
be elevated in both ring finge r protein 43 (RNF43) and R-Spondi n (RSPO) aberrated 
colorectal cancer (CRC).  There is also evidence that Wnt signa lling may have a role in 
enabling cancers to avoid immunosur veillance and hence resistan ce to some immunotherapies.  
RXC004 is a small molecule porcupi ne (PORCN) inhibitor which re duces Wnt signalling and 
therefore may offer an opportun ity to deliver clin ical benefit by both a direct tumour targeting 
effect in genetically selecte d patients and by c onverting the t umour microenvironment from an 
immune “cold” to an immune “hot” signature making the tumour se nsitive to anti-PD1/PD-L1 
inhibition. 
The PORCUPINE study will therefor e evaluate RXC004 as monothera py and in combination 
with anti-PD1 (nivolumab) in ! 2
ndline metastatic MSS colorect al cancer patients who have 
either a RNF43 LoF mutation or a  RSPO fusion/translocation.

Secondary  
To further assess the preliminary efficacy of RXC004 monotherapy and RXC004 + nivolumab  % change in the sum of target lesions, duration of response (DoR), PFS, ORR (monotherapy) and DCR (combination) using investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1 and OS. 
To assess the PK of RXC004 as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab  Maximum plasma concentration (C
max) after 
Dose 1, C max at steady state, minimum observed 
plasma concentration (C min) at steady state as 
well as other relevant parameters ( e.g. t max, t½, 
λz, AUC 0-∞, CL/F, and Vz/F).    
To assess the safety and tolerability profile of 
RXC004 monotherapy and RXC004 + nivolumab combination Incidence of AEs , SAEs, dose reductions, 
interruptions and discontinuations, and assessment of dysgeusia.

ORR objective response rate; OS Overall survival; PFS progression free survival; RNF43 Ring finger 43; RSPO R -Spondin; 
RXC004 Porcupine inhibitor  
 
Disclosure Statement : This is a n open label study two  Arms  A & B  
Number of Participants:  
Approximately  pa tients will be enrolled  in total to provide 20 evaluable patients in each 
arm. Patients who progress on Arm A will have the opportunity to cross over into the 
combination arm, once this is open to recruitment.  
Pre-screened for MSS status, RNF43 loss of 
function mutations and RSPO fusions Estimated  p  patients

Once Arm B is opened, patients who are eligible for both Arm A and Arm B will be randomised 2:1 to Arm B: Arm A in an open -label manner  on Day 1 . Randomisation will be stratified by genetic 
alteration (RNF43, RSPO).  
a  A baseline (pre- first dose IP) biopsy is a mandatory requirement, except in exceptional circumstances where biopsy is not technically feasibl e. All patients without a baseline sample must be 
approved by Sponsor before starting study treatment.  The baseline   can be a ‘fresh newly acquired’ biopsy or an   (  (preferably from the same organ site that ‘on 
treatment’ biopsy will be taken) and taken after completion of all pr ri io or r s  st ta an nd da ar rd d  o of f c  care treatments. In exceptional circumstances s  w wh he er re e b  ba as se el li in ne e b  biopsy cannot be scheduled before C0D1, the 
procedure may be performed before C1D1 after a minimum of 4 days washout from C0D1. A second ‘on treatment’ biopsy at Cycle 1 Day 15 (+/ - 1 day), is also mandatory providing that 
investigator judges the second biopsy to be technically and clin ically feasible.  The Cycle 1 Day 15 biopsy should be collected post -dose and the time of collection should be accurately recorded.  
RECIST 1.1 target lesions should not be chosen for biopsies.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  32 of 146  2 INTRODUCTION 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for approximately 10% of all cancer related deaths 
world wide ( Bray et al 2018 ).  Approximately 20- 25% of newly diagnosed CRC is metastatic 
at presentation  and approximately 70% will eventually develop metastases ( Ansa et al 2018, 
SEER cancer stats review 2015) . 
Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is based on several factors including patient factors (e.g. performance status, age), treatment choice factors (e.g.  QoL, toxicity profile), tumour 
molecular characteristics   an  and tumour clinical characteristics (tumour burden 
and biology, related symptoms).  Expert treatment guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer include those by the European society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) ( Van Cutsem et al 
2016) and the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (NCCN clinical 
practice guidelines V3. 2020). 
According to the U.S. NCCN guidelines, first line treatment choice is based primarily on the 
patient’s performance status and ability to tolerate intensive versus non- intensive treatment.  
Typically , 1
st line treatment encompasses doublet or triplet chemotherapy with or without 
targeted therapy with anti- VEGF or anti -EGFR agents. In patients with   
 wi  wild -type disease or with left -sided tumours, oxaliplatin or irinotecan -based doublet 
chemotherapy treatment (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI) in combination with an anti- EGFR  agent is 
recommended. In patients with  m  mutated tumours, oxaliplatin - or 
irinotecan -based doublet or triplet chemotherapy (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI/FOLFOXIRI) in 
combination with anti- VEGF treatment (bevacizumab) is recommended.  
In patients with poor per formance status or inability to tolerate intensive treatment, 1st line 
treatment is typically monotherapy chemotherapy with/without targeted treatment (anti-VEGF/EGFR) or targeted monotherapy or immunotherapy treatment. Treatment for 
patients with  w  wild -type disease includes cetuximab or panitumumab. 
Patients with  w  wild -type tumours may be offered 
Trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab or lapatinib. Patients with MSI- H disease are 
offered anti -PD1 second line  treatment.  
Second -line treatment is largely based on the 1
st line treatment offered to patients with those 
who received platinum- based 1st line treatment receiving irinotecan based 2nd line treatment 
and vice- versa.   Recommended third- line treatments include monotherapy treatment with 
irinotecan, regorafenib ( Grothey et al 2013) or TAS -102 (Trifluridine in combination with 
tipiracil) ( Mayer et al 2015 ). 
The median survival of patients with metastatic CRC is 30 months ( Van Cutsem et al 2016).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 33 of 146  approximately 15% and 40% respectively (Cao et al 2020).  There  is therefore still a 
significant unmet medical need f or additional treatment options  for metastatic CRC.
 Study Rationale 
The Wnt signalling pathway plays a n important role in tumourige nesis and has been shown to 
be elevated in both ring finge r protein 43 (RNF43) and R-Spondi n (RSPO) aberrated CRC.  
There is also evidence that Wnt  signalling may ha ve a role in e nabling cancers to avoid 
immunosurveillance and hence resi stance to some immunotherapies .  
Currently there remains a major  unmet medical ne ed in metastati c colorectal cancer. 
Immunotherapy with ant i-PD1 has not demonstr ated any efficacy i n Microsatellite stable 
(MSS) colorectal cancer, which represents approximately 85% of colorectal cancer. 
RXC004 may offer an opportunit y to deliver clinical benefit by both a direct tumour targeting 
effect (in patients with RNF43 LoF  mutations or RSPO fusion/tra nslocation) and an immune-
oncology effect, by converting the tum our microenvironment from  an immune “cold” to an 
immune “hot” signature, making the  tumour sensitive to anti-PD1 /PD-L1 inhibition. This 
immune effect may be seen in ge netically unselected patients as  the target cells are the 
immune cells and not the tum our cells themselves. 
RXC004 will therefore be evaluated in ! 2nd line metastatic MSS colorectal cancer patients, 
who have either a RNF43 LoF muta tion or a RSPO fusion/transloca tion. 
 Background 
2.2.1 Wnt signalling in colorectal cancer 
The Wnt signaling pathway plays a n important role in tumourigen esis (Zhan et al 2016) and in 
immune evasion (Goldsb erry et al 2019) in many common cancers.  The Wnt pathway is 
initiated by the binding of Wnt glyc oproteins to Frizzled (Fz) and low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein (LRP)  5 or 6 co-receptors, resulting i n the phosphorylation of 
Dishevelled (DSH) which in turn r ecruits a destruction complex comprising axin, 
adenomatous polyposis coli (APC ) and glycogen synt hase kinase 3 ȕGSK3ȕto the cell 
membrane.  The movement of the se proteins inhibits the phosphor ylation of ȕ-catenin 
allowing ȕ-catenin to accumulate near the  cell nucleus and induces the tr anscription of target 
genes. 
RNF43 is an integral membrane  E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes  degradation of Fz receptors.  
Loss of function (LoF) RNF43 mut ations have been described in 3 -13% of all colorectal 
cancers (cBioPortal for cancer  genomics, Matsumoto et al 2020, Cerami et al 2012).  These 
LoF RNF43 mutations lead to incr eased Fz receptors at the cell surface and hence elevated 
Wnt signaling. 
RSPOs are secreted proteins tha t act as ligands for the LRP 4/5 /6 receptors. RSPO binding to 
Clinic al Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  34 of 146  LRPs potentiates Wnt signaling by sequestering RNF43, resulting in the accumulation of 
Fz/LRP -receptor complexes at the cell membrane ( De Lau et al  2014 and Seshagiri et al 
2012).  Chromosome rearrangements of RSP O2 and RSPO3 have been described in 
approximately 5% of CRC ( Seshagiri et al 2012, Shinmura et al 2014, Kleeman et al 2019 ).  
The rearrangements result in fusion transcripts that drive marked overexpression of the RSPO gene.  
PORCN  is a membrane-bound protein- serine O -palmitoleoyltransferase which is required for  
the acetylation, activation and secretion of Wnt ligands.  RXC004 inhibits PORCN leading to 
reduced  canonical and non- canonical Wnt signalling .  Blocking Wnt signalling with PORCN 
inhibitors has been shown to suppress the growth of RNF43  and RSPO aberrated CRC cancers 
in preclinical models ( Madan et al 2016 and Koo et al 2015).   
2.2.2 Role of Wnt signalling in the immune response to cancer 
Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies such as nivolumab have been shown to improve survival in 
metastatic mis -match repair deficient (dMMR) and MSI -H CRC, but patients with MSS CRC 
are largely unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment ( Overman et al 2017, Le et 
al 2015).  
There is strong scientific rationale, from both preclinical and clinical studies, that Wnt pathway activity drives the immune evasion of tumours ( Spranger and Gajewski 2018, Wang 
et al 2018 and Luke et al 2019).  In order for immune cells to recognize cancer cells, they must first infiltrate the tumour and then remain activated.  Wnt pathway activated tumours 
have been shown to be poorly infiltrated by immune cells ( Grasso et al 2018 ) and 
pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling promotes cytotoxic T cell infiltration sensitizing 
cancer cells to PD -1 inhibitors (Feng et al 2019, Xiao et al 2018). 
There are currently a number of ongoing clinical trials investigating Porcupine inhibitors 
combine
d with  PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, in genetically unselected patients with advanced 
tumours (e.g. [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
The results from a n ongoing Pha se 1 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of the small molecule PORCN 
inhibitor WNT974, indicated WNT974 monotherapy had a manageable safety profile and the potential for antitumor activity in a molecularly selected population ( Janku et al 2015, Rodon 
et al 2021).  Preliminary data from the dose escalation part of the study, in which patients with advanced solid tumours received WNT974 in combination with the anti- PD-1 monoclonal 
antibody, spartalizumab have been reported ( Janku et al 2020).  Of 27 enrolled patients (as of 
02 September 2019), 63% had received prior anti- PD-1 therapy.  One patient (4%) had a 
partial response (PR), 11 (41%) had stable disease (SD), 13 (48%) had progressive disease, 
and response was unknown in 2 patients.  The combination of WNT974 + spartalizumab was 
reported as being well tolerated.  Dose- limiting toxicities were reported in 2 patients: Grade 2

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  35 of 146  spinal compression fracture that occurred in the setting of trauma and Grade 3 arthralgia. The 
most common treatment-related AE was hypothyroidism (19%).  Four patients (15%) had 7 suspected -related Grade 3/4 AEs (arthralgia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, diabetic 
ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and maculopapular rash)..  
2.2.3 RXC004 
RXC004 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Porcupine (PORCN) that is required for the post- translational modification of all Wnt ligands.  Inhibition of PORCN 
reduces both Wnt secretion and downstream canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling.  RXC004 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy in preclinical models with RNF43 loss of function mutations and RSPO fusions. This data supports the genetic selection of patients 
with MSS CRC with upstream Wnt pathway aberrations such as RNF43 mutation and RSPO 
fusions. RXC004 was not effective in 3 human cancer cell lines with downstream Wnt 
pathway mutations such as  m  mutations, however there is evidence to  suggest that patients 
with  m  mutated tumours may also benefit from a reduction in ligand drive because of 
PORCN inhibition.  It has been reported that many colorectal cancer cell lines with mutations 
in  r  remain dependent on Wnt ligands ( Voloshenenko et al 2013) and in these Wnt 
dependent cell lines, PORCN inhibition with a small molecule in resulted in decreased pathway activation, anti- proliferative effects and reduced cell viability.   Taken together these 
data suggest patients with genetically selected cancers bearing  downstream mutations in the 
Wnt pathway, may also receive some therapeutic benefit from treatment with RXC004 
RXC004 has demonstrated an immune stimulant effect and efficacy in monotherapy and in 
combination with anti-PD1 in mouse syngeneic models, supporting testing of combination of 
RXC004 with nivolumab in MSS CRC patients.  
RXC004 is being assessed in the Phase 1 RXC004/0001 trial (NCT 03447470) as monotherapy 
and also in combination with the anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab, for safety and 
tolerability  in advanced malignancies.   RXC004 monotherapy at doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 mg, 
3.0 mg  and 10 mg have been evaluated to date. RXC004 at doses of 1.0 and 1.5 mg has  been 
evaluated in combination with nivolumab. 
In addition, RXC004 is being tested as monotherapy in patients with RNF43 mutated 
pancreatic cancer and biliary tract cancers, and is planned to be tested in combination with pembrolizumab in biliary tract cancers, following SOC therapies, in an ongoing Phase 2 study 
RXC004/0003. 
A detai led description of the chemistry, pharmacology, and pre- clinical efficacy, and safety of  
RXC004 is provided in the RXC004 Investigator’s Brochure As of the 30 July 2021 a total of 25 patients have been dosed with RXC004 monotherapy in

A detailed descripti on of the Phase 1 study r esults is provided  in Section 4.4.1.   
2.2.4 Nivolumab 
Nivolumab is a human immunoglobuli n G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibo dy that binds to the 
programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1 ) receptor.  Binding of the PD -1 ligands, PD-L1 and 
PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor f ound on T cells, inhibits T-cell p roliferation and cytokine 
production. Upregulation  of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumours  and signaling through this 
pathway can contribute to inhib ition of active T-cell immune su rveillance of tumours. 
Nivolumab blocks the interacti on of PD-L1 and PD-L2 with the PD -1 receptor, releasing the 
inhibition of the immune respons e and hence generating an anti- tumour immune response.  
Nivolumab has been approved in t he European Union (EU) for the treatment of multiple 
cancers including metastatic me lanoma, metastatic non-small cel l lung cancer, advanced renal 
cell carcinoma, metastatic or rec urrent squamous cell head and neck cancer, metastatic 
urothelial cancer, unresectable , recurrent or metastatic oesoph ageal squamous cell carcinoma 
and classical Hodgkin lymphomas tha t have progressed or recurre d after an autologous stem 
cell transplant.  Nivolumab has also been approved by the US Fo od and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the treatment of chemoresistant microsatellite instab ility-high (MSI-H) or 
mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). 
A detailed descripti on of the chemistry, pha rmacology, efficacy , and safety of nivolumab is 
provided in the nivolumab pr escribing information. 
 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
2.3.1 RXC004 risks 
2.3.1.1  Risks associated with ta rgeting the Wnt pathway 
The principal on-target adverse events of significant interest known to occur with porcupine 
inhibition include decreases in bone density (including bone fr agility fractures) and loss of 
taste (dysgeusia).  Inhibiting t he Wnt pathway may also predisp ose to inflammation in the 
gastrointestinal tract because of  the role of Wnt in the immune  micro-environment.  
The safety profile of RXC004 is s imilar to that reported for tw o other Porcupine inhibitors in 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  37 of 146  clinical trials: ETC -159 and WNT974.  Preliminary data from 16 patients in the ongoing 
Phase 1a/b, first in human (FIH), dose escalation study of PORCN inhibitor, ETC-159, in 
advanced or metastatic solid tumo urs [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] were first reported in 2017. At that 
time, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 30  mg every other day, with dose limiting 
toxicities of compression fractures and hyperbilirubinemia.  Adverse events (>20%) included vomiting (32%), anorexia and fatigue (31%) dysgeusia and constipation (25%) Elevations of serum β -CTX, a marker of bone turnover, were observed ( Ng et al 2017). Subsequently, 
prophylactic denosumab was introduced during the first 2 cycles. Data from the completed Phase 1, open- label trial of WNT 974, administered in monotherapy have recently been 
published [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] ( Rodon et al 2021). In this study, 94 patients received oral 
WNT974 at doses of 5–30 mg once-daily, plus intermittent dosing schedules. AEs suspected 
to be related to study treatment were reported for 75 patients (80%), with the most common 
(≥20%) being dysgeusia (44 patients; 47%), decreased appetite (27 patients; 29%), and nausea (23 patients; 24%). Six patients (6.4%) experienced seven bone related disorders, five of which were suspected to be related to study treatment: osteoporosis, pathological fracture, 
osteopenia, and 2 Grade 3 spinal fractures.  
2.3.1.2 Risks of RXC004 associated adverse events  
As described in Section 4.4.1, RXC004 has been evaluated as a monotherapy in 25 patients in 
a phase 1 monotherapy dose- escalation trial at doses of 0.5–10 mg QD, in which doses of up 
to 2 mg QD were found to be tolerable and safe .  
At doses up to and including 2 mg QD, the most common treatment related AEs of any grade were fatigue (10/20 patients), nausea (7/20), anorexia (6/20), dysgeusia (6/20), and vomiting (4/20).  
Dysgeusia Events 
In the Phase 1 study, RXC004- related dysgeusia was observed in 5 out of 20 patients who 
received doses of up to 2 mg QD, 3 out of 4 patients receiving 3  mg QD, and by the 1 patient 
who received 10 mg QD RXC004.   This study protocol includes an assessment for the further 
characterisation of this event and include guidance for the management of dysgeusia 
(Appendix I )  Guidance for dose modifications of RXC004 and nivolumab for all toxi cities 
are provided in Section 6.6.  
Colitis Events  
In the Phase 1 study, events of intestinal inflammation (colitis, enteritis or enterocolitis ) were 
observed in 4 patients who started treatment with RXC004 at doses of 3 mg QD or higher and 
3 were dose- limiting toxicities . CTCAE Grade 3 RXC004 related colitis occurred in the one 
patient who received 10 mg and CTCAE Grade 3 enteritis occurred in one patient who 
received RXC004 3 mg  QD. CTCAE Grade 2 colitis also developed in two more patients who 

Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  38 of 146  started treatment with 3  mg RXC004, both Grade 2 events presented during Cycle 2, 
Symptoms included abdominal pain, intermittent constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and/or 
vomiting. Blood and mucus in the stool were not apparent in any of the cases.  Symptoms were 
usually accompanied by, and preceded by, a raised CRP. In two patients, the event recurred after initially  responding to steroids, but responded again to further treatment.  
Colitis events were not  observed in any patients who commenced treatment with doses of 
RXC004 2 mg QD and lower, and the 3 mg QD dose gave a disproportionately high exposure 
compared to 2 mg QD. However, at the time of writing this protocol, one SAE of ileitis ha d 
been reported in this  Phase 2 study and, considering the known risk of colitis for patients 
receiving nivolumab, there is a potential risk  for colitis in patients receiving RXC004 as a 
monotherapy in Arm A and as an overlapping toxicity in patients who receive RXC004 in combination with nivolumab in Arm  B. 
Guidelines for the investigation and management of diarrhoea/colitis for RXC004 both as a 
monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab are provided in Appendix J . Guidance for 
dose modifications of RXC004 and nivolumab for all toxicities are provided in Section 6.6.  
Colitis events are also defined as an Adverse Event of Potential Interest (AEPI)  for RXC004, 
requiring additional details to be recorded on routine safety reporting.   
Bone Events  
Since Wnt inhibition both reduces bone formation and increases bone resorption, the 
concomitant use of the anti-resorbing agent, denosumab is expected to prevent drug-induced 
bone loss, and this has been a successful approach in the Phase 1 study, along with patient selection, and monitoring. Patients with high risk of bone fractures are excluded study protocols and participating patients will be monitored for bone turnover biomarkers and bone mineral density while on study.  
In this study, patients will receive prophylactic denosumab (120 mg s.c. once every month) 
along with Vitamin D3 and Calcium supplements (800 IU vitamin D3 daily [ Cholecalciferol ] 
and 1000-1500 mg calcium daily supplements) from the time of signing the ICF and throughout the study until discontinuation of RXC004.  
Guidance for dose modifications of RXC004 and nivolumab for all toxicities are provided in 
Section  6.6.  Bone toxicity events are defined as an AEPI  for RXC004, requiring additional 
details to be recorded on routine safety reporting.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  39 of 146  Assessment of p otential for other risks  
Potential for Drug -Drug Int eractions  with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
RXC004 has not shown the potential to induce or inhibit CYP enzymes or transporters at the 
dose to be investigated in this study but it is exclusively metabolised by CYP3A4 and as such 
has the potential to be a victim for drug-drug interactions with potent CYP inhibitors (which could increase levels of RXC004, leading to a higher risk of adverse events). As such, strong and moderate CYP3A4  inhibitors are contra indicated in this protocol (see Appendix E ). 
Patients with colorectal cancers commonly require co -medication with analgesics, antibiotics, 
anti-emetics and anti -depressant or anxiolytic drugs, some of which are CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
The table in Appendix E  highlights the CYP3A4 inhibitors which are also likely to be 
commonly used in colorectal cancer patients. These drugs should be avoided, and alternatives 
used wherever possible. If it is not possible to use an alternative (e.g. if a specific antibiotic or 
anti-fungal treatment is needed), RXC004 should be interrupted. 
Potential for QTc prolongation 
Based on preclinical data  [hERG assay, ECG monitoring in 28-day GLP toxicology studies], 
RXC004 is not considered to have a significant potential to prolong the QTc interval. RXC004 did not lead to cardiac adverse events including arrhythmias, or syncope in the Phase 1 study.  
Triplicate ECGs will be collected in this study and other studies of RXC004 so that the 
potential for QTc prolongation can be explored in future as part of a population PK analysis.  
Potential for an effect of food on RXC004 exposure 
It is not yet known whether food may increase or decrease the exposure of RXC004. Until 
such data are generated, RXC004 must be given in a fasted state, as described in Section 5.3.2, and this is explained to patients in the Information Sheet.  
Potential for risks in specific patient populations 
A preliminary analysis of data from the Phase 1 study showed no effect of age, sex, BMI or race on RXC004 pharmacokinetics.  
Pre-clinical developme nt showed that RXC004 is exclusively metabolised by CYP3A4 and 
there was no renal clearance of RXC004. However, there is currently no information on the 
clearance of potential human metabolites of RXC004. While data are limited, the study 
inclusion criteria will restrict the use of RXC004 to patients with adequate renal and hepatic function  
More detailed information about the known and potential risks of RXC004 may be found in 

Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  40 of 146  the most recent Investigator’s Brochure and Development Safety Update Report. 
In summary the pre -clinical information and emerging PK and safety profile has not identified 
any risks that would preclude investigation of RXC004 at a dose of 2 mg QD in the advanced 
cancer setting.  
2.3.2 Nivolumab Risks 
Checkpoint inhibitors including anti PD- 1, as well as antibodies directed against PDL -1 and 
CTLA -4, boost the endogenous immune responses directed against tumours.  Adverse events 
seen with checkpoint inhibitors are frequently due to immune mediated mechanisms and can 
occur in any organ system.  The adverse events known to occur with nivolumab treatment (as monotherapy and in combination with various agents) are well documented ( Haanen et al 
2017) and include gastrointestinal effects (e.g. diarrhoea or colitis), pneumonitis, hepatic events, skin rashes myocarditis and endocrinopathies (including hypo and hyper-thyroidism).   
The safety of nivolumab administered as a single agent or in combination wi th ipilimumab in 
patients with mCRC was evaluated in the CHECKMATE -142 study. ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The 
most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy were colitis/diarrhoea, hepatic events, abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, pyrexia, and dehydration. The most common adverse reactions for single agent nivolumab (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, 
musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, pruritus, nausea, rash, decreased appetite, and vomiting 
(Overman et al 2017).  
Immune mediated adverse events that can occur during treatment with nivolumab can be seen weeks or months after discontinuation of treatment. Symptoms of these events will be 
monitored throughout treatment (e.g. diarrhoea, rash, and neuropathy). Laboratory 
assessments will check for elevated liver enzymes, kidney and thyroid function, electrolytes, glucose and blood counts.  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and potential risks of 
nivolumab may be found in the nivolumab Package Insert . 
The safety profile of RXC004 in combination with nivolumab has not been fully characterized 
in patients . The toxicity profiles of RXC004 and nivolumab as monotherapy are largely 
non-overlapping apart from  gastrointestinal effects (diarrh oea/colitis ), which were observed at 
the 3  mg dose of RXC004 but not at doses up to and including doses of 2 mg .  The porcupine 
inhibitor WNT974 has been combined with an anti-PD1 in a phase 1 trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in 27 patients with metastatic solid tumours , most of whom (63% ) had received prior anti- PD1 
treatment. DLTs of Grade 2 spinal compression fracture (in the setting of trauma) and Grade 3 arthralgia were reported in 2 patients. The authors concluded that WNT974 + spartalizumab 
was well tolerated  (Janku et al 2020). The safety profile of RXC004 in combination with 

Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  41 of 146  nivolumab, while unknown, is expected to be similar to that of WNT974 in combination with 
spartalizumab.  
2.3.3 Benefit assessment 
This trial will evaluate RXC004 monotherapy and RXC004 in combination with nivolumab in Microsatellite Stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with upstream WNT 
pathway aberrations (RNF43 LoF mutations and RSPO fusions). RXC004 monotherapy may 
offer clinical benefit by both a direct tumour targeting mechanism and by an immune -oncology mechanism.  
Wnt pathway activated tumours have been shown to be poorly infiltrated by immune cells (Grasso et al 2018) and pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling promotes cytotoxic T cell 
infiltration, sensitizing cancer cells to PD -1 inhibitors ( Feng et al 2019, Xiao et al 2018).  
Thus, there is clear rationale for the combination of RXC004 with checkpoint inhibitors. 
The Phase 1 st udy of RXC004 enrolled unselected patients with advanced cancers with a 
median of 3 prior lines of treatment. Out of 18 RECIST- evaluable patients , 5 had stable 
disease, in one case lasting for up to 26 weeks. All five of these patients with stable disease 
had Wnt-ligand-dependent tumours, supporting the hypothesis that RXC004 will have clinical 
activity in selected tumours that are dependent on Wnt ligand signaling pathways. 
In the expansion cohort of the WNT 974 study ( Rodon et al 2021), stable disease was 
observed in 10 out of 28 patients, which was enriched in patients with RNF43 mutations.
  
WNT974 has also been combined with anti- PD1 (spartalizumab ) in an ongoing Phase 1 trial 
in 27 patients ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The combination was well tolerated with efficacy being 
observed in some patients (DCR of 41%) ( Janku et al 2020).   
In addition, in  house data with RXC004 in mouse syngeneic model s have demonstrated that 
RXC004 combined with anti-PD1 results in a more immunogenic tumour microenvironment.  
Currently the prognosis of previous ly treated MSS metastatic colorectal cancer patients is 
poor with current 3rd line standard of care agents (regorafenib and TAS-102) with a  response 
rate of <5%, median PFS and OS of approximately 2 and 6 months respectively and a DCR of 
approximately 40% ( Grothey et al 2013; Mayer et al 2015 ). MSS colorectal cancer represents 
approximately 85% of all colorectal cancer. Immunotherapy has, to-date, proved ineffective in MSS CRC with no efficacy observed with anti- PD1 treatment - in contrast to MSI- H CRC 
where anti -PD1 treatment is approved for use as a single agent.  
There is insufficient clinical data to reach a definitive conclusion about the efficacy of PORCN inhibitors or other treatments in genetically selected MSS CRC with RNF43 mutations and RSPO fusions. However, there is some preliminary evidence to suggest that 

Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  42 of 146  patients with RN F43 mutations have a poor prognosis compared to the general patient 
population with MSS CRC, ( Cerami et al  2012, Gao et al 2013) suggesting that alternative 
treatments are needed for this subset of patients.  
RXC004, both as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab in this genetically 
selected MSS metastatic colorectal cancer population has therefore the potential to demonstrate clinical benefit in this major patient population with a large unmet medical need.  
2.3.4 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion 
Considering the measures taken to minimise  risk to participants participating in this study, the 
potential risks identified in association with study treatment  seem justified by the anticipated 
benefits that may be afforded  to participants with RNF43 or RSPO aberrated MSS mCRC.

 Overall Design 
This is Phase II, open label, mu lticentre, multi-arm, study to evaluate the preli minary efficacy 
and safety of RXC004 as monothe rapy and in combination with niv olumab in patients with 
Ring finger protein 43 (RNF43) or  R-spondin (RSPO) aberrated, m icrosatellite stable (MSS), 
colorectal cancer (CRC), that have progressed following current  standard of care treatment. 
The study is composed of two a rms, RXC004 monotherapy (Arm A) a nd RXC004 in 
combination with nivolumab (Ar m B).  20 evaluable  patients will  be enrolled in Arm A and 
20 evaluable patients in Arm B. 
The study initially opened with A rm A; Arm B will be opened onc e a recommended Phase II 
dose (RP2D) for RXC004 in combi nation with nivolumab is establi shed in the Phase I dose 
escalation study (NCI 03447470).  A sa fety review of the combin ation data will  be conducted 
after   patients have receiv ed the combina tion of RXC004 and ni volumab for at least 1 cycle. 
Once Arm B is opened, patients w ho are eligible for both Arm A and Arm B will be 
randomised 2:1 to Arm B: Arm A i n an open-label ma nner. Randomi sation will be s tratified by 
genetic alterati on (RNF43 vs RSPO).
Patients in Arm A may be treat ed with RXC004 + nivolumab if the y have progressive disease 
on the 8-week scan, as long as the y are eligible for Arm B and have Sponsor approval. 
Patients who have undergone dose reduction during monotherapy c annot have the RXC004 
dose re-escalated if switchi ng to RXC004 + nivolumab combinatio n therapy. The RXC004 
dose must be discussed with the  Sponsor prior to starting combi nation therapy. 
The primary objectives of the st udy are to assess the prelimina ry efficacy of each treatment 
arm; RXC004 monotherapy and RXC 004+nivolumab based on an indivi dual patients best 
overall response.) Tumour asse ssment will be pe rformed by Inves tigators every 8 weeks 
± 1 week (relative to the date  of initiation of s tudy treatment ) for the first 56 weeks, followed 
by q12w weeks ± 1 until radiological  disease progression (as de fined by Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumours, ve rsion 1.1 [RECIST1.1]).  The prima ry efficacy endpoint for 
RXC004 monotherapy is disease cont rol rate (i.e. proportion of patients who achieve CR, PR 
or SD) and the primar y efficacy endpoint for RXC004 + nivolumab  is objective response rate.  
Following radiological progressi on, patients will be  followed-u p for safety and survival. 
The general study design i s summarized in Figure 1.  
 Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
The Wnt signaling pathway plays a n important role in tumourigen esis (Zhan et al 2016) and in 
immune evasion (Goldsb erry et al 2019) in many common cancers. RNF43 is an integral &&,
Clinical Study Protocol Final Version 7.0 Redx Pharma Plc 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 46 of 146  membrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that  promotes degradation of Fz re ceptors.  Loss of function 
(LoF) RNF43 mutations have be en described in 3-13% of all color ectal cancers (cBioPortal 
for cancer genomics, Matsumo to et al 2020, and Cerami et al 201 2).  These LoF RNF43 
mutations lead to increased Fz re ceptors at the cell surface an d hence elevated Wnt signaling. 
RSPOs are secreted proteins tha t act as ligands for the LRP 4/5 /6 receptors. RSPO binding to 
LRPs potentiates Wnt signaling by s equestering RNF43, resulting  in the accumulation of 
Fz/LRP-receptor complexes at the cell membrane (De Lau et al 20 14 and Seshagiri et al 
2012).  Chromosome rearrangement s of RSPO2 and RSPO3 have been described in 
approximately 5% of CRC  (Seshagiri et al 2012, Shinmura et al 2 014, Kleeman et al 2019).  
The rearrangements result in fus ion transcripts that drive mark ed overexpression of the RSPO 
gene.  
PORCN is a membrane-bound protein- serine O-palmitoleoyltransfer ase which is required for 
the acetylation, activation and s ecretion of Wnt ligands.  RXC0 04 inhibits PORCN leading to 
reduced canonical and non-canoni cal Wnt signalling.  Blocking W nt signalling with PORCN 
inhibitors has been shown to suppr ess the growth of RNF43 and R SPO aberrated CRC cancers 
in preclinical models (Mada n et al 2016 and Koo et al 2015). 
 There is strong scientific rationa le, from both preclinical and  clinical studies, that Wnt 
pathway activity drives the imm une evasion of tum ours (Spranger  and Gajewski 2018, Wang 
et al 2018 and Luke et al 2019).  I n order for immune cells to recognize cancer cells, they 
must first infiltrate the tum our and then remain activated.  Wn t pathway activated tumours 
have been shown to be poorly inf iltrated by immune cells (Grass o et al 2018) and 
pharmacological inhibition of Wnt  signaling promotes cytotoxic T cell infiltration sensitizing 
cancer cells to PD-1 inhibito rs (Feng et al 2019, Xiao et al 20 18). 
There are currently a number of  ongoing clinical trials investi gating combining Porcupine 
inhibitors with PD-1 checkpoint  inhibitors, in patients with ad vanced tumours.  This trial will 
therefore evaluate both the dir ect tumour targeting potential o f RXC004 monotherapy and the 
dual potential of direct tumour t argeting and reversal of immun e evasion/restoration of 
sensitivity to anti-PD1 treatment in MicroSatellite Stable (MSS ) metastatic colorectal cancer 
patients with upstream WNT path way aberrations (RNF43 LoF and R SPO fusion). 
 
 Rationale for Study Endpoints 
4.3.1 Arm A Primary Endpoint 
RXC004 has shown efficacy in bot h RNF43 LoF and RSPO fusion hum an xenograft models. 
As part of these preclinical st udies, it was observed that RXC0 04 did not show a clear dose 
response relationship when a ca lliper measurement was utilised for study endpoint.  The 
callipers measure the size of the tumour in the mouse similar t o a RECIST scan in a cancer 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  47 of 146  patient. In addition to the calliper measurement Redx conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
analysis and  s  scanning on these RSPO fusion tumours.  By IHC a clear dose response relationship was shown on reduction of Ki67 staining, a marker of proliferation in 
tumour cells, and  a dose dependent increase in Alcian Blue/Periodic acid -Schiff staining, 
markers of mucins in the tumour.  Therefore, in addition to the dramatic dose dependent 
reduction in tumour cell proliferation, RXC004 also resulted in a striking change in cell morphology. As indicated by Alcian blue/Period acid-Shiff staining, RXC004 treatment was 
shown to increase the presence of mucins in the extracellular space in a dose dependent 
manner.  This increase in mucin in the tumour microenvironment we believe is responsible for 
the lack of apparent dose response in the calliper tumour volume measurement in this model.  Furthermore,   scanning in the same RSPO fusion tumour model showed a reduction 
in metabolic activity in the tumours, and when tumours were removed and implanted into secondary host animals, they had a significantly reduced rate of growth compared to tumours pre-treated with vehicle alone. This suggests potential continued benefit of RXC004 induced 
cell changes even post drug treatment.  
Based on these pre-clinical observations, and also taking into consideration the low published 
response rates % %) with single agents TAS -102 and regorafenib in MSS CR C, it is 
considered unlikely that RXC004 as a monotherapy will deliver RECIST- confirmed clinical 
responses. The RECIST measurement on tumour size may be confounded if this cell 
differentiation and increase in mucous production in the tumour microenvironment that was 
seen in pre-clinical models is also observed in human tumours as this would result in a lack of tumour area shrinkage.  For these reasons, the exploratory objectives of the study include an 
 for IHC and an  s  scan.  
Disease Control Rate (DCR; defined as CR+ PR+ durable stable disease lasting for at least 
16 weeks) was selected as the primary endpoint for the RXC004 monotherapy arm because it 
considers both tumour shrinkage and durable disease stabilisation. It is possible and more likely that RXC004 efficacy could result in prolonged stable disease rather than tumour shrinkage.  As complete ablation of tumour cell proliferation has been observed in preclinical 
models, this mechanism of action could still lead to patient benefit, increased progression free 
survival and ultimately an overall survival benefit for the patient.  
For this endpoint, a value of % DCR will be used as a reference, as this was consistently 
reported in the studies of TAS-102 and regorafenib in a similar but unselected patient 
population ( Grothey et al 2013 and Mayer et al 2015 ) and an improvement over this value 
would be  considered relevant , firstly  because the DCR rate in the reported studies was  based 
on SD at    w  weeks, whereas  in this study at least 16 weeks of SD  is required , and secondly  
because of the preliminary evidence that RNF43 mutated MSS CRC may have a poorer prognosis than the general MSS CRC population. 
However, acknowledging that Disease Control Rate is difficult to interpret in a single arm 
study, the secondary endpoints of the study include the best % change in the sum of target lesions from baseline, the ORR (monotherapy) and duration of response (DoR) according to

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 48 of 146  RECIST 1.1, as well as PFS and OS . All of these endpoints will be taken into account when 
determining whether R XC004 has demonstrated sufficient clinical  activity to support further 
clinical development as a monot herapy. Further details are prov ided in sections 9.2 and 9.4. 
4.3.2 Arm B Primary Endpoint 
The mechanism of action of R XC004 on the tumour epithelial cell  could lead to prolonged 
stable disease and hence DCR is  considered an a ppropriate prima ry endpoint for RXC004 
monotherapy.  In contrast, com bination of RXC004 with nivolumab  would be expected to 
have both a RXC004 effect on the gr owth of the tumour cells and  a synergistic effect with 
nivolumab on the immune system .  RXC004 should reverse Wnt path way induced immune 
evasion and nivolumab will allow ac tivated CD8 T cells to funct ion without the immune 
suppression resulting from tumour  PD-L1 expression.  Therefore,  it is believed that in 
combination, the active CD8 T cells will have t he ability to de stroy tumour cells and thus 
shrink the size of the tumour;  hence ORR is thought to be a sui table endpoint for the 
combination arm. 
 Justification for Doses of RXC004 and Nivolumab 
Patients who enrol in Arm A R XC004 monotherapy will receive 2.0  mg RXC004 orally once 
a day in a fasted state. This dose was chosen using the predict ed efficacious dose ranges from 
pre-clinical pharmacology models, pr eclinical and clinical targ et engagement assays, 
information from toxicology and t oxicokinetic studies, and safe ty, efficacy and 
pharmacokinetics data from th e Phase 1 study of RXC004 in patie nts with advanced solid 
tumours ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
Patients who receive combina tion therapy with RXC004 and nivolu mab in Arm A or B will 
receive RXC004 1.5 mg orally once a day in combination with niv olumab 480 mg q4w. The 
RXC004 1.5 mg dose is supported by the  available safety and PK data for this dose given in 
combination with nivolumab i n the ongoing Phase 1 study RXC004/ 0001 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; see 
Sections 4.4.1.2 and 4.4.1.3). At a meeting held on 07 July 202 2, the Phase 1 Safety Review 
Committee (SRC) determined tha t RXC004 1.5 mg in combination wi th nivolumab is a 
tolerated dose, base d on safety and PK data  (see Sections 4.4.1 .2 and 4.4.1.3).

No DLTs were observed in the patients dosed in the first three cohorts since the study was 
restarted (RXC004 doses from 0.5 mg to 1.5 mg).  One DLT of CTCAE grade 3 pancreatitis was observed at the 2  mg dose level.  At the 3  mg dose level, two DLTs of colitis and enteritis 
were observed in 2 out of 4 evaluable patients, which led to the SRC declaring 3 mg QD

Five patients reported nine CTCAE Grade 3 events that were assessed as possibly or probably related to RXC004 by the investigator, and these patients all received doses of 1.5 mg or higher. These events were: weight loss (1 patient, 1.5 mg); nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (all 
in one patient, 1.5 mg); pancreatitis (1 patient, 2  mg); enteritis (1 patient, 3  mg) and diarrhoea, 
proctitis and hyponatraemia (all in 1 patient, 10 mg). No Grade 4 events were reported. Two 
Grade 5 events were reported – COVID-19 infection (1 patient, 1.5 mg, not- related to 
RXC004) and subdural hematoma following a fall (1 patient, 3 mg QD, assessed as possibly 
related to RXC004).  See Table  4. 
A total of 16 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported in 11 patients. Nine of the 
16 SAEs reported were assessed as unrelated to the RXC004 by the investigator and the sponsor. These were: gastroenteritis viral (Grade 3, 1 patient, 1 mg), Escheri chia urinary tract 
infection (Grade 3, 1 patient, 1.5 mg), pulmonary haemorrhage (Grade 1, 1 patient, 1.5 mg), melaena ( 2 SAEs in 1 patient at 1.5 mg – one Grade 1 then other Grade 3 – both due to a new 
primary malignancy), small intestinal obstruction (Grade 3, 1 patient 1.5 mg), COVID -19 
(Grade 5, 1 patient, 1.5 mg), Stoma site infection (Grade 2, 1 patient, 2 mg) and biliary track 
infection (Grade 3, 1 patient, 3 mg).  7 SAEs (which occurred in 4 patients) were assessed as 
possibly or probably related to RXC004 by the investigator and are described below: 
2. 2 SAEs of NCI CTCAE grade 3/2 diarrhoea that occurred in 1 patient at 10 mg QD RXC004 
(before the study was re -started) were both assessed as probably related to RXC004 and led 
to discontinuation of study drug.  The events subsequently resolved/recovered and 10 mg 
QD RXC004 was declared not tolerated by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). 
3. 1 SAE of NCI CTCAE grade 3 diarrhoea that occurred at 1.5 mg RXC004 was assessed as 
probably related to RXC004 and led to discontinuation of study drug.  The event was also associated with a clostridium difficile  infection and subsequently resolved/recovered.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  54 of 146  4. 1 SAE of NCI CTCAE grade 2 colitis that occurred at 3 mg QD RXC004 was assessed as 
probably related to RXC004.  The event subsequently resolved, and the patient continued 
study treatment at a lower dose (1 .5 mg RXC004).  The 3 mg QD dose of RXC004 was 
subsequently declared not tolerated by the SRC. 
5. 1 SAE of NCI CTCAE grade 3 enteritis that occurred at 3  mg QD RXC004 was assessed as 
probably related to RXC004.  This patient also had a SAE of NCI CTCAE grade 2 humerus fracture (following a fall whilst hospitalised for enteritis) which was assessed as probably related to RXC004.  The enteritis and fracture events w ere both unresolved at the time that 
the patient subsequently died due to a CTCAE grade 5 subdural hematoma (following a fall).  The subdural hematoma  was assessed as possibly related to RXC004 by investigator 
due to unknown mechanism as an association between the study drug and potential factors that could have contributed to this event, such as coagulation, had not been ruled out at the time of death. The 3 mg QD dose of RXC004 was subsequently declared not tolerated by the SRC . 
 
4.4.1.2 RXC0 04 Clinical Safety Data ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) – in Combination with 
Nivolumab Module 2 ) 
As of 01 July 2022, 13 patients have received RXC004 in combination with nivolumab 
480 mg q4w at doses of RXC004 1 mg and 1.5 mg in Module 2 of the ongoing Phase 1 study 
RXC004/0001. Eight of these patients received treatment at the highest declared tolerated 
dose (RXC004 1.5 mg). Treatment -related AEs of CTCAE ≥  Grade 2 reported in 
DLT- evaluable patients are summarised in Table  8.  
Overall, the AE profile of the RXC004 1.5 mg dose in combination with nivolumab is similar 
to the RXC004 2 mg monotherapy dose. More patients who received the 1.5 mg dose had 
treatment rela ted AEs of Grade 2 or higher (4/6) than patients who received the 1 mg dose 
(2/5). One patient who received 1.5 mg in combination had drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ), 
which was considered drug- related and a DLT.  
The SRC determined  at a meeting held on 07 July 2022, that both RXC004 1 mg and 1.5 mg 
QD in combination with nivolumab are tolerated dose s. A decision was made not to further 
escalate the dose in the study, based on the safety and PK profiles of the 1.5 mg dose, as the combination of RXC004 2 mg with nivolumab was anticipated to lead to slightly higher exposure and potentially more AEs than the 2  mg monotherapy dose.

Three patients had  CTCAE Grade 3 events that were assessed by the Investigator as possibly 
or probably related to RXC004: Grade 3 fatigue was reported by one patient who received 
RXC004 1 mg + nivolumab and one patient who received RXC004 1.5 mg. One patient who 
received RXC004 1.5 mg had Grade 3 events of a spartate aminotransferase increased , blood 
alkaline phosphatase increased , and DILI, which w ere considered to be related to both 
RXC004 and nivolumab. No other events of DILI were reported in either Module 1 or 
Module 2. A fourth patient who received RXC004 1.5 mg had a Grade 3 event of anaemia 
with missing relationship details.  
A total of 11  treatment -emergent SAEs were reported in 6 patients.  Ten of the 11 SAEs 
reported were assessed by the Investigator and the Sponsor as unrelated to RXC004. These 
were as follows: infection (NOS), left leg weakness, and infection (all reported in one patient 
at 1 mg); kidney infection and liver pain (in one patient at 1 mg), and 2 events of ascites (in one patient at 1 mg); diarrhoea (in one patient at 1.5 mg); and chest infection and pneumonia (in one patient at 1.5 mg). 
One SAE was assessed as being related to RX C004 and nivolumab: this was Grade 3 DILI in 
a patient who had colorectal cancer with liver metastases, and  was reported on Cycle 1 
Day 17. The event was considered to be a DLT, and study treatment was permanently 
discontinued. The liver function tests subsequently returned to baseline. The patient 
subsequently died due to disease progression. No other events of DILI were reported in either 
Module 1 or Module 2.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  59 of 146  4.4.1.3 RXC004 pharmacokinetic profile 
The data from the ongoing Phase 1 study ( NCT 03447470) have characterised the PK of 
RXC004 monotherapy in patients following single and multiple oral doses ranging from 
0.5 mg to 10 mg, and in combination with standard dose nivolumab at doses of RXC004 1 mg 
and 1.5 mg .   
RXC004 was rapidly absorbed following oral dosing in fasting conditions, with a peak plasma 
concentration observed typically after 1-2 hours post-dose and eliminated with a half- life of 
approximately  hours.  The exposures achieved in patients dosed with 0.5–2 mg were 
broadly dose proportional and predictable from the exposure observed in the patient dosed at 
10 mg in terms of half -life, C max, Cmin and AUC. There was limited accumulation to steady 
state and it is in line with expectations from the measured half -life. The 3  mg dose C max, Cmin 
and AUC were all disproportionately high compared to the 2 mg dose, giving an estimated 
 i  in exposure for the 50% rise in dose.  
There was little difference in RXC004 plasma exposure between monotherapy and combination therapy on Cycle 0 Day 1. On Cycle 1 Day 15, the steady state RXC004 plasma exposure appeared to be slightly greater on combination therapy compared with monotherapy, 
although patient numbers are small. The mechanism for a potential small increase in expos ure 
when RXC004 is given with nivolumab is unclear since a PK interaction with a monoclonal 
antibody is unlikely, but an increase in bioavailability cannot be ruled out. 
The plasma exposure of RXC004 when given at 1.5 mg in combination with nivolumab was 
no greater than that observed at 2 mg monotherapy and was around  t  than that 
observed at 3 mg monotherapy. 
The steady state PK  parameters of RXC004 from Study RXC004/0001, for RXC004 
monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab are summarised in Table  12.

4.4.1.4 RXC004 Pharmacodynamic and Efficacy Data 
In pre -clinical pharmacology models, RXC004 demonstrated anti- tumour activity at steady 
state C min exposures of between   and   fold IC 50, with evidence of improved efficacy at 
higher doses.  The target human exposure to achieve monotherapy efficacy is a C min value of 
fo fold IC 50. 
Pharmaco dynamic effects (>50% reduction in AXIN2 expression in skin) were observed in 
patients who achieved C min exposure of f fold IC 50. 
As of 30 July 2021, 5/18 evaluable patients in the monotherapy module, with at least 
2 scheduled RECIST1.1 scans had achieved durable SD  of 10 weeks or longer – 1 patient 
dosed at 1.0 mg  QD (RNF43 LoF mCRC), 2 patients dosed at 1.5 mg  (CCA and RSPO fusion 
mCRC) and 2  patients dosed at 3 mg (CCA and thymus cancer.  The CCA patient had a dose 
reduction to 1.5 mg RXC004 after exper iencing colitis).  Of note all 5  patients who achieved 
SD had a type of cancer in which RXC004 is most likely to demonstrate clinical benefit based on its mechanism of action. These selected tumour types are CRC or PDAC with a RNF43 LoF mutation or RSPO fusion, or biliary tract cancer or thymus cancer, both of which are 
reported to have high Wnt ligand activity (Boulter et al 2015, Loilome et al 2014, V odicka et 
al 2020). All patients with RECIST SD  also achieved C
min exposures of  - - fold IC 50. 
Efficacy data for the combination of RXC004 + nivolumab in Module 2 are not yet available.

Based on all of the ava ilable information, patients who enrol i n Arm A RXC004 monotherapy 
will receive 2.0 mg RXC004 orally once a day.   
The 2 mg QD dose was both toler able and able to consistently de liver Cmin values of f f fold 
IC50 in all patients, whereas  the 1.5 mg QD dose did not consis tently achieve the target Cmin 
values of  f fold IC50 in all patients.   
The 2 mg dose has been selected f or Phase 2 development as the optimal dose to demonstrate 
an efficacy signal i n patients with geneti cally selected tumour s and to allow for potential dose 
reductions to manage adverse events.  
4.4.1.6  RXC004 dose in combination with nivolumab 
Patients who receive combina tion therapy with RXC004 and nivolu mab in Arm A or B will 
receive RXC004 1.5 mg orally once a da y. Justification for the choice of doses and regimens 
is provided in Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2. 
4.4.2 Nivolumab 
The nivolumab dose and regimen s elected for this study are base d on the FDA approved 
prescribing information for nivol umab.  Patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal 
cancer can receive 240 mg q2w or 480 mg q4w.  480 mg q4w was se lected to complement a 
28-day cycle of RXC004 and reduce the number of patient visits required.

 Lifestyle Considerations 
5.3.1 Contraception 
1 Women must be 1 year post-menopaus al, surgically sterile or mus t agree to using 
enhanced contraceptive measures  for the duration of the study a nd for 5 months after the 
last dose of study drug, with all male sexua l partners.  Highly  effective methods of 
contraception must be used, whic h include having a vasectomised  partner, sexual 
abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse  during the study and for 5 
months after the last dose of  study drug. The reliability of se xual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated by the Investigator, i n relation to the duration of t he study and the 
preferred/usual lifestyle of the  subject), or one of the follow ing: hormonal contraceptives 
which inhibit ovulation (oral, inj ectable, transdermal, intrava ginal or implants), 
Intrauterine Device (IUD), Intr auterine Hormone-releasing Syste m (IUS) (e.g., Mirena), 
or bilateral tubal occlusion.  
2 Men must use a condom (with s permicide) during the study, and f or 5 months after the 
last dose of study drug, wit h all sexual partners.   
3 Men must not donate sperm for 5 mont hs after the last dose of s tudy drug. 
 
5.3.2 Meals and Dietary Restrictions 
Patients must fast (water t o drink only) from at least 2 hours prior to taking a dose to at least 
1-hour post-dose for all doses. P atients should abstain from ea ting large amounts of grapefruit 
and Seville oranges (a nd other products cont aining these fruits  e.g. grapefruit juice or 
marmalade) during the study (e.g., no more than a small glass  of grapefruit juice (120 mL) o r

yellow fever, measles, influenza nasal spray, COVID -19, rubella, mumps, typhoid, 
mycobacterium tuberculosis (BCG), Yersinia pestis (EV) within 4 weeks of starting study treatment , whilst the patient is receiving study medication and for 30 days following 
discontinuation of study treatment.  Patients who require COVID-19 vaccination whilst on study should receive a non-live vaccine (e.g. one based on mRNA or fully inactivated/genetically modified viruses incapable of replication) . 
4 The use of some CYP3A4 inhibitors and  inducers should be restricted prior to first dose 
of study treatment and throughout the study treatment , as RXC004 is observed to be 
exclusively metabolised by CYP3A4. For a list of prohibited CYP3A4 inhibitors and  
inducers and the required washout periods , please refer to  Appendix E . 
5 Drugs that are immunosuppressive or may cause secondary osteoporosis should not be 
administered (e.g. corticosteroids, pioglitazone or rosiglitazone). 
  The following exceptions are allowed; 
• Use of immunosuppressive medication for the management of nivolumab- related 
AEs (as per Appendix G ) or colitis events (as per Appendix J ).  Steroids required 
for the management of RXC004 or nivolumab related AEs, should be tapered to 
doses ≤  10 mg/day prednisone equivalent, before  re- starting study treatment.  
• Use of topical, inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids 
• Systemic steroids at doses ≤  10 mg/day prednisone equivalent 
 
5.3.3.2 COVID-19 Vaccinations 
 
COVID-19 vaccination is permitted before or during study treatment, with the exception of 
live-attenuated vaccines and replication -competent vector vaccines, which are prohibited 
within 4 weeks of starting study treatment and whilst on study treatment.  
As COVID-19 vaccines are often prioritised for cancer patients, vaccination prior to the first dose of study treatment is  advisable.  Where possible, COVID-19 vaccinations should be 
given at least 72 hours before starting study treatment and study treatment should not 
commence until any acute adverse effects from vaccination have resolved to at least Grade 1.  
If this is not possible, investigators should follow their local prescribing information and policies when considering whether a patient on study treatment should receive a COVID-19 vaccination.  If COVID-19 vaccination is given during the study (including the screening 
period), then please ensure that all the relevant information is  recorded in the concomitant 
medication eCRF  (i.e vaccine name, manufacturer, date(s) given and dose).

Patients taking RXC004 are advi sed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight and the use of 
tanning equipment. 
 Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as  participants who consent to part icipate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently treated in t he study. A minimal set of scr een failure information is 
required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure part icipants to meet the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials ( CONSORT) publishing requirements  and to respond to queries 
from regulatory authorities. Minima l information includes demog raphy, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria , and any serious adverse event (SAE). 
Individuals who do not meet the Cal cium and/or Vitamin D3 labor atory criteria for 
participation in this study may be  retested after starting Calc ium/Vitamin D3 supplementation.  
Repeating laboratory tests w ithin the screening period will not  be considered as a rescreen. 
 Pre-Screening Genetic Testing 
All enrolled patients’ tumours w ill be required to have a genet ic mutation whic h is predicted 
to be loss of function in RNF43, or  an RSPO fusion/translocatio n detectable in   
.  .  Eligible patients also need t o have evidence of MSS status.  Eligible 
subjects will be ide ntified by either a cen tral genetics screen ing approach or local laboratory 
assessments.

decisions. 
  
  
 
  
5.5.2 Local Testing  
Patients with predicted loss of function RNF43 mutations or RSPO fusions from other local testing will also be eligible to enter the study, provided that the assay used for testing has 
adequate analytical validation for this purpose (i.e. fully  f  for the purpose of 
investigating RNF43 mutations or RSPO fusions; partially   for their analytical 
performance or having achieved a minimum validation specification of >90% for Analytical 
Sensitivity / PPA and >95% for Analytical Specificity / NPA f or the detection of the 
aberrations in the genes of interest and performed in an ISO accredited,  CLIA or CAP accredited lab). If aberrations are detected by local tests that are not included in the list in Appendix F , these may be included in the study on discussion with the Sponsor.   
 
 
  
5.5.3 MSS/MSI Testing 
Tumour samples that test positive for RNF43 mutations or RSPO fusions will also be tested for MSI st atus at .  .  The MSI status from   
 is  is not required for eligibility (which will be based on the local standard of care IHC, 
NGS or PCR test that has been taken at diagnosis to identify patients with Lynch Syndrome or 
patients with MSI CRC who may be eligible for treatment with a PD -1 inhibitor), but will be 
used to retrospectively evaluate the concordance between local and central MSI assays.

in separate release protocols/ Certificate of Analysis.  
RXC004 is formulated as two dosage strengths capsules (0.5 mg and  1.0 mg), manufactured 
by Quay Pharma, Deeside Industrial Park, CH5 2NS, United Kingdom. The RXC004 capsules 
strengths are 0.5, 1.0 mg for oral administration.   Stability testing of RXC004 is ongoing. 
Please refer to the current IMP label for the Expiry Date associated with the current shelf -life 
of the product. 
Patients must fast (water to drink only) for at least 2 hours prior to taking a dose to at least 
1-hour post- dose for all doses . 
6.2.2 Nivolumab 
Nivolumab will be supplied by 240 mg/24 mL vial solution s for infusion after dilution. Two 
(2) vials will be needed for the 480 mg dose. 
Storage;  
• Unopened vials must be stored in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). The vials must be kept 
in the original package in order to protect from light. Vials  should not be frozen. The 
unopened vial can be stored at controlled room temperature up to 25°C with room light for up to 48 hours.  
• Infusion must be completed within 24 hours of preparation. If not used immediately, 
the solution may be stored under refrigeration conditions (2°C-8°C) and protected 
from light for up to 24 hours [a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 hours can be at room temperature (20°C-25°C) and room light]. 
• Do not use after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and on the vial label 
after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.  
•  Do not store any unused portion of the infusion solution for reuse. Any unused 
medicine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  
 
Preparation and administration of nivolumab; 
• Visually inspect drug product solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration. Nivolumab is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale-yellow solution. 
Discard the vial if the solution is cloudy, discoloured, or contains extraneous 
particulate matter other than a few translucent -to-white, proteinaceous particles. Do 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  72 of 146  not shake the vial.  
• Withdraw the required volume of nivolumab and transfer into an intravenous 
container. Dilute nivolumab with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose/Glucose Injection, USP to prepare an infusion with a final concentration ranging from 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL. The total volume of infusion must not exceed 160 mL. For patients with body weights less than 40 kg, the total volume of infusion 
must not exceed 4 mL/kg of body weight.  
• Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. Do not shake 
• The dose of nivolumab for administration must be prepared by the Investigator’s or 
site’s designated IP manager using aseptic technique.  Total time from needle puncture 
of the vial to the end of administration should not exceed; 
o 8 hours at room temperature  
o 24 hours under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)  
• The infusion should be administered over 60 minutes through an intravenous line  
containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 0.2 micrometre  to 1.2 micrometre ). 
• Do not co-administer other drugs through the same intravenous line 
• The intravenous line should be flushed at the end of the infusion. 
 
6.2.3 Denosumab 
Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with high affinity specifically to RANKL, preventing RANKL/RANK interaction from occurring and resulting 
in reduced osteoclast numbers and function, thereby decreasing bone resorption and cancer-
induced bone destruction. 
Denosumab is approved to be administered at 120 mg S.C. once monthly for use in the 
prevention of skeletal- related events in patients with advanced cancers with bone metastases 
(XGEV A ). 
The u se of denosumab in this trial is outside labelled use as patients may not have bone 
metastases. The rationale for its prophylactic use in all patients is as a bone protection 
measure based on the increased risk of bone fragility with RXC004 treatment.

 Randomisation 
Once Arm B is opened, patients w ho are eligible for both Arm A and Arm B will be 
randomised 2:1 to Arm B: Arm A to ensure there is no conscious or unconscious selection 
bias. A 2:1 randomisation was sel ected to ensure that the combi nation and monotherapy arms 
will complete at approximately the same time and to maximise th e number of patients 
recruited under randomisation cond itions. Patients will be cent rally assigned to a Study Arm 
using IRT. 
Randomisation will be ope n-label, and will  be stratified by gen etic alteration 
(RNF43 vs RSPO). 
 Study Treatment Compliance 
6.4.1 RXC004 
The first dose of RXC004 will be  taken at the site under medica l supervision.  The date and 
time of dose administered at site  will be recorded in the sourc e documents and recorded in the 
eCRF.  When patients se lf-administer RXC004 a t home, compliance  with study treatment will 
be assessed at each visit. Comp liance will be a ssessed by colle ction of a patient diary cards 
and counting of returned capsule s, during the site visits and d ocumented in the source 
documents and eCRF. Devia tion(s) from the prescribed dosage reg imen should be recorded in 
the eCRF. 
A record of the number of RXC004 capsules dispensed to and take n by each participant must 
be maintained and reconciled wit h study treatment and complianc e records. Treatment start 
and stop dates, incl uding dates for treatme nt delays and/or dos e reductions will also be 
recorded in the eCRF. 
6.4.2 Nivolumab 
Nivolumab will be dosed at the s ite, directly from the investig ator or designee, under medical 
supervision. The date, and time  of dose administered at site wi ll be recorded in the source 
documents and recorded in the e CRF. The dose of nivolumab and t he study participant 
identification will be confirm ed at the time of dosing by a mem ber of the study site staff other 
than the person administeri ng the study intervention.  
Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (incl uding over-the-counter or prescr iption medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that  the participant is receiving at  the time of enrolment or 
receives during the study mus t be recorded along with: 
x Reason for use 
x Dates of administration i ncluding start and end dates 
Clinical Study Protocol Final Version 7.0 Redx Pharma Plc 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 74 of 146  x Dosage information inc luding dose and frequency 
Concomitant medication may be gi ven as medicall y indicated with  the exception of prohibited 
concomitant medication (Secti on 5.3.3 and Appendix E).  The Medi cal Monitor should be 
contacted if there are any que stions regarding concomitant or p rior therapy. 
6.5.1 Rescue Medicine 
As a result of immune mediated AEs that could potentially be ex perienced by patients on 
nivolumab, steroids and other imm unosuppressant rescue medicati on must be available to 
these patients. The t wo products that fall into the category of  other immunosuppressants are 
infliximab (e.g., for c olitis) and mycophenol ate (e.g. for hepa titis).  Rescue medications for 
immune mediated adverse even ts will be obtained locally. 
The use of inflixima b and mycophenolate are considered to be us ed as off-label for 
management of immunothe rapy related toxicities.  These rescue m edications must be 
receipted, controlled, and ad ministered by the pharmacist and s tored according to the labelled 
storage conditions. 
 Dose Modification 
RXC004 dose reduction and interr uption are permitted. Nivolumab  dose reduction is not 
permitted but dose interruption/de lay is permitted as per Appen dix G. 
RXC004 may be dose interrupted (w ithheld) until a clinically si gnificant (any grade) and/or a 
grade ! 3 related adverse event resolv es to baseline or < grade 2. RXC 004 may also be 
withheld if it is necessary to gi ve a concomitant  medication th at is a moderate or strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor. RXC004 relate d colitis events should be manag ed as per Appendix J. 
Adverse events that are assesse d as being causally related nivo lumab should be managed as 
per the Nivolumab Toxicity Manag ement and Dose Modification Gui delines (Appendix G). If 
either agent is interrupted or di scontinued for a related-AE th e other agent (nivolumab or

evaluated for  safety, progression (if the patient discontinues for a reason other than 
progression) and survival. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study treatment  and during follow-up. 
7.1.1 Treatment of Symptomatically Stable Patients after RECIST 1.1 
Defined Progression 
Patients with symptomatically stable disease  may continue treatment after the initial 
RECIST  1.1 – defined progression, until symptomatic/clinical progression or a second 
RECIST 1.1 PD assessment  (relati ve to the initial RECIST1.1 progression, for a given study 
treatment ).  
Patients  who  wish to continue study treatment after RECIST1.1 defined progression, should 
be informed of all other alternative treatment options available to them by the treating 
physician and sign an additional consent that they wish to continue study treatment. A decision 
to continue study treatment after initial progression must also be discussed and agreed by the 
treating physician and the Sponsor .   
The criteria for continuing treatment after initial RECIST 1.1-defined progression are as follows: 
• Signed patient consent for treatment after progression  
• The patient does not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities 
indicating that continuing treatment will not further harm  the patient.

intervention. 
x Study treatment was not on hold/in terrupted at time of progress ion   
Patients continuing study trea tment after initial RECIST 1.1 de fined progression should 
continue RECIST scans as per the Schedule of Assessments (the n ext tumour assessment 
should be at least 4 weeks after  the first RECIST 1.1 defined p rogression and no later than the 
next regularly scheduled imaging timepoint).   
 Participant Withdrawal from the Study 
x A participant may withdraw fro m the study at any time at his/he r own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time a t the discretion of t he investigator for  safety, behavioural, 
compliance, or administrative reasons. This is expected to be u ncommon. 
x A participant who cons iders withdrawing from the study must be informed by the 
investigator about modified fo llow-up options (e.g., telephone contact, a contact with a 
relative or treati ng physician, or informati on from medical rec ords). 
x If the participant withdraws cons ent for disclosure of future i nformation, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to us e any data collected before such a wit hdrawal of consent. 
x If a participant withdraws fro m the study, it should be confirm ed if he/she is still agrees 
for existing samples to be used i n line with the original conse nt. If he/she requests 
withdrawal of consent for use  of samples, destruction of any sa mples taken and not tested 
should be carried in line with wha t was stated in the informed consent and local 
regulation. The investigator m ust document the decision on use of existing samples in the 
site study records and inform the Global Study Team. 
 
 Lost to Follow up 
A participant will be c onsidered lost to fo llow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study sit e. 
The following actions must be tak en if a participant fails to r eturn to the clinic  for a required 
study visit: 
x The site must attempt to contact  the participant and reschedule  the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the particip ant on the importance of maint aining the assigned visit

the study. 
• Before a participant  is deemed lost to f ollow up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary , a certified letter to the participant ’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant ’s 
medical record .

 Efficacy Assessments 
The primary endpoint f or the RXC004 monothe rapy arm, will be th e DCR using a patients 
best overall response, with sec ondary endpoints of % change in the sum of target lesions, 
ORR, DoR, PFS and OS.  For the  RXC004 + nivolumab arm, the prim ary endpoint will be   
ORR using a patients BO R with secondary endpoi nts of % change i n the sum of target lesions, 
DCR, DoR, PFS and OS. 
Efficacy assessments of DCR, ORR, %  change in the sum of target  lesions, DoR and PFS will 
be derived using investigator R ECIST 1.1 assessments.  In addit ion, OS will also be 
evaluated. 
8.1.1 Tumour assessments 
Tumour assessments utilize images from CT or MRI, collected dur ing screening/baseline and 
at regular (follow-up) intervals  during the study.  The same im aging method should be used 
throughout the study.  It is impor tant to follow the tumour ass essment schedule as per the 
SoA.  Tumour assessme nts will continue un til RECIST1.1-defined radiological progression.  
Patients treated with R XC004+nivolumab that c ontinue treatment after RECIST1.1

 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The Principal investigator (P I) is responsible for ensuring tha t all staff involved in the study 
are familiar with the cont ent of this section. 
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix B. 
AEs will be reported by the pa tient (or, whe n appropriate, by a  caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant’s legally autho rised representative).  
The investigator and any design ees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and recording 
events that meet the definition of an AE. 
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
Adverse Events will be collected from time of signature of the main study informed consent 
form throughout the treatment  period and until 30 days after th e last dose of RXC004 (for 
patients treated with RXC004 m onotherapy only) or 90 days after  the last dose of nivolumab 
(for patients treated w ith RXC004 and nivolumab). 
SAEs will be recorded from the time of signing of the main stud y informed consent form until 
the follow-up period is complete d (30 days after the last dose of RXC004 [for patients treated 
with RXC004 monotherapy only] or 90 da ys after the last dose of  nivolumab [for patients 
treated with RXC004 and nivolumab]) .  If an event starts after the safety follow-up period 
defined above is considered to be  a late-onset t oxicity related  to study treatment, then it should 
be reported as an AE or SAE, as applicable. 
If the investigator becomes aware  of a serious adverse event wi th a suspected causal 
relationship to the investigationa l medicinal product that occu rs after the end of the clinical 
study in a participant treated by h im or her, the investigator shall, without undue  delay, report 
the serious adverse event to the sponsor. 
8.3.2 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
Any AEs that are unresolved at  90 days after last dose of IP sh ould be followed up by the 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  88 of 146  investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the e CRF.  
Redx  retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 
Adverse event variables  
'The following variables will be collected for each AE;  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when the AE started and stopped 
• CTCAE grade  changes  
• Whether the AE is serious or not 
• Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Product(s) (yes or no) 
• Action taken with regard to Investigational Product(s) 
• Outcome 
• Whether treatment was required  
 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: 
• Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
• Date investigator became aware of serious AE  
• Serious criteria  
• Date of hospitalisation  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy performed 
• Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) 
• Causality assessment to other medication  
 
8.3.3 Causality Collection 
The investigator should assess causal relationsh ip between Investigational Product and each 
Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?’ 
8.3.4 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the pa tient or reported in response to the open question 
Clinical Study Protoc ol Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  89 of 146  from the study site staff: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were 
last asked?’ , or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the e CRF. When 
collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.  
8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests 
The results from the Clinical Study Protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the Clinical Study Report ( CSR).  
Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol- mandated , laboratory values, vital signs, 
bone turnover biomarkers and DXA scans, should therefore only be reported as AE s if they 
fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned 
visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, e.g. dose adjustment or 
drug interruption).
  
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information . Wherever possible the reporting investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term ( e.g. anaemia versus low  haemoglobin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).  
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related to the disease un der study. 
8.3.6 Hy’s Law 
If a patient demonstrates an AST or ALT ≥3x ULN together with total bilirubin ≥2x ULN, it must 
be reported to the Sponsor and/or designated CRO within 24 hours. Prompt reporting of cases meeting Hy’s Law criteria (via the SAE expedited reporting system) is required for compliance with regulatory guidelines. The Investigator is responsible for immediately determining whether a 
patient meets potential Hy’s Law criteria. The Investigator needs to perform additional 
examinations for this and confirm the results with the medical monitor.
 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  90 of 146  8.3.7 Disease Progression 
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a pa tient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the investigational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The 
development of new, or progression of existing metastasis from  the primary cancer under 
study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study. 
8.3.8 Disease U nder study  
Events which are unequivocally due to disease under study should not be reported as an AE during the study unless they meet SAE criteria or lead to discontinuation of the investigational product. 
8.3.9 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s) . All SAEs will be  recorded in the e CRF.  
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel must 
inform the appropriate Sponsor representatives within one day i.e., immediately  but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated Sponsor representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to Patient Safety within 1  calendar day of initial receipt 
for fatal and life -threatening  events  and within 5 calendar  days of initial receipt for all other 
SAEs.  
For fatal or life -threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, 
active follow -up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform 
Sponsor representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 
one calendar  day i.e. , immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes 
aware of it . 
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B  of the Clinical Study 
Protocol. 
The reference document for definition of expectedness is the IB for RXC004 and the 
EU/FDA/Local label for nivolumab.  
8.3.10  Pregnancy 
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to Sponsor representative except for  if the pregnancy is discovered before the study participant  has received any study 

Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  91 of 146  drug. 
8.3.10.1 Maternal Exposure 
The Sponsor and Sponsor designated Safety Services must be notified within 24 hours  of the 
initial report and any follow- up reports of a female patient or a male patient’s female partner 
becoming pregnant during the course of the study and for 5 months after the last dose of the 
study drug(s) via the Pregnancy Report Form. Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicion that the investigational product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or a female patient or male 
patient’s female partner experiences signs or symptoms of pregnancy complications; congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported as SAEs. T he contact information for pregnancy reporting is the same as for SAE reporting. 
Female patient(s) who become pregnant will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy 
is known. In order for the Sponsor or designee to collect pregnancy surveillance information, 
the pregnant patient or partner must sign an ICF. Pregnancy follow-up should describe the outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary or spontaneous termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any congenital abnormalities or birth defects in the 
offspring. 
If a female patient becomes pregnant, administration of the study drug(s) must be 
discontinued immediately.  
8.3.10.2 Paternal E xposure  
Male participant s should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and  
for at least 5 months following the last dose. 
Pregnancy of the participant ’s partners is not considered to be an adverse event. However, the 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth or congenital abnormality), occurring from the date of the first dose until 5 months after the last dose  should, if possible, be followed up and documented in the 
Pregnancy Report Form. Consent from the partner must be obtained before the Pregnancy Report Form is completed .  
8.3.11  COVID-19 infections 
COVID-19 infections occurring from the time of signature of the main study ICF until 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment should be reported as adverse events.  Patients who test positive for COVID -19, but do not have any symptoms should be reported as 
‘asymptomatic COVID -19’.  If COVID -19 is suspected but not confirmed by a diagnostic test, 
then ‘suspected COVID-19’ should be reported.  The AE term for the ‘suspected COVID-19’ should be updated when the results of the diagnostic test are known to reflect the confirmed COVID-19 or alternative diagnosis (e.g. common cold, influenza etc). 
Clinical Study Protocol Final Version 7.0 Redx Pharma Plc 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 92 of 146  8.3.12  Dysgeusia 
Loss of taste (dysgeusia) is a n on-target adverse event known t o occur with porcupine 
inhibition (Ng et al 2017, Janku e t al 2015).  According to CTC AEv5, there are only two 
grades of dysgeusia; 
Grade 1 – Altered taste  but no change in diet 
Grade 2 – Altered taste with c hange in diet (e.g., oral supplem ents); noxious or unpleasant 
taste; loss of taste. 
As dysgeusia is poorly character ized by CTCAE grade alone, site  research personnel will 
complete a taste assessment (c onsisting of a specific set of qu estions and an oral examination) 
at screening for each patient e nrolled, and for any patient who  reports dysgeusia in response to 
the open question from the st udy site staff; ‘Have you had any health problems since the 
previous visit/you were last asked ?. In such cases, the assessm ent will be performed at each 
visit until the adverse event ha s resolved. The information wil l be recorded and analysed as 
part of the overall safet y objective of the study. 
8.3.13  Adverse Events of Potential Interest (AEPI) 
As discussed in Section 2.3.1, Colitis  events and Bone Toxicity  events are classified as AEPIs 
for RXC004. This means that add itional information will be capt ured on the case report forms 
for any CTCAE preferred terms tha t fall into these categories. These terms will be defined in 
the CRF Guidelines and reviewed at any update of the CTCAE defi nitions. 
 Overdose 
For this study, any dose of RXC 004 greater than the daily assig ned dose will be considered an 
overdose. 
Investigators should be advise d that any patient who receives a n overdose should be 
monitored closely, managed wit h appropriate supportive care and  followed up expectantly. 
There are no data regarding R XC004 overdose in humans. An overd ose and AEs should be 
treated as per standard medical practice.  
Dosing details should be captured i n the eCRF. If the subject r eceives a dose of a study drug 
that exceeds protocol specifica tions and the subject is symptom atic, then the symptom(s) 
should be documented as AEs in t he eCRF and, if serious, submit ted to the Sponsor’s 
designated safety contact on an SAE  Report Form. Do not record the overdose as an AE if the 
subject is not symptomatic. 
Please refer to the l ocal label for manag ement of nivolumab ove rdoses.

measures to protect confiden tiality. For furth er details on Han dling of Human Biological 
Sample see Appendix C. 
Samples will be store d for a maximum of 15 ye ars from the date of the issue of the CSR in 
line with consent and local requi rements, after which they will  be destroyed/re patriated.  
x Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples w ill be disposed of after the Bioa nalytical Report 
finalization or six months after i ssuance of the draft Bioanaly tical Report (whichever is 
earlier), unless consented for future analyses.  
 Pharmacokinetic samples ma y be disposed of or anonymised by poo ling. Additional 
analyses may be conducted on the  anonymised, pooled pharmacokin etic samples to 
further evaluate and validate t he analytical method. Any result s from such analyses 
may be reported separately from th e Clinical Study Report (CSR) . 
 
8.5.1 Pharmacokinetics 
RXC004 PK data will be  summarised using descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, median, min, 
max for all parame ters, also geometric mean for C max and AUC) to determine the 
pharmacokinetic behaviour of  RXC004 on multiple dosing and to c onfirm relevant exposure 
to RXC004. This may also permit investigation of any significan t metabolites .  Venous blood 
samples (2 mL) for determina tion of concentrations of RXC004 in  plasma will be taken at the 
times described in the s chedule of assessmen ts (Table 1 and Tab le 2).  The date and time that 
the last dose of RXC004 was admin istered before the PK assessme nt day, the date and time of 
the dose of RXC004 administere d on the PK assess ment day and th e date and time of 
collection of each sample will be recorded.  
The date and time of collection of each sample will be recorded .  
The timing of the PK samples may be  adjusted during the study, dependent on emerging data, 
in order to ensure appropriate characterisation of the plasma c oncentration-time profiles. The 
total number of samples and the  total volume of blood taken fro m each patient will not exceed 
that outlined in the Lab Manual. 
If a patient misses any doses  of RXC004 within 3 days of PK sam pling, please contact the 
Sponsor representative as to a ny effect on the changes required  on the timing of the PK 
assessments. All other assessmen ts, including laboratory safety  assessments, vital signs and 
RECIST should continue to be perfo rmed as per study plan, relat ive to baseline assessments. 
Samples will be collected, lab elled, stored and s hipped as deta iled in the Laboratory Manual.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  94 of 146  8.5.1.1 Determination of D rug C oncentration  
Samples for determination of RXC004 concentrations in plasma will be analysed using an 
appropriate bioanalytical method. Full details of the analytical method used will be described in a separate bioanalytical report.  
All samples still within the known stability of the analytes of interest at the time of receipt by the bioanalytical laboratory will be analysed. 
In addition, the pharmacokinetic samples may be subjected to further analyses in order to 
investigate the presence and/or identity of drug metabolites. Any results from such analyses 
will be reported separately from the Clinical Study Report.  
PK parameters will be estimated for each patient using WinNonlin® (Phoenix 64 V8 or 
higher) or suitable alternative. The following parameters will be derived, where appropriate, from the individual plasma concentration versus time profiles of RXC004.

 Statistical Hypotheses 
The statistical hypotheses for te sting the activity of monother apy and the combination 
independently are: 
H0 : pS0 
H1 : SS 1 
Where H0 is the null hypothesis, p is the observed response rate, p0 is the response rate for 
available treatment options –  , , H1 is the alternativ e hypothesis and 
p1 is the target response rate –  .  .  For RXC004 monotherapy the primary 
summary measure is the disease c ontrol rate (DCR) and the corre sponding  p0 and p1 are % % 
and %.  For the combination of  RXC004 and nivolumab the primary  summary measure is 
objective response rate (OR R) and the corresponding  p0 and p1 are % and %.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 100 of 146  Approximately  patients are exp ected to be enrolled in order fo r approximately 20 patients 
to be in the evaluable datas et in each treatment arm.
Note : "Enrolled" means the subject  has signed the main study ICF, c ompleted screening and 
been dosed. 
The intention of the trial is t o recruit patients with tumours with either RNF43 LoF mutation 
or RSPO fusion/translocation tum ours to ensure the optimum deci sion is made at the end of 
the trial.  If, after approxima tely half the pa tients have been  recruited it is f ound that patients 
with tumours harbouring RNF43 LoF  mutation or RSPO fusions domi nate recru itment and at 
that time the results are such there is a  % % probability of the  b  being met in 
patients with one of t he aberrations then r ecruitment may be fo cussed on patients with the 
alternative aberration.  For e xample, if all 10 patients in bot h arms have RNF43 LoF mutation 
tumours  and no patients respond on t he combination arm and/or 3 or less have disease control 
on the monotherapy arm then rec ruitment in one or both arms may  be focussed on patients 
with RSPO fusion/translocati on tumours and rec ruitment expanded  to allow 20 patients with 
RSPO fusion/translocati on tumours to be recruited.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  101 of 146  9.4.1 General Considerations 
The study data is planned to be analysed  and reported based on all subject data at the primary 
completion data cut -off date (approximately 24 weeks after cycle 1 day 1 for the last subject 
in), or at the End of Study, whichever comes first.   
All analyses, summaries and listings will be performed using SAS software (version 9.3 or 
higher).  For categorical variables the frequency and percentage will be presented.  For 
continuous variables, the sample size (n), mean, median, and standard deviation, as well as the minimum and maximum values will be presented.  Missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise stated.  
A baseline assessment will be defined as the last assessment performed prior to the first dose 
of study treatment.  While many of these assessments will be performed on the day of the first 
dose, others will be performed during screening.  If a patient is missing an asse ssment 
typically performed on the day of the first dose, screening values may be substituted as baseline  
Data will be presented separately for the m onotherapy arm and the combination arm.  There 
will be no formal comparisons of the results in the two arms .  ORR, DCR and PFS will be 
presented separately for the patients who received RXC004+nivolumab as combination therapy as sequential therapy after progression on RXC004 monotherapy at first RECIST 
progression scan.  
9.4.1.1 Patient Disposition  
Patient disposition will be presented together with withdrawals from treatments, withdrawals 
from the study, and the reason for withdrawal. 
9.4.1.2 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be collected and reviewed during the study. The final classification 
and effect  of each protocol deviation as well as the composite effect of a set of protocol 
deviations on analysis populations will be assessed prior to the database lock.  
9.4.1.3 Demographic and other baseline characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will b e summarised.  For continuous demographic 
variables, results will be summarized and presented as n, mean, standard deviations, median 
and minimum and maximum values.  For categorical variables the frequency and percentage 
of subjects will be used. 
9.4.1.4 Medical History  
Medical History will be coded according to the latest version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) . The number (percent) of patients reporting a history of any 
disease related medical condition, as recorded on the CRF, will be summarized by sys tem 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  102 of 146  organ class (SOC) and preferred  term (PT) for the FAS .   
9.4.1.5 Prior and concomitant therapy  
All investigator terms for medications recorded in the eCRF will be coded to standard names 
using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary and further coded to the appropriate 
Anatomical -Therapeutic- Chemical code.  
Prior medications will be defined as medications that stopped before the first dose of study 
drug and will be summarised and listed. 
Concomitant medications will be defined as medication s that (1) started before the first dose 
of study drug and were continuing at the time of the first dose of study drug or (2) started on 
or after the date of the first dose of study drug.  Concomitant medications will be summarised and listed. 
9.4.2 Efficacy  
9.4.2.1 Primary E ndpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint for the monotherapy arm is disease control rate and the primary endpoint for the combination arm is the objective response rate, both based on a individuals best overall response using investigator RECIST 1.1 assessments. 
Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall response of 
complete response or partial response, based on local investigator assessment, as defined in RECIST 1.1.  Confirmation of response is required for declaring PR or CR as the BOR.  A confirmed response is defined as a CR or PR followed by a CR or PR a least 4 weeks later.  
The ORR will be summarised with accompanying 90% confidence interval calculated using 
the Clopper Pearson method.  This will be calculated on the full analysis set and the evaluable analysis set with the evaluable analysis set calculation being considered primary. In the summary tables the incidence of unconfirmed responses will be presented as well as the 
patients with confirmed res ponses. 
Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of either CR, 
PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 16 weeks post baseline (corresponding to SD for 2 scheduled scans post baseline). A time window of 1 week around the week 16 visit will be 
applied.  The DCR and associated 90% confidence interval, calculated using the Clopper 
Pearson method will be presented.  This will be calculated on the full analysis set and the evaluable analysis set with the evaluable analysis set  calculation being considered primary. 
9.4.2.2 Secondary E ndpoint(s)  
Progression free survival is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment until the date of disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless 
whether  the subject withdraws from the assigned study treatment or receives another 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  103 of 146  anticancer prior to progression.  Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of 
analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of RECIST v1.1 assessment of their last evaluable scan, however if the subject progresses or dies after 2 or more missed scheduled 
scanning visits, the subject will be censored at the time of their last evaluable scan prior to the 
missing scan visits.  If the subject  has no evaluable visits or does not have baseline data they 
will be censored at 0 days unless they die within 2 scan visits of baseline.  Progression free 
survival will be listed by subject and will be presented graphically using Kaplan-Meier plots. 
Median PFS, together with 3 month, 6 month and 12 months PFS rates will be estimated. 
Percentage change in tumour size will be derived at each visit by the percentage change from 
baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions.  The best percentage change in tumour size will be the subjects value representing the largest decrease (or smallest increase) from baseline 
in tumour size. Best percentage change in tumour size will be presented in waterfall plots  and 
percentage change in tumour size at each visit will be presented in a spider plot. 
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
Overall survival is defined as the time from first day of study treatment until death due to any 
cause.  Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on 
the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive.  Overall survival will be listed by subject and presented graphically using Kaplan-Meier plots.  Median, 6 month and 
12 month OS rates will be estimated.

Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) ar e defined as those AEs with an  onset after dosing and 
those pre-existing AEs that wor sen after the start of dosing an d within 30 days of stopping 
RXC004 monotherapy or 90 days after t he last actual nivolumab d ose (for patients on 
RXC004 and nivolumab com bination).  For AEs, verbatim terms in the eCRF will be mapped 
to preferred terms and system or gan class using the Medical Dic tionary for Regulatory 
activities (version 22.0 or later) CTCAE criteria v5.0 will be used to grade the severity of AEs.  
The incidence of treatment eme rgent AEs will be summarised by p referred term and system 
organ class as well as severity.  Treatment related TEAEs will be summarised in the same way.  
Subject incidence of SAE s will also be produced. 
By subject listings of all AEs, d eaths, SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation will also be

Shift tables to characterize ch anges from baseline to on treatm ent will be presented for 
haematology, clinical chemistry a nd coagulation parameters.  La boratory tests with numerical 
grading criteria in the NCI C TCAE v5.0 will be graded according ly.  Grade 0 will be assigned 
for all non-missing values not grad ed as 1 or higher.  For labo ratory tests where grades are not 
defined by CTCAE v5.0 results will be  classified as low, normal  or high based on laboratory 
normal ranges, 
9.4.3.3   Vital signs 
Vital signs data will be presente d in listings.  Abnormal vital  signs values will  be identified as 
those outside (above or below) th e reference range.  Vital sign s data will be summarized using

 Safety Monitoring Committee 
A safety monitoring committee (SMC ) will be appointed to review  safety data from patients in 
this study and a second study of R XC004 in patients with pancre atic and biliary tract cancer 
(RXC004/0003).   
The SMC will comprise experts i n the disease areas under invest igation, who may be study 
investigators, a biostatisticia n and an independent bone metabo lism expert. The SMC will be 
convened to review the safet y and tolerability of RXC004 at reg ular intervals.   
 
The safety reviews will start when approximately y   patients across the  phase 2 clinical trial 
programme have been do sed for at least 1 c ycle of study treatme nt and will con tinue every 6 
months until the phase 2 studies c lose or last patient disconti nues study treatme nt (whichever 
occurs first).  A safety revie w of the combina tion data will be  conducted after   patients have 
received the combination of RXC 004 and nivolumab for at least 1  cycle.  Additional safety 
reviews may be performed at other times as deemed appropriate b y the Sponsor. 
 Since the studies are open lab el, there are no blinding issues associated with performing 
interim safety reviews.  Full de tails of the SMC procedures, pr ocesses, and analyses can be

documents (e.g., advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB/IEC by the investigator 
and reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC before the study is initiated.  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/IEC and a pplicable Regulatory 
Authority approval before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants.  
• Redx  will be responsible for obtaining the required authorisations to conduct the study 
from the concerned Regulatory Authority. This responsibility may be delegated to a CRO but the accountability remains with Redx . 
 
Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. 
• The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. 
• For all studies except those utilizing medical devices investigator safety reports must be 
prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local 
regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information ( e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the spons or will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, 
if appropriate according to local requirements.

Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed. 
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are 
not limited to:  
• Failure of the  investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC 
or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines 
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator 
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development 
 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research 
organization(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by 
the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow-up. 
A 9 Publication Policy  
• The data generated by this study are confidential information of the Sponsor. The Sponsor 
will make the results of the study publicly available. The publication policy with respect 
to the Investigator and study centre will be set forth in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
• The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support 
publication of multicentre studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In 
this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  111 of 146  Appendix  B Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
B 1 Definition of adverse events  
An adverse event is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a pa tient or 
clinical study participant  administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an  abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can incl ude a 
deterioration of a pre- existing medical occurrence . An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no Study treatment has been administered. 
B 2 Definitions of serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase ( i.e., run-in, treatment, 
washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -participant  hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospita lisation  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the participant  or may require medical 
treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Adverse Events (AEs) for malignant tumours  report ed during a study should generally be 
assessed as Serious AEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the  ‘Important Medical Event’ 
criterion should be used. In certain situations, however, medical judgement on an individual 
event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be assessed 
and reported as a Non-Serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history 
and progression occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumour, the AE may not fulfil  the attributes for being assessed as 
Serious, although reporting of the progression of the malignant tumour as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of malignant tumours, which do not spread remotely after a 
routine treatment that does not require hospitalization, may be assessed as Non-Serious; 
examples in adults include Stage 1 basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer 
removed via cone biopsy. 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  112 of 146  The above instruction applies only when the malignant tumour event in question is a new 
malignant tumour (i.e., it is not  the tumour for which entry into the study is a criterion and that 
is being treated by the IP under study and is not the development of new or progression of 
existing metastasis to the tumour under study). Malignant tumours that – as part of normal, if 
rare, progression – undergo transformation (e.g., Richter's transformation of B cell chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia into diffuse large B cell lymphoma) should not be considered a new 
malignant tumour. 
Life threatening  
‘Life -th
reatening’ means that the participant  was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
participant’s death . ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (e.g., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).  
Hospitalisation  
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the participant was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected way during the study. 
Important medical event or medical  treatment  
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopard ise the participant or may 
require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious. 
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. 
• Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment  
• Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation 
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  113 of 146  Intensity rating scale:  
The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute CTCAE latest version will 
be utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the recommendation in the CTCAE c riteria that converts mild, moderate and 
severe events into CTCAE grades should be used. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov). The applicable version of CTCAE should be described clearly.  
B 3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question  
When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there is a ‘ reasonable possibility’  that an AE may have been caused by the drug. 
• Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant  actually received the suspect 
drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? 
• Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties? 
• De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug? 
• No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such 
as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. 
• Re-challenge experience . Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped?  
• Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship . 
 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
• Is this a recogn ised feature of overdose of the drug? 
• Is there a known mechanism? 
 
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’  of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relat ionship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship. 
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  114 of 146  information to make an informed judgment. With no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’ . 
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility. 
B 4 Medication Error  
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for a Redx  study drug that either causes harm to the participant or has 
the potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study s ite staff or participant.  
Medication error includes situations where an error.  
• occurred  
• was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug  
• did not occur, but circumstances were recognised  that could have led to an error 
 
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: 
• Drug name confusion 
• Dispensing error e.g. medication  prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the participant  
• Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration  
• Drug not taken as indicated e.g. tablet  dissolved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet, tablet taken with food when it should be taken fasted.  
• Drug not stored as instructed e.g. kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature  
• Wrong participant received the medication  
• Wrong drug administered to participant  
 
Examples of events that do not  require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: 
• Participant accidentally missed drug dose(s) e.g. forgot to take medication  
• Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)  
• Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  115 of 146  • Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in 
open label studies 
 
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  116 of 146  Appendix  C Handling of Human Biological Samples  
C 1 Chain of custody  
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. 
The investigator at each centre keeps full traceability of collected biological samples from the 
patients  while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and 
records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site.  
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward shipment or disposal. 
Redx  or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal 
procedures, monitoring of study sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual 
requirements of external laboratory providers. 
Samples retained for further use w ill be stored in the Redx -assigned biobanks or other sample 
archive facilities and will be tracked by the appropriate Redx  Team for the remainder of the 
sample life cycle. 
C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples  
Redx  ensures that biological samples are returned to the source or destroyed at the end of a 
specified period as described in the informed consent. If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will 
be disposed of/destroyed/repatriated, and the action documented. If samples are already 
analysed , Redx  is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. 
Following withdrawal of consent for biological samples, further study participation should be 
considered in relation to the withdrawal processes outlined in the informed consent. 
The investigator: 
• Ensures participant’s’ withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
highlighted immediately to Redx  or delegate.  
• Ensures that relevant human biological samples from that participant, if stored at the 
study s
ite, are immediately identified, disposed of as appropriate, and the action 
documented. 
• Ensures that the participant and Redx  are informed about the sample disposal. 
 
Redx  ensures the organization(s) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  117 of 146  consent as soon as reasonably possible and that samples are disposed of or repatriated as 
appropriate, and the action documented and study site notified.

Guidance Document  
LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES  
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 
(https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Pages/download.aspx) classifies infectious 
substances into 3 categories: Category A, Category B or Exempt 
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life- threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens  are e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever virus. Infectious substances meeting these 
criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 2814. Infectious substances which cause disease only in animals must be assigned t o UN 
2900: 
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are e.g., Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses. They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name  
• UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B 
• are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 
 
Exempt - Substances which do not contain infectious substances or substances which are 
unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they 
meet the criteria for inclusion in another class.  
• Clinical study samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations  
• Clinical study samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in 
IATA 650 compliant packaging 
(https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Documents/DGR-60- EN-PI650.pdf).  
• Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification 
for the dry -ice content  
• files would remain physically separate.

Tumo urs) Responses  
 
 
Patients with symptomatically stable disease  may continue study treatment after the initial 
RECI ST 1.1 - defined progression until symptomatic progression or second RECIST 1.1 PD 
assessment  (relative to the initial RECIST1.1 progression for a given study treatment ).   A 
decision to continue study treatment after initial progression must be discussed and agreed by 
the treating physician and the Sponsor .   
The criteria for continuing treatment after initial RECIST 1.1-defined progression are as 
follows: 
• The patient does not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities indicating that continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient.  
• There is absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease 
progression accompanied by a decline in ECOG performance status>1.  Term  Definition  
Complete response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must 
have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial response (PR)  A ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, 
the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.  
Stable disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
New measureable lesions1 Always represents progressive disease (PD) 
New non-measureable lesions  Always represents progressive disease (PD)  
Non-index lesions  Changes contribute to defining best overall response of CR, PR, SD, and 
PD 
From RECIST v1.1  
1) Measureable lesion must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane 
of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan (CT slice thickness no 
greater than 5  mm)  
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  137 of 146  Appendix  I Dysgeusia treatment guidelines  
As there are no recognised standard international guidelines for the management of this 
multifactorial event, investigators are advised to consult their local practice guidelines for the management of dysgeusia. Please refer to Table  14 and Section 6.6 for instructions on dose 
reductions and interruptions for dysgeusia. 
Some interventions may be effective in treating dysgeusia: • Treatment with oral pilocarpine and artificial saliva may help in cases where there is also dry 
mouth • Zinc supplements may help in cases where there is evidence of zinc deficiency  
• Alpha lipoic acid is an antioxidant capsule supplement which may improve flavour sensation • Good oral hygiene and chlorhexidine (or similar) mouthwashes  Patients may be advised of some ways that they can manage dysgeusia, for example: 
• Cooking or eating food in non- metallic cookware  
• Avoiding foods that taste bitter or metallic  
• Flavouring foods with seasonings and spices 
• Eating food cold may help to reduce unpleasant flavour sensations 
• Frequently brushing teeth 
• Rinsing with mouth wash regularly • Using chewing gum. Lozenges or mints to stimulate saliva production  
A dysgeusia treatment algorithm has been developed by Sevryugin et al 2021 based on their 
review of published studies of dysgeusia interventions and is  included to assist investigators 
with the management of dysgeusia that occurs during treatment with RXC004.  However, it is acknowledged that not all of the management suggestions may be readily available or 
applicable to patients in this study.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  139 of 146  Appendix  J Management of Colitis Events  
In the Phase 1 study of RXC004, events of colitis or enteritis  were reported in 4 patients who 
commenced treatmen t at doses of 3 mg QD or 10 mg QD as a monotherapy. One event of 
ileitis has also been reported to date in this study.  
RXC004- related diarrhoea/ colitis may present as abdominal pain with other symptoms 
including intermittent constipation , diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomiting. In some cases, 
symptoms may be minimal.  Blood and mucus in the stool may not be apparent. 
Symptoms may be preceded by or accompanied by a raised CRP  and neutrophil count.  
If lower GI tract inflammation  is suspected, infectious and other causes should be excluded, 
including CMV and C .difficile .  Attempts should be made to definitively diagnose the 
condition with a CT scan, and colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy with biopsy , if clinically safe to do 
so. 
Nivolumab is known to cause Colitis (See Appendix G ) so patients receiving the combination 
of RXC004 and nivolumab may be at higher risk of this event. These guidelines are consistent 
with guidance for nivolumab-related colitis. However, for patients who are receiving RXC004 plus nivolumab, please also refer to the most current version of the nivolumab SPC/USPI. 
Management:  
Monitoring of CRP or fecal calprotectin levels may help to monitor the response to treatment.  Table  20 Management of colitis events 
Grade Management  
Grade 1 colitis  
[asymptomatic but evidence 
on CT scan] 
 Continue RXC004 at a lower dose and repeat the CT scan 
within 4 weeks. 
No action is needed for nivolumab.  
No additional treatment is indicated.  If the Grade 1 colitis  is 
evident on the second scan despite the lower dose of 
RXC004, it should be managed as Grade 2 colitis and the scan sh ould be repeated within 4 weeks. 
Grade 2 colitis  [abdominal 
pain, mucus or blood in 
stool] Pause RXC004  (and nivolumab if applicable)  
Manage with corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent. 
When symptoms have resolved, taper over 2-4 weeks. 

Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  140 of 146  Grade Management  
If symptoms recur during tapering, the steroid dose may 
need to be increased again.   
If no improvement in 72 hrs despite treatment, treat as 
Grade 3  
RXC004 can be restarted at a lower dose after colitis has 
resolved  to Grade ≤  1* and steroids tapered to physiological 
levels (<10  mg prednisone per day equivalent dose) over at 
least 1 month . 
If steroids cannot be tapered to physiological levels within 
12 weeks of commencing steroid treatment, then RXC004 (and nivolumab if applicable) should be permanently 
discontinued. 
Grade 3 colitis  [ severe or 
persistent abdominal pain, 
fever, ileus; peritoneal 
signs] Pause RXC004 (and nivolumab, if applicable) 
Seek sp ecialist advice  
Manage with corticosteroids at a dose of 1  mg/kg 
methylprednisolone equivalent.   When symptoms improve, taper steroids to physiological 
levels over 4 -8 weeks and consider use of prophylactic 
antibiotics and anti-fungals 
If the patient is r eceiving RXC004 as a monotherapy, 
RXC004 can be restarted at a lower dose after colitis has 
resolved  to Grade ≤  1* and steroids tapered to physiological 
levels (<10  mg prednisolone equivalent dose) . If the 
patient is receiving RXC004 in combination with nivolumab, both agents should be permanently discontinued  
If steroids cannot be tapered to physiological levels within 
12 weeks of commencing steroid treatment, then RXC004 
(and nivolumab, if applicable) should be permanently discontinued. 
Additional anti- inflammatory medications (e.g infliximab) 
may be indicated if no improvement in 48-72hrs. It is 
Clinical Study Protocol  Final Version 7.0 Redx Pha rma Plc  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  141 of 146  Grade Management  
important to rule out bowel perforation and refer to 
infliximab SMPC/USPI for general guidance before 
using infliximab 
If anti -inflammatories a re required, RXC004 (and 
nivolumab, if applicable) should be permanently 
discontinued. 
Grade 4 colitis  [life 
threatening consequences] Manage as per Grade 3 Colitis.  
RXC004 and nivolumab (if applicable) should be 
permanently discontinued.  
*Attempts should be made to confirm that the colitis has resolved to Grade ≤ 1  (e.g normalised CRP or fecal 
calprotectin if raised during event; GI appearance normalised on X ray/ CT or endoscopy) before restarting 
RXC004.  
 
If there is any recurrence of colitis ≥ Grade 2 after recommencing RXC004, RXC004 and 
nivolumab, if applicable should be permanently discontinued.

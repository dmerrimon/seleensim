Protocol:  8.4.2020 1.0  Introduction  
1.1  Study Conduct 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol approved by the Institutional Review 
Board, and according to Good Clinical Practice standards. No deviation from the protocol will be 
implemented without the prior review and approval of the IRB except where it may be necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to a research subject. In such case, the deviation will be reported to 
the IRB according to its policies and procedures.   
 
1.2  Background  
Despite many advances in imaging and thera py, prostate cancer remains the second most common 
cause of cancer -related death of men in the United States.  The management approach to men 
diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer remains a socioeconomic dilemma with no clear consensus 
whether prostatect omy or whole -gland radiation therapy improves outcomes and these treatments are 
often associated with significant long -term morbidity negatively impacting quality of life parameters 
that require long -term management. Another approach has been ‘active surve illance’ but often these 
men are under staged at the time of diagnosis, and will clinically progress and ultimately receive 
definitive therapy to the whole gland, while more frequently many men opt for partial gland ablative 
therapy with surveillance.   
 
Previous research has demonstrated the value of radiation dose escalation in patients with prostate 
cancer (Bolzicco 2010, Friedland 2009). However, to date, most paradigms have focused on dose 
escalation applied to the whole gland. It is recognized that hi gher doses to the whole gland are 
associated with higher treatment related toxicities (impotence, incontinence, rectal fissures) 
(Zelefsky). Now, with advanced delivery techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT), proton therapy, and st ereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) dose escalation can be 
achieved targeting sub -volumes of the prostate. Preliminary evidence suggests that sub -volume dose 
escalation based upon molecular and anatomical imaging may improve outcomes (Eggner 2007, Ell is 
2010). This research will evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for focal partial gland therapy in 
prostate cancer.  
 
There is growing concern over the risk of over treating patients who may not be at risk of dying from 
the disease. Prostate cancer r emains the sole malignancy where treatment is always delivered to the 
whole organ in routine practice. Many low risk patients therefore opt for Active Surveillance rather 
than immediate whole gland treatment to limit treatment related decrease in quality o f life associated 
with either surgery or whole gland radiation. A growing body of evidence also suggests that treatment 
of the dominant prostatic lesion/s may be sufficient to prevent systemic disease progression, and that 
small lesions less than 5 mm may be indolent, thus if left untreated initially may not be likely to 
progress in a clinically significant manor. Additionally once a dominate lesion is treated, the patient 
may return to a course of active surveillance using PSA, physical examinations, and r epeat MRI or 
biopsy as clinically indicated (Scardino 2009, Cosset 2013).  
 
Despite early success using molecular and anatomical data to identify sub -volumes of disease for 
image-guided therapy, physicians remain reticent to escalate dose based upon imaging findings alone, 
which are inherently limited by sensitivity and specificity (Ellis 20 10, Pinto 2011). Therefore, a 
treatment planning methodology that provided direct 3D spatial correlation of imaging sets with the 
gold standard of histopathology w ould be highly effective to exclude normal tissue (false positives 
by imaging) and simultaneously allow radiation dose escalation to clearly delineated “true positive” 
target volumes.  
CASE 11813                  Page 6 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 By using high resolution 3T MRI imaging with parametric sequencing to id entify areas suspicions 
for harboring malignancy, we believe that focal therapy could be safely delivered to property selected 
patients.  Biopsy confirmation of the imaging findings for both suspicious and non -suspicious regions  
based on MRI imaging would be used to confirm that cancer is present at the suspected locations 
using a patented methodology to define the treatment target volumes. Rather than treating the whole 
gland, therapy could then be targeted to partial prostate volumes with the goal of redu cing treatment  
related morbidity and long term  cost for treatment.  
 
A recent systematic review of the focal therapy in localized prostate cancer evaluated 2350 cases 
reported in 30 studies through October 2012, mainly delivered in low and intermediate dise ase, and 
some high -risk patients where imaging suggested unilateral disease. Post therapy incontinence, and 
erectile function toxicities were limited, with promising short - to medium term disease free survival 
outcomes (Valerio 2013). In a separate critica l appraisal of focal therapy for localized prostate cancer, 
Eggener et al. (representing an international multidisciplinary task force with expertise in prostate 
cancer) evaluated “the focal lesion paradigm” ( Eggener 2007) and the role of focal ablative th erapy. 
This review panel concluded with encouragement for prospective clinical research in emergent focal 
technologies for the treatment of unifocal and biologically unifocal prostate cancer – as needed 
options for men resistant to active surveillance and watchful waiting.  A number of other authors from 
major universities, have more recently reported good outcomes with whole -gland, unilateral and focal 
ablative cryotherapy applications. These authors list focal ablative options to include focused 
ultrasound, brachytherapy, thermotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery 
(Polascik 2008, Hou 2009, Pisters 2010, Boomers 2013). Radiation therapy is uniquely qualified for 
use in focal therapies as it stands alone as a standard of care for pros tate cancer treatment with long 
term outcomes showing safety and efficacy for whole gland disease control, and growing evidence 
with partial gland focal therapy (Ellis  2010, Katz 2010, Cossett 2013).  
 
Focal image -guided radiation therapy is a novel alternative that may provide a cost -effective and less 
morbid treatment option for men diagnosed with low -risk disease.  Conceptually, focal therapy targets 
only diseased prostatic tissue and spares adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissue which may be as 
efficacious as whole -gland therapy but with less side effects. Further, clinical evidence suggests that 
the α/β ratio of prostate cancer is quite low providing an opportunity for greater therapeutic gain with 
hypofractionated courses of radiotherapy compared to traditional fractionated treatment. The 
hypothesis of this proposal is multiparametric MR data including T2 weighted, contrast enhanced, 
and diffusion weighted imaging when correlated with marked histopat hology biopsy sites confirming 
tumor foci, will allow appropriate patient selection for focal radiation therapy with a higher sensitivity 
than routine MR imaging alone. Further, that using advanced imaging to guide dose modulation in 
focal stereotactic bod y radiation therapy (SBRT), also named stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, may 
provide equivalent outcomes to whole -gland therapy with shortened treatment courses and decreased 
toxicity. This prospective investigational review board (IRB) approved, single institution pilot study 
will be used to demonstrate clinical feasibility and may potentially lead to future federally funded 
Phase I/II and consortium supported multi -center clinical research trials for focal SBRT in localized 
low-risk prostate cancer pati ents.  
 
Most recently, parametric sequencing MRI have been reported to identify prostatic regions that are 
highly suspicious for tumor foci (Valerio 2013). The current study will be used to help select for the 
proper group of patients for whom focal therap y may be appropriately offered. Men who have a 
diagnosis of localized prostate cancer with only moderately elevated PSA and Gleason score of 7 or 
lower without either a dominate pattern 4 or a tertiary pattern 5 seen on initial pathology may be 
CASE 11813                  Page 7 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 eligible fo r evaluation, as these patients meet the institutional clinically accepted determination 
making them eligible for Active Surveillance (AS). Many men meeting AS criteria, however, prefer 
treatment with curative potential, and opt for partial gland therapy a iming at limiting potential 
treatment related toxicities that may be associated with treatment to whole gland. A staging 3T MRI 
is our adopted standard of care evaluation for men presenting for radiation therapy planning with 
parametric sequences. In the c urrent study we will use the staging and treatment planning images to 
evaluate regions highly suspicious for tumor foci as a screening tool for appropriateness of focal 
therapy and for eligible patients, for use in guided biopsy to confirm pathology on the  imaging studies.   
Standard radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer is delivered at 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction in a 
protracted course over 8 to 9 weeks to total doses in the range of 78 to 81 Gy. Following the published 
work of Hall and Brenner su ggesting that prostate cancer may have a lower alpha beta ration 
describing the cell line’s ability to repair damage caused by ionizing radiation; many centers have 
routinely adopted into clinical practice that prostate cancer may be treated using larger d oses per 
fraction ranging in size from 3 to 19 Gy in as many as 20 or as few as a single fraction of therapy 
(Brenner 1999) .  The assumption is that the alpha beta ration of most tumors is as high as 10, while 
the surrounding normal tissues at risk of late  radiation reactions is around 3 to 5 ( Yoshioka 2013). 
Positive histopathology findings on co -registered diagnostic MRI data sets (T2 and parametric  
functional imaging) will be used to segment a dominant biologic target volume and improve disease 
mapping a cross the gland. Subjects will then be treated in a series of three SBRT (typically every 
other day) treatments to deliver a total dose of 29.25 Gy in 9.75 Gy fractions, yielding a total biologic 
equivalent dose (BED) of 273.15 allowing dose to reach the d esired minimal BED of 268 with an 
assumed alpha beta of 1.2 for prostate cancer as suggested by Martinez (2011). A similar dose 
regimen has been published by Barkate et.al. using HDR brachytherapy in a three fraction dose 
escalation trial to deliver minima l dose of 30 Gy in 3 fractions over two days to a maximal dose of 
34.5 Gy at 11.5 Gy per fraction. ( Barkati 2012). While the published 3 fraction HDR regimen gave a 
minimal dose of 10 Gy, we feel that 9.75 Gy  per fraction is effectively equivalent when taking into 
account the additional 12 cGy per fraction we will be giving to allow for tracking of intrafraction 
prostate motion with Image Guided Radiation Therapy using a series of 4 cone beam CT image 
sessions obtained before, during and after each fraction, thus accounting for a daily fractionated dose 
of 987 cGy, or 9.9 Gy. What is uniquely novel in this protocol is not the total dose of radiation 
delivered but rather that it is to be delivered in a non -invasive fashion using SBRT, and more 
importantly delivered to a novel partial prostate volume using a patented methodology to define the 
volume at risk to be treated using focal therapy for prostate cancer. This methodology may be adopted 
as a template for dir ecting therapy to partial organ volumes using other treatment modalities based on 
the results of this trial if the use of tracked histopathology location is found to have significant 
influence on the selected treatment volumes in this study beyond what wou ld be used based on 
functional and anatomic imaging studies alone.  
2.0 Study Objectives  
Hypothesis:  Multiparametric MRI with histopathological correlation can be used to treat sub -
volumes of the prostate with focal SBRT in low - and intermediate -risk patients leading to equivalent 
outcomes as whole -gland therapy with reduced toxicity and improved quality of life.  
 
To validate the above hypothesis in this prospective study, the specific aims include:  
 
CASE 11813                  Page 8 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 1) Evaluate the correlation of histopathology findings in  comparison to regions of the prostate 
reported to be suspicious for harboring tumor burden on multiparametric MRI report/s;  
2)  Demonstration of the dosimetric and radiobiological advantages of focal SBRT versus 
whole-gland radiation therapy;  
3)  Evaluati on of clinical outcomes in focal SBRT for localized prostate cancer.  
 
3.0 Study Design  
3.1   General Design  
This 2-year pilot study will include patients with positive diagnostic prostate biopsy, with or without 
positive digital rectal exam (clinical stage T2a or T1cN0M0), Gleason score ≤7(3+4), with a PSA 
≤10ng/mL and routine imaging that includes bone scan and MRI of the pelvis.  
 
Patients eligible for either whole -gland therapy or active surveillance will be evaluated by staging 
MRI and the scan used to s creen for disease burden within the gland. Patients identified with a focal 
dominate lesion greater than 5 mm in size confirmed with imaging and biopsy will be eligible for this 
trial. Patients found to have no focal abnormalities will be offered other dis ease management options 
off study, such as active surveillance or whole gland therapy with traditional fractionated external 
beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and/or brachytherapy.  
 
Eligible patients (≤6 total per year) will sign consent to enroll and be trea ted with focal SBRT on 
study at a dose of 29.25 Gy in 3 fractions (9.75 Gy per fraction) to involved sub -volume of the prostate 
using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with the Synergy BMX2 with Agility collimator

 Minimum and maximum (1 -2) dominant intraprostatic tumor foci are suggested on MRI during 
screening  
 Visualization of the urethra on CT scan for treatment planning will be accomplished through 
fusion of pelvic MRI with CT simulation images.  
 Baseline testosterone  
CASE 11813                  Page 12 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020  In addition to standard of care IPSS and SHIM questionnaires, EPIC, EQ5D, and Utilization of 
Sexual Medications/Devices Suppleme nt will be obtained at baseline, and 6, 12 and 24 months 
post end of radiation therapy.  
 
6.1.1 Description of Radiation Therapy  
Radiation treatment will be delivered using Elekta  S Agility, LINAC -based technology (SBRT). Prior 
to SBRT 3 -5 fiducial markers will be placed in the prostate for image guidance during radiation 
therapy. Fiducial marker placement will be conducted using standard of care FDA approved 
ultrasound guidance de vice and will incorporate findings from MRI image sets to guide the selection 
of biologic target volumes suggested on imaging to represent tumor burden within the prostate. If 
eligible, patient may also have a hydrogel spacer placed to maximally spare the rectum, as per 
standard of care.  At least 1 week will elapse between fiducial marker  and hydrogel spacer  placement 
and treatment planning simulation to allow for fiducial settling and any potential for migration. Using 
a LINAC -based SBRT system, the techn ique of motion control will be abdominal compression and 
/or rectal balloon, combined with 4D CT simulation. This information related to treatment and 
treatment planning will be recorded and processed in the UHCMC Seidman Cancer Center 
Department of Radiat ion Oncology password protected electronic medical record per institutional 
policy. 
 
Imaging the Prostate  
All patients will undergo a Serum Creatinine clearance study prior to MRI exams. Patients who are 
unable to undergo a staging MRI scan with contrast d uring screening will not be eligible for the study. 
Prior to radiation therapy, all patients will have a staging 3T MRI (utilizing a body coil) of the pelvis 
to include standard (T2 weighted) and multiparametric MRI sequences (to include Dynamic Contrast 
Enhanced and Diffusion Weighted scans or mpMRI) with gadolinium contrast. Axial, sagittal and 
coronal MRI scans are required for all MRI scans.

Each patient  will have a treatment planning simulation prior to delivery of SBRT at least 1 week 
following the insertion of radio -opaque fiducial markers implanted in the pro state for target 
localization and daily set up during fractionated dose delivery. A custom mad e immobilization device 
consisting of a whole body vac bag and vacuum wrapping (Medical Intelligence BodyFix) will be 
made for every patient. A CT scan with and without contrast of the pelvis will be performed with the 
immobilization device in place. If th e patient is not a candidate for CT contrast, non -contrast CT will 
be performed. Treatment planning CT scans must take into account the respiratory motion. A 4DCT 
or combination of end -inspiration and end -expiration CT scans will be taken.  A treatment pla nning 
MRI (with contrast is preferred and using standard MRI and mpMRI sequences as described above 
for the staging MRI) will be acquired following placement of fiducial markers and prior to delivery 
of SBRT. A rectal balloon may be used during simulation and treatment, as tolerated by each subject.  
 
Dose Specifications  
Radiation will be delivered in to 29.25 Gy in 3 fractions (9.75 Gy per fraction) to involved sub -
volume/s of the prostate using VMAT by the Synergy S with Agility collimator (Elekta, Stockho lm, 
Sweden and Atlanta, GA) as focal therapy. Dose escalation to organs -at risk surrounding the prostate 
target volume is not allowed. Dose constraints of normal tissues surrounding the target will be set to 
limit toxicity. Although this three fraction SBR T regimen is novel, the tolerance levels selected for the 
normal organs are consistent with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol RTOG 0938  
CASE 11813                  Page 13 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 “A randomized phase II trial of hypofractionated radiotherapy for  favorable risk prostate cancer”  
( Hhttp://www.rtog.org/ClinicalTrials/ProtocolTable/StudyDetails.aspx?study=0938 H accessed 
12/09/2013)  and selected to provide the minimal Biological Equivalent Dose (BE D) or Equivalent 
Dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) felt to be required at a high dose per fraction to provide a high 
likelihood for tumor control as noted above in the concluding paragraph of the introduction (page 9).   
 
This protocol requires the use of SBRT  that uses inverse treatment planning (dose specifications are 
provided below in further detail). It is thought that SBRT treatment plans and delivery for this pilot 
series may be achievable without increase in normal tissue toxicity compared to whole orga n 
treatment using either SBRT or HDR brachytherapy as defined above.  If a patient is determined to 
have failed therapy using acceptable clinical standards, such as the Phoenix definition (a rise in PSA 
following nadir of 2 ng/mL) or biopsy proven locally recurrent or persistent disease, the patient may 
be offered other curative therapy or therapies off study, depending on the patient’s clinical status and 
intent to treat.  
 
Dose Coverage  
The isodose  line used for the prescription dose should cover a minimum of 95% of the PTV. This will 
be recorded in the Department electronic medical record for each patient.  
 
Minimum Dose  
The minimum dose within the PTV to a point that is 0.03 cc in size must be ≥95%  of the prescribed 
dose. This will be recorded in the electronic medical record for each patient.  
 
Critical Structures  
Critical Organ Dose -Volume Limits  
The normal tissue volume to be contoured will include bladder, rectum, bilateral femora (to the level 
of ischial tuberosity), seminal vesicles, penile bulb, neurovascular bundles, skin, and urethra. The 
normal tissues will be contoured and considered as solid organs rather than contouring the bladder 
and rectal walls. The bladder should be contoured from it s base to the dome. The rectum should be 
contoured from the anus (at the level of the ischial tuberosities) for a length of 15 cm or to the 
rectosigmoid flexure. This generally is below the bottom of the sacroiliac joints. The tissue within the 
skin and ou tside all other critical normal structures and PTVs are designated as unspecified tissue. 
These data will be recorded in the electronic medical record for each patient.  
 
Supportive Measures  
Urinary 
Symptomatic urinary medicines, (e.g. tamsulosin) are allow ed at the discretion of the treating 
radiation oncologist or urologist.  
 
Bladder 
Patients will be asked to have a full urinary bladder both during simulation and treatment. Consistent 
bladder filling procedure should be used for an individual patient for simulation and for each 
treatment. Bladder filling may be achieved by asking patie nts to drink 16 -24 oz of water or other fluid 
2-3 hours prior to treatment and to not urinate between this time and treatment as they are able.  
 
Bowel 
Patients will be advised to adhere to a low gas, low motility diet commencing one day prior to the 
treatment. One tablespoon of Milk of Magnesia will be taken the night before the simulation and the 
CASE 11813                  Page 14 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 night before each treatment. One Fleet’s enema will be administered 2 -3 hours before the simulation 
and each treatment. Rectal balloons may be used when patients tolerate, both for simulation and 
during treatments at the discretion of the Radiation Oncologist.  
 
Supportive measures will be recorded in the usual fashion in the electronic medical record.

Protocol:  8.4.2020 Technical Factors  
Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment  
This protocol will require treatments to be performed with an image -guided technique with the use of 
a 3-D coordinate system define d by 3D sub -volume/s of the prostate using VMAT by the Synergy S 
Agility collimator (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden and Atlanta, GA). A computerized method for image 
registration is required for determination of the patient shift information. Serial MRI images with 
parametric sequencing will be used both to evaluate intra fraction response and post therapy response. 
The intrafraction image (between the second and third fraction) will be evaluated for yield in intra -
therapy response, that may be useful future in clinical applications such as in MRI -Linac based 
adaptive radiotherapy planning. Post therapy serial MRI will also be used to evaluate radiographic 
determined response to therapy, versus pre and mid treatment scans and as compared to clinical 
features such  as PSA follow -up.  
 
All available image sets will be co -registered using clinical software such as MIM Maestro (MIM 
software, Cleveland, OH) and PercuNav (Invivo, Gainsville, FL) and/or evaluated using our available 
in-house developed software for image r egistration verification, as is customary for clinical cases. 
Imaging data will thus be transferred to our Linac based treatment planning system Pinnacle, Philips 
Medical Systems (Cleveland, OH) for SBRT delivery. We will also use 3D cone -beam kV CT for 
alignment of in-vivo fiducials to track and adjust for internal target motion detection.  
 
As previously described (6.1 Description of Radiation Therapy) a minimum of three and maximum 
of five radio -opaque fiducial markers will be inserted in to the prostate for use in fractionated dose 
target positioning during SBRT (delivered in three fractionated doses on 3 different days, typically 
every other day). At least one fiducial marker for treatment planning will be guided to a prostatic 
region reported on mpMRI t o be highly suspicious for tumor burden.  
 
For patients who have not previously received a targeted biopsy (in -gantry MRI or US-MRI fusion), 
during this fiducial marker placement procedure, and just prior to needle insertion to place the fiducial 
marker, a  guided biopsy will be targeted to the location of disease suggested by mpMRI using FDA 
approved devices for image guided biopsy procedures. An FDA approved sterile surgical needle will 
be introduced either transrectally or transperineally through which th e biopsy needle will pass. 
Following extraction of tissue sample, a fiducial marker will be placed in each of 3 -5 biopsy cavities 
and recorded for spatial in-vivo orientation with to the anatomic and functional image sets (US, CT, 
MRI and mpMRI).  
 
If additional mapping biopsies are necessary,  other sextant regions of the prostate reported as normal 
by screening MRI will be biopsied as is typical for a mapping biopsy procedure to improve disease 
staging and localization of true positive disease during the s creening procedure. Thus, a total of 12 to 
15 biopsies will be obtained from each patient for screening eligibility to aid in a determination of 
likelihood that disease is not multifocal and to enable delivery of focal partial organ therapy. Each 
biopsy site will be tracked using a combination of permanent and virtual fiducial markers. Virtual 
markers will be electronically tracked in the regions suggested to be negative for the presence of 
disease on imaging at the sites of all other sextant biopsy locatio ns using the biopsy needle tip as a 
temporary fiducial imaged by ultrasound at the time of biopsy and fused back to the mpMRI and 
planning CT scan if the patient goes on to be treated on protocol.  
 
It should be noted that the permanent fiducial markers pl aced for screening would not preclude 
prostatectomy, or could be used for directing radiotherapy if the patient is found to be ineligible for 
CASE 11813                  Page 16 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 partial prostate treatment based on more extensive pathology being found on the screening biopsy. 
Conversely, shou ld the patient elect to remain in active surveillance despite qualifying for the 
protocol, the fiducials would serve to help direct subsequent biopsies required for active surveillance.  
Inserted permanent fiducial markers will satisfy the following requirements for prostate cancer: (1) 
good radiographic visibility on kV imaging/diagnostic Xrays, (2) minimal distortion of delivered 
dose, (3) minimal artifacts on MRI and CT images used for treatment planning, and (4) minimal 
migration during treatment. Temporary markers (biopsy needle tip tracking) will be used to track 
mapping biopsy locations (≤12 additional sites) and all biopsy locations will be recorded and tracked 
for in-situ position and for subsequent correlation to pathology findings and sequential MRI scans. 
Individual biopsy tissue samples will be labeled and processed by the institution’s clinical pathology 
laboratory for prostate biopsy reporting.  
 
Three D (3D) mapping will be us ed with SBRT using cone beam CT (CBCT). Doses reported for kV 
cone beam CT on the Elekta Synergy machine are in the range of <3 cGy per image Alaei (2010).  
The doses for 3D imaging systems are anticipated in this study to be around 12 cGy per fraction 
assuming 4 CBCT’s daily during treatment cGy. Thus one may assume that the total dose delivered 
daily may actually be at least 9.87 cGy when taking into account the prescribed dose of 9.75 Gy and 
the 12 cGy daily IGRT. This would yield a total BED of 273.15 f or an alpha beta of 1.2 allowing us 
to reach the desired minimal BED of 268 suggested by Martinez (2011).  
 
Localization  
We will use a set -up CBCT, as well as repeat CBCT after every 3.25 Gy and following completion 
of therapy daily to assess intrafraction  prostate organ motion. One goal of the project will be to use 
these data to assess the need for continuous IGRT such as that achievable with MRI Linac based 
SBRT applications. The Hexapod couch will be used to correct for rotation using the fiducial marke rs 
for each IGRT image set during treatment. A minimum of 4 IGRT CBCT’s will be acquired daily as 
initial setup and after every 3.25 Gy has been delivered to assess intrafraction prostate motion. At the 
discretion of the radiation oncologist/physicist, mon itoring of intrafraction motion may be required 
more frequently.  
 
Imaging studies for staging, treatment planning and response to therapy monitoring  
 
Multiparametric and Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( mpMRI) 
Prior to radiation therapy, all patients will have standard of care staging and treatment planning MRI’s 
of the pelvis, with contrast unless clinically contraindicated, using standard morphologic imaging 
sequences, per institutional standard of care imaging protocols for anatomic detail and localization. 
Additional functional mpMRI sequences will also be acquired and evaluated to enable morphologic 
and/or quantification of various tissue parameters as are routinely ordered prior to radiation therapy.  
The duration of the entire mpMR imaging procedure (patie nt on the scanner table) will be no longer 
than at total of 90 minutes, which is within the range for a standard single diagnostic MRI scan. 
Quantitative MRI data may include analysis of some or all of the following parameters:  
  
Diffusion weighted imagin g (DWI):  
 Measurement of b -value assesses different levels of diffusivity within tumor tissue and normal 
tissue.  
 Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) will be calculated as a quantitative measure from 
multiple b -values by measurement of ROI in the target l esion.   
CASE 11813                  Page 17 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020  Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE -MRI): 
 Typical quantitative parameters will be obtained describing tissue enhancement pattern and 
perfusion, contrast agent exchange rates of tissues and distribution of contrast between the 
various tissue spaces  using standard evaluation models.  
 Quantitative assessment will be performed with post processing techniques as commercially 
available as well as post processing software under investigation or development to 
demonstrate feasibility with currently availab le and future techniques.  
  
These sequences will be recorded for virtual comparison to the standard MRI sequences to determine 
if the investigational functional data correlates with histopathology data, and to determine if these 
data would have changed th e radiation therapy contouring and dose delivery. Any change in treatment 
planning due to functional MRI versus standard sequences alone will be recorded, and evaluated for 
utility in the determination of tumor response to therapy.  
 
Target Delineation  
All clinically relevant radiologic images will be transferred to the Radiation Oncology Pinnacle 
(Philips, Cleveland, OH) treatment -planning system. Using the various MRI sequences and the CT 
image data sets, a composite gross tumor volume (GTV) will be genera ted. The focal GTV will be 
contoured and approved by the attending radiation oncologist and urologist. The 4D CT will be fused 
with the treatment planning CT and an internal target volume (ITV) will be generated. The location 
of tumor foci from each positi ve biopsy core will also be segmented and expanded by 5mm to add to 
the PTV along with imaging data sets. An additional 0.3 -0.5 cm margin will be placed around the 
image data set ITV to generate a final PTV to account for set -up variation. The use of abdom inal 
compression may be used to decrease the volume of ITV since there is no real -time target tracking. 
Surrounding normal structures, including the rectum, small bowel, bladder, femora, seminal vesicles, 
penile bulb, and skin will be contoured. Skin is de fined as a 0.5 cm concentric ring beneath the skin.   
 
Mid Treatment and Post SBRT (MRI) with multiparametric sequences (mpMRI)  
Each subject will be offered up to 4 additional MRI scans: 1 during therapy (between the 2nd and 3rd 
fractionated treatments), a t 6 months following the end of radiation therapy, and again at 12 and 24 
months. All mpMRI will be requisitioned in the same manner as described above (Staging MRI) as 
described above at page 16 (6.1 Imaging the Prostate ), with the exception that contrast  with 
gadolinium is preferred. If patients are unwilling or clinically unable to undergo contrast or have all 
follow-up MRI scans, the patient will remain on study and followed for PSA response and toxicity 
outcomes .   
 
Computed Tomography (CT)  
CT will be fused with MRI scans and used as a primary image platform for treatment planning. It is 
preferred that CT with contrast be acquired, unless clinically contraindicated. The simulation should 
be performed in the supine treatment position, in the custom made immobilization device, with the 
fiducial markers and rectal balloon in place (where utilized). Axial cuts of 2.0 mm or less will be 
acquired throughout the pelvis and prostate from the top of the iliac crests superiorly to the perineum 
inferiorly.  
 
Contrast 
CASE 11813                  Page 18 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 CT scans with and without IV contrast are required, unless contraindicated. Dose calculations will be 
based on the non -contrast study, and the contrast study if obtained will be used to delineate prostate 
and surrounding organs at risk including bladder.  
 
6.2  Radiation Therapy Adverse Events  
All patients will be seen in the radiation oncology department during radiation therapy. Any 
observations regarding radiation reactions will be recorded and should include attention to the 
following potential side ef fects: 
 Small bowel or rectal irritation manifesting as abdominal cramping, diarrhea, rectal urgency, 
proctitis, or hematochezia  
 Bladder complications including urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract 
infection, and incontinence  
 Radiation dermatitis  
 
Clinical discretion may be exercised to treat side effects from radiation therapy. Examples of typical 
medications used in the management of side effects, such as diarrhea, include diphenoxylate or 
loperamide. Bladder or rectal spasms are us ually treated with anticholinergic agents or tolterodine.  
Bladder irritation may be managed with phenazopyridine. Erectile dysfunction is often treated with 
medical management or mechanical devices. A record of the incidence and management of side 
effects will be recorded in the electronic medical record as a usual course of care and the data will be 
reported in a Case Report Form.  
 
Definition of an Adverse Event (AE): Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment 
or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure 
(attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). [CTEP, NCI Guide lines Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements. January 2005; http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html]  
  
Definition of an SAE: Any adverse experience occurring during any part of protocol treatment and 
30 days after that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse experience  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE, when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
the definition.  
 
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4 for reporting of adverse events (AEs). The CTCAE version 4 is identified and located on 
the CTEP web site at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelo pment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.

9.0  Safety and Effectiveness Assessments  
The primary goal of this  pilot study is to determine if MRI with multiparametric sequences mpMRI 
can be used a s a mapping tool for correlation with histopathology results, providing a more informed 
method for the delivery of focal hypofractionation treatments. Hypofractionated radiation using 
SBRT is a promising tool for delivery with intent to cure. The use of fo cal partial prostate SBRT 
should show lower toxicity, and will be evaluated for equivalent efficacy. A co -primary end point of 
the pilot study will be to show that patients maintain acceptable HRQOL status as compared to 
baseline. There will be two co - primary endpoints based on summary scores from the bowel and 
urinary domains of the EPIC questionnaire. Although HRQOL is collected at multiple time points, it 
has been decided that EPIC, EQ D5 and Sexual Medication/Device Screening data collected at 6, 12 
and 24 months post therapy will be compared to baseline to test the primary hypothesis. The 
percentage of patients with change in EPIC bowel domain score (baseline to 1 -year) that was worse 
than 5 points and a change in EPIC urinary domain score that was wor se than 2 points are felt to be 
clinically meaningful endpoints to assess for tolerability and safety. A rate for the worse -than-5 point 
change in bowel score of up to 35% of patients will be considered acceptable, with a rate ≥55% 
specified as unacceptabl e. Similarly, a rate for the worse -than-2 point change in urinary score of up 
to 40% will be considered acceptable, with a rate ≥60% unacceptable. The PSA results along with 
serial MRI assessments will be used to test the hypothesis of equivalent disease c ontrol compared to 
historical data for whole gland therapy using SBRT. Standard of care quality of life assessments 
International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) scores will 
be acquired as part of the standard care prior to and following SBRT. When collected, this data will 
be collected and reported.  
Analysis of the Primary Endpoints  
Treatment efficacy will be analyzed through PSA response, clinical exam, with the addition of serial 
MRI evaluations. Confirmation of m ultiparametric MR targets for focal SBRT with image guided 
biopsy, histopathology and fiducial marker position tracking will be evaluated for reporting accuracy 
of multiparametric and standard MRI sequences to detect disease. Prostate MRI including T2 -
weighted, contrast -enhanced, and diffusion weighted imaging along with computer aided detection 
(CAD) may be used to identify suspicious lesions for targeted biopsy and fiducial placement.  Chi -
square and cluster analysis will be used to correlate degree of su spicion on MR pulse sequences with 
incidence of cancer detected on biopsy and subsequently targeted for focal therapy.  Post therapy 
MRI will be used to report response to therapy as either complete, partial, stable or progressive by 
RECIST criteria.  
9.1  Safety and Efficacy Endpoints  
Assessment of early clinical outcomes in focal SBRT for low risk prostate cancer patients.  Twenty -
four hormone naïve low to intermediate risk prostate cancer patients will be screened for PSA level, 
acute toxicities and quality of life (QOL) measures at baseline and twelve will be followed at 
longitudinal follow -up appointments.  
 
CASE 11813                  Page 25 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 Acute and Late GI and GU Adverse Events (AEs)  
Adverse events are evaluated by the CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE). We will record in Oncore the highest grade reported during a reporting 
period. The treatment -related attribution includes definitely, probab ly or possibly related to treatment. 
An acute adverse event is defined as the first occurrence of worst severity of the adverse event ≤30 
days after the completion of RT. We will evaluate the acute radiation therapy -related adverse events. 
Specifically, we  are interested in the percentage of acute GI and GU Grade 3+ adverse events that 
may occur, which is considered to be similar to the high RT dose arm of RTOG 0126 in terms of RT 
dose. If our partial prostate hypofractionated regimen has an acceptable perc entage, then it will be 
deemed to have an acceptable adverse event profile. We will report the percentage for the regimen as 
well as the one -sided 97.5% confidence interval. For example, the number of patients in the high dose 
arm of RTOG 0126 Phase II rep orted that 1% of patients experienced Grade 3+ GI/GU acute toxicity, 
with no patient experiencing Grade 4 or 5 toxicities (citation) should be greater than this pilot study. 
A late adverse event is defined as the first occurrence of worst severity of adver se event >180 days 
after RT completion. Late Grade 3+ GU/GI toxicity information will be collected and reported also.  
 
PSA Failure  
Failure occurs when the PSA is first noted to be 2 ng/mL or more than the patient’s nadir value post 
RT completion (Phoenix , Abramowitz 2009). PSA failure at 6, 12 and 24 months following RT will 
be estimated for the series by the cumulative incidence method (Gray 1988). Also, confidence 
intervals will be reported.  
 
Disease-Free Survival (DFS)  
The disease -free survival duration  will be measured from the date of treatment to the date of 
documentation  of disease progression or until the date of death from any cause. DFS at 6, 12 and 24 
months for each patient and the series by the Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan 1958). Also, 95% 
confidence intervals will be reported.  
 
Analysis for Endpoints Related to HRQOL  
We will use three instruments to measure HRQOL: the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 
(EPIC), the Utilization  of Sexual Medications/Devices, and EQ -5D. Protocol eligible pati ents will be 
included in the HRQOL analysis only if they have provided baseline and at least one subseque nt 
measurement.  All HRQOL instruments (EPIC, the Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices and 
EQ-5D) will be collected on all cases participating in the trial. The standard departments QOL 
instruments may also be used to report outcomes with both the International Prostate Symptom Score 
(IPSS) and Sexual Health Information Measurement (SHIM) obtained from chart review.  
The EPIC Supplement Utilization o f Sexual Medications/Devices, and EQ -5D will be collected at 
pretreatment (baseline) and at 6, 12 and 24 months after radiation therapy ends. Patient self -
assessment of symptoms will be performed using four primary EPIC scales: urinary, bowel, hormonal 
and sexual symptoms. The Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices and EQ -5D Questionnaires are 
found in Appendix 3.  
For all primary HRQOL analyses we will estimate the degree of change from baseline to 6, 12 and 
24 months  as continuous variables. For this e ndpoint, in each domain, the actual change score will be 
used as the statistic and a t -test will be used to evaluate if the change is different from 0. Confidence 
intervals also will be computed  
CASE 11813                  Page 26 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 The primary objective in HRQOL analysis is to estimate the c hange from baseline to 24 months.  The 
response will be the change of measurement from baseline to 24 months (or the last available HRQOL 
data point where data are missing). The one -sample t- test will be used to test the null hypothesis that 
response chan ge is 0. For the regimen to maintain the overall significance level for testing three 
HRQOL instruments. In addition, we will describe the distributions of HRQOL data collection 
patterns over all collection points in each treatment arm.   
Demonstrate dosim etric and biological advantage of focal SBRT versus whole -gland therapy  
Treatment plans from focal versus simulated whole -gland SBRT for each patient will be compared 
for target volume size, dose distribution, and dose reduction to organs at risk (OAR). Ad ditional 
assessments  for planning volumes based solely  on imaging versus with correlated histopathology to 
define PTVs will be collected, evaluated and reported. Biological modeling will be used to evaluate 
tumor control probability and normal tissue compl ication probability (NTCP) betw een the two 
treatment paradigms  (focal versus virtual simulation of whole gland treatment using conventional 
treatment per institutional standards). Standard independent methods of dosimetry calculations will 
be evaluated by Medical Physics staff and reported by Medical Physics co -investigators, utilizing 
such programs as Pinnacle and MUcheck, and Monte Carlo simulations. Subject data sets 
appropriately de -identified by a stu dy co-author may be additionally evaluated utilizing  advanced 
software MRI analysis for predictive modeling and comparison to tumor volume selection as 
identified with histopathology validation.  
We estimate that 12 patients will be treated on study, and that 24 patients may be screened. MRI 
and histopathol ogy data will be collected for all patients consented to the study and screened.  
Interim Reports to Monitor Study Progress  
Patients will have imaging sessions (MRI and CT Simulation) for treatment planning and delivery of 
radiation therapy. Interim imaging reports  will be provided to the funding partners following the first 
3-6 subjects screened, along with case study descriptions, and limited de -identified treatment plan 
screen shots along with composite image sets. Other interim reports will evalua te workflow and 
carepath processes.  
 
9.2 Effectiveness Assessments  
Clinical information from subjects will be recorded onto Case Report Forms and subsequently 
transferred into OnCore.  Patients who additionally consent to a separate Urology Registry will h ave 
their data added to the Urologic Oncology & Minimally Invasive Therapies Database for UHHS 
Faculty. 
 
Should any unanticipated adverse events occur during the course of the study, the clinical research 
coordinator will ensure that they are documented by  the investigator and reported to the appropriate 
Institutional Review Board per its then -current gui delines.  If the determination is made that an 
unanticipated adverse event presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the clinical evaluation will be 
paused, or if deemed appropriate (to enable further investigation), the subject will be withdrawn as 
soon as safely possible.   
 
Adverse events, grade 3 and above, will be captured in OnCore and will be reported in accordance 
with the Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan (DSMP) that is approved by the Cancer Center Protocol 
Review and Monitoring Committee (and aligned with the NCI -approved plan).   
CASE 11813                  Page 27 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, subject PSA, DRE and PSA data will be recorded in Oncore  as 
evaluations for response to radiation therapy, per standard of care procedure during post radiation 
therapy follow -up visits. In addition  to PSA and DRE evaluations, RECIST (v.1.1) measurements 
will be acquired using mpMRI surveillance. Response and pr ogression will be evaluated in this study 
using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228 -247, 2009]. Changes in the largest 
diameter (unidimensiona l measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. We will also analyze volumetric response to 
therapy based on serial MRI data that will be evaluated using radiation oncology  treatment planning 
computers.  
 
Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity All patients will be evaluable for acute toxicity within 90 days from the time 
of the end of the course of radiation therapy.  
 
Evaluable for objective response   
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disea se Response  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable, but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have completed a course of SBRT, 
and have had their disease re -evaluated by imaging will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of 
the lesions.   
 
Disease Parameters   
Radiologic Surveillance  
Standard of care f ollow-up post RT will include contrast enhanced MRI and parametric imaging 
unless clinically contraindicated should include contrast.   
 
Measurement of Response  
Measurement of Response Prior to Study Entry  
The revised RECIST guideline, v. 1.1. [European J of Cancer. 45: 228 -247, 2009] will be used  as 
applicable to the protocol. See 
Hhttp://ctep.info.nih.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/recist_guideline.pdf H for further detail s. 
Additional definitions beyond the RECIST guidelines specific to this protocol are incorporated to 
define local control as described below (Eisenhauer 2009). We will evaluate and report RECIST 
measures minimally at 12 and 24 months post radiation therapy .  
 
Response Criteria: Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target  
    lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of  
    target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on   
    study (includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest  
  on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm. The appearance of new lesion(s).  
 
CASE 11813                  Page 28 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient  
    increase to qualify for PD, taking the smallest sum diameters as  
    reference while on study.  
 
3D Lesion Volumes 
In addition to RECIST criteria evaluation on follow -up scans, we will report 3 D volumetric data of 
individual lesions based on pre and post treatment images over time, for comparison to 2 D RECIST 
measurements (Guiou 2012 and Eisenhauer 2009).  
 
Measurable Disease  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter for non -nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions to be 
recorded) as > 20 mm by chest x -ray, as > 10 mm with CT scan,  or > 10 mm with calipers by clinical 
exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Non-measurable disease  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (< 5 mm 
longest diameter) wi ll be considered non -measurable disease. The presence of lymph nodes 
suspicious for metastatic disease during screening will be defined as an ineligibility criterion.   
 
Target lesions   Only a single target lesion which is biopsy positive will be selected for focal therapy 
and identified as the dominant target lesion and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesion 
should be selected on the basis of size (lesions with the longest diamete r). We will use T2 weighted 
MRI image sets with contrast for the baseline measurement.  
 
Non-target lesions   All other suspicious lesions should be identified as non-target lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment. The 
same method of assessment and technique should be used to characterize the dominant lesion at 
baseline and during follow -up. Use of 3T MRI T2 scans with contrast is required for the baseline 
measurement and is the preferred method and technique for all imaging -based evaluations. The 
mpMRI image data will additionally be recorded, evaluated and reported separately.  
 
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target lesions  
 
Response  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in 
short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the 
CASE 11813                  Page 29 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.   
Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target lesions less than 5mm and /or detected on screening biop sy to involve less 
than 5% of the submitted tissue for carcinoma.  
 
Response  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 
10 mm short axis).  
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, 
they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  
 
 Non-CR/ Non-PD 
[Incomplete response/ Stable 
Disease (SD)]  
 Persistence of  one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal 
progression  should not normally trump target lesion status. It must 
be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase. 
 
Although a clear progression of ‘non -target’ lesions only is 
exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician shou ld prevail in 
such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed 
at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement an d confirmation criteria.

deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

RECIST (Eisenhauer 2009) Tumor Response  
Tumor measurements will be defined by the PI or treating physician, and confirmed by an objective 
radiation oncologist or radiologist not associated with this study.   
 
Duration of overall response :   The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for stable disease (SD), partial re sponse (PR) or complete response (CR) 
- whichever is first recorded, until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment st arted) 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until 
the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. CR will be reported as unconfirmed 
CR until a repeat image shows duration of res ponse. 
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria 
for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started, including the baseline measureme nts.

Protocol:  8.4.2020 Biochemical Disease -Free Survival: The absence of PSA Clinical Nadir plus 2 ng/mL (Phoenix, 
Abramowitz  (2007). 
 
10.0 Statistical Plan  
10.1 Data Collection      
All study -related data will be entered into OnCore.  Access will be limited via a password k nown 
only to the investigator and designated research personnel (study nurse(s), data manager(s)).  
 
10.2   Statistics  
Statistical Considerations  
Chi-square and cluster re -sampling analyses will be used to correlate suspicion on multiparametric  
magnetic resonance imaging and the incidence of cancer detected on biopsy.   
 
The primary goal of this study is to evaluate acute and late toxicities. In addition clinical data will be 
collected to monitor for tumor control. Digital rectal examination (DR E) and serum prostate antigen 
(PSA) will be evaluated every 3 months for two years. Toxicity will be evaluated EPIC  EQ D5, 
Sexual Medication, Device Screening Questionnaires completed by the patients or in conversation 
with the patient by the clinical sta ff, at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months following the end of radiation 
therapy (+/ - 14 days). Rates of acute and late side effects and adverse events will be summarized as 
proportions, with 95% confidence intervals.   
 
Biochemical failure will be based on PSA values using the Phoenix definition (clinical nadir 
+2ng/mL). Data from all patients will be pooled.   Survival rates estimated from the Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals.   We will also track virtual treatment plans 
based on standard models for treatment to the whole gland versus partial gland MRI -TPUS validated 
planning to report change in dosimetric parameters of the focal SBRT versus traditional whole -gland 
treatment plans for statistical comparison.  
 
Either a positive D RE or rising PSA may be used as clinical indication for additional MRI 
surveillance. When additional MRI are available, tumor volume will be summarized by mean ±STD 
and the difference between two time points (pre and post treatment) will be examined using paired T-
test. Radiographic efficacy will be summarized by calculating Kaplan -Meier curves for the 
following:   disease-free survival, time to local progression, time to distant failure. Descriptive reports 
of RECIST (1.1) and volumetric findings will be pr ovided. 
 
Acute/Late Toxicity and Quality of Life Measurements  
Using multivariate analysis, we will report acute and late (>180 days post SBRT) rates of GI toxicity  
with dose -volume histogram. We will also report time to event analyses collected for all ava ilable 
HRQOL data collected.  
 
Temporal pattern of quality of life scores will be summarized graphically; and repeated measures 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to test for changes in scores over time. The 
predictive value of demographic, pat hological and clinical factors on the scores will be examined by 
mixed models assuming missing values are missing at random.   
 
Sample Size  
Twelve patients will be evaluated in this pilot study. As a proof -of-principle study, it’s not design to 
have the appropriate power (80%) for detecting significant difference in clinic outcomes (i.e. 
CASE 11813                  Page 32 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 toxicities, survival or QOL), but to provide some prelim inary data for future studies. A sample of 12 
patients, however, achieves 78% power to detect 8% difference of urinary toxicity against historical 
controls under whole gland therapy using a two -sided binomial test with the target significance level 
of 0.2. We anticipate that a minimum of twenty four patients will be screened leading to twelve 
patients who will be treated and evaluated on -study in this pilot study.  
 
11.0 COSTS AND COMPENSATI ON 
The costs of procedures, tests, visits and hospitalizations in co nnection with the radiation therapy are 
standard of care and will be billed to the subject’s insurer and/or to the subject.  This includes costs 
for pre-treatment diagnostic scans, fiducial markers and fiducial marker placement, treatment 
planning, radiati on therapy treatments, and post -operative follow -up for radiation therapy, are 
standard of care and will be charged accordingly. Therefore, subjects and their insurers will be fully 
responsible for the costs related to this research evaluating and comparin g standard of care 
procedures.   
 
Subjects will not be paid for their participation in this study.  
 
 
12.0 Risks   
12.1   Anticipated Risks  
Risks include those that result from the special nature of radiosurgery standard of care, including 
errors in giving the radiation.  This may include giving radiation to normal tissue around the tumor 
and not to the cancer, or giving the wrong dose of radi ation, either too much or too little.  Any of 
these problems could potentially be severe, possibly even fatal.  
 
Subjects may have a number of CT scans, nuclear scans and MRI scans that are part of the regular 
care for this condition, whether or not they p articipate in this research. These studies will not add to 
the risk of the research. However, subjects with concerns about the overall radiation exposure or MRI 
safety issues should be discussed with a study physician.  
 
The risks associated with the MRI sc ans are the same risks as those posed by clinically  indicated tests 
(non-research). A known risk related to MRI examinations is that the MRI magnet could attract 
certain kinds of metal that may cause injury to the patient. In order to avoid that, patients will be 
screened for any hazardous metal object that they may have or is implanted inside their body which 
includes pacemakers, intracranial aneurysm clips, heart valve prostheses and other implanted devices 
that are not compatible with MRI. Although there  is no risk from ionizing radiation with MRI, 
subjects will be exposed to strong magnetic fields and radio waves, neither of which are associated 
with any known detrimental health effects.  
 
We will use an MRI contrast agent that is approved by the FDA and commercially available. There 
is a risk of an allergic or fibrotic reaction, which occurs more often with iodine based contrast (for 
CT) than with MRI contrast agents. Every effort will be made to minimize the risk of such reactions 
in this study by exclud ing subjects who have a history of kidney disease, which is the cohort who 
most frequently exhibits an allergic reaction. Generally, an injection of 10 -20 ml IV contrast agent 
will be used, provided that the subject has no known reaction to contrast agents  used in previous MRI 
scans. As with all such injections, bleeding, bruising, dizziness, fainting or infection may occur. Also, 
CASE 11813                  Page 33 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 the injection may be painful but the discomfort should be brief and efforts will be made to minimize 
the pain.  
 
All data will b e entered and managed in computer systems having limited access and password 
protected. There is some risk that subjects’ personal protected health information could be breached 
and health information made available to unauthorized individuals.  
 
Adverse ev ents are not anticipated as related to the delivery of focal therapy, beyond the normal risks 
of radiation therapy with curative intent for localized prostate cancer.  
 
Intravenous MRI contrast agents will be applied to stage each patient’s stage of disease, looking for 
local disease extension. Subjects who have a history of adverse reactions to contrast media will be 
excluded from that portion of the study as will subjects with a history of kidney disease or unacceptable 
values of creatinine and/or G lomerular Filtration Rate [GFR] (see exclusion criteria). Subjects who 
have a history of adverse reactions to contrast media will be excluded from the study as will subjects 
with a history of kidney disease or unacceptable values of creatinine and/or Glome rular Filtration Rate 
[GFR] (see exclusion criteria).  
 
In addition, we will use the MRI images obtained for staging to also map locations of intraprostatic 
tumor foci, to map the location/s of disease. Just prior to fiducial marker placement, patients will  be 
consented for a biopsy procedure during fiducial marker placement for radiation therapy set up, for 
the purpose of establishing a map of known disease within the gland. Biopsy cavities will be marked 
with in-vivo fiducials and/or using temporary in-situ marker tracking, such as the use of the echogenic 
needle tip coordinates on ultrasound. Such recorded TRUS ultrasound coordinates will be tracked and 
evaluated  for subsequent correlation of histopathology data and the mpMRI images – using all 
available image data (for example the treatment simulation MRI and CT) to inform our treatment 
planning to improve se localization of known true positive tumor foci.  
 
Additional biopsy samples will be acquired just prior to fiducial marking (permanent or temporary as 
defined above) in a sextant fashion to map disease across the prostate gland for use in treatment 
planning and staging. The risks associated with prostate biopsy sampling are similar in nature to those 
associated with the patient’s diagnostic biopsy tha t confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma. These 
risks include the risk associated with bleeding, and the possibility of infection that could be serious. 
There is additional discomfort that may be associated with the insertion of use of a rectal ultrasoun d 
probe that may be managed by light sedation. The fiducial marker placement procedure will be 
lengthened by several minutes during which time biopsy mapping will occur. This procedure will 
include the use of general sedation, which is customary with trans perineal fiducial marker placement 
and or biopsy procedures. However, additional risk may be associated with the use of such sedation 
measures over an increased timeframe during the additional biopsy sampling procedure.

Protocol:  8.4.2020 12.2   Benefits 
There are potentia l benefits for individuals who may elect to participate in this particular study. The 
staging biopsy and image guided fiducial marker placement with correlation to serial MRI scans 
may allow improved staging information for these screened patients. Our eff orts to apply advanced 
imaging with histopathology correlation may allow us to refine treatment planning contours, aimed 
a reduction in toxicity while completing therapy with curative intent. It is, however, unknown if this 
treatment schema will be proven safe and effective. The diagnosis and treatment decisions will be 
based on the standard of care imaging. There may be a benefit for future patient populations using 
MRI with multiparametric sequences and histopathology correlation for the management of pro state 
cancer using focal SBRT.   
 
12.3 Alternatives to participation  
This study does not involve a change to the clinical care of the participant. There will be no 
consequences to individuals who withdraw or step down from the study. The subject will not u ndergo 
the additional MRI scans, nor focal SBRT if a patient refuses to take part in the study. Only the 
clinically indicated diagnostic standard of care imaging will be performed. If a subject withdraws 
during the procedure of the study, the investigators  will use the data as acquired up to the point of 
withdrawal.

Protocol:  8.4.2020 About the I -PSS 
The International Prostate Symptom Score (I -PSS) is based on the answers to seven questions  concerning 
urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life.  Each question concerning urinary symptoms 
allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom.  
The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5.  The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic 
to very symptomatic).  
 
The questions refer to the following urinary symptoms:  
Question  Symptom  
1  Incomplete emptying  
2  Frequency  
3  Intermittency  
4  Urgency 
5  Weak Stream  
6  Straining 
7  Nocturia 
 
Question eight refers to the patient’s perceived quality of life.  
 
The first seven questions of the I -PSS are identical to the questions appearing on the American Urological 
Association (AUA) Symptom Inde x which currently categorizes symptoms as follows:  
 
Mild (symptom score less than of equal to 7) 
Moderate (symptom score range 8 -19) Severe 
(symptom score range 20 -35) 
 
The International Scientific Committee (SCI), under the patronage of the World Health Organization (WHO) 
and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), recommends the use of only a single question to assess 
the quality of life.  The answers to this que stion range from “delighted” to “terrible” or 0 to 6.  Although this 
single question may or may not capture the global impact of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) Symptoms 
or quality of life, it may serve as a valuable starting point for a doctor -patient conversation.  
 
The SCI has agreed to use the symptom index for BPH, which has been developed by the AUA Measurement 
Committee, as the official worldwide symptoms assessment tool for patients suffering from prostatitis.  
 
The SCI recommends that physicians c onsider the following components for a basic diagnostic workup: 
history; physical exam; appropriate labs, such as U/A, creatinine , etc.; and DRE or other evaluation to rule 
out prostate cancer.

Protocol:  8.4.2020 Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC)  
Prostate cancer-specific HRQOL as measured by the Expanded  Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) Instrument 
development  was based on advice from an expert panel and prostate cancer patients, which led to expanding 
the 20-item University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA -PCI) to the 50-item EPIC. 
Summary  and subscale scores were derived by content and factor  analyses. Test-retest reliability  and 
internal consistency were high for EPIC urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domain summary scores (each 
r ≥0.80 and Cronbach's alpha≥0.82) and for most domain-specific subscales. Correlations between function 
and bother subscales within domai ns were high (r >0.60). Correlations between different primary domains 
were consistently low er, indicating that these domains assess distinct HRQOL components. EPIC domains 
had weak to modest correlations with the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health  Survey (SF -
12). Moderate agreement was observed between EPIC domains relevant to the Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy Prostate module (FACT-P) and the American Urological Association Symptom Index 
(AUA-SI), providing criterion validity without excessive overlap (Wei 2000). EPIC is a robust prostate 
cancer HRQOL instrument that measures a broad spectrum of symptoms; however, to decrease patient 
burden we will only use the domains most pertinent to this study: urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal. 
The domains were validated separately, and since each domain will be used intact, there is no threat to 
validity. This reduces patient burden

a health state is, we have drawn a 
scale (rather like a thermometer) 
on which the best state you can 
imagine is marked by 100 and the 
worst state you can imagine is 
marked by 0. 
 
We would like you to indicate in this 
scale how good or bad is your own 
health today, in your opinion. Please 
do this by drawing a line from the 
box below to whichever point on the 
scale indicates how good or bad 
your current health is.

Sexual health is an important part of an individual's overall physical and emotional well-being. Erectile 
dysfunction, also known as impotence, is one type of very common medical condition affecting sexual health. 
Fortunately, there are many different treatment options for erectile dysfunction. This questionnaire is designed 
to help you and your doctor identify if you may be experiencing erectile dysfunction. If you are, you may 
choose to discuss treatment options with your doctor. 
 
Each question has several possible responses. Circle the number of the response that best describes your own 
situation. Please be sure that you select one and only one response for each question.

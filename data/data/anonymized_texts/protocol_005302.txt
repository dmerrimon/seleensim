 ABSTRACT 
ANBL0532 is a Phase III trial to study the use of intens ified consolidation (Primary Aim 1), the use of 
newer agents during induction (Primary Aim 2), and the use of high dose local radiation (Primary Aim 3).  
 
The primary goal of ANBL0532 is to test whether furt her intensification of myeloablative therapy will 
improve cure rate for high risk neuroblastoma.   Myeloblative consolidation therapy is given at the co mpletion of induction therapy and is categorized into 
Regimen A and Regimen B. Regimen A consists of one myeloablative consolidation with a carboplatin – 
etoposide – melphalan (CEM) preparative regimen. For Regimen B, patients will receive two myeloablative consolidations: Thiotepa – cyclophos phamide (TC) preparative regimen followed by CEM 
preparative regimen.  
 
Most patients will be randomized into either Regimen A or Regimen B. Randomization will be stratified by stage, MYCN status and response to indu ction therapy. Patients 365 to 547 days of age (12 
– 18 months) with Stage 4, MYCN  nonamplified tumor with unfavorable histopathology or diploid 
DNA content or with indeterminant histology or ploidy and patients who are greater than 547 days of 
age with Stage 3, MYCN  nonamplified tumor AND unfavorabl e histopathology or indeterminant 
histology will be nonrandomly assigned to sing le myeloablative transplant (Regimen A).   
 ANBL0532 will also assess the efficacy of a dose in tensive topotecan containing induction regimen, 
substituting 2 cycles of dose intensive cyclophosph amide and topotecan for the initial 2 cycles of 
induction utilized on the prior COG A3973 protocol .  Patients will receive 6 cycles of induction 
chemotherapy as outlined in the schema below. Pati ents will undergo periphera l blood stem cell (PBSC) 
harvest after 2 cycles with no ex vivo manipulation prior to cryopreservation.  PBSC collection will be 
performed prior to randomization.The goal of apheresis will be collection of 10 x 10
6 CD 34+cells/kg 
divided into 3 aliquots.  A minimum collection of 4 x 106 CD 34+cells/kg, divided into 2 aliquots is 
required for each patient while an additional 3rd aliquot of 2 x 106 CD 34+cells/kg is strongly 
recommended to be stored as backup for delayed engr aftment or for future use. Tumor response will be 
assessed after 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy. Patie nts will undergo surgical resection after Cycle 5 
(or 6 if necessary). Tumor response will be assessed after completion of surgical resection and 6 cycles of chemotherapy (end-induction). Patients with progressive  disease (PD) at end of induction evaluation will 
be taken off protocol therapy, all ot her patients will continue on therapy. 
 ANBL0532 will also test whether additional radia tion therapy delivered to gross residual disease 
improves local control for those patients with less than a gross total resection. 
 After completion of 
transplant and recovery from acute toxicities, patient s will undergo radiation to primary site of disease 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 11 and to MIBG-avid sites seen at pre-transplant (end- induction) evaluation. Patients who achieve end of 
induction primary site complete response (CR) will receive 21.6 Gy external beam radiation therapy 
(EBRT) to the primary site (standard dose) while patients achieving <CR (>  1 cm3 residual soft tissue) at 
the primary site will receive an additional boost of 14. 4 Gy for a total dose of 36 Gy EBRT delivered to 
gross residual primary site disease.  Pre-surgical a nd end of induction CT or MRI scans and operative 
reports will be centrally reviewed in real time for a ll patients assessed by the treating institution to have a 
complete response at the primary site at the end of induction.  Tumor response will be assessed after 
completion of radiation therapy.   
Patients will be encouraged to enroll onto ANBL 0032 or ANBL0931for Maintenance biologic therapy. 
Alternatively, post-transplant Main tenance therapy with cis-RA daily for 14 days every 28 days repeated 
for 6 months will be administered.
 
 
Pharmacogenomics studies will be performed to ev aluate whether host genetic polymorphisms in 
cyclophosphamide metabolizing enzymes are associ ated with cyclophosphamide/topotecan – related 
toxicity and tumor response. Cis-RA pharmacokine tics and pharmacogenomic studies will be performed 
to evaluate whether the variability of cis-RA continuous steady state plasma levels and/or genetic 
variations in retinoic acid metabolic enzymes correlate with event-free survival or systemic toxicities in 
high-risk neuroblastoma patients.  Total topotecan levels will be assessed to formulate a population-based dosing model for topotecan in children with high-risk neuroblastoma. 
 
 
Post-operative complications will be studied prospectively in patients with high risk neuroblastoma to better characterize the incidence and timing of o ccurrence. Specifically, th e occurrence of bowel 
obstruction, renal atrophy, chylous leak and chroni c diarrhea will be evaluated through 12 months from 
completion of therapy. Rates of these complicati ons will be correlated with the surgical and 
radiotherapeutic efforts in obtaining local control as they may impact on future management decisions. 
The neurologic and orthopedic outcome for patients with intraspinal extension of primary tumors 
(referred to as paraspinal tumors) will be studied prospectively on this protocol, to better characterize the multiple aspects of disability that these patients may be at risk for.  It is the intent of this study that patients with clinical signs of spinal cord compression will be treated with primary chemotherapy; however, multidisciplinary discussion among oncology, neurosurgery, and radia tion oncology is strongly 
encouraged at the time of diagnosis.  
 
Clinical outcome data for patients treated on this st udy will be used in conjunction with ongoing biologic 
studies on ANBL00B1 to identify new biological surrogate markers for disease relapse and/or disease progression.  In addition, immunologic assays will be employed to assess functional cellular immunity against neuroblastoma at diagnosis and after myeloablative therapy and to enumerate T-cell lymphocyte recovery following single versus  tandem myeloablative therapy.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
Neuroblastoma, a neoplasm of the sympathetic nervous system, is the second most extracranial malignant 
solid tumor of childhood.
1  The current survival for a child >1 year at diagnosis with Stage 4 
neuroblastoma is only 20-35%.2-7  Novel therapies to improve initial disease response and treatment of 
minimal residual disease are required to improve survival  for these children with high-risk neuroblastoma.  
Standard therapy for patients with high-risk neur oblastoma involves at least 4 components: Induction, 
Local Control, Consolidation and Treatment of minima l disease with biologic agents. The use of these 4 
components has evolved over the last 20 years, based upon work by the POG and CCG, international 
cooperative groups and smaller cohort studies. 
 
The primary aim of ANBL0532 is to improve even t free survival for children with high-risk 
neuroblastoma.  This study is a logical extension of the COG Neuroblastoma committee’s strategic plan 
and will build upon our previous findings to study the use of intensified consolidation (Primary Aim 1), 
the use of a novel induction regimen (Primary Aim 2) , and the use of increased dose local radiation 
therapy (Primary Aim 3).  Specifi cally, a limited institution pilot study through COG (ANBL00P1) has 
demonstrated the feasibility and tolerable toxicity  of the proposed tandem transplant consolidation 
regimen. An additional limited institution pilot study through COG (ANBL02P1) has demonstrated 
feasibility/tolerable toxicity of the dose intensive cyclophosphamide/topotecan administration proposed in the induction phase and ability to harvest PBSC fo llowing such chemotherapy. ANBL0532 will also test 
whether additional radiation therapy will improve local  control for those patients with less than a gross 
total resection, a hypothesis derived directly from retrospective analysis of the prior CCG 3891 high-risk 
neuroblastoma protocol.
8  Patients completing this study will be eligible for COG ANBL0032 or 
ANBL0931, a study of immunotherapy as treatment of minimal residual disease.  
2.1 Definition of High-Risk Neuroblastoma 
Patients eligible for ANBL0532 must have high-risk ne uroblastoma as defined by risk criteria that include 
age, stage, and the biologic features of MYCN amplification, histopathology, and DNA ploidy (Appendix 
VII).  The stratification algorithm to be u sed for ANBL0532 and ANBL0531 (Intermediate Risk 
Neuroblastoma clinical trial) has been revised from recent clinical trials and is based upon data from 
legacy CCG and POG clinical trials.  These data s uggest that patients up to 18 months of age who are 
diagnosed with biologically favorable stage 4 neur oblastoma share the same excellent prognosis that has 
previously been demonstrated for infants less than 12 months of age with non-amplification of MYCN  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 15 oncogene ( MYCN-NA) stage 4 disease.9  Data from CCG 3881 and 3891 trials demonstrated a 6-year 
EFS=90% for infants < 12 months, EFS=86.7% for t oddlers 12-18 months, and EFS=36.6% for children 
18-24 months of age at diagnosis of stage 4, MYCN-NA neuroblastoma.10 In this analysis, Shimada 
histology also correlated with age at diagnosis and survival, with nearly all patients with favorable 
Shimada histology (FH) tumors being in the 12-18 month age group.  Data from PO G clinical trials also 
suggest a favorable outcome for toddl ers ages 12-18 months with stage D, MYCN-NA, hyperdiploid 
tumors, treated on a variety of POG protocols with a 4- year EFS of >80%, > 90%, and < 40% for patients 
age 6-12 months, 12-18 months, and 18-24 months, respectively, at diagnosis.11  Further analyses of CCG 
3891 data reveal an excellent outcome for the rare patient age 12-18 months with stage 3, MYCN -NA but 
unfavorable Shimada histology (UH) disease. Measurement of tumor DNA index was not performed in this study.  The 3-year EFS/OS was 100% for patients 12-18 months with Stage 3, MYCN-NA and UH 
neuroblastoma (n=3).
12 
 Based upon these data, ANBL0532 will exclude patie nts age 12-18 months with stage 4, MYCN-NA, 
hyperdiploid, and FH tumors or stage 3 MYCN-NA, unfavorable histopathol ogy.  These patients will be 
treated on the intermediate-risk protocol, ANBL0531, representing a reduction of therapy in both dose-intensity and cumulative dose.  Of note, this clinically favorable cohort of 12-18 month old patients with stage 4 disease represents only 5% (15/313) of all stage 4 patients enrolled onto CCG3891 for whom 
MYCN  analyses were available and only 3% (14/528) of all stage D patients enrolled onto POG trials for 
whom MYCN  and DNA ploidy analyses were available.   
 In contrast, patients 12-18 months of age with stage 4, MCYN -NA tumors characterized by either diploid 
DNA content (4-year EFS 66.6%) or UH tumors (6-year EFS 46%) and patients greater than 18 months of age with stage 3 tumors and unfavorable histology (5-year EFS 53%) have a less favorable outcome and support further attempts to optimize therapy.
10-12 However, given that the majority of these patients 
treated on legacy CCG or POG trials did not receive myeloablative therapy, a further escalation to tandem transplantation may not be warranted.  Theref ore, patients 12-18 months of age with stage 4 MYCN-NA 
tumors but with diploid DNA content, UH or indeterminant histology or DNA ploidy and children greater than 18 months of age with stage 3 MYCN -NA tumors with UH, estimated to be 1-4% of all high risk 
stage patients, will be eligible for treatment on ANBL0532 but will be nonrandomly assigned to single 
myeloablative therapy.  A uniformed treatment appro ach will allow improved analysis of outcome for this 
relatively rare patient cohort.  
 2.2 High-risk Neuroblastoma Therapy   
High-risk neuroblastoma is largely chemotherapy r esponsive, but despite improvements in complete 
response rates, the majority of patients still relap se. To improve event free survival, COG and legacy 
CCG and POG clinical trials have intensified chem otherapy during induction and consolidation phases of 
therapy and added biologic agents for treatment of minimal residual disease. CCG-3891 study demonstrated that increased dose intensity of cons olidation with purged bone marrow transplant and 
administration of the biologic agent 13- cis retinoic acid (cis-RA) following consolidation therapy 
improved outcome for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma
13.  The 8-year EFS and OS rates for patients 
treated with one transplant and cis-RA (n=50) ar e 44% + 12% and 54% + 13%, respectively (personal 
communication; K. Matthay and W.London). The r ecently completed COG Phase III trial, A3973, 
evaluated whether the use of a more intensive induction chemotherapy re gimen (N7), reported by 
investigators at Memorial Sloan-Ke ttering to produce a 85% CR/VGPR rate,14 will result in improved 
EFS and end-induction response rate when compared to  CCG-3891. A3973 also tested whether the use of 
anti-neuroblastoma purged PBSC rescue improves EFS for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. The 
results of COG A3973 indicate no difference in event-free or overall survival with the use of purged PBSC products for transplant. Feasibility and toxi city data from COG A3973, ANBL00P1 and ANBL0P2 
cited below support the continued utilization of a dose intensive induction re gimen and myeloablative 
chemotherapy consolidation regimen as the “backbone” schema as proposed in this successor study for high-risk neuroblastoma. The current COG ANBL0032 has demonstrated that immunotherapy (ch14.18 
antibody plus cytokines) in addition to cis-RA  improves EFS. Patients treated on ANBL0532 will be 
eligible for participation on ANBL0032 or ANBL0931.

Page 16  
2.3 Myeloablative regimens  
The results of the randomized CCG-3891 protocol de monstrate that a myeloablative therapy with 
carboplatin, etoposide, melphalan and 1000cGy total body irradiation (TBI) and purged autologous bone 
marrow rescue improves EFS for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. The 3-year EFS was 30% for all patients on study, 85% of which had stage 4 neuroblastoma. The 3-year EFS from time of assigned randomization was 34% for autologous bone ma rrow transplantation (ABMT) versus 22% for 
continuation chemotherapy (CC) (p = 0.045).
13  Overall survival was not significantly different for the 
two regimens, perhaps partly due to use of AB MT salvage in > 30 pa tients who progressed after 
chemotherapy consolidation. An apparent advantage was seen for ABMT  within strata separated either by 
MYCN  amplification, bone marrow immunocytology or st age. More recent evaluation of outcome for 
those children with high-risk neuroblastoma treated  on CCG 3891 revealed an overall 8-year EFS and OS 
rate +/- SE from the time of enrollment onto CCG 3891 of 24% +/- 3% and 29% +/- 3% (n=539), 
respectively, with a median follow-up time of patient s who did not experience an event of 7.7 years (130 
days – 12.8 years) (Table 1). The 8-year EFS from the time of randomization for patients randomized to 
ABMT (n=189) was 27% +/- 5% vs. 18% +/- 4% fo r patients randomized to CC (n=190), p=0.0434. The 
8-year OS for ABMT was not statistically significantly higher than for CC, 33% +/- 6% vs. 25% +/- 4%, p=0.3917 (personal communication, K. Matthay and W. London). These data continue to suggest that 
therapy intensification diminishes risks for ne uroblastoma recurrence. Based on the incremental 
improvement in EFS with ABMT, myeloablative consolidation has become a standard of care for patients with high-risk disease in the United States and abroad.   While TBI was used in the initial studies of autologous transplantation for neuroblastoma
15 , the 
worldwide trend has been to eliminate this modality due to excessive toxicity including second malignancies.
16 It is now clear that retrospective comparisons of TBI and non-TBI containing regimens 
showed no difference in patient outcomes. 16 17 Smedler et al. reported a m oderate general developmental 
delay; with motor, perceptual and cognitive defects in ten children transplanted for leukemia or neuroblastoma with TBI regimens.
18   Children transplanted for neuroblastoma with TBI also demonstrate 
abnormal growth rates, in some cases asso ciated with growth hormone deficiency.19  TBI regimens can 
also cause late effects such as cataracts, othe r endocrine dysfunction, and secondary malignant 
neoplasms.20  There has been no prospective comparative tr ial to determine whether the addition of TBI 
improves survival from high-risk neuroblastoma. A retrospective review of 51 patients transplanted for advanced or poorly responding neuroblastoma from the European BMT Solid Tumor Registry found no significant difference in outcome between TBI and non-TBI regimens.
17  A separate retrospective review 
of 62 concurrently treated stage 4 neuroblastoma patients with and without TBI also demonstrated 
equivalent survival rates.16 The CHLA group has shown a 3-year EFS rate of 49% +/- 6% in 73 patients 
analyzed from the end of induction therapy who were treated on protocol 91-LA6 with a non-TBI 
regimen of carboplatin, etoposide and melphalan with local irradiation (CEM-LI, Table 1). A preliminary 
comparison of the EFS of patients with stage 4 ne uroblastoma over one year of age at diagnosis 
transplanted before progression with CEM-LI (n=47) with the same cohort of patients treated with CEM-
TBI on CCG-321P3 (n=43) showed no significant differe nce in outcome (p=0.059). Overall, there were 
4/73 (5%) toxic deaths in the patients transplanted  before progression with CEM on the 91-LA6 protocol 
as compared to 8.3% toxic deaths following CEM-TB I in similar patients transplanted on CCG-321P3. 
These data suggest that the proposed CEM-LI without TBI is at least as effective as prior TBI regimens 
with the caveats that sample size lim ited the ability to detect a statistical difference in EFS and that trend 
towards improvement in EFS in this historical co mparison could also be attributed to general 
improvements in care and induction regimens used  in the 91-LA-6 (personal communication, J. 
Villablanca).  The COG A3973 recently completed Phase III trial utili zed the CEM preparative regimen based upon the 
results for the 91LA6 clinical trial noted above. Of the 489 eligible patients enrolled onto A3973, 368 had 
completed preparative regimen of carboplatin, etoposide,  melphalan and autologous transplant with either 
purged or unpurged PBSC and reporte d on toxicity. Nearly 75% of the patients developed Grade 3 or 4 
stomatitis during consolidation. One patient devel oped Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction, and four had renal 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 17 dysfunction. Three patients developed renal failure requiring dialysis. Two of these patients had severe 
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), formerly VOD, the other had severe capillary leak syndrome 
with grade 2 elevation of bilirubin, but no hepatic enlargement. All 3 patients proceeded to post transplant 
therapy on study.  In total, 12 of 368 (3.2 %) pa tients have died of complications during Consolidation 
phase of therapy, mainly due to infectious complica tions (n=8).  There have been 20 patients reported 
with SOS, which resulted in death in the 3 patients.  These toxicities are similar to those reported using 
alternative myeloablative consolidation regimens13,21-23  and did not meet designed stopping rules. Two-
year EFS for the tranpslanted cohort from time of study enrollment was 48 +/- 3%.  The 91LA6 and COG 
A3973 experience to date suggest tolerable toxici ty following CEM-LI consolidation therapy. 
Comparative analysis of 91LA6, CCG 321-P3 and A3973 indicates that the CEM-LI regimen without TBI is at least as effective as prior TBI regimens.  Therefore, CEM-LI will be employed in each arm of this successor Phase III study comparing singl e versus tandem consolidation therapy. 
 2.4 Tandem Myeloablative Regimens  
High-risk neuroblastoma remains incurable in 60-70% of patients.
6,13  Further dose intensity may yield 
further improvements in EFS. To achieve this, tandem,  or dual-cycle, transplant approaches have been 
developed. An initial attempt at tandem transplant  using marrow support was piloted by the European 
Neuroblastoma Group in the LMCE2.24  Median time to reach the second ABMT was 3 mos. (range 2-6 
mos.), and median time to ANC > 500 was 43 days (15-120).  Overall survival at 2 years was 36% in a 
very high-risk group of patients, but the toxic death rate was high at 24%. 
 Grupp et al. explored the use of tandem transplant w ith PBSC support in children with high-risk solid 
tumors.
25,26  The myeloablative regimens employed in the CHP-594/DFCI 34-DAT study were an initial 
regimen of 2.4 g/m2 etoposide, 3.6 g/m2 cyclophosphamide and carboplatin 2 g/m2 followed 4-6 weeks 
later by a second regimen of melphalan 180 mg/m2 with 12 Gy of TBI. Initial data on 55 enrolled patients 
(ages 1 to 18 years) demonstrated the feasibility of the approach with 98 cycles of myeloablative therapy 
with stem cell rescue completed. Four patients who completed the first HSCT course did not complete the second, and there were three toxic deaths. Median  time to neutrophil engraftment was 11 days. One 
patient experienced delayed engraftment but recovered following infusion of back-up PBSC. The 3-year EFS was 58% with a median follow-up of 22 months from diagnosis. These data are substantiated by a 
more recent analysis of 97 consecutive children (incl uding the 55 previously published) treated with the 
CHP-594/DFCI 34-DAT that shows a 3-year PFS and OS of 55% (95% CI, 40 – 65%) and 66% (95%CI 
35 – 60%), respectively; a 5-year PFS and OS of 47%  (95% CI 35 – 60%) and 55% (95% CI 43 – 68%), 
respectively and a 7-year PFS of 45%.
27 Of the 89 patients who received at least one HSCT, the 5-year 
and 7-year PFS was 51% and 49%, respectively (Table 1). 
 
 
Toxicity and feasibility data on tandem transplanta tion without TBI have been evaluated in POG 9640 
and COG ANBL00P1 studies. POG 9640 enrolled 33 patients and utilized 5 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by tandem transplantation with unpurged PBSC support. The tandem regimens 
were: Carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide (AT#1) followed by thiotepa and cyclophosphamide 
(AT#2). This regimen was found to be feasible and to lerable. There were no toxic deaths associated with 
the tandem regimen. A total of 21 patients underwen t at least one course myeloablative therapy and 17 
patients received tandem regimens.  Of the 17 patie nts who underwent tandem transplant, 12 were alive 
without evidence of disease at 2 years.  The 5-year EFS and OS rates +/- standard error of the 33 patients enrolled was 27% +/- 8% and 39% +/- 9%, respectivel y.  Twenty-two patients received at least one 
transplant, and the 5-year EFS and OS rates from time of first transplant were 41% +/- 12% and 49% +/- 
12%, respectively (personal communication S. Gr upp and W. London, MS in preparation).  
 The promising results of the CHOP/DFCI experience, the POG 9640 study and the 91LA6 CEM-LI study have led the COG Neuroblastoma Committee to consider intensification of CEM-LI in a tandem regimen. 
The feasibility and toxicity of incorporating CEM- LI in a tandem regimen has been studied in COG 
ANBL00P1. This limited-institution pilot study utili zed five cycles of induction chemotherapy followed 
by tandem transplantation. The ta ndem regimens were Thiotepa/Cyc lophosphamide followed by CEM-LI. 
Thiotepa/Cyclophosphamide regimen was chosen as the initial transplant based upon the known toxicity 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 18 profile of agents alone and in combina tion when delivered at myeloablative doses,28-30 the acceptable 
toxicity profile of the combination demonstrated in the POG 9640 tandem transplant study and the known 
anti-neuroblastoma activity of each agent including their ability to cross the blood brain barrier.31  Data 
obtained from a CHOP pilot tandem regimen of Thiotepa/Cyclophosphamide followed by full dose CEM (equivalent to A3973 dosing) revealed excessive t oxicity following CEM.  Therefore, a 15% dose 
reduction of CEM agents was utilized in the ANBL00P 1 protocol and will be utilized in ANBL0532.  The 
observed toxicity following CEM in the CHOP pilot and in the COG A3973 trial suggest that CEM-related toxicity would interfere w ith subsequent delivery of myeloabl ative chemotherapy and support the 
sequence of thiotepa/cyclophosphamide followed by  CEM in a tandem myeloablative regimen.   
 Of the 41 eligible patients enrolled onto ANBL00P1,  8 patients were removed from protocol prior to 
consolidation. Of the remaining 33 patients, 7 recei ved only a single transplant while 26 patients received 
tandem transplants. Reasons for not receiving the 2
nd transplant included progressive disease (1 patient), 
family preference (2 patients), mo rtality following transplant #1 (n=1) and prolonged toxicity following 
transplant #1 (n=3, delayed engraftment, elevated liver transaminases, renal insufficiency). Therefore, 
63% of all patients and 79% of those patients elig ible for consolidation therapy received the tandem 
consolidation regimen. This compares favorably to the legacy CCG3891 trial where 68% of patients 
assigned to ABMT received the intended therapy. Over all, 3 patients have experienced treatment related 
mortality.  Twenty-two events occurred in 41 eligible  patients enrolled at diagnosis resulting in 2-year 
EFS from time of diagnosis of 38% +/- 11%.  These data support the feasibility of this tandem myeloablative chemotherapy regimen, although sma ll numbers of accrued patients limits the ability to 
assess efficacy.  The summary data presented in Table 1 support the i nvestigation of tandem transplant consolidation to 
improve EFS from high risk neuroblastoma.   A comparison of the CCG3891 and CHP/DFCI trials, both 
TBI-containing trials, reveals an improvement in EFS following tandem consolidation; (CCG 3891 from 
time randomized to ABMT: 8-year EFS 27+/- 5% versus CHP/DFCI from diagnosis: 7-year EFS 45+/-
10% versus CHP/DFCI from time on initial myeloabl ative regimen: 7-year EFS 49 +/- 11%).  A trend 
toward improvement in EFS following tandem transp lant is even observed when comparing the highly 
selected cohort of CCG3891 patients who received ABMT and were randomized to receive cis-RA (26% 
of those patients patients randomized to ABMT) versus the CHP/DFCI patients who received the 
intended tandem transplant (84.5% of patients enrolled); CCG 3891:  8-year EFS 44 +/- 12% versus 
CHP/DFCI 7-year EFS 52 +/- 11%.  Furthermore, th e 91LA6 data suggests that CEM provides similar 
EFS to the single TBI-CEM containing regimen used  in CCG3891, supporting the elimination of TBI 
from a tandem regimen.  The EFS and OS results of the various non-TBI contai ning tandem regimens 
(ANBL00P1 and POG 9640) vary between studies, reflecting the difficulty in evaluating efficacy of 
therapy regimens in small, non-randomized clini cal trials. However, the combined data from the 
CHP/DFCI, the POG 9640 and the ANBL00P1 trials demonstrate that intensification of consolidation 
therapy with PBSC support is feasible, does not in crease treatment related mortality and may decrease 
recurrence for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

2.5 Novel Induction Regimen  
The emergence of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells is the major obstacle to improved initial tumor 
response and to the cure of high-risk neuroblastoma.5,6,13,32 A marked escalation in chemotherapy dose 
intensity has resulted in improved initial tumor response rates.14,33,34  A highly dose intensive combination 
of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and doxorubicin alte rnating with cisplatin and etoposide has been 
studied in small numbers of patients at Memorial Sl oan Kettering Cancer Center with a reported CR plus 
very good partial response rate (VGPR) of 85%.14  Unfortunately, this excellent induction response rate 
was not reproduced in a multi-center trial performed by  the French Society of Pediatric Oncology (SFOP) 
where 21 of 47 patients who received the MSKCC inducti on regimen achieved CR at metastatic sites of 
disease, results that were similar to prior less dose intensive regimens.35  This regimen was further 
evaluated in over 400 patients with high risk ne uroblastoma enrolled on the recently completed COG 
Phase III trial (A3973), demonstrating a CR plus VGPR of 52%. Data from the A3973 and SFOP  trials suggest that chemotherapy resistance remains an obstacle to the cure of high risk neuroblastoma.  Further dose intensification of induction chemotherapy is li mited by hematopoietic and mucosal toxicity arguing 
for the addition of new non-cross resistant agen ts to further improve tumor response rates.

2.6 Topotecan 
Topotecan, 9-dimethylaminomethyl-10-hydroxycamptot hecin, is a semi-synthetic derivative of 
camptothecin that inhibits topoisomerase I enzyme resulting in double stranded DNA breaks and cellular 
apoptosis.36 Preclinical investigations in murine xenograf t models have demonstrated antitumor activity 
against neuroblastoma,37,38 synergistic activity when combined w ith alkylator and platinum anti-tumor 
compounds 39,40 and both dosage and schedule dependency of anti-tumor activity.41  Anti-tumor activity 
demonstrated in xenograft models is maximal following daily x 5 days administration or daily x 5 days x 
2 weeks at single day systemic exposure of 52 – 88 ng/mL*hr, a systemic exposure proven to be feasible 
in subsequent clinical trials.42 Although topotecan demonstrates a non-cross resistant mechanism of 
action42,43 cross-resistance to etoposide, a topoisomer ase II inhibitor commonly used in neuroblastoma 
therapy, has been demonstrated by in vitro analyses of patient-derived neuroblastoma cell lines resistant 
to etoposide.44   Patient-derived neuroblastoma cell lines established early in the clinical course (diagnosis 
or after induction therapy) were more likely to be sensitive to topotecan, supporting the incorporation of 
topotecan into Induction therapy, prio r to significant etoposide exposure.  In vivo , topotecan is eliminated 
through hepatic metabolism and renal ex cretion. Topotecan penetrates the CNS,45 a site of recurrence in 
neuroblastoma.46 Topotecan has a limited toxicity profile notable for dose-limiting myelosuppression and 
mild to moderate nausea, vomiting and mucos itis, regardless of administration schedule.47-49  Anti-
neuroblastoma activity has been demonstrated in bot h Phase I and II trials. A Phase I trial administered 
topotecan at dosages of 1.4 mg/m2/day to 2.4 mg/m2/day for 5 days to pediatric patients with recurrent 
tumors. Of nine patients with neuroblastoma, a partial response was demonstrated in 3 patients while stable disease occurred in one patient.
42  A Phase II upfront window trial in patients with newly diagnosed 
high-risk neuroblastoma (POG-9341) identified topotecan (2 mg/m2/day for 5 days) as an active anti-
neuroblastoma agent with 38% of patients achieving a complete (n=1) or partial tumor response (n=11) following 2 cycles of single agent therapy.
32  In a more traditional topo tecan single agent Phase II trial 
(topotecan 2 mg/m2/day for 5 days) enrolling 37 patients with refractory neuroblastoma, complete 
response (CR) was achieved in 2 patients, mixed response (MR) in 5 patients and stable disease (SD) in 8 patients.
50  These data are consistent with topotecan’s anti- neuroblastoma efficacy documented in pre-
clinical studies and support the incorporation of topotecan into upfront therapy for neuroblastoma.  2.7 Topotecan and Cyclophosphamide 
Topotecan and cyclophosphamide have been successfully  combined without excessive toxicity and have 
anti-neuroblastoma activity. A phase I trial in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors demonstrated the topotecan MTD as 0.75 mg/m
2/day administered over 30 minutes daily for 5 days in 
combination with cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/day administered daily for 5 days.51  Myelosuppression, 
defined as Grade 4 neutropenia, was the dose limiting toxicity without additional significant toxicity observed. Anti-tumor activity was further evaluated in a Phase II trial of topotecan 0.75 mg/m
2/day x 5 
days combined with cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/day for 5 days administered to 83 pediatric patients 
with refractory solid tumors.52  Six of thirteen patients with refractory/recurrent neuroblastoma (5 
received prior HSCT) achieved a PR (3 had received a prior BMT), while 2 patients achieved mixed response or stable disease. Preliminary data from POG-9642, a randomized study of topotecan (2 mg/m
2/day for 5 days) versus topotecan/cyclophosphami de (at Phase II doses noted above) in patients 
with recurrent neuroblastoma demonstrate a trend toward improved CR/PR rate following 
topotecan/cyclophosphamide therapy (34% versus 20%),  decreased rate of grade 3 or 4 infectious 
complications and increased time to tumor progression (Frantz C., COG 9462 Public Report, 2/11/2003).  Xenograft models predict that higher systemic e xposure (52-88 ng/ml*hr) to topotecan will improve 
tumor response.
38  A topotecan systemic exposure of 52 – 88 ng/ml*hr is predicted to be achieved by 
doses of 1.0 to 1.6 mg/m2/day.42  Limited pediatric trials, both non-myeloablative and myeloablative, have 
incorporated such doses of topotecan. Repetitive delivery of a dose-intensive topotecan and cyclophosphamide regimen (MSKCC regimen), continuous infusion high-dose cyclophosphamide (4200 mg/m
2/48 hours) combined with continuous infusion topotecan (6 mg/m2/72 hours), has been 
administered to pediatric patients with recurrent solid tumors.53  Severe neutropenia was observed 
following all courses of therapy, with 89% of cour ses complicated by fever and 5.9% complicated by

Page 21 bacteremia. Median duration of neutropenia was 7 days  (range 5-12 days); however, all patients recovered 
neutrophil count to > 1000/ μl and platelet to 75,000/ μl by 28 days. Nonhematologic toxicity was limited 
to Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia and Grade 3 cardiac dy sfunction in one patient during documented sepsis 
and three episodes of Grade 3 mucositis, two associated with herpes simplex infection. There were no 
toxic deaths. Cyclophosphamide and topotecan doses of 1 gram/m2/day for 3 days and 1.25 to 4 
mg/m2/day for 5 days have been successfully combined  with melphalan as a myeloablative regimen for 
adult patients with advanced ovarian cancer.54  Non-hematopoietic toxicity was limited to mucositis with 
maximum of Grade 2 toxicity occurring in 16 of 53 patients treated.  
The limited toxicity profile following dose-intensiv e administration of topotecan and cyclophosphamide 
support the potential feasibility for its incorporation in to an upfront induction regimen. To this end, COG 
ANBL02P1 examined the feasibility of adding dose intensive topotecan and cyclophosphamide onto the 
N7 backbone chemotherapy administered in CO G A3973 study. Escalated doses of topotecan (1.2 
mg/m
2/day for 5 days) and cyclophosphamide (400 mg/m2/day for 5 days) (T/C) replace the initial 2 
cycles of A3973 induction chemotherapy allowing in corporation of topotecan while maintaining dose 
intensity of known active agents in the treatment of  neuroblastoma (see Table 2).  The topotecan dose of 
1.2 mg/m2/day x 5 days was chosen based upon a predicted topotecan AUC (50 - 70 ng/mL*hr) that is 
within the range known to produce tumo r response in murine xenograft models42 and the ability to 
administer with cyclophosphamide.53  Chemotherapy cycles were scheduled every 21 days, PBSC harvest 
occurred after T/C cycles and surgical resection of r esidual primary tumor after cycle 5.  Thirty-one 
patients, 3 with INSS Stage 3 and 28 with Stage 4 were enrolled.  Pharmacokinetically guided topotecan 
dosing (target systemic exposure of AUC 50 - 70 ng/ml *hr determined by single day topotecan lactone 
levels) demonstrated the ability to achieve the target AUC in 87% (27/31) of patients during T/C Cycle 1 and in 85% (23/27) of patients during T/C Cycle 2.  Furthermore, the median topotecan dose required to 
achieve the targeted AUC during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 was 1.2 mg/m
2/day and 1.3 mg/m2/day, 
respectively and support the use of 1.2 mg/m2/day dosing in the ANBL0532 induction.  Successful PBSC 
harvest as defined by a minimum of 2 x 106 CD34 cells/kg  was achieved in 25/26 patients for whom data 
are available; median harvest of 32.4 x 106 CD34 cells/kg (range 2.24 - 548) collected over a median of 1 
day (range 1-3 days). A PBSC harvest of > 6 x 106 CD34 cells/kg was achieved in 23 patients (88%). One 
patient was harvested after Cycle 5 due to physicia n discretion and achieved a PBSC collection of 1.8 x 
106 CD34 cells/kg.  Only one patient required 3 days of  apheresis but achieved a total PBSC collection of 
31.4 x 106 CD34 cells/kg.  All PBSC collections we re free of tumor contamination using an 
immunocytochemical detection assay.  There were no dose limiting toxicities during Cycles 1 and 2 of induction and no induction related moralities.  The majo rity of patients (85%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 
hematopoietic toxicity. Documented infection occurred in 10.3% patients during T/C cycles compared to 26% of patients during subsequent induction cycl es on ANBL02P1 or 30% patients during initial 3 cycles 
of the MSKCC induction on COG A3973. The intended dose intensity of all chemotherapy agents was maintained in 30 of 31 patients.  One patient required a 25% dose reduction of chemotherapy doses 
during Cycle 6 induction due to pr olonged myelosuppression.   Comple te response or partial response 
was achieved in 36% of patients following 2 cycles of  T/C.  End-induction response rate (CR/VGPR) was 
50% (13/26), 1 patient developed progressive disease following comp letion of induction but prior to 
initiating consolidation therapy. 
55 
 In summary, this dose intensive cyclophosphamide a nd topotecan containing induction regimen was well 
tolerated with expected and reversible toxicities.  Dose intensity of standard induction chemotherapy 
agents was not limited by the addition of dose-intens ive topotecan. The ability to achieve sufficient PBSC 
harvest with in vivo  tumor purging was demonstrated.  Together these data support the investigation of 
efficacy of this novel induction regimen in ANBL0532.

 2.8 Local Radiation Therapy  
For stage III and IV neuroblastoma, local relapse is  a major component of treatment failure in several 
published series, all of which included radia tion delivered to the site of primary disease.
57-59  As systemic 
therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma becomes more aggressive, response rates improve, and survival 
increases, local control becomes a formidable problem. This is evident in a recent analysis of CCG 3891, consisting of chemotherapy, primary surgery, 10 Gy of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to gross residual disease, followed by randomized assignment to  continuation chemotherapy (CC) or autologous 
bone marrow transplantation (ABMT).
8  ABMT patients received 10 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI). 
Estimated 5-year locoregional recurrence rates we re 51% ± 5% and 33% ± 7% for CC and ABMT 
patients, respectively (P=0.004). Results of this tria l revealed that for patients who received 10 Gy of 
EBRT to the primary, the addition of 10 Gy of TB I and ABMT decreased local recurrence compared with 
CC (22% ± 12% and 52% ± 8%, P=0.022). This indicates that in combination with EBRT to the primary tumors site, the addition of 10 Gy of TBI as a component of high dose chemotherapy with ABMT 
improved local control compared with CC without TBI.   Several single institution reports further support 
the administration of pre-chemotherapy or pre-su rgery primary tumor volume and regional lymph nodes 
primary site radiation therapy (21 Gy) re sults in improved local tumor control.
60-62  Based upon these data, 
the currently completed COG A3973 delivered 21.6 Gy EBRT to pre-surgical primary tumor volume following recovery from consolidation myeloablative therapy.  Several analyses of outcome for high-risk neurob lastoma suggest that current local therapy for 
incompletely resected patients is inadequate. Wolden et al. reported on a series of patients with stage 4 
neuroblastoma receiving 1.5 Gy twice a day to 21 Gy  to pre chemotherapy, pre-surgery primary tumor 
volume and regional lymph nodes.
60  The actuarial locoregional control rate at 5 years was 84%. A recent 
update of this experience reported a 10.1% probability of primary-site failure among 99 patients, most of 
whom (92 patients) had no evidence of disease in the primary site at the time of irradiation.61  Among 
seven patients with disease at the primary site at th e time of irradiation, three had disease that recurred 
locally. EBRT did not increase acute toxicity, except for increased total parenteral nutrition 
administration.   Published studies have sought to assess the appropriate radiation dose to achieve local control in patients 
with neuroblastoma.  A dose response to radiation is supported by several publications;
58,63,64 however, 
these publications describe results in stage III disease or do not incorporate biological prognostic markers.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 23 In the analysis of radiation therapy in CCG 3891, in combination with EBRT to the primary tumors site, 
the addition of 10 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) as a component of autologous bone marrow transplant 
(ABMT) improved local control compared with con tinuation chemotherapy (CC) without TBI.  In 
addition, a dose response to radiation administered to the primary tumor site is supported by the patients in this study that received 20 Gy for extra-abdom inal primary tumors. Of 36 patients with extra-
abdominal primaries, 6 patients received 20 Gy EBRT  (2 also received TBI) while 30 patients received no 
EBRT (10 of these received TBI). Local relapse rates at 5 years were 0%  0% and 44%  15% for 
patients with and without EBRT, respectively (P=0.09).
8  Jacobson et al. reported on the experience at the 
University of Florida, using radiation doses up to 45 Gy.  The authors noted no evaluable complications 
related to radiation alone, but rather related more  commonly to the tumor itself or surgical resection.65 
Investigators at the University of Utah performed  a similar analysis of radiation dose response for 
neuroblastoma.  The authors observed local failures af ter doses up to 45 Gy in children older than three 
years.65  Although authors of both studies state that do ses lower than 45 Gy may be adequate for some 
patients with neuroblastoma, the vast minority of  patients in these studies had high-risk disease and 
therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the appropriate dose to the primary site in patients 
with high-risk disease.  In fact, a recent abstract from the University Children’s Hospital in Cologne, 
Germany, reported that 36 Gy of external beam ra diation therapy (EBRT) administered to patients with 
incompletely resected primary tumors could compensate for “the disadvantage of incomplete response to 
induction chemotherapy.”  In this report of the NB97 tr ial for patients one year of age or older with stage 
4 neuroblastoma, patients with isolated localized  residual disease had improved outcome following EBRT 
(3-y-EFS 100%, 3-y-OS 100%) compared those not r eceiving EBRT despite residual tumor tissue (3-y-
EFS 20±18%, p<0.001; 3-y-OS 20±18%, p<0.001).66  
 
Given the high rates of local recurrence, particularly  following an incomplete surgical resection, and the 
tolerable toxicity of EBRT evident in multi-institutional trials, patients enrolled onto ANBL0532 who have an incomplete surgical resection of the pr imary tumor will receive 21.6 Gy EBRT to the post-
induction chemotherapy, pre-operative primary tumor volume and an additional boost of 14.4 Gy EBRT 
to the gross residual volume (total dose 36 Gy to gross residual tumor volume).  The additional dose of 14.4 Gy to gross residual disease is unlikely to result  in significantly increased toxicities.  In CCG 3891, 
the administration of EBRT was not associated with enhanced toxicities with the exception of parenteral 
nutrition requirement, which occurred in 55% and 44 % of patients who did and did not receive EBRT, 
respectively (P=0.049).  Furthermore, 36 Gy is well with in normal tissue tolerance for most organs within 
the field of radiation.  Kidneys and liver will likely prove to be the dose-limiting structures and the same guidelines for maximal doses to normal structures w ill be followed, as is standard in all current 
neuroblastoma protocols.   It should also be noted that the boost fo r patients with incomplete resections 
will deliver an additional 14.4 Gy (from 21.6 Gy to 36. 0 Gy) only to regions of gross residual disease, a 
target that generally is substantially smaller than  the original pre-operative tumor volume that receives 
21.6 Gy.  
 2.9 Surgery  
Biopsy at initial diagnosis is necessary to obtain adequate tissue for biologic studies and enrollment on 
the Neuroblastoma Biology Protocol.  Resection of the primary tumor and bulky metastatic disease is usually necessary to achieve CR or VGPR after inducti on chemotherapy. A retrospective analysis of high 
risk neuroblastoma patients enrolled onto CCG 3891 demonstrated improved resectability of primary tumor after initial chemotherapy and revealed a tre nd toward improved survival for those patients who 
underwent gross total resection of primary tumor, 5-year EFS 30 +/- 3% and 25 +/- 3%, respectively 
(p=0.1010).
67 Acute surgical complication rates and characteristics were independent of timing of primary 
tumor resection. Based upon these data, patients en rolled onto the recently co mpleted A3973 underwent 
delayed surgical resection of the primary tumor after 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Tumor biopsy at 
diagnosis was required to obtain adequate tissue fo r assessment of biologic characteristics.  ANBL0532 
will utilize this treatment strategy and prospectively evaluate if complete primary tumor resection is 
predictive of local control and EFS in high risk neuroblastoma patients.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 24 Early and late postoperative complications are know n to occur following extensive tumor resection for 
neuroblastoma.  These complications may include adh esive bowel obstruction, chylous leak, ipsilateral 
renal injury, atrophy or loss, and chronic diarrhea.  Group wide studies have regularly sought data on 
intraoperative and 30 day postoperative complications.  Adkins et al. reported normal organ removal in 
19% of high risk neuroblastoma patients who underwent complete resection of primary tumor.  There was 
no statistical difference in acute intra-operative or  peri-operative complications, including risk for 
hemorrhage, renal injury, wound complication or acute bow el obstruction, regardless of extent of surgical 
resection.67  There is potential for bias in this study, given the retrospective collection of data.  Extended 
observations are necessary to detect late postoperative complications, as they may relate to the extent of 
resection and subsequent surgical and radiotherapeutic  efforts to achieve local control.  Specifically, 
extended follow up will be necessary to detect the occurrence of adhesive bowel obstruction and renal 
atrophy related to surgically induced  ischemic events while the risk fo r chylous leak or diarrhea may be 
related to extensive retroperitoneal dissection.  Rates of these complications should be correlated with the 
surgical and radiotherapeutic effo rts in obtaining local control as they may impact on future management 
decisions.  2.10 Neurologic Outcome of Patients with Epidural Neuroblastoma  
Epidural or intradural extension of tumor occurs in approximately 5-15% of patients diagnosed with 
neuroblastoma, and may occur with or without neurologic impairment.
8,68  Epidural neuroblastoma with 
spinal cord compression is an oncologic emergency that  warrants immediate intervention.  However, the 
choice of emergent therapy remains somewhat c ontroversial, with pediatric oncologists favoring 
chemotherapy and neurosurge ons favoring laminectomy with surgical decompression.69  There are several 
retrospective reports of similar neurologic outcome for patients tr eated with chemotherapy versus 
laminectomy,70-73 and therefore emergent chemotherapy has become a preferable alternative to 
laminectomy in most cases, in an effort to diminish the devastating late orthopedic effects of laminectomy 
in infants or young children.  Radiation therapy has generally been reserved for situations of progressive or persistent neurologic dysfunction de spite chemotherapy and laminectomy. 
 This study will prospectively characterize multiple aspects of neurologic disability at diagnosis and 
during the follow-up period in an effort to systemat ically study the neurologic outcome of patients with 
primary neuroblastoma tumors with intraspinal extension (see Appendix III).  A multidisciplinary evaluation at the time of diagnosis, including oncology , neurosurgery, and radiation oncology, is strongly 
encouraged.  It is the intent of this study that patie nts with clinical signs of spinal cord compression will 
be treated with primary chemotherapy, unless the multid isciplinary evaluation determines that surgical 
decompression would be more appropriate.  Radiat ion therapy should be reserved for patients whose 
neurologic status deteriorates despite chem otherapy and surgical decompression. 
 2.11  Maintenance Therapy  
The presence of minimal residual disease despite achievement of maximal response to induction and consolidation therapy results in continued risk for neuroblastoma relap se. This was demonstrated in the 
CCG-3891 study where the benefit of additional non-cross resistant therapy, 13-cis Retinoid acid (cis-
RA) administered following myeloablative consolid ation therapy was observed. Patients with newly 
diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma enrolled in CC G3891 were randomized at week 34 of therapy 
(following either chemotherapy or ABMT consolidati on) to no further therapy versus cis-RA for six 
months. Cis-RA or isotretinoin is a synthetic retinoid derived from the naturally occurring all transretinoic 
acid by modification of the terminal carboxyl group . When neuroblastoma cell lines are exposed to all-
trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA) or cis-RA in vitro,  they exhibit decreased proliferation, decreased 
expression of the MYCN oncogene, and morphological differentiation.
74-77  Growth arrest and 
differentiation in response to cis-RA have been ob served in neuroblastoma cell lines initiated from tumors 
at the time of progression after chemoradiotherapy, 74,75 suggesting that resistance to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy does not induce resistance to cis-RA. cis-RA was well tolerated in a pediatric Phase I trial using an intermittent administration schedule of twice daily administration for 14 days followed by 14 
days with no therapy.
74  cis-RA toxicities are generally mild; consisting primarily of chelitis, dry skin, and 
hypertriglyceridemia,78  with hypercalcemia seen at higher doses.79  A significant difference in the three 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 25 year EFS from the time of this randomization in the patients receiving cis-RA (46%) versus those with no 
further therapy (29%), with p value of 0.027 in a test of proportions.13  This advantage for EFS was seen 
in subgroups by prior randomization, such that the best overall EFS was for patients treated with ABMT 
with cis-RA (55% EFS), second was ABMT wit hout cis-RA (39%), third was chemotherapy 
consolidation with cis-RA (32%), and fourth  was chemotherapy without cis-RA (18%).  
 
Despite the use of cis-RA, greater than 40% of child ren will develop recurrent neuroblastoma. To further 
improve outcome, the efficacy of novel, anti-neuroblastoma targeted immunotherapy to eliminate minimal residual disease has been evaluated. Anti- gangliosidase (GD2) monoclonal antibody ch14.18 has 
shown preclinical and early clinical activity agains t neuroblastoma, which was enhanced when combined 
with GM-CSF or IL2. COG ANBL0032 was designed to determine if adding ch14.18 + GM-CSF + IL2 to standard therapy of isotretinoin after intensiv e multimodality therapy improved outcome for high-risk 
neuroblastoma patients. High-risk neuroblastoma pati ents who responded to induction therapy and stem 
cell transplant were randomized to 6 cycles of isotre tinoin (standard therapy) or 6 cycles of isotretinoin 
with 5 concomitant cycles of ch14.18 combined with GM-CSF or IL2 in alternating cycles (immunotherapy). An intent-to-treat randomized  comparison (Lan-DeMets interim monitoring, 
cumulative alpha=0.025) was performed for event free survival (EFS). A total of 226 eligible patients 
were evenly randomized to standard or immunot herapy. Immunotherapy was associated with grade ≥3 
pain, vascular leak syndrome and hypersensitivity reactions in 51%, 23% and 25% of patients, 
respectively. With 61% of expected events observed, the study met criteria for early stopping for efficacy. 
Median follow-up was 2.1 years. Two-year EFS estimates were 66%±5% for patients randomized to 
immunotherapy versus 46%±5% for standard therapy (p =0.01). OS was also superior (p=0.02, unadjusted 
for interim looks) for immunotherapy : (86%±4%*) versus isotretinoin alone (75%±5%*). Moreover, for 
the major subgroup of patients ≥1 year of age with stage 4 disease, EFS was significantly greater (p= 
0.02) for the immunotherapy group (63% 6%*), as compared to isotretinoin alone (42% 6%*).  (*2-year 
estimates) (Alice Yu; personal communication, COG ANBL0032 study report).  Immunotherapy consisting of ch14. 18 with GM-CSF and IL2 significantly improves outcome for high-
risk neuroblastoma patients. Ch14.18 remains under clinical investigation through COG ANBL0032 and 
ANBL0931 protocols to further evaluate efficacy and toxicity. Given the significant improvement in survival from high risk neuroblastoma following an tiGD2 antibody therapy, patients enrolled onto 
ANBL0532 should be encouraged to participate in activ ely enrolling clinical trials of ch14.18 antibody, 
(i.e. ANBL0032 or ANBL0931). Patients who are not e ligible to receive ch14.18 antibody therapy or 
decline immunotherapy will remain on ANBL0532 and r eceive six months of cis-RA post ASCT based 
on the significant improvement in EFS w ith cis-RA documented by CCG3891 trial. 
 2.12 Biologic Correlative Studies  
 2.12.1 Enrollment on COG ANBL00B1
 
Enrollment on COG ANBL00B1 (Neuroblastoma Biolog y Study) is an eligibility requirement for 
ANBL0532 as assignment to clinical risks groups and different COG neuroblastoma  therapeutic clinical 
trials is dependent upon accurate histologic and biologic diagnosis.  Although submission of paraffin-
embedded tissue is acceptable for enrollment onto ANBL00B1, the COG Neuroblastoma committee encourages the submission of fresh  or snap-frozen tissue, peripheral blood, or bone marrow specimen.  
The acquisition of these primary tumor specimens w ill enable additional correlative biologic studies.  
Enrollment on both COG ANBL0532 and ANBL00B1 has the significant advantage of allowing the correlation of novel biologic parameters with a clinically well-characterized (including treatment and outcome) cohort of patients.  
 
2.12.2 Cyclophosphamide Pharmacogenomics in Pediatric Patients  
 Although the efficacy of cyclophosphamide is well established in NB patients, considerable inter-patient 
variability exists in response and toxicity.  Variability in cyclophosphamide  metabolism may result in 
such clinical variability.  Cyclophosphamide dos ing based on body weight (mg/kg) or BSA (mg/m
2) 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 26 results in a wide area under the concentration-time cu rve (AUC) range of the parent drug, and an even 
greater variability in the AUC of its metabolites.80  Children have a faster clearance of cyclophosphamide 
relative to adults,81  although the clinical significance of this difference in disposition is unclear.82  Recent 
studies have revealed an association between the AUC of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites to the 
risk of recurrence in children receiving sta ndard dose cyclophosphamide (i.e., 300-1000 mg/m2) for 
treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.82,83  
 The pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and its me tabolites HCY and CEPM were evaluated in 18 of 
the 31 patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma enrolled in COG ANBL02P1.  Median 
patient age was 2.5 years (range:  0.9-9.4).

The median clearance was 2.43 L/hr*m2 (range: 0.0.88 – 4.32) after dose 1 and 4.35 (1.55-8.54) after 
dose 4, consistent with previous reports 81,83-85  Topotecan did not appear to effect cyclophosphamide 
clearance. Similar to our observations in pa tients receiving Cyclophosphamide/TBI, there was 
considerable interpatient variability in the AUC of  cyclophosphamide with even greater interpatient 
variability in exposure to the metabolites. After dose 1, variability of the AUC of cyclophosphamide (3.1 
fold), HCY (8.4 fold) and CEPM (8 .3 fold) was comparable to that measured in cyclophosphamide/TBI 
patients (i.e., 3.3, 7.8 and 16.1 fold, personal communication J. McCune).  Auto-induction of 
cyclophosphamide clearance was observed in 14 of the 15 children for whom cyclophosphamide AUC was available after doses 1 and 4, again similar to other reports.
86-89 The AUC HCY and AUC CEPM increased 
in four and three children, respectively.   
 
Multivariate analysis was conducted to evaluate for determinants of AUC of cyclophosphamide, HCY and CEPM.  Two of the 21 chil dren received cyclophosphamide 13.3 mg/kg; their AUCs were 
normalized to cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m
2 to allow for inclusion in this multivariate analysis.  
Multivariate regression analysis indicated that age, weight and body surface area explained only 23% of 
the variability in CY clearance after dose 1.  Fu rthermore, the AUC of cyclophosphamide and its 
metabolites were not consistently correlated.   
 
Cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetic assess ments are unlikely to be used c linically given the variability in 
cyclophosphamide metabolism and the resource in tensity of cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetic 
evaluations.  Alternatively, genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in cyclophosphamide metabolism 
may correlate with cyclophosphami de pharmacokinetics and may predict toxicity and anti-tumor activity 
of the ANBL0532 cyclophosphamide containing induction regimen.  Cyclophosphamide is activated by several cytochrome P450 enzymes which have genetic polymorphisms, specifically CYP3A4/5, 
CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2B6.
90 CYP2B6 *5 and *6 alleles have been associated with either altered 
activation of HCY or clinical outcome. Their frequencies in Caucasians are 25% and 26-41%, 
respectively.91 Several genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C9 ha ve functional consequences on the enzyme’s 
activity; CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 are the most common variants. 92  In Caucasians, 65% of individuals 
are homozygotes for CYP2C9*1, 22% are heterozygous or homozygous for CYP2C9*2 and 13% carry 
CYP2C9*3. The expression of these alleles is less common in African-Americans or Chinese (<2% - 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 27 3.5%, respectively). 92,93 The CYP2C9*2 allele is characterized by an arginine to cysteine exchange at 
position 144 (Cys144 – Ile 359), while in CYP2C9*3 isoleucine 359 is changed to leucine (Arg144 – 
Leu359). Both CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 are non-null alleles which code for functional protein with 
reduced levels of enzyme activity. CYP2C9*2 carriers have a moderate reduc tion in activity, while the 
reduction in activity is most marked for CYP2C9*3 .92,93  GSTA1, the predominant GST involved in the 
metabolism of cyclophosphamide, exhibits a polym orphism that influences its hepatic expression. 
GSTA1*B, which is several linked single nucleotide pol ymorphisms in the proximal promoter region of 
the GSTA1 gene, has reduced levels of GSTA1 enzyme. The expression of GSTA1*B does not differ by 
ethnic group; GSTA1*A/*B occurs in 49% and GSTA 1*B/*B occurs in 16% of a population of breast 
cancer patients.94  
 
ANBL0532 will assess whether host genetic polym orphisms in CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and GSTA1 
genotypes involved in the metabolic activation and cl earance of cyclophosphamide are correlated with 
Cyclophosphamide/Topo associated toxicity and tumor response.  Prior studies have established genotype-phenotype relationships for the CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and GSTA1 genes for both  in vitro 
analyses
95 and in metastatic breast cancer patients receiving high dose cyclophosphamide as a component 
of a HSCT preparative regimen.96  The pharmacology laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center is currently conducting an analysis of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 , CYP3A5, ABCC2, GSTA1, GSTM1, 
GSTT1 genetic polymorphisms in 147 patients who received CY in combination with TBI in preparation for HSCT. Preliminary analysis su ggests that polymorphisms in CY P2B6, CYP2C9, and GSTA1 are key 
enzymes associated with toxicity (personal communicati on, J. McCune).  An exploratory analysis of co-
variance (ANCOVA) was conducted using limited ANBL02P 1 data.  Age was used as a co-variate for 
three genes (GST, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) upon the following endpoints after the first cyclophosphamide 
dose (i.e., dose 1):  AUCCY, CY clearance, AUCHCY, AUCCEPM.  CYP2C9 was the only gene that 
trended towards statistical significance with AUC CY, cyclophosphamide clearance (p=0.37), AUCHCY 
(p=0.89), AUCCEPM (p=0.80).   
 
2.12.3 13-cis Retinoic acid Pharmacokinetics  
The variability of cis-RA continuous steady state (CSS) plasma levels and/or gene tic variations in retinoic 
acid metabolic enzymes may correlate with event-free su rvival or systemic toxicity (CTC Grade 3/4 skin, 
hypercalcemia and hepatic toxicity) in high-risk  neuroblastoma patients. Pharmacokinetics studies 
performed on patients in the Phase I trial of cis-RA showed significant interpatient and intrapatient 
variability in peak serum levels (mean peak  serum cis-RA concentration: 7.2 ± 5.3 μM; trough 
concentration: 4.1 ± 2.7 μM). It was noted that peak serum concentrations above 10 μM were associated 
with a higher incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicities in patients.97,98 cis-RA may be subject to first-pass 
metabolism and subsequent plasma (and tumor) concentr ations will depend on the rate of metabolism to 
its inactive 4-oxo metabolite. Preliminary data from a pilot study in the UK (UKCCSG Study PK 2000 
08) has shown that plasma concentrations of 4-ox o-13-cis-RA can accumulate to exceed those of the 
parent compound. A ~10- fold variation in 4-oxo-13-cis- RA peak plasma concentrations was found. It is 
proposed that increased levels of this metabolite in vivo may lead to a diminished efficacy of cis-RA.99   
 
A number of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have b een identified as playing a role in the metabolism 
of cis-RA.100,101  CYP2C8 is most important in terms of activity and level of expression in the liver.  
Genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 gene have been described 100  which result in a lower rate of 
paclitaxel metabolism and are commonly seen in a Caucasian population.102,103  Thus, genetic variation in 
CYP2C8 activity could underlie individual differences in cis-RA metabolism and bioavailability. The 
fetal isoform CYP3A7, which is expressed post-natally  in a significant number of individuals, also 
metabolizes cis-RA 100.  The expression of CYP3A7, and thus the contribution of this isoform to cis-RA 
metabolism, may be predicted by genotyping in a pediatric population.  A further aspect of cis-RA 
metabolism is glucuronidation, both of the parent drug and of 4-hydroxy-metabolites. This conjugation 
may be mediated by UGT1A1 or UGT2B7, 104 both enzymes that are subject to genetic polymorphisms.105  
Results from this study will provide an insight into  whether modulation of cis-RA dosing according to 
blood levels achieved and/or genotype,  could be used in future studies to optimize the treatment of high-

Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG).  
2.12.4 Topotecan Pharmacokinetics
 
Many individual pharmacokinetic studies of topotecan in children with cancer have been conducted, and 
results have shown wide interindividu al variability in topotecan clearance.42,45,49  Due to the inherent 
variability in topotecan disposition, investigators have used pharmacokinetically guided dosing to 
individualize the topotecan dosage for each patient based  upon their systemic clearance and the goals of 
the clinical trial.  The response rate for this approach has been promising.106,107  Although 
pharmacokinetically guided topotecan is a promising approach to dosing topotecan, it has limitations and 
it is important to find ways to simplify th e current pharmacokinetic dosing strategy.   
 
One approach would be to use a dosing model ba sed upon patient specific covariates identified in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis.  Such an analysis of topotecan lactone pharmacokinetics has been conducted in a large pediatric patient  population, which includes patients with many different diagnoses.  
The covariates identified in this analysis included BSA, age, phenytoin coadministration, calculated 
glomerular filtration rate, and serum creatinine.  However, for the current application the patient population will be limited to children with high-risk  neuroblastoma and only total topotecan (combination 
of lactone and carboxylate forms) will be available for pharmacokinetic analysis.  Thus, a more limited 
population pharmacokinetic analysis was undertaken of the ANBL02P1 total topotecan plasma concentration-time data.  In this analysis, the only patient covariate identified as significantly related to 
topotecan total clearance was sex with females having a lower clearance.  Clearly this covariate will not 
be very informative in a dosing model.  Thus, it would be helpful to gain additional covariate data in this 
patient population, and relate that to total topotecan clearance determined using a limited sampling model.  
Ultimately, data collected in this Phase III clinical trial will be used to derive a dosing algorithm for 
topotecan in children with high-risk neuroblastoma that will either not need plasma topotecan 
concentrations or at most use only one plasma concentr ation.  By using this dosing model, the interpatient 
variability in topotecan systemic exposure can be mi nimized, and the full therapeutic efficacy of this 
compound can be realized. 
 
2.12.5 Cellular Immune Responses to Neuroblastoma  
Despite low or absent expression of MHC class I, T cells capable of recognizing neuroblastoma cells and 
acting as effector cells have been described. Survivin has the potential to be a relevant tumor antigen in 
neuroblastoma, as it is widely expressed108 and expression is inversely correlated with prognosis.109 
Moreover, as a key inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin may be required for tumor growth and development, 
making its potential loss as a means of escape of th e tumor from immune surveillance difficult. We 
hypothesize that cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) directed  against survivin+ targets will be detectable in 
the blood of neuroblastoma patients. Additionally, these CTL will be expanded by exposure to two 
different preparations of antigen presenting cells (APCs). One APC type will be transfected with survivin 
mRNA, providing surviving peptides to the MHC of th e APC, while the second AP C type will be loaded 
with neuroblastoma RNA. The APC used in our studi es has been an activated B cell, referred to as a 
CD40-B. Relevant prior work fro m the Grupp and Vonderheide labs110 show that: 1) CD40-B cells serve 
as efficient APCs, inducing antigen-specific and anti- tumor CTL. 2) Large numbers of CD40-B APCs can 
be grown from small volumes of peripheral blood, as opposed to dendritic cells, which require pheresis to collect in adequate numbers. 3) RNA transfectio n efficiently transduces CD40-B APC, allowing 
expansion of tumor-specific CTL from patient blood samples even in a tumor like neuroblastoma in which tumor antigens are not known. 4) Neuroblastoma expresses survivin. 5) Survivin-specific CTL can 
be detected at diagnosis in up to 50% of neurobl astoma patients and expanded  using either survivin-
transfected CD40-B or CD40-B transfected with neuroblastoma RNA.
110 Iinitial studies demonstrate that 
T cells active against survivin+ targets emerge whethe r survivin RNA or whole tumor RNA is used as the 
antigenic stimulus. 6) Survivin-specific CTL secretes IFN-gamma in response to tumor and effectively lyse survivin+ neuroblastoma targets. 7)  CD107a is a marker of CTL function
111 and can also be used to 
demonstrate that CTL specific for the immunodominan t epitope of survivin are responsible for anti-
neuroblastoma killing activity. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 29  
These data point to survivin as an important tumor antigen in neuroblastoma, show feasibility of using 
tumor RNA to provide an antigenic payload to APCs and confirm that neuroblastoma is a tumor 
susceptible to immune recognition. Data revea ling tumor RNA-loaded APC produce tetramer+ CTL 
directed against survivin that are capable lysi ng autologous tumor provides key evidence of the 
importance of survivin in neuroblastoma. These results  need to be confirmed in the larger number of 
samples available from the patients on this clinical trial. These experiments will allow us to further characterize survivin as a potential tumor antigen in neuroblastoma. 
 
2.12.6 Cellular Immunity after Myeloablative Chemotherapy  
Increasing intensity of therapy has the potential to increase extent and duration of immune suppression, 
especially of adaptive immunity. This was apparent in the CHOP/DFCI tandem HSCT experience27 where 
a combination of tandem HSCT, use of TBI and, pot entially, use of CD34 selection of PBSC produced 
significant T cell immune suppression .112 We hypothesize that patients on the tandem HSCT arm will 
experience slower T cell recovery, specifically of CD4+ T cells. Enumerati on of CD3, CD4 and CD8 
cells post HSCT is available at all FACT-approved HSCT centers, and is part of post-HSCT routine 
follow up at many centers. There is also value in following CD4 recovery to guide the level of viral 
surveillance and isolation precautions that may or may not be required for an in dividual patient. Thus, we 
propose to perform these assays at 1, 3 and 6 months post-HSCT, comparing T cell recovery across arms 
of the study. These assessments will provide a valuable baseline for studies that may utilize either of the 
ANBL0532 regimens, especially in the context of i mmunotherapies that may require functional T cell 
recovery. 
 
2.12.7 Minimal Residual Disease  
Despite initial response to therapy, the majority of  children with high-risk neuroblastoma will develop 
recurrent or progressive disease.  More sensitive me thods for the detection of minimal residual disease 
(MRD) are needed.  Several reports de monstrated the high sensitivity (1 x 10-4 to 10-6 normal cells) of 
immunocytological assays in bone marrow,113-115  bone marrow autograft116 and peripheral blood 
samples.117 Quantitative levels of bone marrow infiltration using immunocytological assays have been 
predictive of outcome for patients with stage 3 and 4 disease.118,119. More recently amplification of tissue-
specific mRNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chai n reaction (RT-PCR) has been used to detect 
minimal disease burden (reviewed in120).  Investigators have employ ed an RT-PCR assay, using both 
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the neuronal gene (PGP  9.5) which has a sensitivity of 1 tumor cell per 
million hematopoietic cells.121  Although IC and RT-PCR appear to be ideal tools for monitoring MRD, 
reaching a sensitivity of one tumor cell detected in 1 x 105 to 106 normal cells, their introduction into 
clinical management of children with neuroblastom a has been slow. ANBL0532 will evaluate the clinical 
relevance of tumor cells detected by these techniques. Immunocytology and RT-PCR studies will be used on bone marrow, peripheral blood, and PBSC co llections to examine the question of tumor 
contamination. The incidence of RT-PCR positivity in  stem cell products infused will be prospectively 
monitored.  Furthermore, the incidence of RT-PCR positivity in bone marrow and peripheral blood will 
be compared following consolidation therapy betw een single verus tandem myeloablative therapy.  
 
2.13 Gender and Race Differences  
In CCG-3891, stage at diagnosis and EFS were similar between genders, however there was a trend for males to have better EFS than females on the ABMT arm of the study.  There was a significant interactive 
effect, in which the benefit of ABMT was restricted to males.  No differences in outcome by gender were 
observed in the earlier 321P3 transplant study.  There were no differences on CCG-3891 with respect to gender, regarding the effect of 13-cis-RA on EFS.  Data from CCG-3891 also showed a lower overall 
EFS for African Americans versus Whites or Hispanics.   African Americans had equivalent outcome on 
the ABMT arm, but lower EFS if treated on the chemotherapy arm in comparison with Whites.  No ethnic differences were seen in the outcomes of patients treated with cis-RA.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 30 2.14 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Immunocytology (Amendment #2)  
Patients will undergo collection of peripheral blood stem cell product following 2 cycles of induction 
chemotherapy.  The ANBL0532 study has previ ously mandated immunocytology assessment of 
peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) product for tumo r contamination. The laboratory at Children’s 
Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) that has previ ously performed the immunocytology assay for CCG 
3891, COG A3973 and COG ANBL0532 no longer has CLIA certification and no validated CLIA-
approved alternative labor atory testing exists. 
 ANBL0532 Amendment #2 will NOT REQUIRE immunocytology assessment of PBSC for tumor 
contamination. The amendment to this study will al so remove mandatory PBSC specimen shipment to 
CHLA for immunocytology testing. Data from the most recent generation of COG high-risk 
neuroblastoma trials show that tumor contaminati on is rare and is not an  independent prognostic 
determinate of outcome. COG A3973 determined tumor cell contamination of PB SC by immunocytologic 
assessment in only 5 of 487 (1%) of PBSC products collected after 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy. 
More importantly, COG A3973 demonstrated no benef it from anti-tumor purging of PBSC product using 
the same antibodies used for immunocytologic detecti on and support the conclusion that tumor recurrence 
is not directly related to tumor cell re-infusi on from the PBSC product. Taken together, the COG 
neuroblastoma committee has concluded that there ar e no data to support the clinical utility of 
immunocytological testing of PBSC products fo r patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

CTSU. For general (non-regulatory) questions, call the CTSU General Helpdesk at: 1-888-823-5923. 
 
3.1.2 Patient Registration
 
Prior to enrollment on this study, patients must be  assigned a COG patient ID number.  This number is 
obtained via the eRDE system once authorization for th e release of protected health information (PHI) has 
been obtained.  The assigned COG patient identification number will be used to identify the patient in all 
future interactions with the COG. If you have problem s with registration, please refer to the online help in 
the eRDE area of the COG website. 
 In order for an institution to maintain COG membersh ip requirements, every newl y diagnosed patient needs 
to be offered participation in ACCRN07, Protocol for the Enrollment on the Official COG Registry, The 
Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) .  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 31 A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as part of the registration process.  Each patient will 
be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID.   Each patient will be assigned only one PBC number 
per COG Patient ID.  For additional information about the labeling of  specimens, please refer to the 
pathology and/or Biology guidelines in this protocol.   3.1.3 Enrollment on Biology Study ANBL00B1
 
Enrollment on ANBL00B1 is required for all newly diagnosed patients within 21 days of diagnosis.  Tissue procurement is mandatory for biology study registration.  For patients with stage 4S disease who are very ill 
and in whom an open biopsy to obtain tissue for di agnosis and biologic studies  is considered medically 
contraindicated, every effort should be made to obtain some tumor tissue by either fine needle aspiration of a 
metastatic site of disease and/or sampling of invol ved bone marrow, so that this tumor sample can be 
submitted for MYCN  determination.  Consent for ANBL00B1 mu st be obtained at the time of tissue 
submission and should be within one week of surgery.   Needle biopsies are not  sufficient for histologic 
classification.  Investigators are strongly encouraged to obtain adequate tissue (see Sections 13.0, 14.0, and 
15.0) via open biopsy techniques.  For patients with Stage 4 disease who are >
 547 days of age with 
unequivocal neuroblasts in the bone marrow, in whom a diagnostic biopsy is not obtained, a minimum of 
2-3 mL of involved bone marrow and a blood specimen must be sent to the reference lab per the requirements of ANBL00B1 to be eligible for this study. (See ANBL00B1 protocol for specifics)  
 
3.1.4 Study Enrollment on ANBL0532  
Patients may be enrolled on the study once all eligibilit y requirements for the study have been met.  Study 
enrollment is accomplished by going to the Enrollment  application in the eRDE system.  If you have 
problems with enrollment, refer to online help in the Applications area of the COG website. 
 
3.1.5 Timing  
Patients must be enrolled on ANBL00B1 prior to the time of enrollment on ANBL0532. In emergency situations (or if in the opinion of the treating physician, it is in the patient’s best interest) consent can be obtained and patient enrolled on ANBL00B1 and subsequently enrolled on ANBL0532 as soon as the 
assignment of “High-Risk” has been made in th e eRDE system.  When ANBL0532 enrollment is done 
prior to start of beginning protocol therapy, the date pr otocol therapy is projected to start must be no later 
than five (5)  calendar days after enrollment. In a case of a need for emergency therapy, protocol therapy 
may start before enrollment on ANBL0532; however, ANBL0532 consent part 1 must be obtained prior 
to start of therapy AND enrollm ent must take place within fourteen (14)  calendar days of beginning 
protocol therapy. Study enrollment must occur within  4 weeks of diagnosis or after only one cycle of 
chemotherapy on the low/intermediate risk neurobl astoma studies, or within 4 weeks of progression to 
stage 4 for INSS stage 1, 2, 4S.  3.1.6 Bilingual Services
  
To allow non-English speaking patients to participate in the study, bilingual health care services will be 
provided in the appropriate language. 
 
3.1.7 Randomization  
Randomization will take place at completion of Induction phase of therapy via RDE.  Patients will be 
assigned to either single myeloablative therapy or ta ndem myeloablative therapy.  Randomization will be 
stratified by initial stage of disease, biologic characteristics and response to indu ction chemotherapy.     
 3.1.8 Non-Randomized Consolidation therapy:
 
Patients 365 to 547 days of age (12 – 18 months) with Stage 4, MYCN  nonamplified tumor with 
unfavorable histopathology or diploid DNA content or  with indeterminant histology or ploidy and 
patients who are greater than 54 7 days of age with Stage 3, MYCN  nonamplified tumor AND 
unfavorable histopathology or  indeterminant histology  will be nonrandomly assigned to single 
myeloablative transplant arm.

Page 34 4.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
 
 
    
 
 4.1 General Guidelines  
This study will be a Phase III trial that analyses the use of intensified consolidation in high-risk 
neuroblastoma. 
  Myeloblative consolidation therapy is given at th e completion of induction therapy and is categorized 
into Regimen A and Regimen B.  Regimen A consis ts of one myeloablative consolidation with a 
CARBOplatin – etoposide – melphalan (CEM) preparativ e regimen. For Regimen B, patients will receive 
two myeloablative consolidations: Thiotepa – cycl ophosphamide (TC) preparative regimen followed by 
CEM preparative regimen.  
 
Most patients will be randomized into either Regimen A or Regimen B. Randomization will be stratified by stage, MYCN status and response to induction therapy.  
 
The following patients will be nonrandomly assigned  to single myeloablative transplant (Regimen A): 
 Patients who are 365 to 547 days of age (12 – 18 months) with Stage 4, MYCN  nonamplified 
tumor with any of the following potent ially unfavorable biologic features: 
o unfavorable histopathology 
o diploid DNA content 
o indeterminant histopathology 
o indeterminate ploidy 
 Patients who are grea ter than 547 days of age with Stage 3, MYCN  nonamplified tumor with 
either of the following: 
o unfavorable histopathology  
o indeterminant histopathology   
 
Patients who develop progressive disease (PD) at the end of induction, those w ho are unable to obtain 
adequate PBSC for transplant or who have GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 will be taken off protocol therapy. 
Refer to protocol section 8.1.1 for complete definition of off protocol therapy criteria. 
 4.1.1 Central Line
 
All patients will have a double lumen central venous line placed prior to beginning induction chemotherapy.  4.1.2 Chemotherapy doses for all drugs EXCEPT topotecan will be adjusted for patients who weigh <
 12 kg; 
these patients will have chemotherapy dosed per kg rather than per body surface area (BSA).  Dosing 
will be adjusted only during cycles when patient’s weight is <  12 kg. Topotecan dosing will be based on 
BSA regardless of age or weight.   
 
 4.1.3 Induction Therapy
 
Patients will receive 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy cycles (except Cycle 1) may begin when the ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL after post-chemotherapy nadir.  There are no 
hematologic criteria to begin Cycle 1. Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease eval uations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for 
valid clinical, patient and family logistical , or facility,  procedure and/or anesthesia 
scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where 
explicitly prohibited within the protocol).
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 35 Patients who received one cycle of chemotherapy pe r low or intermediate risk neuroblastoma therapy 
(P9641, A3961, ANBL0531) prior to determination of MYCN amplification and histology will receive all 
6 cycles of ANBL0532 induction therapy. 
 
4.1.3.1 Patients will undergo surgical resection after Cycle 5 (or Cycle 6, if medically necessary).  Begin next chemotherapy cycle as soon as possible following surgery.  Therapy should not be delayed by more than one week unless complications arise.  If surgery canno t be scheduled after Cycle 5, it should occur after 
Cycle 6. 
 
4.1.3.2 Primary and metastatic tumor response will be assessed  after 2 cycles and at completion of induction 
chemotherapy.  Primary site tumor assessment prior to surg ical resection (Cycle 5 or Cycle 6, if 
medically necessary) is mandatory as the pre-su rgical primary tumor volume will be used to 
establish radiation fields. 
 
4.1.3.3 
Patients with progressive disease (PD) at the end of  induction evaluation will be taken off protocol 
therapy.  
 
4.1.3.4 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvest (PBSC) (See Section 19.0 for complete details) Patients will undergo PBSC harvest after 2 cycles REGAR DLESS of persistent bo ne marrow metastatic 
disease. There will not be any no ex vivo  manipulation of PBSC prior to cryopreservation as results from 
the randomized question in A3973 did not demonstrate a benefit in survival following ex vivo purging of PBSC product.   
 
 PBSC collection will be performed prior to randomi zation.  Therefore, all patients must have a PBSC 
collection that is sufficient for tandem transplant with a goal for collection of 10 x 10
6 CD 34+cells/kg 
divided into 3 separate aliquots.  A minimum number of frozen PBSC of 4 x 106 CD34 cells/kg divided 
into 2 aliquots is require d for all patients (2 x 106 CD34 cells/kg for each transplant) to remain eligible for 
transplant while an additional 3rd aliquot of 2 x 106 CD34 cells/kg is strongly recommended to be stored 
for back-up.   4.2 Induction Therapy Administration  
 
 For patients > 12 kg, chemotherapy doses will be calculated by body surface area (BSA). 
 For patients <  12 kg, chemotherapy doses for all drugs EXCEPT topotecan will be dosed per 
kg rather than per BSA.   
 Topotecan dosing will be based on BSA regardless of age or weight. 
 Note specific dosing instructions for vinCRIStine in Cycles 4 and 6 of induction. 
 Myeloid Growth Factors : During induction cycles 1 and 3-6 (all induction cycles except cycle 2 or other 
cycles in which PBSC collections are planned), cytokine support need not be limited to G-CSF i.e: other 
growth factors are permitted according to an instituti on’s standard guidelines. Choice of myeloid growth 
factor must be recorded appropriately in the ther apy delivery maps. Myeloid growth factors (including G-
CSF) should be administered 24 – 48 hours after th e last dose of chemotherapy. Daily myeloid growth 
factor therapy should be continued until the ANC > 1500/µL. Discontinue daily myeloid growth factor 
support a minimum of 24 hours prior to administration of the next chemotherapy cycle. See Appendix II for supportive care guidelines. 
 
Institutions are permitted to use their standard guideli nes for hydration/monitoring parameters pertaining 
to chemotherapy agents utilized in this protocol.  In the absence of institutional standards, suggested 
guidelines are included in the therapy delivery maps that follow.

Surgical resection of soft tissue disease will occur during induction ther apy.  Refer to section 13.0 for 
complete details.  
 
4.3.1 Timing of Surgery  
Second look surgery  
Residual persistent mass after initial chemotherapy is  common, and in previous analyses is not correlated 
with patient outcome.  All patient s will undergo attempt at complete surgical resection of primary tumor 
following Cycle 5 (or Cycle 6, if medica lly necessary) of induction chemotherapy. 
 
 
4.4 Consolidation Therapy  
 
Eligibility to proceed to Consolidation Therapy/Tran splant:  Only patients who have a minimum number 
of frozen PBSC of 4 x 106 CD 34+ cells/kg (minimum of 2 x 106 CD 34+ cells/kg/transplant), who have 
adequate organ function, who do not have progressive disease at end of induction AND who have 
consented to Consent Part 2 are eligible for transplantation.   
 
Eligibility for randomization:  Patients must first be eligib le to proceed to transplant in order to be eligible for 
randomization.  Patients will be randomly assigned to ei ther single myeloablative therapy (Regimen A) with 
a CARBOplatin, etoposide, melphalan (CEM) preparative regime n and autologous PBSC rescue 
(representing the standard arm of the study), OR to the experimental arm of tandem myeloablative therapy 
(Regimen B) with the regimen us ed in the COG ANBL00P1 (thiotepa and cyclophosphamide followed by 
CEM).   
The following patients will be nonrandomly assigned  to single myeloablative transplant (Regimen A): 
 Patients who are 365 to 547 days of age (12 – 18 months) with Stage 4, MYCN  nonamplified 
tumor with any of the following potent ially unfavorable biologic features: 
o unfavorable histopathology 
o diploid DNA content 
o indeterminant histopathology 
o indeterminate ploidy 
 Patients who are grea ter than 547 days of age with Stage 3, MYCN  nonamplified tumor with 
either of the following: 
o unfavorable histopathology  
o indeterminant histopathology   
 
 Patients should begin consolidation chemotherapy no later than 8 weeks after the start of Induction Cycle 
#6.  (It is strongly recommended to begin consolida tion within 4-6 weeks after starting Induction Cycle 
#6.) Patients who are delayed beyond 8 weeks, but who still meet organ functi on criteria should remain 
on protocol therapy and proceed to transplant.  Delay in starting transplant will be considered a protocol 
deviation.  
Patients with progressive disease at end of induction th erapy are NOT eligible to continue on protocol 
therapy.  Patients with mixed response or stable di sease evaluation may remain on protocol therapy as per 
investigator preference.  However, such patients are encouraged to come off pr otocol therapy for entry 
onto available COG Phase I and Phase II studies. 
 No restaging will be performed between Hematopoie tic Stem Cell Transplants (HSCT) or prior to 
radiation therapy unless clinically indicated.  Patie nts randomized to Regimen B will proceed to HSCT #2 
(CEM) no less than 6 and prior to 10 weeks from day 0 of HSCT #1, providing they have recovered from 
acute toxicities of HSCT#1 and meet organ eligibility criteria for HSCT #2.

*Calvert Formula for CARBOplatin dosing: 
 
  Patients with GF R < 100 ml/min/1.73 m2 who are > 12 kg will be dosed according to the formula below to 
achieve an area under the concentration versus time cu rve (AUC) of  4.1 per dose .  GFR will be calculated 
using a blood sampling method.  Daily dose should not exceed 300 mg/m2.   
 
Total Dose (mg)/day =        (Corrected GFR x surface area)     +   (15 x surface area)              x  4.1 
                           1.73 
  
Example:  Patient’s GFR is 86 mL/min/1.73 m2, they weigh 14.6 kg and their BSA is 0.61 m2: 
 
  Total dose (mg)/day = {  (86 mL/min/1.73 m2  x  0.61 m2)     +    (15 x 0.61 m2) }   x  4.1    =   162 mg  
              1.73 
NOTE : if lab reports raw GFR in mL/min instead of corrected GFR in mL/min/1.73 m2, convert Raw GFR to corrected GFR as 
follows:      Divide Raw GFR in mL/min by the patient’s surface area in m
2, then multiply result by 1.73 m2.  
     Example: Raw GFR is 30.3 mL/min, BSA = 0.61 m2:    30.3 mL/min divided by 0.61 m2 then multiplied by 1.73 m2  =  86 
mL/min/m2

using a blood sampling method.  Daily dose should not exceed 10 mg/kg.  Calculate dose by Calvert formula 
below and also calculate dose by weight (10 mg/kg).  Give LOWER of the two calculated doses.   
 
Total Dose (mg)/day = { Raw GFR  +  (0.36 x weight in kg) }  x 4.1 
 
   Example:  Patient’s GFR is 74 mL/min/1.73 m2, they weigh 10.2 kg and their BSA is 0.45 m2: 
  To convert corrected GFR reported as mL/min/1.73 m
2 to Raw GFR reported as mL/min, multiply 
corrected GFR by the patient’s BSA, then divide by 1.73 m2: 
  74 mL/min/1.73 m2 x 0.45 m2 then divided by 1.73 m2 = 19.2 mL/min 
 
 Total dose (mg/day) = {19.2 mL/min   +    (0.36 x 10.2 kg)}   x   4.1 = 94 mg

   Criteria to Start Consolidation Regimen B HSCT#2 :   
 
No restaging will be performed between transplants or prior to radiation therapy unless clinically indicated.  Patients 
randomized to Regimen B will proceed to HSCT #2 (CEM) no less than 6 weeks and prior to 10 weeks from Day 0 of HSCT #1, providing they have recovered from acute toxicities  of HSCT#1 and meet organ eligibility criteria for HSCT 
#2.   
1. All patients must have repeat GFR after recovery from HSCT #1 and prior to HSCT #2.
 If a creatinine 
clearance is performed and the result is < 100 ml/min/1.73m2, a GFR must be performed using a nuclear 
blood sampling method or iothalamate clearance method.  Camera method is NOT allowed as measure of GFR 
prior to or during Consolidation therapy if GFR/creatinine clearance is < 100 ml/min/1.73 m2. Patient is ineligible to 
receive HSCT #2 if CrCl or GFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73m2. If the GFR is < 100 ml/min/1.73m2, then modified 
dosing is used as noted below. It is recommended that the Study Chair be notified of patients with low glomerular 
filtration rates. 
2. Resolution of acute hepatic, pulmonary or cardiac toxicities devel oped during HSCT #1.  
3. AST  < 3 x upper normal 
4. Shortening fraction   27%, or ejection fraction  50%, no clinical congestive heart failure. 
5. No uncontrolled infection.  
6. No moderate or severe  sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)  (formerly veno-occlusive disease (VOD) ) during 
HDC/SCR #1 
Definition of  sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)   
SOS (formerly known as VOD) is a syndrome of hepatic dysfunction, which develops by Day+21 post stem cell transplant, and is characterized by hyperbilirubinemia ≥2 mg/dL, with at least two of the following three findings: 
ascites, hepatomegaly, which is usually painful, and weight gain >5% over baseline. Patients with SOS during SCT #1, with hepatic function meeting eligibility for SCT#2 and NOT meeting definitions for moderate or severe SOS (see below), may proceed to SCT#2. 
 
Definition of severe SOS : 
 Severe SOS is defined as a SOS episode accompanied by specific organ failure (hepatic encephalopathy (CTC Grade 4 liver dysfunction/failure, clinical will be referred as “Hepatic failure” per CTCAE v.4.0 followed starting 
July 1st, 2011), continuous oxygen requirement (CTC Grade 3 hypoxia), serum creatinine > 3 times the upper limit 
of normal (CTC Grade 3 creatinine), requirement for vent ilatory support or dialysis not clearly attributable to 
another cause. Patients with a history of severe SOS, even if resolved, should not undergo SCT#2. 
 
Definition of moderate SOS : 
 Moderate SOS is defined as a SOS episode where the peak total bilirubin was 10 mg/dL or greater (personal 
communication, Paul Richardson).  Patients with a history of moderate SOS, even if resolved, should not undergo SCT#2. 
 
7. Minimum frozen PBSC of 2 x 106 CD34 cells/kg is mandatory to proceed with second transplant.   
8. No clinical evidence of disease progression defined as increase in tumor size by 25% or new lesions; restaging 
studies between HSCT courses only as clinically indicated. 
9. ANC recovery to > 750/µL after HSCT #1  10. Platelet count > 20,000/µL or < 20,000/µL and responsive to platelet transfusion

mg/m
2.   
 
Total Dose (mg)/day =        (Corrected GFR x surface area)     +   (15 x surface area)                          x  4.1

Example:  Patient’s GFR is 86 mL/min/1.73 m2, they weigh 14.6 kg and their BSA is 0.61 m2: 
 
  Total dose (mg)/day = {  (86 mL/min/1.73 m2  x  0.61 m2)     +    (15 x 0.61 m2) }   x  4.1    =   162 mg  
              1.73 
NOTE : if lab reports raw GFR in mL/min instead of corrected GFR in mL/min/1.73 m2, convert Raw GFR to corrected 
GFR as follows: 
Divide Raw GFR in mL/min by the patient’s surface area in m2, then multiply result by 1.73 m2.  
Example: Raw GFR is 30.3 mL/min, BSA = 0.61 m2:    30.3 mL/min divided by 0.61 m2 then multiplied by 1.73 m2  
=  86 mL/min/m2

4.7 Radiation therapy  
After completion of stem cell transplantation and recovery from acute toxicity, patients will receive 
radiation therapy to the primary site of disease as well as to MIBG-avid sites that were documented at 
pre-transplant (end-induction) evaluation. Patients who have a complete surgical resection of the primary 
tumor will receive 21.6 Gy external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the post-induction chemotherapy, 
pre-operative primary tumor volume while those who have an incomplete surgical resection of the 
primary tumor (residual soft tissue mass measuring > 1 cm3) will receive 21.6 Gy EBRT to the post-
induction chemotherapy, pre-operative primary tumor volume and an additional boost of 14.4 Gy EBRT 
to the gross residual tumor (total dose 36 Gy to gross residual tumor volume).   
 
Timing of Radiation Therapy:   Radiation will be given after stem cell transplantation and should start no 
sooner than 28 days post transplant. Organ toxicity w ithin radiation field should have resolved or meet the 
protocol criteria for starting radiation therapy that are included in Section 17.0.  It is recommended to start radiation therapy within 42 days after stem cell transplant.

5.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITIES 
All toxicities should be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) v3.0 (Starting July 1st 2011, it will be graded according to CTCAE V.4.0). 
 
5.1 Myelosuppression During Induction  
 5.1.1 Dose adjustments will be made based on the neutrophil count and platelet count on Day 29 of each cycle. 
Following any cycle, if the ANC < 750/ L and/or platelet count is < 75,000/ L on Day 22, delay next 
cycle until recovery occurs or meets criteria to continue based on bone marrow tumor involvement (see 
below).  If patient recovers to ANC >
 750/L and platelets >  75,000/L by Day 29, proceed with next 
cycle at full dose.  If patient has not met hematopoie tic recovery criteria on or  before Day 29, perform 
bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.  Proceed based on he matopoietic recovery criteria (see Section 5.1.2). 
 
5.1.2 Hematopoietic Recovery Criteria  
If the marrow is positive for tumor at diagnosis or at  last evaluation, still contains tumor and is 
normocellular or mildly hypocellular with trilineag e hematopoiesis proceed with the next cycle of 
chemotherapy without alteration in dose regardless of  ANC and platelets. If the marrow has no tumor and 
is severely hypocellular without tri-lineage hematopoiesis, delay the next cycle of therapy until the ANC 
> 750/L and platelets >  75,000/L. 
 
 If recovery occurs between Day 30-43 for an y cycle of Induction, reduce the doses of all 
drugs except vincristine by 25%.  
 If recovery occurs after Day 43 of any cycle, reduce drug doses by 50%, except for 
vincristine. 
 
5.2 Hematuria During Induction  
For Cycles 1 and 2: If microscopic (> 2 abnormal urinalyses during a cycle of therapy with < Grade 2 hematuria) or gross hematuria occurs after Induction Cycle 1 cyclophosphamide, give MESNA with Induction Cycle 2 cyclophosphamide as follows: MESNA 80 mg/m² (or 2.67 mg/kg if <
 12 kg) with 
cyclophosphamide infusion, then MESNA 80 mg/m² (or 2.67 mg/kg if <  12 kg) IV over 15 minutes at 
Hours 4 and 8 from start of cyclophosphamide infusion.  If hematuria resolves prior to start of cycle 4 cyclophosphamide, administer cyclophosphamide and mesna in cycles 4 and 6 without modification.   For Cycles 4 and 6: If microscopic (> 2 abnormal urinalyses during a cycle of therapy with < Grade 2 hematuria) or gross hematuria o ccurs after Induction Cycle 4 cyclophosphamide, give mesna as a 24 hour 
continuous infusion with Induction Cycle 6 cyclopho sphamide as follows:  MESNA 560 mg/m²(or 18.7 
mg/kg if <
 12 kg) with each cyclophosphamide infusion, then MESNA 1800 mg/m² (or 60 mg/kg if <  12 
kg) in required fluid over 18 hours after cyclophosphamide infusion completed.   
 If Grade 3 or 4 hematuria occurs following a cycle of cyclophosphamide, do not give another cycle of 
cyclophosphamide, topotecan (CT) or cyclophosph amide, doxorubicin and vincristine (CDV) until 
hematuria resolves to Grade 2 or less.  If patient is due to begin next cycle of cyclophosphamide 
containing chemotherapy prior to resolution of hematuria to  Grade 2, substitute cisplatin and etoposide 
cycle. Make notation of substitution on data forms.  Th e intent of Induction is to give a total of 2 cycles 
each of CT, cisplatin/etoposide and CDV, therefore if substitution of cisplatin/ etoposide is made for 
CDV cycle or a CT cycle, make-up this missed cy clophosphamide-containing cycle later in therapy. If 
gross hematuria from cyclophosphamide recurs, delete cyclophosphamide from subsequent cycles.    
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 57  
5.3 Renal Toxicity During Induction  
 
5.3.1 Cisplatin  
No dose reductions in cisplatin will be made for a de crease in the baseline GFR or  creatinine clearance as 
long as the value remains > 60 mL/min/1.73 m².  If the serum creatinine increases > 50% during a cycle 
of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, or increased to  greater than maximum serum creatinine for age as 
listed in table below, omit the remainder of the cisplatin from that cycle.   
Age 
 Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) 
 Male Female 
1 month to < 6 months 0.4 0.4 
6 months to < 1 year 0.5 0.5 
1 to < 2 years 0.6 0.6 
2 to < 6 years 0.8 0.8 
6 to < 10 years 1 1 
10 to < 13 years 1.2 1.2 
13 to < 16 years 1.5 1.4 
≥ 16 years 1.7 1.4 
The threshold creatinine values in this Table were derived from the Schwartz formula for 
estimating GFR (Schwartz et al . J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) utiliz ing child length and stature 
data published by the CDC.  
 If GFR or creatinine clearance is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² prior to cisplatin/etoposide cycle substitute CDV 
cycle.  Make notation of substitution on data forms.  Th e intent of Induction is to give a total of 2 cycles 
of CT, 2 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide, and 2 cycles of CDV, therefore if substitution of CDV cycle is 
made for cisplatin/etoposide cycle, give the cisplatin /etoposide cycle later in therapy. Omit further cycles 
of cisplatin therapy if GFR or creatinin e clearance remains < 60 mL/min/1.73m². 
 
5.3.2 Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Topotecan and Etoposide
  
No dose reductions in cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, topotecan or etoposide are necessary 
for decrease in creatinine clearance. 
 
5.4 Cardiac Toxicity  During Induction  
 
5.4.1 For Change In Ejection/Shortening Fraction  
If the cardiac ejection fraction falls below 50% or shortening fraction below 27% and patient is 
asymptomatic  following a cycle of doxorubicin, repeat the study in one week.  If the ejection fraction or 
shortening fraction remains abnormal one week later proceed as follows: 
 If cardiac toxicity occurs prior to Cycle 4, substitute cycle of cisplatin/etoposide for CDV.  Make notation 
of substitution on data forms.  The intent of Induction is to give a tota l of 2 cycles of CDV and 2 cycles of 
cisplatin/etoposide, therefore if cisplatin/etoposide cycle substituted for CDV, give CDV cycle later in 
therapy if possible.  If cardiac function does not return to normal prior to cycle 6 or is initially noted to be abnormal prior to cycle 6 scheduled CDV, omit doxorubicin. 
 
5.4.2 For Symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
  
If at any time, the patient develops Grade 3 conges tive heart failure or dysrhythmia or any Grade 4 
cardiac toxicity not related to underlying infec tion or metabolic abnormality, omit doxorubicin from all 
subsequent cycles.  If cardiac toxicity is resolved to <  Grade 2 congestive heart failure or dysrhythmia, 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 58 decrease the dose of cyclophosphamide to 50% for the next cycle containing cyclophosphamide.  If this 
dose of cyclophosphamide is tolerated without > Grade 2 congestive heart failure or dysrhythmia, then 
administer full dose of cyclophosphamide in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.   
 Congestive Heart Failure will be referred as “Heart Failure” per CTCAE v4.0 followed starting July 1
st, 
2011.  5.4.3 For Dysrhythmia
 
If the patient develops Grade 2 cardiac dysrhythmia as defined in the Common Toxicity Criteria, repeat in 
one week.  If Grade 2 toxicity resolves to Grade 0 or 1 toxicity, patient may continue on therapy without chemotherapy dose alterations.  
 
 If Grade 2 toxicity occurs prior to Cycle 4, substitu te cisplatin/etoposide for CDV cycle until dysrhythmia 
resolves. Make a notation of chemotherapy substitution on data form.  The intent of  Induction is to give a 
total of 2 cycles of CDV and 2 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide, therefore if cisplatin/etoposide cycle substituted for CDV, give CDV cycle later in therapy. If dysrhythmia symptoms occur prior to Cycle 6, proceed with cyclophosphamide, vincristine but omit doxorubicin.   
5.4.4 Hypertension
 
Hypertension due to neuroblastoma will not  be considered reason for removal from protocol therapy or 
alteration in chemotherapy doses. 
 
5.5 Hepatotoxicity During Induction 
If direct bilirubin is > 3 mg/dL prior to Cycle 4 chemotherapy, substitute ci splatin/etoposide for CDV 
cycle.  If direct bilirubin is > 3 mg/dL prior to Cycle 6 chemotherapy, omit doxorubicin and vincristine.  
If direct bilirubin is > 1.5 but < 3 (Grade 3 toxi city) prior to Cycle 4 or 6 chemotherapy, reduce 
doxorubicin and vincristine dose by 50%.  5.6 Gastrointestinal Toxicity During Induction  
 5.6.1 Mucositis
 
If patient develops Grade 3 or 4 mucositis that resolv es to < Grade 2 by Day 22-29 of next cycle, no dose 
adjustments will be made in chemotherapy. If patient develops Grade 3 or 4 mucositis that is NOT attributable to infectious etiology AND recovery to < Grade 2 occurs between Day 30-43 for any cycle of 
Induction, reduce the dose of doxorubicin or etoposide in the next 2 cycles of chemotherapy by 25%.   If 
subsequent chemotherapy tolerated w ithout recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity then resume full doses 
of chemotherapy agents in all subsequent cycles of induction.   
 
If patient develops Grade 3 or 4 mucositis that is NOT attributable to infectious etiology AND recovery to 
< Grade 2 occurs after Day 43 of any cycle, reduce dose of doxorubicin or etoposide in the next 2 cycles of chemotherapy by 50%. If subse quent chemotherapy tolerated without  recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 GI 
toxicity then escalate dose by 25% in subsequent cycles of induction.   
 If patient develops mucositis that requires intubation for airway management or if patient develops grade 4 typhlitis or other grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity hold subsequent chemotherapy until toxicity resolved 
to < Grade 2.  If the toxicity resolves to < Gr ade 2 by Day 43, proceed with next 2 cycles of 
chemotherapy but reduce dose of doxorubicin or etoposide by 25%.  If recovery to < Grade 2 occurs after 
Day 43 of any cycle, reduce dose of doxorubicin or etoposide in the next 2 cycles of chemotherapy by 
50%.  If subsequent chemotherapy to lerated without recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity then escalate 
dose by 25% in subsequent cycles of induction.

Page 59  
5.6.2 Diarrhea  
If patient develops severe diarrhea (Grade 3 or 4) attributable to chemotherapy and not underlying 
infection (i.e. C. difficile), that resolves by Day 22-29 of cycle, no dose adjustments will be made in 
chemotherapy. If recovery to < Grade 2 occurs betw een Day 30-43 for any cycle of Induction, reduce the 
dose of doxorubicin or etoposide in next cycle of chemotherapy by 25%.   If subsequent chemotherapy 
tolerated without recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 GI toxici ty then resume full doses of  chemotherapy agents in 
all subsequent cycles of induction.  If recovery to < Grade 2 occurs after Day 43 of any cycle, reduce dose 
of doxorubicin or etoposide in the next cycle of chemotherapy by 50%.  If subsequent chemotherapy 
tolerated without recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 GI to xicity then escalate dose by 25% in subsequent cycles 
of induction. 
 
5.7 Ototoxicity During Induction  
For an inner ear/hearing toxicity   Grade 3, decrease cisplatin dose by 50% for subsequent cycles.  If loss 
extends below 2000 Hz, delete further cisplatin/etoposide cycles.  If cispla tin is deleted, then complete 
total of 2 cycles of CDV, then proceed to consolid ation therapy. Make notati on of cisplatin deletion on 
data form.  5.8 Neurologic Toxicity During Induction  
If severe peripheral neuropathy (vocal cord paralysis, inability to walk or perfo rm usual motor functions) 
or ileus develops from vincristine, vincristine ther apy should be stopped or withheld until the ileus 
resolves or the peripheral neuropathy improves.  Rest art vincristine at 50% dose and escalate by 25% if 
tolerated with next course.  If ne uropathy recurs on escalating dose, re turn to previously tolerated dose 
once neuropathy improved. 
 
 5.9 Allergic Reactions  
5.9.1 Etoposide
  
Etoposide allergic reactions may be  managed with pre-medications such as diphenhydramine 1mg/kg IV 
(maximum single dose 50 mg), ranitidine 1mg/kg IV (maximum single dose 50 mg) and Hydrocortisone 1-4 mg/kg IV and by slowing the rate of the infusion. For those reactions which are unable to be controlled with pre-medication and the slowing of the rate of etoposide infusion, etoposide phosphate 
may be substituted in the same dose and at the sa me rate. Pre-medication for etoposide phosphate is 
recommended.   
 
 5.9.2 Cisplatin and Carboplatin
 
Platinum allergic reactions may be managed with  pre-medications such as diphenhydramine 1mg/kg IV 
(maximum dose 50mg), ranitidine 1mg/kg IV (maximum single dose 50 mg) and Hydrocortisone 1-4 mg/kg IV. 
 
5.10 Other toxicities During Induction  
For any Grade 3 or 4 toxicity not mentioned abov e, the treatment should be withheld until patients 
recover to Grade 2 or less toxicity.  For any non-hema tologic Grade 3 or 4 organ toxicity attributed to 
chemotherapy AND not related to underlying infection or  metabolic derangement that is not discussed in 
Sections 5.1 – 5.8, and resolves to < Grade 2 by Day 43, reduce the subsequent dose of that chemotherapy 
agent by 25%. For any non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity attributed to chemotherapy AND not 
related to underlying infection or metabolic derangement that is not discussed in Sections 5.1 – 5.8  
resolves to < Grade 2 greater than Day 43, reduce th e subsequent dose of that chemotherapy by 50%. 
 
 
5.11 Dose Modifications for 13- cis-Retinoic Acid (cis-RA) Therapy  
 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 60 5.11.1 
A dose reduction of 25% (to 120 mg/m²/day or 4 mg/kg/day if child weighs <  12 kg) for subsequent 
cycles should be made for the occurrence of any Grade 3 or 4 toxicities EXCLUDING: Grade 3 or 4 
hematologic, Grade 3 hepatic, Grade 3 nausea, Grade 3 vomiting, or Grade 3 fever.  If the same Grade 3 
or 4 toxicity recurs at a 25% dose reduction, then  decrease dose another 20% (t o 100 mg/m²/day or 3.33 
mg/kg/day if child weighs  12 kg).  If the same Grade 3 or 4 toxicity recurs after two dose reductions, 
and toxicity cannot be attributed to an alternative etiology, then withhold further therapy.  
 
5.11.2 It has been reported (rarely) that some patients treat ed with cis-RA develop new areas of abnormal uptake 
on bone scan, likely due to increased bone resorption.  If such changes occur during retinoic acid phase in 
absence of other evidence of tumor recurrence do not report as progressive disease.     
5.11.3 
If criteria (Section 4.8.1) to begin next cycle are not me t by the date cycle is due to begin, delay cycle for 
one week.  If criteria still not met, hold therapy until cr iteria are met, and treat at 25% dose reduction (120 
mg/m²/day or 4 mg/kg/day if child weighs  12 kg). An additional dose reduction to 100 mg/m²/day (3.33 
mg/kg/day if child weighs  12 kg) should occur if criteria are not met within one week after due date for 
subsequent cycles.  5.11.4 
If serum creatinine increases by > 50% in any cycle of therapy, creatinine clearance or GFR should be 
done prior to starting next cycle, and a urinal ysis. If creatinine clearance and/or GFR are < 50 
mL/min/1.73 m² reduce cis-RA by 50%.  If serum cr eatinine continues to incr ease or GFR decreased to < 
40 mL/min/1.73 m² then withhold further therapy.  5.11.5 
If patient > Grade 1 develops hematuria, proteinuria , and/or hypertension during any cycle of therapy, 
hold medication until resolves to <
 Grade 1 then reduce cis-RA dose by 25%. 
 
5.11.6 For localized cheilitis, apply topical vitamin E to lips  for subsequent cycles.  If this does not control 
symptoms sufficiently to allow sufficient oral intake, then decrease dose by 25% (120 mg/m²/day or 4 
mg/kg/day if child weighs  12 kg). 
 
5.11.7 
If serum triglycerides are > 300 mg/dL when next cycle is  due, delay starting therapy for two weeks.  If 
still > 300 mg/dL, then start patient on medical th erapy for serum triglyceride reduction (consider 
cardiology consultation) and begin cycle at previous cis-RA dosage.  If serum triglycerides are < 300 
mg/dL by time subsequent cycle is due, then continue  at same dosage cis-RA.  If triglycerides are still > 
300 mg/dL after one cycle on medical therapy, then reduce cis-RA acid dosage by 25% for subsequent 
cycles.

8.0 OFF PROTOCOL THERAPY CRITERIA AND OFF STUDY CRITERIA 
 
8.1 Off Protocol Therapy Criteria 
 8.1.1 During Induction Therapy
 
a) Patient with progressive disease at end of Induction therapy will be off protocol therapy.  
Patients with mixed response, stable disease or persistent tumor in bone marrow by 
morphologic evaluation may remain on protocol therapy as per investigator preference. These patients are encouraged to come off protocol therapy for entry onto available COG Phase I and Phase II studies.  
b) Patient develops any Grade 4 organ toxicity not  related to underlying infection or metabolic 
derangement that fails to resolve to < Grade 2 by 8 weeks from last cycle of chemotherapy 
EXCEPT:  
Patients with Grade 4 toxicities of fever, infection, ileus, nausea, transaminases, renal electrolyte wasting, vomiting, diarrhea, and st omatitis (not requiring intubation) who may 
continue on therapy if these toxicities resolve or are controlled with medication by Day 56 
of cycle.
  
c) Unable to obtain adequate stem cell product for transplant. 
d) Patient with GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 at the end of induction. It is to be noted that GFR must

8.1.2 During Stem Cell Transplant
 
a)  Patients who develop progressive disease (PD) at any time after stem cell transplant are off 
protocol therapy and may receive alternate therapy.If the patient has PR or SD after stem cell 
transplant i.e., questionable residual tumor, a biopsy should be done to obtain histological 
diagnosis, if possible, to determine if there is residual disease. If active malignant tumor 
remains, notify the Study Chair prior to a dditional therapy. Surgical removal is not 
encouraged unless it would alter therapy. Additional local irradiation should also be considered.   
 8.1.3 Treatment Completed Per Protocol

a. Patient/Parent refuses further treatment (includi ng patient/parent who refuses randomization) 
b. Patient/parent withdraws consent for any further data submission. 
c. Physician determines it is in patient’s best interest. 
d. Development of a 2nd malignancy 
 
 8.2 Off Study Criteria  
a) Death 
b) Lost to follow-up 
c) Entry onto another COG study with tumor therapeutic intent (e.g., alternative maintenance 
therapy protocol or at recurrence) 
d) Withdrawal of consent for further data submission 
e) Tenth anniversary of study entry

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Overview  
This study will address the issue of whether an add itional myeloablative consolidation results in better 
EFS than a single myeloablative consolidation, sufficien t to justify the additional toxicity and duration of 
therapy.    9.1 Statistical Design  
Randomization 
This is a prospective study with a delayed two-arm randomization. With delayed randomization, early 
induction failures will be excluded from the EFS comparis on and will prevent dilution of treatment effect.  
Randomization will be stratified by stage and MYCN status (the two factors most highly prognostic of 
outcome in neuroblastoma), and also by the end of induction response (CR/VGPR vs PR vs MR/NR).   
 
Timing: Randomization will occur after the completion of 6 cycles of induction therapy (including 
surgery) prior to transplant. 
 Eligibility to proceed to Consolidation Therapy/Transplant:  Only patients who have a minimum PBSC harvest of 4 x 10
6 CD 34+ cells/kg (minimum of 2 x 106 CD 34+ cells/kg/transplant), who have adequate 
organ function, who do not have progressive disease at end of induction AND who have consented to 
Consent Part 2 are eligible for transplantation.  Eligibility for randomization:  Patients must first be eligib le to proceed to transplant in order to be eligible for 
randomization.  Patients will be randomly assigned to ei ther single myeloablative therapy (Regimen A) with 
a carboplatin, etoposide, melphalan (CEM) preparative regimen and auto logous PBSC rescue (representing 
the standard arm of the study), 
OR to the experimental arm of tandem myeloablative therapy (Regimen B) 
with the regimen used in the COG ANBL00P1 (t hiotepa and cyclophosphamide followed by CEM).   
 
Nonrandom Assignment to Single Transplant  The following patients will be nonrandomly assigned  to single myeloablative transplant (Regimen A): 
 Patients who are 365 to 547 days of age (12 – 18 months) with Stage 4, MYCN  nonamplified 
tumor with any of the following potent ially unfavorable biologic features: 
o unfavorable histopathology 
o diploid DNA content 
o indeterminant histopathology

 9.2 Patient Accrual and Expected Duration of Trial  
 9.2.1 Accrual
 
Based on A3973 and CCG-3891, annual accrual was expected  to be about 140 patients/yr. Of these, 30% 
(42/yr) are expected to go off protocol therapy or off study prior to randomization due to physician discretion, tumor progression, death, or inability to achieve the 4 x 10
6 CD 34+ cells/kg needed to proceed 
to randomization/transplantation. Of the remaining 98 patients/year, 13 are estimated to be stratum 01 
patients who are non-randomly assigned to receive a singl e transplant (AT).  Furthermore, the delayed 
timing of randomization and the criteria to discontinue protocol therapy for those with progressive disease should result in a very low rate for refusal of randomi zation (about 5%).  Therefore, the original estimate 
was for 81 patients/year (69/year of which are Stage 4) to be randomized.  However, as of the second quarter of 2011, the annual accrual rate has reached 230 patients/year and the randomization rate is 50%, 
so the new estimate of the randomized  patient rate is 115 patients/year. 
 
 
In the original plans, a total of 329 randomized patients were needed for sufficient power for an analysis of the primary EFS treatment comparison.  At an accrual rate of 81 patients per year, 329 would be 
accrued in about 4.1 years, plus 3 of follow-up, fo r a total study duration of about 7 years. Including 
stratum 01 patients and patients who go off protocol ther apy or off study prior to randomization, the total 
study accrual was originally planned as 574 patients (140/ year for 4.1 years).  Based on the observation of 
higher EFS rates than anticipated in A3973 and AN BL0032, the power calculations below have been 
revised, and a new total enrollment of up to 664 patients will be required.  
 To increase the homogeneity of the patient cohort, patients will be strongly encouraged to enroll on 
ANBL0032 or ANBL0931 after ANBL0532.  The DSMC will be kept apprised of the proportion of 
patients who enroll on ANBL0032 or ANBL0931, overall and by ANBL0032 treatment arm.  (Prior to 
closure of randomization, ANBL0032 randomizati on was stratified by ANBL0532 treatment arm.) 
 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 70 9.2.2 Power Calculations  
In the original plan: Power for EFS treatment comparison:  n=329 randomized patients can detect a 12% 
difference in the 3-year EFS rate starting from the time of randomization (from 46% for AT versus 58% 
for AT1+AT2, which is a hazard ratio of 0.7) with 80% power in a one-sided logrank test at a 0.05 
significance level.  The 46% 3-year EFS was chosen for the control group in this study based on the 
national trend for improvement in local control rat es, use of more dose intensive therapy, and better 
supportive care occurring since the design of 3891 w ith 38% 2-year EFS.  A 3 year follow-up provides 
time for sufficient events for 80% power and a llows for some normalization of the EFS time post-
transplant for 1 versus 2 transplants. The more patient-years of follow-up there are, the smaller the 
proportion of time represented by the additional EFS time post-transplant of the tandem transplant patients.  
For the new plan (Aug 2011): 
The new control arm 3-year EFS will be 60%, starting from the time of randomization.  In order to 
detect a 12% difference in the 3-year EFS rate starting from the time of randomization (from 60% 
for AT1 versus 72% for AT1+AT2) with 80% po wer in a one-sided logrank test at a 0.05 
significance level, and taking into account a 6% crossover rate from AT1+AT2 to AT1, a total of 
332 randomized patients will be required.  (This resu lts in a change from the originally planned 
hazard ratio (HR) [AT1+AT2: AT1] of 0.7 to a new HR of 0.64.)  In order to accrue 332 
randomized patients, we will need to enroll 664 patients (which assumes that the randomization 
rate might drop to as low as 50%).  
The choice was made to limit accrual duration to 4 years, and so the sample size of stage 4 patients 
provides too little power for the study to be designe d/powered on the basis of this subgroup.  A 12% 3-
year EFS difference can be detected with 72% power based on the 276 stage 4 patients expected to be 
randomized.One-hundred and seventy-seven events are expected to be observed within the cohort of 
randomized patients after completion of 3 years follow-up after the last patient is accrued. 
  9.3 Statistical Analysis Methods  
 9.3.1 Endpoints
 
 9.3.1.1 Primary Endpoint The primary end point to determine benefit of a 2
nd myeloablative consolidation procedure is the event-
free survival (EFS) rate.  A potential inherent bias exis ts due to the longer duration of therapy for patients 
who get two myeloablative consolidations.  Ideally the duration of treatment for two randomized groups would be the same, such that all patients complete their treatment at about the same time from randomization.  However, in this study the patient s randomized to two transplants will take longer to 
finish their treatment than those randomized to one transplant.  There will be an inherent bias in the 
calculation of the EFS time. However, the longer duration is considered a clinical drawback, and so there 
will be no statistical adjustment in the EFS time for the extra treatment.  The EFS analysis will be intent-
to-treat starting from the time of randomization, i.e., just prior to the first transplant.   9.3.1.2 Endpoints for Additional Primary Objectives The endpoint to determine benefit of topotecan addition is response at the end of induction therapy.  The 
proportion of Responders (end of i nduction CR/VGPR) will be compared to an analogous cohort of 
Responders on A3973. 
 
 
 
 
 
The endpoint for determination of local control will be the incidence rate of local recurrence (local 
recurrence events: progression or relapse at site of pr imary, to be determined by central review).

Page 71  
9.3.2 Non-compliance with randomization (i.e., CROSSOVERS) : 
A crossover is defined as a patient who does not r eceive the second myeloablative regimen, except for 
reasons of disease progression. 
 
The majority of crossovers are anticipated to be  patients randomized to receive two myeloablative 
consolidations, but only receive one.  Very few crossovers, if any, will be pa tients who were randomized 
to receive one myeloablative consolidation but were treated with two.  If patients cross over to the other treatment arm, the detectable difference between trea tment groups will increase.  If the detection of a 12% 
difference is to be maintained, a greater number of events (i.e., larger sample size) would be needed in order to overcome the diluting effect (Table A).  Updated power calculations  have been performed 
assuming a 6% crossover rate from AT1+AT2 to AT1; this update obviates the need for Tables A and B 
below.

 For the first 79 patients randomized to the two-tran splant arm, the proportion of crossovers will be 
monitored using the two-stage rule below.  Thereaf ter, it will be monitored using an upper bound of 35% 
crossovers from AT1+AT2 to AT.  If the proportion of crossovers from AT1+AT2 to AT reaches 35%, 
then the detectable difference in an intent-to-treat analysis will have increased beyond a clinically 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 72 reasonable value of 16.3% (i.e., beyond the expectation of  increased benefit of two transplants).  At that 
time, consideration should be given to modifying fo r increased accrual, modifying the study design, or 
abandoning the study due to infeasibility .  Due to the dilution effect of the crossovers, an intent-to-treat 
comparison of treatment groups after 35% of patient s have crossed from AT1+AT2 to AT would permit 
detection of a 16.3% difference (47%  vs. 63%) in the 3-year EFS rate.  Stated another way, if 35% of 
AT1+AT2 patients cross to AT, an underlying true difference of 16.3% would need to exist in order for 
the study to be able to detect a difference of 12% in an  intent-to-treat analysis with n=329.  Per Table B, if 
the underlying true difference is only 12%, and th ere are 35% crossovers, then 688 patients would be 
required to detect the 12% difference. 
 
9.3.3 Power for detection of difference in proportion of induction responders  
All n= 664 patients on this study will be compared to n=486 patients on A3973, for a total of 1,150 
patients in the test of proportions.  The power and detectable different were already very good per Table C, but with the increase in sample size from what was originally planned, the available power will be 
higher and/or the detectable difference will be smaller than what was originally planned (Table C).  The 
A3973 cohort will be nearly identical to the cohort on this study with the exception of the change in the 
induction therapy under study and the later timeframe of this study.  Comparison will be made to assess 
ability to achieve CR + VGPR.

 9.3.4 Power for detection of a differ ence in the risk of local recurrence
  
There are two differences between ANBL0532 and A3973 in the cohort of patients who have pre-
transplant <CR of the primary: 1) the number of tr ansplants; and 2) the use of purging.  For an unbiased 
comparison of analogous patients who achieve pre-tr ansplant <CR of the primary, the Treatment 01 
patients on ANBL0532 (36 Gy EBRT) will be compar ed to the unpurged patients (n=245) on A3973 
(21.6 Gy EBRT) in terms of their risk for local recurrence. The following projections are based on response rates from prior protocols. We assume 45% (n=110) of unpurged pa tients on A3973, and 45% 
(n=149) of patients randomized to receive one tran splant on this study will achieve less than CR at 
primary site at end of induction therapy.  If  75% of the A3973 patients and 90 % of the ANBL0532 
patients make it from randomization to consolidation and XRT, then the total number of patients utilized 
for the local recurrence risk comparison is n= 217 (83 from A3973 and 134 from ANBL0532).  This will 
provide more than 80% power to detect a clinica lly significant decrease of 13% (from 19% to 6%) in the 
risk for local recurrence after 36 Gy , and more than 87% power to detect an 14% decrease (from 19% to 
5%) in a one-sided Fisher’s Exact test at a significance level of 0.05.  
 
9.3.5 Monitoring
  
 
a) Monitoring for the proportion of “crossovers” from  the two-transplant arm to the one-transplant 
arm:  
Of the eligible patients randomized to two transpla nts, patients who are unable to receive the second 
transplant except for reasons of disease progression ( “crossovers”) will be identified.  The complement 
cohort who are compliant with their randomized assignm ent shall be called the “compliers”.  A two-stage 
rule will be used to monitor the proportion of “c ompliers” within the cohort of eligible patients 
randomized to receive two transplants.   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 73  Stage 1:  Accrue 33 patients randomized to the two-transplant arm.  If 20 or fewer patients 
are “compliers”, then consider modifying the study design to maintain power.  If more than 
20 patients are “compliers”, then proceed to Stage 2. 
 Stage 2:  Accrue an additional 46  patients to the two-transplant arm for a total of 79.  If 53 
or fewer patients are “compliers”, then consid er modifying the study design to maintain 
power.   
 
 
 
 
This two-stage design has the follo wing characteristics:  The proportion of “compliers” is 0.61 under the 
null, and 0.75 under the alternative. This exact test  will have >90% power and a significance level of 
<0.10.  b) Interim monitoring for futility or superiority of the experimental arm  (AT1-TC & AT2-CEM) 
will start after 20% of the total expected information (177 events) has been observed, and will be 
performed on an annual basis.  If issues of concern ari se that require more frequent looks, then monitoring 
can be performed every six months.  
 There will be cause to stop the trial early if the AT1 + AT2 arm appears to be in sufficiently efficacious or 
significantly more efficacious.  The need for curtailment for non-significance of the AT1 + AT2 arm will 
be assessed using 
Fleming-Harrington-O’Brien  boundaries for the hazard ratio (AT: AT1+AT2) at 
each interim analysis (Table D).  The interim analyses of EFS will take place every year starting after 
20% (40) of the planned events have occurred.  Th e lower bound is calculated based on repeated testing 
of the alternative hypothesis that the re lative risk is equal to 1.42 at a p- value of 0.005.  This relative risk 
is calculated as control: experimental using the pla nning parameters for 3-year EFS.  The upper bound 
uses an alpha*t2 spending function for a cumulative alpha level of 0.05.

c) Descriptive monitoring :  In addition, the following descrip tive monitoring will be performed.  If 
descriptive results present a concern,  then a formal statistical monitoring rule will be developed: 
i) the proportion of local recurrences with in the cohort of patients who have pre-
transplant <CR (about 25% expected); 
ii) the induction toxic death rate (about 3% expected); 
iii) end of induction response ra te (about 50% for CR+VGPR);  
iv) rate of PBSC contamination as determ ined by ICC (about 3% expected) (this 
monitoring was discontinued starting with Amendment #2);  
v) the toxic death rate post-consolidation attributed to TC or TC + CEM (about 5% 
expected); and, 
vi) by ANBL0532 treatment arm, the propor tion of patients who choose to enroll on 
ANBL0032 or ANBL0931 (difference less than 5%). 
 
9.3.6 Assessment of Study Objectives  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 74 Primary Objective 1.1.1: Intent-to-treat log-rank test comparison of EFS curves, starting from the time 
of randomization, by treatment group (AT-CEM vs. AT1-TC & AT2-CEM). Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated starting from a) the time of randomization (this is the defin itive analysis); b) the time of 
transplant; c) the time of completion of the last transplant (for descriptive purposes); and d) the time of diagnosis (for descriptive purposes). 
 
 Primary Objective 1.1.2: Chi-square test of proportions in all patients to compare the proportion of Responders (CR+VGPRs) at the end of induction in this study to the analogous proportion in A3973.  
There is no reason to believe that the characteristics of the induction cohort on this study will differ from 
that of the induction cohort on A3973, so th is will be a fair and appropriate comparison. 
 Primary Objective 1.1.3: Log-rank test to compare the risk for local recurrence within the subset of 
patients who obtain a pre-transplant primary site < CR, i.e., comparing ANBL0532 patients randomized to get one transplant versus the historical A3973 patients who were randomized to unpurged transplant.  
Secondary Objective 1.2.1: The endpoints for this correlative ai m are a) the duration of grade >=3 
neutropenia during cycle one; b) the duration of grade >=3 thrombocytopenia during cycle one; and, c) 
the response rate after two cycles of induction therapy.  Of the total 664 patients, we will assume that 78% (n= 518) will have biologic samples submitted for this correlative study.  For a) and b), a logistic regression model will be used to test the abilit y of the number of days of neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia to predict the presence of a polymorphism.  For c), a chi-square test of association will be used to compare the proportion of res ponders with versus without a polymorphism. 
 For a particular genetic polymorphism, if the pr evalence of homozygocity is 30%, the resulting sample 
sizes of 155 homozygous patients a nd 363 non-homozygous patients will resu lt in more than 80% power 
to detect a difference in response rates of 45% ve rsus 30%, respectively, assuming a 2-sided 0.05 alpha 
level.  If the prevalence of homozygocity for a pa rticular genetic polymorphism is 50%, the resulting 
sample sizes of 259 homozygous pa tients and 259 non-homozygous patient s will result in more than 80% 
power to detect a difference in response rates of 44% versus 30%, respectively, assuming a 2-sided 0.05 alpha level.  If the prevalence of homozygocity fo r a particular genetic polymorphism is 10%, the 
resulting sample sizes of 52 homozygous patients a nd 466 non-homozygous patie nts will result in more 
than 80% power to detect a difference in response rates of 53% versus 30%, respectively, assuming a 2-
sided 0.05 alpha level.  Secondary Objective 1.2.2 :  A chi-square test of proportions will be used to test for association between 
the proportion of patients who achieve a surgical CR and the proportion of patients who do not relapse in 
the primary.  A logrank test will compare the EFS cu rves for degree of surgical response (CR vs. <CR). 
 Secondary Objective 1.2.3 : The proportion of patients by type of surgical complication and type of 
radiation therapy complication will be descriptively tabulated.  The complications, described in more 
detail in section 13.5.2, are: bowel obstruction, chyl ous leak, renal injury/atrophy/loss and diarrhea. 
 
Secondary Objective 1.2.4 :  For the patients with primary tumors with intraspinal extension: descriptive 
tabulation of the proportion of patients with resolutio n of neurologic symptoms by type of symptom. 
 
Secondary Objective 1.2.5 :  The cohort of patients for this analysis of the cis-RA PK data are patients 
enrolled on either A3973, ANBL0032, ANBL0931, ANBL05 32, and future high risk studies who receive cis-
RA.  The analyses will be conducted in the overall cohort as well as within the subset of patients who receive 
only one transplant and cis-RA without the addition of antibody.  Patients  will be pooled across these studies 
until at least 195 patients are available for analysis.  We would not st op consenting patients to this aim or 
collecting blood specimens in the middle of a study si mply because the minimum accrual goal of n=195 had 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 75 been reached; accrual of patients towards this aim would continue until that study’s overall accrual was 
completed.  A larger cohort would permit this aim to be addressed with greater accuracy.     
1.2.5 a)  For each patient, the peak serum concentration level will be determined.   Pilot data 
97,98 indicate the 
mean peak serum concentration level will be approximately 7 µM.  Given a mean peak serum concentration 
level of 7 µM, a sample size of n=195 will permit pla cement of a 90% confidence interval on the mean peak 
serum concentration level with a precision of +/- 0. 24 µM.  This confidence interval will provide a 
descriptive assessment of the inter-patient variability of the cis-RA plasma levels. 
 
 
To determine the relationship of peak serum concen tration level with the existence of polymorphisms, 
Kendall’s Tau statistic will be calculated.  The allelic frequency of the known polymorphisms in 
UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 are such that the expected numbe rs of homozygotes for the variant forms are 25% 
in caucasians.  Therefore, collection of 80 patient samples would allow us to detect a 2-fold difference in the peak serum concentration level of 13-cis retinoic acid with an expected power of greater than 90 % and a 50% difference with a power of 50%.  The a llelic frequency of the CYP2C8 variant, CYP2C8*3 in 
Caucasians is 0.13, giving a frequency of only 2% fo r homozygotes.  However, the influence of this 
variant in those heterozygous for CYP2C8*3 has not been determined and evidence for variation between 
heterozygotes and those possessing the homozygous w ild-type genotype exists for other genes.  
Combining heterozygotes and homozygous variants for this gene (CYP2C8) gives similar statistical 
power to that applied to the UGT polymorphisms. 
 
1.2.5 b)   To determine if there is a relationship of the peak serum concentration level with event-free survival, 
the term for this level will be tested in a Cox propor tional hazards model.  If the level is statistically 
significant, then a) the hazard ratio will provide a measur e of increased risk for an event for a unit change in 
the level; and, b) a cut-off in serum concentration level (low vs. high) will be identified that optimizes the difference in EFS between the low and high serum concentration groups. 
 
To determine if there is a relationship of the peak serum concentration level with toxicity rates (CTC 
grade 3 or 4 skin, hypercalcemia, or hepatic toxic ity), Kendall’s Tau statistic will be calculated.   
 1.2.5 c) To determine if pharmacoge nomic variations are predictive of EFS, a logrank test comparison of 
patients with vs without a give n polymorphism will be made. 
 A Fisher’s exact test will test for association of the presence of a polymorphism with the occurrence of systemic toxicity (CTC grade 3 or 4 skin, hypercalcemia, or hepatic toxicity).  These tests will be performed for UGT1A1, UGT2B7, CYP2C8 and CYP3A7 alleles. 
 Secondary Objective 1.2.6 : The hypothesis for this aim is that  topotecan systemic clearance can be 
calculated with acceptable accuracy and precision using patient specific covariates in a dosing model. The topotecan total clearance value will be calculated from a single sample using Bayesian modeling 
techniques and population priors established from a si milar patient population studied by Dr. Stewart’s 
laboratory.  The two clearance values from course 1 and 2 will be used in the analysis separately and as 
an average value.  In addition to this topotecan clearance, a “calculated” topotecan  clearance value will be 
determined from a topotecan dosing model, which consis ts of patient specific covariates determined from 
a) previous population pharmacokinetic analyses, b) planned population phar macokinetic analyses of 
already collected data, and c) population pharmacokinetic analyses of data that will be collected during 
this clinical trial. The relation between the to potecan clearance value determined by pharmacokinetic 
analysis (limited sampling; Bayesian modeling) a nd the topotecan clearance va lue determined by the 
topotecan dosing model (patient covariates) will be i nvestigated using regression analysis and simulation 
studies.  The long-term goal is to identify relevant pa tient covariates that will enable the development of a 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 76 clinically useful dosing nomogram for topotecan in children with cancer.  This approach will minimize 
the interpatient variability in topotecan systemic  exposure by individualizing the topotecan dosage.   
 
Secondary Objective 1.2.7 . We hypothesize that: i) T cells recognizing antigens expressed on 
neuroblastoma  cells circulate at diagnosis, and ii) anti- neuroblastoma  T cells can demonstrate effector 
function against neuroblastoma  cells, We will assess functional immunity against neuroblastoma  in 
patient samples, including T cells collected at diagno sis and in patients after myeloablative therapy. We 
will look for functional T cell responses using both a specific tumor antigen (survivin) as well as 
allogeneic tumor RNA as a source of antigenic stimulus. 
 
Assays used will include: 
1.  Survivin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes dete cted using peptide/MHC tetramers in HLA-A2+ 
patients.  This assay provides measures of the presence of T-cells that are capable of recognizing 
neuroblastoma .  For objective 1.2.7.a, the median number of  survivin-specific T-cells will be calculated 
at diagnosis and post-transplant. The proportion of  patients who are positive for survivin-specific 
immunity will be calculated at diagnosis and post-transplant.  For objective 1.2.7.d, of the patients who were positive for survivin-specific immunity at diagnosis, the proportion of patients who remain positive 
post-transplant will be calculated.  2. IFN-gamma production in ELISPOT assays to antigen presenting cells (APCs) loaded with 
tumor RNA, survivin RNA, or control RNA.  This assay provides a measure of the number of T-cells 
that are capable of recognizing 
neuroblastoma .  A sample of peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) will be exposed to  
 
APCs loaded with mRNA for survivin, mRNA from neuroblastoma cells and irrelevant  mRNA.  This 
assay does not require that the patient be HLA-A2+.  For objective 1.2.7.b, the median number of T-cells 
and the median number of IFN-gamma-producing T-cells  will be calculated using T-cells collected at 
diagnosis and after completion of myeloablative therapy for each stimulating APC type.  For each 
stimulating APC type, the median number of T-cells af ter transplant will be desc riptively compared to a) 
the median number of T-cells at diagnosis; and, b) the median number of IFN-gamma-producing T-cells at diagnosis.  3. Response of APC-stimulated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) response to neuroblastoma cells .  
The ability to lyse neuroblastoma cells will be evaluated for T cells stimulated by exposure to APCs 
loaded with mRNA for survivin, mRNA from 
neuroblastoma cells and irrelevant  mRNA.  The ability 
of stimulated T-cells to lyse neuroblastoma cells will  be calculated at diagnosis and after myeloablative 
therapy. This assay provides a measure of the ability of stimulated T-cells to kill neuroblastoma  cells.  
For objective 1.2.7.c, the proportion of patients whose stimulated T-cells lyse neuroblastoma cells will be 
descriptively compared between diagnosis and after completion of myeloablative therapy. 
 
It is not necessary to perform treatment arm comparisons to assess this objective.  
Secondary Objective 1.2.8 . We hypothesize that patients who received the tandem myeloablative 
chemotherapy regimen will experience slower T cell recovery, specifically of CD4+ T cells when 
compared to patients who received a single myeloa blative chemotherapy regimen. Enumeration of 
peripheral blood CD3, CD4 and CD8 ce lls will be performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after completion of 
assigned myeloablative therapy.  For each timepoint (1 , 3, 6 months post-myeloablative therapy), we will 
perform a descriptive comparison of the median numbe r of T-cells (CD3, CD4, CD8) between treatment 
arms (single vs. tandem myeloablative regimens).  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 77 Secondary Objective 1.2.9 - The proportion of patients with neur oblastoma detected in bone marrow and 
peripheral blood using RT-PCR technique will be calcu lated overall and by treatment arm.  Data from 
CCG-3891 indicate that by immunocytology ~15% of patients prior to myeloablative therapy show 
minimal residual disease in bone marrow,119 and ~ 5% of patients in peripheral blood at the time of bone 
marrow harvest. Presumably residual disease found after tr ansplant will be less than  this figure, although 
the sensitivity of RT-PCR may increase the proporti on of neuroblastoma positive specimens. If 15% of 
the n=478 randomized patients are positive for neuroblastoma by bone marrow RT-PCR or 
immunocytochemistry and if the EFS from time of tran splant of the positive group is two thirds that of 
the negative group, this study will have good power (>80%) to detect this difference. The same 
considerations apply to peripheral blood; unless the E FS difference is quite larg e between the groups this 
study will have limited power to detect differences by peripheral blood positivity. The statistical tool used 
will be the log rank test, stratified by any other variables of interest. Cox regression techniques will be 
used for multivariate analysis, in particular for dete rmination of whether these variables add independent 
prognostic information. 
 Secondary Objective 1.2.10  
A descriptive analysis of outcome will be performed of patients 12 – 18 months with Stage 4, MYCN  
nonamplified tumor with unfavorable histopathology or diploid DNA content or with indeterminant histology or ploidy and patients who are greater than 547 days of age with Stage 3, MYCN nonamplified 
tumor AND unfavorable histopathology or indeterminant histology.  Kaplan-Meier curves of EFS and OS will be plotted, and the proportion of responde rs to induction therapy will be tabulated.

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
This study will utilize the CTCAE of the National Ca ncer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and performance 
reporting. The descriptions and grading scales found in  the revised CTCAE version 4.0 will be 
utilized for reporting beginning July 1st, 2011.  All appropriate treatm ent areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0, which can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov
).   
 10.2 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors  
This study will use the International Neuroblast oma Staging System (INSS) Response Evaluation 
Criteria. This will allow direct comparison with le gacy COG studies as well as Phase 3 trials performed 
abroad.  10.3 International Staging System
123 
Stage 1: Localized tumor with complete gross excision, with or without microscopic residual disease; representative ipsilateral lymph nodes negative microsc opically (nodes attached to and removed with the 
primary tumor may be positive).  Stage 2A: Localized tumor with incomplete gross ex cision; representative ipsilateral nonadherent lymph 
nodes negative for tumor microscopically.  Stage 2B: Localized tumor with or without complete  gross excision; with ipsilateral nonadherent lymph 
nodes positive for tumor.  Enlarged contralateral lymph nodes must be negative microscopically. 
 Stage 3: Unresectable unilateral tumor infiltrating acr oss the midline with or without regional lymph node 
involvement; or, localized unilateral tumor with c ontralateral regional lym ph node involvement; or, 
midline tumor with bilateral extension by infiltra tion (unresectable) or by lymph node involvement. The 
midline is defined as the vertebral column.  Tumors or iginating on one side and crossing the midline must 
infiltrate to or beyond the opposite side of the vertebral column.  
Stage 4: Any primary tumor with dissemination to di stant lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin 
and/or other organs (except as defined for Stage 4S). 
 Stage 4S: Localized primary tumor (as defined for Stag e 1 or 2A or 2B), with dissemination limited to 
liver, skin, and/or bone marrow (limited to infants < 1 year of age).  Marrow involvement should be < 
10% of total nucleated cells identified as malignant on bone marrow biopsy or on marrow aspirate.  
MIBG scan (if performed) should be negative in the marrow. 
 10.4 International Response Criteria
123  
Measurable tumor is defined as the product of the longest x widest perpendicular diameter.  The third dimension is added when possible.  Elevated catechol amine metabolite levels and tumor cell invasion of 
bone marrow also is considered measurable tumor. See Appendix VI.  10.4.1 Complete Response (CR)**
 
No evidence of primary tumor, no evidence of me tastases (chest, abdomen, liver, bone, bone marrow, 
nodes, etc.), and HVA/VMA normal. 
 
10.4.2 Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  
Greater than 90% reduction of primary tumor; no me tastatic tumor (as above except bone); no new bone 
lesions, all pre-existing lesions improved on bone scan; HVA/VMA normal. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 79  
 
10.4.3 Partial Response (PR)  
Fifty-90% reduction of primary tumor; 50% or great er reduction in measurable sites of metastases; 0-1 
bone marrow samples with tumor; number of positive bone sites decreased by > 50%. 
 
10.4.4 Mixed Response (MR)  
Greater than 50% reduction of any measurable lesion (primary or metastases) with, < 50% reduction in 
any other site; no new lesions; <25% increase in an y existing lesion (exclude bone marrow evaluation). 
 10.4.5 No Response (NR)
 
No new lesions; <50% reduction but <25% increas e in any existing lesion (exclude bone marrow 
evaluation).  10.4.6 Progressive disease (PD)**
 
Any new lesion or increase of a measurable lesi on by >25%; previous negative marrow positive for 
tumor.  
** MIBG scan must be negative for patient to be cl assified as having a complete response. New site of 
disease documented by MIBG scan qualifies patient as having progressive disease.
 
 
 11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to 
ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as  well as those who will enroll in future studies using 
similar agents.   
 
11.2 Determination of Reporting Requirements 
Reporting requirements may include the following cons iderations: 1) the characteristics of the adverse 
event including the grade  (severity); 2) the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution); and 3) the prior 
experience  (expectedness) of the adverse event.  The CTCAE (v 4.0 will be used starting from July 1st, 
2011) provides descriptive terminology and a gr ading scale for each adverse event listed.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial 
source. In some cases an agent obtained commercially may be used for indicati ons not included in the 
package label.  In addition, NCI may on some occasions  distribute commercial supplies for a trial.  Even 
in these cases, the agent is still considered to be a commercial agent and the procedures described below 
should be followed.  
Determine the prior experience
 Expected events are those that have been  previously identified as resulting 
from administration of the agent.  An adverse event is considered unexpected,  for reporting purposes only, 
when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not  listed in:  
 
 the current NCI Agent-Specific Adverse Event Li st (provided in the Drug Information 
Section of this protocol); or 
 the drug package insert (for treatments with commercially available agents). 
 11.3 Reporting of Adverse Events for Commercial
 Agents - AdEERS abbreviated pathway  
Commercial reporting requirements are provided in Table B.  The commercial agent(s) used in this study 
are listed in the Drug Information Section of this protocol.   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 80  
COG requires the AdEERS report to be submitted within 5 calendar  days  of learning of the event.   
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-specifi c patient ID provided duri ng trial registration on all 
reports. 
 
 
 
Table B  
Reporting requirements for adverse events experienced by patients on study who have NOT 
received any doses of an investigational agent on this study.

1This includes all deaths within 30 days  of the last dose of treatment with a 
commercial agent, regardless of attribution.  Any death that occurs more 
than 30 days after the last dose of treatment with a commercial agent which can be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not
 
due to cancer recurrence must be reported via AdEERS. 
 11.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting 
 
The NCI defines both routine and expedited AE repor ting.  Routine reporting is accomplished via the 
Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study database.  For this study, routine reporting will include all AdEERS reportable events and Grade 4  and higher non-hematologic Adverse Events 
with any attribution.  Reporting of hematologic adv erse events will not be required as a part of 
routine AE reporting for this study.  Exceptions to the routine reporting criteria above are the 
following which are necessary to meet study aims: 
 Grade 3 or higher neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia during induction Cycle 1 
 Grade 2 or higher diarrhea or gastrointestinal obstruction which may occur at any time after surgical resection of primary tumor.  
11.5 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS 
As of August 25, 2010, all secondary mali gnancies should be reported via AdEERS. 
  
 
 
12.0 RECORDS AND REPORTING 
 
12.1 Categories of Research Records  
 
Research records for this study can be divided into three categories: 
 
1. Non-computerized Information:  Pathology Na rrative Reports and Surgical Reports.  These forms 
are submitted through the Document Imaging System in the eRDES  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 81 2. Reference Labs’ required reports, and QARC da ta:  These data accompany submissions to these 
centers, which forward their review data electr onically to the COG Statistics and Data Center. 
 
3. Computerized Information Electronically Submitted:   All other computerized data will be entered 
in the COG Remote Data Entry System with the aid of schedules and worksheets (essentially 
paper copies of the RDE screens) provided in the data form packet. 
 
See separate Data Form Packet posted on the C OG web site, which includes submission schedule. 
 
12.2 CDUS  
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS).  Cumulative CDUS data will 
be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31 and 
October 31. This is not a responsibility of institutions participating in this trial. 
  
13.0 SURGICAL GUIDELINES 
 
13.1 Surgical rationale  
The overall surgical goal in high-risk patients wi th neuroblastoma is the most complete tumor 
resection with preservation of full organ and neurologic function if possible . In addition, the surgeon 
is responsible for the preservation and delivery of an adequate surgical specimen to the appropriate laboratory for crucial biologic analyses; including determination of MYCN  amplification, ploidy, and 
molecular genetic analyses. Titanium clips should be placed around sites of residual disease.   
 
13.2 Pre-operative management  
Adequate pre-operative imaging of the primary tumor a nd sites of regional spread is done by either 
computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imag ing, or a combination of the modalities. Sites of 
distant metastases should be evaluated by a combination of clinical and bone marrow assessment as well as bone scan and MIBG scans. When dealing with paraspinal or epidural lesions pre-operative 
neurosurgical consultation is recommended and a b aseline neurologic assessment carried out (see section 
13.4.3 and Appendix III). The planned operation s hould be discussed with the attending pediatric 
oncologist and, if possible, at tumor board and the goals of the surgery should be clearly understood by all involved services pre-operatively.   13.3 Sampling requirements  
In all patients, the primary purpose of the initial surgical procedure is to obtain enough tissue to establish the diagnosis, determine stage, and secure enough pr operly preserved tumor for biological studies. Refer 
to ANBL00B1 for complete deta ils of specimen requirements. All patients must be enrolled onto 
ANBL00B1 to be eligible to participate in ANBL0532.  An adequate biopsy to determine the diagnosis 
and assess biological variables like histopathologic classification, MYCN amplification and ploidy is 
required. Usually more than 1 cubic centimeter of vi able tissue is needed fo r all these assays. Needle 
biopsies are not sufficient for histologic classificati on.  The surgeon should remember that a significant 
portion of the tumor may be necrotic. Frozen section examination of a small amount of tissue will verify that viable neuroblastoma is being biopsied. The anesthesia time while awaiting frozen section analysis can also be used to obtain bone marrow aspirations and biopsies, and for placement of a vascular access 
device.  
For patients with stage 4S disease who are very ill and in whom an open biopsy to obtain tissue for 
diagnosis and biologic studies is c onsidered medically contraindicated, every effort should be made to 
obtain some tumor tissue by fine needle aspiration of a metastatic site for at minimum the determination of MYCN status.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 82  
13.4 Operative management  
 
13.4.1 Central Line Placement  
Patients will require central venous access both for treatment and apheresis.  It is usually feasible and 
efficient to place a vascular access device and obtain a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy during the same 
anesthetic.  The appropriate catheter should be placed from initiation of therapy.   Medcomp or similar catheters are specifically desi gned as tunneled, permanent apheresis catheters.  It 
may not be possible to draw at a sufficient rate from a non-apheresis catheter that is smaller than 10Fr. If a smaller double lumen must be placed, or if it is not possible to draw at a sufficient rate (2 mL/kg/min) 
then it may be necessary to place an additional 8-10 Fr single lumen catheter for the apheresis. If a 
second, single-lumen line is needed, it is best to pl ace it electively PRIOR to starting the mobilization 
cycle of chemotherapy (i.e., Cycle 2 induction chemotherapy). 
 
13.4.2 Diagnostic Surgery
 
In all patients, the primary purpose of the initial surgical procedure is to obtain enough tissue to establish the diagnosis, determine stage, and secure enough properly preserved tumor for biological studies.  The great majority of high-risk patients will undergo initial  diagnostic biopsy without resection.  Biopsy of the 
primary tumor or an accessible metastatic site is acce ptable.  The goal of the biopsy procedure is to obtain 
enough tissue for a histopathological diagnosis as well as MYCN determination, cytogenetics, and other 
biological studies.  The surgeon shou ld try to obtain at least one cm
3 of viable tumor tissue, if feasible, 
according to the surgeon’s judgment.  Complete excision of the primary tumor can occasionally be 
performed if the tumor is easily resectable without a lengthy procedure or extensive dissection. However, a resection should not be undertaken if it might result in significant delay in the initiation of 
chemotherapy or great morbidity. In some institutions the diagnosis is established by finding 
neuroblastoma in bone marrow specimens in conjunction with elevated urinary catecholamines.   13.4.3 Tumors with Intraspinal Extension
 
When the tumor approaches the spinal canal on imaging (see Section 16.2), a detailed examination must 
assess neurological function. The format for the exam ination, a modification of the ASCIA scale, is 
detailed in Appendix III and should be used to document the degree of neurologic dysfunction at 
diagnosis and at subsequent time points during and post-therapy. 
 Laminectomy should not be performed in patients who are neurologically asymptomatic.  Patients with 
symptomatic spinal cord compression secondary to  intraspinal/epidural extension of neuroblastoma 
through a neural foramina may require laminectomy, or osteoplastic laminotomy at diagnosis to prevent 
permanent paralysis.  However, treatment with chemotherapy alone or chem otherapy and radiation 
therapy will frequently be sufficient to rapidly re verse symptoms of cord compression. Therapeutic 
decisions in neuroblastoma patients with spinal cord compression should be made with the multidisciplinary involvement of the attending pediatric oncologist, general pediatric surgeon, and 
pediatric neurosurgeon. 
If neurologic deterioration occurs during chemotherapy, neurosurgical  evaluation should be sought and 
operative decompression strongly considered.  Appropriate to the degree of neurological impairment, the treating physicians may decide that operative ne urosurgical decompression is indicated under these 
circumstances. If feasible, the neurosurgeon should perform an osteoplastic laminotomy, with secure 
replacement of the laminae after decompression h as been accomplished. Operative details will be 
recorded in the RDE.  Assessment of neurological function will be perform ed prior to start of treatment, after 2 cycles of 
inductions, end-induction therapy, end consolidation therapy and end of cisRA therapy for all patients 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 83 with intraspinal extension of tumors (see Section 7.0).   Neurologic and orthopedic evaluations will be 
a routine part of off therapy follow-up for patients with intraspinal extension of tumors, and will be 
performed at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post therapy, and then annually thereafter.   Orthopedic 
evaluation will include assessment of scoliosis and of extremity deformity by upright spine x-ray at these 
time points (see Appendix III). 
 
13.4.4 Operative management of primary tumors after chemotherapy  
The majority of patients will undergo resection of the primary tumor after initial induction chemotherapy.  
Surgical resection should be performed when the ANC > 500/µL and the patient is medically stable after Cycle 5 of Induction.  This is to allow maximal tumor reduction by chemotherapy prior to resection and 
to reduce vascularity.  Surgical resection may be pe rformed later in Induction, if necessary, but must 
occur prior to Consolidation. Surgical scheduling
 SHOULD AVOID  DELAYS OF MORE THAN SIX  
WEEKS BETWEEN CHEMOTHERAPY CYCLES.  
 
 
 
 
The goal of delayed surgery is gro ss total resection of residual tumor in the primary site as well as tumor 
in areas of regional dissemination (usually lymph nodes).  Resection with microscopically negative 
margins may not be feasible because of proximity to ma jor vascular structures and the spine.  Instead, the 
surgeon should concentrate on removing, as completely  as possible, all gross disease.  It is acceptable, 
and often necessary, to incise the tumor and remove it in a segmental fashion. Titianium clips should be 
used to mark all areas of residual disease. All attempts should be made to preserve organs, especially the 
kidney.  Rarely, nephrectomy may be necessary for complete tumor removal but this should only be 
planned if the involved kidney has greatly diminished  function.  If pre-operatively a nephrectomy is being 
considered, then a differential GFR should be obtained to determine what the rena l function will be in the 
remaining kidney.  This is extremely important becau se carboplatin is used for consolidation and toxicity 
may be greater for patients with a GFR < 100 ml/min/1.73m2. The surgical committee of the Children’s 
Oncology Group strongly recommends kidney preservation when feasible.   It is vital that the operating surgeon dictate a detailed operative note, which should include: the 
completeness of resection, areas of residual disease, estimated blood loss, and any operative complication 
such as identification of injury to adjacent structures, removal of normal  organs, renal injury and vascular 
injury.  Surgical resection of residual disease following HSCT is not encouraged, unless it would alter therapy. 
 
13.5 Management of Surgical Complications  
 
13.5.1 Intraoperative Complications
 
 
Intraoperative complications are site-dependent. Ma jor hemorrhage from either venous or arterial 
structures is always possible with these infiltrative tumors.  The principles of vascular surgery, including proximal and distal control, pertain.  Appropriate in traoperative vascular consulta tion should be sought if 
necessary.  Crucial vessels like the carotid, subclavian, hepatic, superior mesenteric or renal arteries 
should be repaired and flow restored even if bypa ss grafting is required.  Nerve injuries may also be 
incurred and should be primarily repaired using magnification. 
 
13.5.2 Post-operative Complications
 
 
This topic is too broad for simple discussion. Generally, large neuroblastoma resections result in 
significant third space losses and require vigorous fluid replacement.  Because of this fluid requirement 
patients may require significant periods of post-operative ventilation.  The need for post-operative 
monitoring in an intensive care environment should be  anticipated.  Acute and long-term complications 
and duration of complications will be prospectivel y monitored, including chylous leak (thoracic and 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 84 abdominal); secretory non-infectious diarrhea; bowel obstruction due to post-surgical adhesions and renal 
dysfunction due to vascular injury. 
 
Pulmonary Complications:  Resection of large abdom inal neuroblastoma may result in significant third 
space losses and require vigorous fluid replacement intr aoperatively and postoperatively.  Because of this 
fluid requirement patients may require significant pe riods of post-operative ventilation.  The need for 
post-operative monitoring in an intensive care environment should be anticipated.  Pneumonias or other 
pulmonary complications related to ICU and postopera tive course (including incubation >7 days) should 
be reported 
 
Bowel Obstruction:  Small bowel obstruction may o ccur for many reasons, including injury, exposure, or 
blunt trauma during the resection, postoperative intussusception, formation of adhesions, or related to radiation injury.  Obstruction may occur in the early postoperative period, or may occur months to years later.  This study will collect long term data on th e occurrence, etiology, and management of small bowel 
obstruction in this patient population, with the aims  of reporting accurate occurrence rates, along with 
correlation of occurrence to the extent of r esection and other efforts at local control. 
 Chylous Leak: Extensive dissection of the retroperitoneum or mediastinum may result in either frank disruption of chylous channels, or interruption causing intraluminal lymphatic hypertension and leak.  
This study will collect long term data on the occurrence and evaluation of abdominal distension, chylous 
ascites, and chylothorax as they relate to chylous leak, with the aims of reporting accurate occurrence 
rates, along with correlation of occurrence to extent of resection and other attempts at local control  Renal Injury/Atrophy: Renal injury may manifest in ma ny forms, related to the nature of the injury or 
insult.  While nephrectomy is strongly discouraged, extensive perirenal dissection and kidney sparing 
surgery may still result in vascular occlusion, infa rction, traumatic compression, or other injury 
mechanisms sufficient to cause long term dysfunction or atrophy.  Additionally, radiation therapy may 
lead to kidney damage, again with the long term finding of atrophy.  This study will collect long term data 
on renal function, identifying the occurrence of renal injury and atrophy, with the aims of reporting accurate occurrence rates, along with correlation to extent of resection and other attempts at local control. 
 
Diarrhea: Extensive sympathetic denervation associat ed with aggressive retroperitoneal dissection may 
result in increased frequency of stooling or diarrhea .  This study will collect long term data on the 
occurrence and interventions necessar y for the control of postoperativ e diarrhea, with the aims of 
reporting accurate occurrence rates, along with correla tion to extent of resection and other attempts at 
local control. 
 
 
13.6 Special techniques  
 
13.6.1 Nerve Stimulation  
 
Nerve stimulation can be useful in detecting motor ne rves in the brachial or lumbo-sacral plexus.  This 
requires cooperation from the anesthesiologist as muscle re laxation must be allowed to wear off.  Nerve 
stimulation should always be used when dissection along the pelvic sidewall or in the neck or thoracic inlet. 
 
13.6.2 Ultrasonic Dissector-aspirators
 
 
Some authors have described the use of ultrasonic dissectors (CUSA) to debulk the interior of large 
tumors allowing an easier capsular dissection.  The tec hnique is useful for friable tumors but not those 
that are stroma rich.  The surgeon should try to pe rform a generous incisional biopsy prior to ultrasonic 
dissection as it is difficult to capture the tumor specimen after it has been aspirated into the device. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 85  
13.6.3 Thoracoscopy  
 
Video-assisted thoracoscopy can be used to remove sm all posterior mediastinal or thoracic inlet tumors 
provided there is no vascular encasement.   One-lung ventilation is mandatory. 
 
13.6.4 Laparoscopy  
 
Laparoscopic resection of small adrenal or pelvic prim aries can be done.  Extensive tumors or those with 
significant vascular encasement, or locoregional noda l spread can be more completely resected using 
standard open approaches. 
 13.6.5 Radiofrequency Ablation, Cryosurgery
 
 
 
These techniques have significant drawbacks when app lied to lesions in proximity to major vascular 
structures and should be avoided when treating neuroblastoma.   13.7 Specimen requirements  
 
As noted above an initial biopsy should obtain greater than 1 cubic centimeter of  viable tumor tissue. 
Placement of the specimen in formalin should be a voided. Rather, the pathologist should be alerted and 
the specimen rapidly transferred from the operating r oom fresh and sterile. The surgeon should verify 
with the pathologist that viable tissue was sent a nd is being processed for COG biological studies and 
histopathology. Since it is hoped to extract RNA from these specimens, rapid freezing of some of the tissue is required.   14.0 PATHOLOGY GUIDELINES AND SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 
 
14.1 Rapid Pathology Review  
A rapid review of histology (under ANBL00B1) is re quired to determine eligibility of patients for this 
study. See COG ANBL00B1 for complete details on specimen requirements. Recently, as part of the 
international cooperative effort to develop a comple te set of International Neuroblastoma Risk Groups, 
the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Committee devised a morphologic classification of 
neuroblastoma tumors that is modeled on the one proposed by Shimada and colleagues
124,125  I n  
ANBL00B1, tumor sections will be centrally review ed, and classified as favorable or unfavorable 
according to the criteria described by the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Committee (INPC).  
 
Send representative slides to the COG Pathology Center  via Federal Express for overnight delivery.  The 
slides will then be forwarded to Dr Hiroyuki Shim ada, who will determine the histologic classification 
(INPC) and will notify the Neuroblastoma Biology Tr acking Center.  The Tracking Center will then 
determine protocol assignment (low, intermediate, a nd high-risk) and will notify the treating institution of 
the results.  
14.1.1 Tracking Center Activity
 
 
Institutions will first enroll patients on ANBL00B1 once the patient’s age, stage of disease and diagnosis 
have been determined.  The COG Statistical Office will notify the Tracking Center with the enrollment 
information.  Results of MYCN and ploidy status will be sent to the Tracking Center and to the treating 
institution by the Neuroblastoma Biology Reference La boratory as soon as the results are available.  The 
Tracking Center will notify immediately Dr Shimada in the event that a patient’s stage, age, MYCN, and 
ploidy status mandate immediate review of histolog y for risk-grouping and treatment assignment.  The 
Tracking Center will then notify the Statistical Office and the treating institution of the patient’s risk 
group and protocol assignment.  Patients will then be  enrolled on the appropriate therapeutic study.

15.0 SPECIAL STUDIES SPECIMEN REQUIREMENTS 
 
15.1 Biologic Requirements  
 
Patients must be enrolled on ANBL00B1 prior to the time of enrollment on ANBL0532.  Enrollment on ANBL00B1 is required for all newly di agnosed patients within 21 days of diagnosis for all patients, with 
the exception of infants with stage 4S neuroblastoma who are too ill to undergo a diagnostic biopsy procedure.  Tissue procurement is mandatory for biology study registration.  Consent for ANBL00B1 must be obtained at the time of tissue submission and should be within one week  of surgery.  Needle 
biopsies are not sufficient for histologic classification.   Investigators are strongl y encouraged to obtain 
adequate tissue (see sections 13.0 and 14.0) via op en biopsy techniques.  See protocol ANBL00B1 for 
details on the type of specimen to be obtained, how  the specimen should be pr epared, when the specimen 
should be shipped and the appr opriate contact information. 
 
ANBL00B1 enrollment allows tumor tissue and blood samples obtained at the time of diagnosis to be tested for the determination of INPC histologic classification, MYCN copy number and tumor cell ploidy. 
These results are used in real time to determine ri sk categorization and treatment assignment, especially 
for patients age 12-18 months with stage 4 disease or stage 3 disease.   Residual tissues may be used for 
additional research testing and/or banking if info rmed consent for these options are indicated on the 
patient’s ANBL00B1 consent document.   
 
Study enrollment on ANBL0532 must be within 4 weeks of diagnosis, with confirmed biology status for 
initial risk group assignment.  15.2 Cyclophosphamide Pharmacogenomics  
Patients may opt to participate in the pharmacoge nomics study of cyclophosphamide. For these studies, 
peripheral blood should be drawn prior to starting therap y. The sample is, however, acceptable at any time 
the patient is not neutropenic.  Handling
 
Blood samples (10mL) are to be collected in a purple top tube (EDTA).  Please label tubes with date of 
collection and patient COG identifi cation number.  The samples should be kept at room temperature . 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532

15.6 Minimal Residual Disease – Peripheral Blood 
Specimen collection for this test is optional depending on whether or not the patient has signed an informed 
consent for them.  
Although several studies have shown that the number of  circulating neuroblastoma cells is approximately 
2 log higher in bone marrow than in peripheral blood,
117 peripheral blood samples should also be screened 
for MRD because sampling peripheral blood is less invasive and better tolerated by most patients.126 
Specimen will be obtained at diagnosis, end of induction (before transplantation), prior to treatment for 
MRD (end consolidation) and at the end of therapy.   
 
RT-PCR Analysis:  
Peripheral Blood:   2 mL is drawn and placed into an anticoagulant (Sodium heparin or EDTA) tube. 
Peripheral blood and anticoagulant are gently mixed by inverting the tube 3 to 5 times.  The specimen is 
then withdrawn and placed immediately into a PAXgeneTM blood RNA tube.  Label tube with the BPC 
Number, COG Patient ID, specimen type and collecti on date. On PAXgene tube also include type of

cis-RA Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacogeno mics Sample Collection and Shipping 
 
Sample Collection:  
ALL SAMPLES MUST BE PROTEC TED FROM LIGHT AT ALL TIMES BY WRAPPING IN FOIL 
IMMEDIATELY. 
One 5mL blood sample will be collected  into sodium heparin tube 4 hours  after administration of cis-
RA on Day 14 of Course 1 of cis-RA treatment.  Unseparated blood and plasma must be protected from 
light at all times (i.e. wrapped in aluminum foil).  The blood will be immediatel y chilled in an ice-water 
bath and plasma will be separated by low speed  centrifugation (1500-2000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C). 
The plasma will be transferred to a polypropylene tube, immediately frozen and stored at – 20 °C 
wrapped in foil for pharmacokinetic drug analysis.  The cell pellet (RBC and WBC) will be frozen and 
stored at –80 °C for the pharmacogenomic studies.  E ach tube must be labeled with patient identifier, 
study number, date and time the sample was drawn. Da ta should also be recorded on the 13 Cis Retinoic 
Acid Pharmacokinetic Shipping (PKS) Form (RDE) to be  returned with the samples. Data will also be 
collected to indicate whether cis-RA was taken by ca psule or out of capsule (i.e., capsules snipped and 
contents mixed with fatty food).  Do not label the tubes or PKS form with the patient’s name.

Description of assays The central intent of these studies is to assess survivin as a tumor an tigen in neuroblastoma. Three 
immunoassays are available to these studies to  measure functional cellular and antitumor 
immunity
110,127,128. These assays depend on the ability to isolat e and utilize autologous antigen presenting 
cells (APCs) to activate and expand antigen-specific T cells. We have used a system of RNA transfection into engineered antigen presenting cells to examine immune responses in patients with neuroblastoma and 
to develop a system to engineer cellular can cer vaccines applicable to pediatric tumors
127. The RNA 
transfection uses the Amaxa technology, and is capab le of transfecting RNA driving the expression of 
specific proteins such as the tu mor antigen survivin as well as tu mor RNA to express potential tumor 
antigens. The APC technology utili zes RNA-loaded CD40-activated B ce lls (CD40-B) as an alternative 
APC to induce cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. We have shown that we can use these techniques 
to detect antigen-specific CTL by tetramer staining,  demonstrate antigen- or tumor-specific CTL function 
using ELISPOT or target cell cytolysis, and detect antigen specific CTL using tetramers. Routine assays 
necessary for these assessment s have been established in the lab and the Penn Human Immunology Core 
(HIC)110,127. These assays include: (i) Flow cytometric T cell assays using monoclonal antibodies and 
HLA-A2/peptide tetramer complexes, (ii) ELISPOT assay for cytokine release from single peptide-
specific T cells, and (iii) T cell cytotoxicity assays in response to survivin expressing targets. This 
combination of immunoassessment assays will permit the evaluation of whether survivin-specific CD8+ 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 94 cells in patients both before after HSCT can be directly enumerated by peptide/MHC tetramers, 
proliferate and secrete IFN-gamma, and possess phenotypic  and functional characteristics of tumor-lytic 
CD8+ T cells. 
 
We have used HLA-A2/survivin1M2 tetramer to detect survivin-specific CD8+ CTL in HLA-A2+ 
patients (about half of patients will be A2+). These cells  can be detected in the T cell samples collected at 
diagnosis, and we can use RNA-tr ansfected CD40-B cells as APC to expand anti-tumor CD8+ T cells 
from patient samples. We will compare the numbers of  survivin+ CTL generated using total autologous 
tumor RNA transfected into CD40-B cells to CTL generated using survivin mRNA. From the initial 
sample, CD40-B will be generated and electroporated  with total autologous tumor RNA or survivin 
mRNA. After coculture with autologous patient PBMC for one week, tetramer analysis will be 
performed. Survivin-specific CD8+  CTL will be measured using our  HLA-A2/survivin1M2 tetramer, 
comparing the percentage of CD8+/tetramer+ cells in cultures stimulated with either survivin mRNA or 
total tumor RNA, with GFP-stimulated cultures serving as negative controls.  We will measure anti-tumor 
CTL cytotoxicty using the standard chromium51-release assay. For cytotoxicity assays, HLA-matched 
allogenic cell lines will be used as targets, with HLA-mismatched neuroblastoma cells as negative control targets.  We will also use the CD107a mobilization assay as a marker of CTL function
111.  
 
 
16.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING  
    
 
    
16.1 CT Scans  
Axial imaging of the site of the primary tumor w ill be performed using low-dose technique according to 
the ALARA concept. 
129  The studies will be performed using current-generation single or multi-detector 
systems. CT slice thickness should be 5 mm or less.  Imaging will be performed during the administration 
of intravenous contrast, generally at 2 mL/kg.  Th e use of oral contrast w ill be determined by the 
individual radiologist performing the study, but may be helpful in abdominal imaging.  Images will be 
reconstructed in soft tissue a nd edge-enhanced bone/lung and live r algorithms.  Coronal and sagittal 
multiplanar reconstructi ons may be helpful. 
 
For all patients who achieve CR at end of induction therapy, pre-surgical and end of induction CT scans (or MRI if used instead of CT) will be submitted for central review  
 
16.2 MRI Scans  
Typically MRI will be performed on 1.5 T MRI units.  Axial and at least one additional plane (coronal or sagittal) of the primary tumor will be performed using at least two pulse sequences (T1, T2, STIR, FLAIR, in/out phase, post contrast).  The use of intravenous gadolinium (0.2 mL/kg) will be determined by the radiologist performing the study.  Slice thic kness will be determined by patient size, and region 
covered, but should be less than 7 mm.  The smalle st appropriate coil should be used.  Measurements 
should be made using the same axial
 sequence best showing the tumor in follow-up for comparisons. 
 Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on 
established standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease eval uations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for 
valid clinical, patient and family logistical , or facility,  procedure and/or anesthesia 
scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where 
explicitly prohibited within the protocol).

preferred imaging modality in such cases (neck, chest, nonadrenal retroperitoneum) with spinal cord or 
canal encroachment.130  It may also be useful in evaluating an  MIBG-avid focus detected in the skeleton 
or soft tissues.   
 The lack of ionizing radiation also makes MRI attract ive for younger children, but this must be balanced 
with the need for sedation in these patients.  With the exceptions noted above, the choice of MRI or CT 
will be left to the referring pediatric radiologist.  
 
16.3 Skeletal Scintigraphy  
Technetium 99m methylene diphosphonate scans will include the entire skeleton, including multiple overlapping spot images. Scans will be performed usi ng a large field-of-view gamma camera with a high-
resolution collimator.  The typical dose of Tc-99m MDP is 10.4MBq/kg, with a minimum dose of 74 MBq.
131  In patients with stage 4 disease, if the diag nostic MIBG and bone scans are concordant for all 
positive sites, then only MIBG scans, but not bone scans, will be required for follow up. 
 16.4 MIBG Scintigraphy  
123I-MIBG studies of the entire body will be performed following pretreatment with supersaturated 
solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) (typical dose is 1 drop/3 years of age one day prior and two days following 
123I-MIBG administration, with a maximum of 3 drops/day).  This isotope has significantly less 
risk to the thyroid gland compared to 131I-MIBG.132  A typical dose of 123I-MIBG is 3.7 MBq/kg.  Planar 
and, as appropriate, SPECT imaging will be performed.  In patients with stage 4 disease, if the diagnostic 
MIBG and bone scans are concordant for all positive sites, then only MIBG scans, but not bone scans, will be required for follow up. 
 
 16.5 Plain Film Radiography  
This will be performed as needed using ALARA technique.  If gonadal shielding does not interfere with 
diagnostic accuracy, it should be utilized.  Breast shie lding should also be utilized in scoliosis screening 
unless clinically there is a reason why it should be omitte d.  In patients with paraspinal disease on MRI at 
presentation, scoliosis will be evaluated by upright (or supine, if necessary) spine x-ray and measured 
according to Cobb angle, at presentation and at follow-up (see Section 7.3). 
 
16.6 Tumor Measurement   
Tumors will be measured according to the COG radiol ogy group guideline. Diam eter of a “measurable 
mass” must be at least twice the reconstructed slice th ickness.  Target lesions at baseline must be greater 
than 1 cm.  When multiple or metastatic masses are present, all masses will be described, and up to 5 
target masses will be measured using th e same method in subsequent follow-ups. 
 
Measurement of each mass (see Appendix V) will cons ist of the maximal perpendicular diameters (x and 
y dimensions) on the slice showing the largest surface area.  The length (z axis) will then be determined 
by either (a) the difference in table position of the first and last slices showi ng the tumor plus one slice 
thickness or (b) the product of [slice thickness + gap] times the number of slices showing the tumor minus 
one gap distance.  According to the elliptical model, the lesion volume is then calculated as 0.5 x [length 
x width x height]. 
 16.7 Central Review of Imaging  
As quality assurance, central review of CT/MRI scan s will be performed to correlate with institutional 
end-induction response assessment.  Central review of diagnosis, pre-surgical and end-induction CT 
and/or MRI studies will be performed for all patients who are considered to have a gross total resection of 
primary tumor (< 1 cm
3 residual soft tissue density AND negative MIBG avidity at primary tumor site) 
OR who are coded by the treating institution as a CR (< 1 cm3 residual soft tissue density and normal 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 96 MIBG scan) at the primary site at completion of induction therapy. CT/MRI studies should be 
submitted to QARC within 2 weeks of end-induction restaging evaluation.  Results of central review 
will be performed by Day 35 of Consolidation therapy and results will be forwar ded to treating institution 
prior to start of local radiotherapy planning.  
 Images should preferably be submitted electronically using DICOM format to QARC.   Alternatively, 
they may be submitted on CD using DICOM format.  Th e third option would be hard copy submission of 
images including soft tissue (abdomen) windows as well as edge-enhanced lung, liver, and bone windows (for CT), or hard copy submission of all pulse sequences obtained (for MRI). Studies should not be 
photographed smaller than 20 images/page.

17.0 RADIATION THERAPY GUIDELINES 
      
 
  Radiation Therapy for patients on COG protocols can only be delivered at approved COG RT facilities (see COG Administrative Policy 3.9)  
 
General Guidelines 
Radiation therapy will be given following myeloblative stem cell transplantation. Radiation will be given 
to the primary tumor site and metastatic sites as outlined in this section. The primary site will be 
irradiated even if complete resection was achiev ed. Given the high rates of local recurrence following 
incomplete surgical resection, this study includes boost irradiation of gross residual disease for patients 
following an incomplete surgical resection.  In summary, all patients will receive 21.6Gy to the primary 
site. Those with residual disease after induction therapy will receive an additional 14.4 Gy for a total dose of 36.0 Gy.  Required Benchmark and Questionnaires:
 
Conventional (CT-based 2-dimensi onal) radiation therapy using photons or electrons, 3D-Conformal 
Radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) using photons will be allowed in this study. Patients may not receive intraoperative radiation therapy or proton therapy 
on this protocol.   Centers participating in this protocol us ing 3D-CRT are required to complete the 3D 
Benchmark; those using IMRT must complete the IMRT questionnaire and benc hmark or phantom (see 
Section 17.8). Benchmark materials and questionnair es may be obtained from the Quality Assurance 
Review Center (www.qarc.org) and must be submitted before patients on this protocol can be evaluated. 
Contact the RPC (http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc) for information regarding their IMRT phantoms.   Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on 
established standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease eval uations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for 
valid clinical, patient and family logistical , or facility,  procedure and/or anesthesia 
scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 97 Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of IMRT 
Investigators using IMRT will be required to comply with the guidelines developed for the use of IMRT in National Cancer Institute sponsored cooperative group trials. These guidelines are available through 
www.qarc.org
. These guidelines require that the protocol explicitly state their requirements and methods 
for localization and immobilization; the use of volum etric imaging; target and organ motion management; 
nomenclature, definitions and rationale for targets a nd organs at risk; target volume coverage and normal 
tissue dose constraints; effects of heter ogeneity in tissues; and quality assurance. 
 17.1 Indications for Radiation Therapy   
 
17.1.1 Treatment Sites and Dose
 
All patients will be irradiated and volumetric targeting for radiation therapy planning should be priority. Table 17.1.1 
Site or Volume (see Section 17.4) Dose (see Section 17.5) 
Primary tumor site (PTV1) 21.6Gy 
Residual primary tumor after induction/surgery (PTV2) 14.4Gy 
Metastatic disease after induction 21.6Gy 
Emergent treatment for organ or life-threat ening disease Contact Study RT Coordinators 
 
17.1.2 Tailoring Fields by Site  
Unless constrained in meeting target volume c overage requirements and organ at risk dose 
recommendations, the dose to the entire vertebral body should be uniform to avoid growth asymmetry. No pelvic irradiation should be given pr ior to bone marrow or stem cell harvest.

Treatment Site(s) Methods to anatomically confine CTV 
Intra-Abdominal: adrenal and paraspinal ganglia 
primary sites, involved nodal and metastatic disease Adjust CTV to avoid kidneys, liver, vertebral bodies 
Cervico-Thoracic:  Adjust CTV to avoid uninvolved heart, lung and vertebral bodies 
Pelvic: Adjust CTV to avoid bowel, bladder, and 
uninvolved bone 
Head and Neck: Adjust CTV to avoid uninvolved critical 
structures and bone 
Footnote: for further details, revi ew special site considerations (Section 17.4.3) and recommendations 
for organs at risk (Section 17.7).  
17.1.3 Timing of Radiation Therapy
  
Radiation will be given post-stem ce ll transplant and should start no s ooner than 28 days post transplant. 
Organ toxicity within radiation field should have reso lved. Radiotherapy should be initiated within 42 
days after stem cell transplantation.    17.1.4 Criteria to Start Radiation Therapy

Bladder Irradiation No hematuria 
*Can be achieved with growth factor support.  
**Renal scintigraphy is recommended but not required for patients with two functioning kidneys when  > 20% of one kidney will be  irradiated.   
 
17.2 Emergency Irradiation 
Patients are allowed to have received radiation therapy at diagnosis to sites of life-threatening or function-
threatening disease. This information must be repor ted as a part of the quality assurance data.  This 
treatment will not be considered part of the planned primary radiation course that is delivered at a later 
time provided normal tissue dose constraints are met. Potential deviations from normal tissue dose constraints should be discussed with the study RT coordinators.
 Emergency irradiation is subject to the 
same data submission requirements as the primary site (Section 17.8).  
17.3 Equipment 
Modality
: X-rays with a nominal energy of  4MV. In the unusual circumstan ce of a superficial lesion, 
electron fields may be used. Conventional, conformal, and IMRT techniques are allowed in this study. 
Patients may not receive intraoperative radiation thera py or proton beam thera py on this protocol. 
 
Calibration : The calibration of therapy machines used in this protocol shall be verified by the 
Radiological Physics Center (RPC). 
 CT treatment planning: 
All patients will undergo CT treatment planning for this protocol. Slices no more 
than 5 mm thick (2-3 mm is recommended) shall be ta ken throughout the extent of the irradiated volume. 
 17.4 Target Volumes  
 
The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU-50 and 62) prescription methods and nomenclature shall be utilized for th is study. This will apply to conformal and non-
conformal techniques. Although the post-surgical CT is  used for treatment planning, the target volume is 
based on the extent of disease on pre-operative CT, with modifications noted below, regardless of extent and timing of the surgical resection. If the primary tumor was grossly resected at diagnosis, the radiation 
therapy should be given to the primary site based on the initial diagnostic tumor volume.  No pelvic 
irradiation should be given prior to bone marrow/PBSC harvest.The GTV, CTV and PTV and normal 
tissues must be outlined on all CT slices in which the structures exist.  Beam’s eye view display must be 
used to design beam apertures.   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 99 17.4.1  Primary Site  
 
Gross Tumor Volume 1 (GTV1)  
 The GTV1 is the volume of tissue containing the highest concentration of residual tumor cells. 
 The GTV1 includes disease defined by CT, MR  and MIBG imaging PRIOR to surgery. 
 The GTV1 includes disease (tumor and lymph nodes) identified intra-operatively. 
 The GTV1 is corrected volumetrically after surgical  resection but not at the point of attachment.  
 The GTV1 does NOT include the extent of disease PRIOR to chemotherapy. 
 The GTV1 does NOT include uninvolved draining lymph node regions. 
 Special Circumstances (GTV1) 
 If the primary tumor was grossly resected at diagnosis, GTV1 will be based on the initial diagnostic tumor volume. 
 In cases where there is discrepancy between imagi ng studies or intraoperative findings, the larger 
volume will define GTV1. 
 When the primary tumor expands into a body cavity such as the lung or displaces a normal 
structure such as the liver without infiltration, if following surgical resection the normal structure now occupies the space previously occupied by  tumor, normal tissue volume should not be 
included within GTV1. 
 Gross Tumor Volume 2 (GTV2)
 
 The GTV2 is defined as the volume of residual tumor AFTER induction surgery and chemotherapy measuring >1cm
3 
 The GTV2 includes disease defined by CT, MR and MIBG imaging. 
 Special Circumstances (GTV2) 
 GTV2 will NOT be altered even when there is a complete response after consolidative 
chemotherapy. 
Clinical Target Volume 1 (CTV1)
 
 The CTV is defined as the volume of tissue containing subclinical microscopic disease: 
 The CTV1 margin should be an expansion of  the GTV1 to encompass microscopic disease. 
 The CTV1 for this protocol is the GTV1 with an anatomically confined margin of 1.5 cm. 
 The CTV1 should be tailored at tissue interfaces where invasion/infiltration is not likely. 
 Clinical Target Volume 2 (CTV2)
 
 The CTV is defined as the volume of tissue containing subclinical microscopic disease surrounding the post-surgical residual tumor (GTV2). 
 The CTV2 margin should be an expansion of  the GTV2 to encompass microscopic disease. 
 The CTV2 for this protocol is the GTV2 with an anatomically confined margin of 1.0 cm. 
 The CTV2 should be tailored at tissue interfaces where invasion/infiltration is not likely. 
 Planning Target Volume (PTV1)
 
 The PTV1 is a geometric concept and in cludes a margin surrounding the CTV1. 
 The PTV1 should account for physiologic change or motion in the CTV1 and set-up uncertainty. 
 The PTV1 is defined as the CTV1 with a geometric margin of 0.5-1.0 cm. 
 The PTV1 may vary depending on immobilization and cooperation, 0.5cm is the minimum extent 
of the margin surrounding CTV1 to form PTV1. 
 The PTV1 margin does not have to be uniform in  all dimensions, especially if it compromises 
normal tissue volumes or if directional target or normal tissue motion is assessed and understood.    
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 100  
Planning Target Volume (PTV2)  
 The PTV2 is a geometric concept and in cludes a margin surrounding the CTV2. 
 The PTV2 should account for physiologic change or motion in the CTV2 and set-up uncertainty. 
 The PTV2 is defined as the CTV2 with a geometric margin of 0.5-1.0 cm. 
 The PTV2 may vary depending on immobilization and cooperation, 0.5cm is the minimum extent 
of the margin surrounding CTV2 to form PTV2. 
 The PTV1 margin does not have to be uniform in all dimensions; especially if it compromises normal tissue volumes or if directional target or normal tissue motion is assessed and understood. 
 Motion Management and Margins to Account  for Target Volume and Organ Motion
 
Considering motion of normal tissues and target volumes is important. The internal target volume (ITV) 
is defined as the CTV surrounded by the IM component  of the PTV and is meant to account for potential 
motion of the CTV. The planning organ at risk volum e (PRV) includes the OR surrounded by a margin to 
compensate for physiologic change in the target volume.  If adequate clinical data do not exist to define 
the IM component of the PTV or the PRV margin, the following suggestions are provided:  
 A margin of at least 0.5 cm should be added to any OR to form the PRV. 
 For a CTV susceptible to physiologic motion, a marg in of at least 0.5 cm should be added to the 
CTV prior to PTV margin expansion or a PTV margin of 1.0 cm should be chosen. 
 For tumors of the thorax or abdomen, an assessme nt should be made to determine the extent of 
motion present. PTV margins should include this motion as a component.  
 IMRT may be used for tumors of the thorax only if the degree of tumor motion is assessed and can be limited to 0.5 cm in any direction. If required to achieve this goal, techniques for managing or 
suppressing tumor motion shall be applied. 
 A description of the method used and evidence (i.e., observed motion during fluoroscopy, motion of surrogate markers using camera systems, or analysis of 4D CT) of the remaining tumor motion should be submitted with the Quality Assurance Documentation materials as noted in section 17.8. 
 17.4.2 Metastatic Sites
 
Criteria for Treatment of Metastases:   While the primary site is always  irradiated, radiation is only given 
to those metastatic sites with persistent active di sease demonstrated on the pre-HSCT evaluation (after 
Cycle #6 of induction).  Sites that are negative on the pre-HSCT scans will NOT be irradiated, even if they had enhanced uptake on MIBG and/or bone scan at diagnosis.  
 
For patients with > 5 MIBG positive metastatic sites on pre-HSCT evaluation
 
If the patient had > 5 persistently positive MIBG metastatic sites identified after Cycle #6 of induction, the MIBG scan should be repeated on Day 28 + post-HSCT.  Only sites still MIBG positive post-
transplant should be irradiated.  If there are still > 5 MIBG positive sites contact Radiation Therapy Study 
Coordinator to discuss treatment plan prior to starting radiation.  In patients with > 5 MIBG positive l esions prior to transplant, consideration should be given to reserving 
a portion of the collected PBSC product to use as a boost after radiation if counts fall and fail to recover 2+ weeks after radiation is completed.  THE STUDY CHAIR OR VICE CHAIR MUST BE NOTIFIED 
BEFORE REINFUSING PBSC BOOST.  
 The planning target volume for metastatic sites is the area of residual tumor defined on MIBG, CT, or MR scan with a 1 cm margin.  In cases where there is a discrepancy in volume between the scans, the larger 
volume will be irradiated.  For osseous metastases, th e margin need not extend more than 1 cm outside 
the bone or across a joint space.

17.5 Target Dose 
Table 17.5 Prescribed Dose and Fractionation 
Nominal Dose by Site Target Volume Dose/fraction Number of Fractions 
Primary Site 21.6 Gy PTV1 1.8 Gy 12 
Primary Site Boost 14.4 Gy PTV2 1.8 Gy 8 
Metastatic Sites 21.6 Gy  1.8 Gy 12 
 
Prescribed dose : If conventional methods are used, the prescription point should be at or near the centroid 
of the target volume. If 3DCRT or IMRT is used, dose should be prescribed to  an isodose surface that 
encompasses the PTV and allows the dose uniformity re quirements to be satisfied as noted below.   
 
 
Dose Definition : Dose is to be specified in centigray (cGy)-to-muscle. 
 Tissue Heterogeneity
:  Heterogeneity corrections are required even when conventional planning methods 
are used and shall be applied for IMRT in complian ce with current guidelines for the use of IMRT in 
clinical trials (guidelines available at www.QARC.org) . When IMRT is used in lung, the heterogeneity 
correction algorithm must be approved by QARC. Fo r questions about heterogeneity corrections or 
approved algorithms, please contact QARC (www.QARC.org).  Prescription Dose and Fractionation
:  
 Primary Site:
  The total dose to the PTV will be 21.6Gy given in 12 fractions.  The patient will be treated 
with one fraction per day, all fields each day, giving 1.8 Gy per fraction to the prescription volume. For patients undergoing an incomplete surgical resection (>
 1 cm3 residual soft tissue density) as assessed at 
the end of induction scans, a boost of 14.4 Gy will be delivered to the gross-residual volume for a total dose of 36 Gy. 
 
Metastatic Sites:
  Sites of persistent active metastatic disease will be irradiated concurrently with the 
primary site once daily to a total dose of 21.6 Gy given in 12 equal fractions of 1.8 Gy. 
 Dose Uniformity
:  For 2D treatment, the dose variations sh all be within +7%, -5% of the prescription 
dose. For volume-based treatment plans, the entire PTV should be encompassed within the 95% isodose 
surface and no more than 10% of the PTV should recei ve greater than 110% of the prescription dose as 
evaluated by DVH. Wedges, compensators, and other methods of generating more uniform dose distributions are encouraged.  
 
Interruptions, Delays and Dose Modifications : There will be no planned rests or breaks from treatment, 
and once radiation therapy has been initiated, trea tment will not be interrupted except for any life 
threatening infection or severe hematologic toxicity defined as ANC < 300/ L or platelets less than 
40,000/L during the course of treatment. Under these circumstances, radiation therapy shall be delayed 
until the counts have recovered. Blood produc t support should be instituted according to 
institutional/protocol guidelines.  The reason for any interruptions greater than 3 treatment days should be recorded in the patient’s treatment chart and submitted with the QA documentation. There should be no modifications in dose fractionation due to age or fi eld size. If any area has been previously treated 
(emergently), care should be taken not to  exceed normal tissue tolerance levels.
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 102  
17.6 Treatment Technique  
 
Beam Configuration :  Every attempt should be made to mini mize dose to organs at risk without 
compromising coverage of the targ et volume. Although simple opposed field plans are acceptable, the use 
of oblique fields, or 3-dimensional conformal therapy (coplanar or non-coplanar), or IMRT is encouraged 
to minimize dose to normal surrounding structures.   Patient Position
: Reproducible setups are critical and the use of immobilization devices is strongly 
encouraged. Use of anesthesia is permitted if necessary for proper positioning. 
Field Shaping:  Field shaping shall be done with either customized cerrobend blocking or multileaf 
collimation . 
 
17.7 Organs at Risk 
 
The organ at risk guidelines in this section are recommendations. If the recommended doses to the organs 
at risk are exceeded because of target volume c overage requirements or other conditions (See 
Section 17.1.2), an explanation s hould be included in the quality assurance documentation. In some cases, 
IMRT may be the preferred treatment method to meet these recommendations and the required target volume coverage guidelines. 
 
 Peritoneal Cavity
:  When the entire peritoneal cavity must be irradiated, the volume to be treated extends 
from the diaphragmatic domes to the level of the bo ttom of the obturator foramina. The principles of 
tailoring fields by site should be considered (Table  17.1.2) and the recommendations for organs at risk 
should be followed.  Liver:
  The liver dose should be minimized to reduce the risk of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome 
(SOS), formerly known as  veno-occlusive disease. No more than 50% of the liver shall receive a 
cumulative dose greater than 900 cGy and no more than 25% of the liver shall receive a dose greater than 
1800 cGy.   
 Kidney:
  The kidney doses should be minimized to reduce the risk of chronic renal failure.  
 If the primary tumor demonstrates laterality to the right or left side, an ipsilate ral and contralateral kidney 
should be designated. In such a case, 100% of the ipsilateral kidney may recei ve 1440 cGy and 50% of 
the same kidney may receive 1980 cGy. For the contralateral kidney, no more that 50% should receive a cumulative dose greater than 800 cGy and no more than 20% should receive a cumulative dose greater than 1200 cGy.  If the primary site does NOT demonstrate laterality, both kidneys may receive a mean dose of 14.4 Gy 
and no more than 50% of each kidney should receive 1980 cGy.    Lung:
  When a major portion of both lungs must be treat ed because of a large intrathoracic tumor volume, 
effort should be made to minimize the irradiated l ung volume. No more than one-third of the entire lung 
volume shall receive a cumulative dose greater than 1500cGy.  
17.8 Dose Calculations and Reporting  
 
If 3D conformal techniques are used to treat patient s on this study, a 3D benchmark needs to be 
completed and submitted to QARC. Institutions tr eating with IMRT must complete the IMRT 
Questionnaire and either the QARC Benchmark or i rradiate the RPC’s IMRT head and neck phantom. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 103 The Benchmark material can be obtained from the Qu ality Assurance Review Center (www.QARC.org). 
Contact the RPC (http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc) for information regarding their IMRT phantoms.  
Patients will be considered unevaluable if appr oved benchmarks are not on file at QARC.   
 
Prescribed Dose:  The monitor units required to deliver the prescribed do se shall be calculated and submitted using the RT-1 
or IMRT Dosimetry Summary Form.If IMRT is used, the monitor units generated by the IMRT planning 
system must be independently checked prior to the patient’s first treatment.  Measurements in a QA 
phantom can suffice for a check as long as the patient’s plan can be directly applied to a phantom 
geometry. The total prescribed dose shall be calcula ted and reported on the RT-2 Radiotherapy Total 
Dose Record. If 3DCRT or IMRT is used, dose should be prescribed to an isodose surface that 
encompasses the PTV and allows the dose uniformity requirements to be satisfied.    Dose Uniformity 
The maximum and minimum doses in the PTV shall be calculated and reported on the RT-1 or IMRT 
Dosimetry Summary form. These doses may be extracted  from isodose distributions, calculated separately 
or derived from DVH data.  
 
Normal Tissue Dosimetry 
The daily dose to the critical organs indicated should be  calculated whenever they are directly included in 
a radiation field. For 2D techniques they should be  reported on the RT-1 Dosimetry Summary form.  The 
total dose shall be calculated and reported on the RT-2 Radiotherapy Total Dose Record form.  For 
patients treated with volume-based techniques, the appropriate dose-volume histograms should be 
submitted and RT-1 or IMRT form completed.  If IM RT is used, a DVH must be submitted for a category 
of tissue called “unspecified tissue,” which is defined as tissue contained within the skin, but which is not 
otherwise identified by containment within any other structure.

17.10 Definitions of Deviations in Protocol Performance  
Prescription Dose:  
Minor Deviation: The prescribed dose differs from that in the protocol by between 6% and 10% Major Deviation: The prescribed dose differs fro m that in the protocol by more than 10% 
 Dose Uniformity:
 
Minor Deviation for 3D conformal and IMRT treatments: 
 
The entire PTV is not encompassed within the isod ose surface representing 95% of the prescription dose 
or more than 10% of the PTV receives more than 110% of the prescription dose. 
 Minor Deviation for 2D treatments: The dose variation in the treated volume shall be  within +7, -5% of the prescription point dose. 
 Volume:
 
Minor Deviation: Margins less than specified or fiel ds excessively large as deemed by the study reviewer. 
Major Deviation: A portion of the tumor (GTV) or potentially tumor bearing area (CTV) is not included in the treated volume.  Critical structures: 
A minor or major deviation will be assessed at the time  of data review (depending on the details of each 
case) if the critical structure dose limits are exceeded. 
  
 
18.0 HEMATOPOIETIC TRANSPLANT GUIDELINES 
 
All transplants performed on COG trials must occur at COG-accredited HSCT programs with the 
exception of adolescents/adults being treated on COG trials who are referred to an adult transplant 
facility.  See the COG Administrative Policy 3.3 regarding the agreement requirements for these cases. 
 
 
19.0 RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR PBSC MOBILIZATION AND COLLECTION 
 
19.1 Catheter Use  
PBSC may be collected using a large bore double lumen central venous catheter that will allow the 1-2 ml/kg/min flow rates required for apheresis.  Ma ny institutions use temporary or tunneled apheresis 
catheters (such as the 8 Fr Medcomp catheter) in neuroblastoma patients. Femoral line placement is 
generally not required.   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 106 19.2 PBSC Mobilization  
Institutional standard operating procedures (SOPs) w ill be used for mobilization and pheresis. Patients 
should begin G-CSF starting one day after completing a cycle of chemotherapy.  They should continue on 
G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day while recovering from the cycle of chemotherapy until the post-nadir ANC > 500-
1000/L, at which point it is recommended to increase the dose of G-CSF to at least 10mcg/kg/day per 
institutional policies. 
 
Institutions which time collections using circula ting CD34 cell counts will generally begin when the 
count is >  10-20 cells/ L. Otherwise, the timing of collection is often within 1-3 days  of increasing the G-
CSF dose, when WBC is >2000 (usually Day 14 from start of chemotherapy), although rapid 
hematopoetic recovery as indicated by a significant left shift and/or a rapidly rising WBC count, may provide an opportunity for earlier collection.  It is critical that G-CSF be given daily until PBSC 
collection is complete. If the WBC is > 60,000, decrease G-CSF dose to 5 micrograms/kg.  If patients are off  G-CSF prior to planned PBSC harvest, they should receive G-CSF 10-16 mcg/kg/day, max dose 600 mcg, for 3 days prior to the first da y of scheduled PBSC harvest (timing and cytokine 
regimens per institutional policies), harvest on Day 4 of G-CSF treatment, and continue daily G-CSF until 
PBSC collections are completed. Such patients should be  off their G-CSF for 5-7 days before restarting it 
for mobilization. If the WBC is > 60,000, decrease G-CSF dose to 5 micrograms/kg. 
  19.3 PBSC Collection 
 
19.3.1 Laboratory Studies
 
For patients < 25 kg, a type and cross for PRBC should be performed one day prior to procedure to avoid 
apheresis delays.  
 19.3.2 Apheresis Machine
 
The Cobe Spectra or the Fenwal CS 3000+ is recommended because the continuous flow centrifugation devices are better tolerated than discontinuous flow  machines. Institutional SOPs will be used.   
 19.3.3 Blood Priming
 
For patients less than 25 kg, priming of the apheresis machine with IRRADIATED, leukocyte-poor red 
blood cells may be required. 
 
 
19.3.4 Collection Goals  
It is recommended that large volume apheresis be pe rformed on all patients for each collection.  During 
each leukopheresis procedure, the typical target volume of whole blood processed will be approximately 480 mL/kg (6 blood volumes).  
Optimal collection goal (total for all collections) is 10 x 10
6 CD 34+ cells/kg for PBSC.  The targeted 
number of cells can usually be obtained in 1-3 collect ion days. It is recommended that the collection be 
stored in at least 3 aliquots of cells: 
 2-4x106 CD34+ cells/kg for the first HSCT procedure 
 2-4x106 CD34+ cells/kg for the second HSCT procedure 
 2-3x106 CD34+ cells/kg as a backup for delayed engr aftment, or for potential subsequent use. 
Because of the advantages of collecting these backup cells during this pheresis episode (as 
opposed to later in the patient’s clinical course) ,133 it is highly recommended that these cells be 
collected, even if this requires an additional day of apheresis. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 107 CD 34+ cell counts should be done at local institutio n on all collections as per institutional SOPs.   
 
19.4 PBSC Analyses 
The following studies should be pe rformed on each PBSC collection: 
1) Culture for bacterial and fungal contamination, 
2) Nucleated cell count and differential, 3) CD34+ cell enumeration, 4 PCR analysis for tumor cell content (sent to COG Biopath Center) – see Section 15.5 for 
details. 
 19.4.1 PBSC timing:
 
PBSC mobilization is strongly recommended following cycle 2 REGARDLESS of disease status in the marrow. However, should the patient’s medical condition prohibit use of apheresis, it is appropriate to delay PBSC mobilization and harvest af ter subsequent induction therapy. 
PBSC IMMUNOCYTOLOGY IS NOT REQUIRED FOR STUDY PARTICIPATION OR CELL INFUSION. An aliquot of each peripheral stem cell collection may be analyzed for tumor cell 
content by immunocytochemical analyses per institut ional standards.  In the rare circumstance that 
a PBSC collection following Cycle 2 induction is sh own to be positive by immunocytology for tumor 
cell content, patient will require another harvest after Cycle 3 or Cycle 4. 
 
19.5 Cryopreservation of PBSC Products  
Each aliquot (as detailed above) should be processed  and cryopreserved on the day of collection as per 
Institutional SOPs. These SOPs include the use of 7.5-10% dimethyl sulfoxide final concentration in the cryopreservation medium, use of a monitored, controll ed-rate freezer, and storage in liquid nitrogen with 
appropriate monitoring. The goal is to have 3 separ ate aliquots cryopreserved in separate bags – 1 for 
each HSCT procedure and 1 for a potential backup.    19.6 PBSC Infusion  
The PBSC product should NEVER be irradiated prior to infusion.  
 
19.6.1 Premedication
 
DMSO may cause a histamine-like reaction when infused  into the patient.  Therefore premedication with 
Benadryl and Tylenol is recommended. 
 
 
19.6.2 Thawing of PBSC  
PBSC are thawed in a 37 C water bath. Only one bag of PBSC should be thawed at a time - when the 
infusion of one bag is completed, the next bag should be thawed.   Thawed PBSC should be infused as rapidly as tolerated through a central venous catheter.  The unit may be infused by gravity, or the cells may be drawn up into a syringe and pushe d by trained personnel.  
Microaggregate filters and leukodepl etion filters MUST NOT be used for infusion of PBSC.  If a thawed 
unit appears clumpy or stringy and these particles ca nnot be dispersed with gentle kneading, the PBSC 
product could be infused through a standard 170 micron
 blood filter. 
 19.6.3 Possible Symptoms During Infusion
 
Precipitating Factor  Possible Symptoms  
hemolyzed red cells fever, chills, hemoglobinuria 
cellular clumps and debris chest pain, hypoxia, hypertension cold 10% DMSO nausea, headache

APPENDIX II:  SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES 
 
These are provided for institutional consideration. The Supportive Care Manual of COG (A Altman 
editor) can also be referenced for a more detailed discussion of treatment recommendations than can be 
provided in this appendix.   Inves tigator discretion should be used, and individual considerations made for 
specific patient situations and institutional practices.  During Induction Therapy  1.  Anti-Emetics
 
 
Give anti-emetics to control nausea and vomiting as per institutional guidelines.  Document all 
concomitant use of dexamethasone during Cycle 1 and 2 on the topotecan pharmacokinetics data 
collection form as dexamethasone  may alter drug metabolism. 
 
2.  Cytokine Support  
Only for induction cycles 1 and 3-6:  Patients will receive Myeloid growth factor (cytokine) support per 
institutional guidelines beginning 24-48 hours after chemotherapy until ANC > 1500/ µL post nadir.   
For eg: Filgrastim (G-CSF) 5 mcg/kg/day is given as a single daily Sub Qor IV dose.   Growth factor support should be stopped at least 24 hr  before the next chemotherapy cycle. ANC must be 
> 750/μL and platelets > 75,000/μ L before starting next course of therapy. The ANC frequently falls after 
discontinuing myeloid growth factor support (seconda ry neutrophil nadir). If the ANC recovers to > 
750/μL after nadir but then falls to < 750/ μL after the myeloid growth factor is stopped, the next cycle of 
therapy can be given despite ANC < 750/ μL if all other criteria for the next cycle of chemotherapy are 
met.  
For induction cycle 2 (or sub sequent PBSC collection cycle)  
During cycle when PBSC are to be harvested, filgr asatim (G-CSF) must be used for myeloid growth 
factor support.  G-CSF should be continued until ha rvest is completed.  See guidelines for G-CSF dosing 
during PBSC harvest (See Section 19.2). 
 3.  Blood Product Support
 
Recommend that patients receive prophylactic platelet  transfusions as per institutional guidelines. Use 
irradiated, CMV appropriate products .  Patients should have platelet count of > 50,000 on the day of 
apheresis.  May receive a platelet transfusion to reach 50,000 requirement.  Recommend that patients receive packed red blood cell transfusions to maintain their hemoglobin > 7.0 
gm/dl. Use irradiated, CMV appropriate products. 
 
Irradiation
 
Blood products should be irradiated following the current FDA guidelines found at: http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/gamma.htm  
 
Investigators in Canadian institutions need to follow the CSA standards for Blood and Blood Components 
CAN/CSA-Z902-04 issued in March 2004 and available at http://www.shopcsa.ca. 
 
4.  Pneumocystis Prophylaxis
 
Patients should be given prophylactic co-trimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) based on 5 mg 
trimethoprim/kg/day divided BID orally administered on 3 consecutive days a week.  For sulfa-intolerant 
patients it is recommended that inhaled pentamidin e or oral dapsone be used as prophylaxis.  Co- 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 110 trimoxazole should be held if patients fail to  recover hematopoiesis by Day 21 of any cycle.   It can be 
re-started once the next chemotherapy cycle is given or patient can be changed to pentamidine or dapsone 
if there is concern about continued myelosuppression from co-trimoxazole. 
 
5.  Treatment of Fever and Neutropenia  
Patients should be admitted to the hospital and treated w ith antibiotic therapy that is appropriate to that 
institution’s infections experience and antibiotic sensitivity patterns.  
 
6.  Herpes Simplex Virus Prophylaxis  
Antiviral prophylaxis against HSV is recommended for all patients who are HSV 1 or HSV 2 
seropositive.  Recommend use of acyclovir 1200 mg/m2/day PO divided BID, rounded to the nearest 100 
mg (max dose 800 mg PO BID) OR  500 mg/m2/day IV divided q12 hours (if unable to take PO meds for 
reasons other than mucositis) to begin on the day of  completion of chemotherapy administration, continue 
throughout neutropenia, and stop when  neutropenia (post-nadir ANC > 1500/ L) and mucositis have 
resolved. 
 7.  Nephrotoxic Agents
 
Due to risk for nephrotoxicity following dose intens ive platinum therapy, minimize use of additional 
nephrotoxic antibiotic therapy.  Whenever possible monitor blood levels of the antibiotics used. When 
empiric or directed anti-fungal therapy is required,  utilize lipid-based amphotericin or non-amphotericin 
antifungal therapy as clinically indicated for patient.  
Supportive Care During BMT  
1.  Isolation
 
Protective isolation per local institutional guidelines.   
 
2.  Skin Care  
Thiotepa can cause significant skin toxicity with sloughing of skin.   To avoid skin toxicity, patient 
should be bathed 4-6 times daily during the three days  of Thiotepa administration and the day following. 
Avoid large occlusive dressings and use of any skin  creams and remove adhesive residue from prior 
dressings and leads. Change sheets with bathing a nd bathe with water only, avoiding soap. Consider 
placement of a Foley catheter during the days of Thiote pa use in younger children to avoid perineal burns.  
Perineal burns may be more related to sweati ng induced by diapers than contact with urine. 
 3. Blood Product Support
  
Patients should receive prophylactic platelet transfus ions and packed red blood cell transfusions as per 
institutional guidelines.  Blood products should be i rradiated following the current FDA guidelines found 
at: http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/gamma.htm  
 
Investigators in Canadian institutions need to follow the CSA standards for Blood and Blood Components 
CAN/CSA-Z902-04 issued in March 2004 and available at http://www.shopcsa.ca. 
 
4. Bacterial Prophlyaxis  
Patient will receive empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy for treatment of neutropenia or febrile 
neutropenia per institutional guidelines.  
5. Fungal Prophylaxis
 
Recommend use per institutional guidelines.  Fluconazole 5 mg/kg/day daily until neutrophil engraftment 
is a standard approach.  6.  Pneumocystis Pneumonia Prophylaxis
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 111 Day -10 to day -2 before BMT:  trimethoprim (150 mg/m²/d) and sulfamethoxazo le (750 mg/m²/d); divide 
into two doses and give q12 hr. for prophylaxis against P. carinii.  After engraftment, administer PCP 
prophylaxis) per institutional guidelines. 
 
7.  Viral Prophylaxis  
Prophylaxis against HSV and/or VZV will be given in  seropositive patients as per institutional guidelines.  
In addition, patients should be m onitored for EBV and CMV reactiva tion per institutional guidelines.  
Recommendation to screen EBV by PCR and CMV as per institutional practice (i.e. antigenemia or PCR) 
q2-4 weeks through day 120 for CMV+ and/or EBV+ patients.  
 
Suggested supportive care during cis-RA therapy  
Topical Vitamin E should be applied to lips BID during cis-RA therapy if cheilitis develops.  All patients should avoid direct sun exposure while on cis-RA.  All patients should avoi d exposure to Vitamin A 
products during cis-RA therapy.

APPENDIX XI:  YOUTH SUMMARIES FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS  
  
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDIN G RESEARCH STUDY ANBL0532 
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
A Study of Neuroblastoma (that has spread from where it started) Treatment Comparing One versus Two 
High Dose Chemotherapy Regimens in Consolidation  
 
1. We have been talking with you about neuroblastom a.  Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that 
grows mostly in the nervous system outside the brain. We have done special tests, scans and 
blood tests on you to find out if you have high-risk neuroblastoma.  The tests tell us that you have 
neuroblastoma that is hard to treat becau se it has spread from where it started.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have the type of neuroblastoma 
that is hard to treat.  A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help 
people who are sick. In this study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat high-risk neuroblastoma.  We will do this by: 
a. adding a new anti-cancer medicine, called Topotecan,  to the usual chemotherapy that children with neuroblastoma receive 
b. giving higher doses of radiation (or x-ray treatments) to children who still have tumor 
after getting induction chemotherapy medicine 
c. giving some children one cycle of high dose chemotherapy and some children two cycles 
of high dose chemotherapy, followed by either on e or two stem cell transplants,  to see if 
this will keep the neuroblastoma from coming back after treatment is stopped 
d. studying how your body responds to the medicines.  
We want to see if these things can help more children can get rid of their neuroblastoma.  We 
don’t know if these approaches will help or not.  That is why we are doing this study.   
3. Children who are part of this study will be treated  first with chemotherapy that will include the 
newer medicine, Topotecan, as well as several other chemotherapy medicines.  Chemotherapy is 
a type of medicine that destroys cancer cells. Some  children may also have surgery or radiation to 
get rid of as much of the neuroblastoma as possible. After this first part of therapy, some children 
will get one cycle, while others may get two cy cles of high dose chemotherapy followed by a  
stem cell transplant. All children in this st udy will get the medicine, Accutane, after the 
chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, surgery and radiation are done. Sometimes you will have 
extra blood drawn for special research tests.   
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These good 
things are called “benefits.”  A benefit of being part of this study may be a chance that your cancer will go away for as long as possible. We don’ t know for sure if there is any benefit of 
being part of this study. We expect that the in formation learned from this study will help other 
patients with high-risk neuroblastoma in the future. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad things are called “risks.”  The risks to you fr om this study are possibly having more side  
effects or the therapy may not work to make  the cancer go away. With this treatment you 
can have problems, both during and after the treatment. We will check you closely so we 
can treat the problems you may have. Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ANBL0532  
Page 121 6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or  not.  Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start.  There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about.  Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have. 
 
7. We are asking your permission to collect additiona l blood and bone marrow specimens.  We want 
to see if there are ways to tell how the cancer  will respond to treatment. These samples would be 
taken when other standard blood tests are being performed, so there would be no extra 
procedures. This part of the study is optional. Y ou can still take part in this study even if you 
don't allow us to collect the extra blood or bone marrow samples for research.

(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age) 
A Study of Neuroblastoma (that has spread from where it started) Treatment Comparing One versus Two 
High Dose Chemotherapy Regimens in Consolidation  
 
1. We have been talking with you about neuroblast oma.  Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that 
grows mostly in the nervous system outside the brain. It can also be found anywhere in the body.  
We have done special tests, scans and blood tests on you to find out if you have high-risk 
neuroblastoma.  The tests tell us that you have ne uroblastoma that is hard to treat because it has 
spread from where it started.   
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have the type of neuroblastoma 
that is hard to treat.  A research study is when doc tors work together to try out new ways to help 
people who are sick. In this study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat neuroblastoma.  
We will do this by:

b. giving higher doses of radiation (or x-ray treatments) to children who still have tumor 
after getting induction chemotherapy medicine 
c. giving some children one cycle of high dose chemotherapy and some children two cycles 
of high dose chemotherapy, followed by either on e or two stem cell transplants,  to see if 
this will keep the neuroblastoma from coming back after treatment is stopped in more 
children 
d. studying how your body responds to medicines.  
 We want to see if these things can help more ch ildren can get rid of their neuroblastoma.  We 
don’t know if these approaches will help or not.  That is why we are doing this study.  
 
3.   Children who are part of this study will be  treated with chemotherapy, surgery, radiation 
treatment and stem cell transplant(s). The treatment is given in three phases: Induction, Consolidation and Maintenance.  Chemotherapy is a type of strong medicine that destroys cancer cells. The chemotherapy in this study is very str ong and may make you feel pretty sick at times. 
The doctors will give you medicines to help you wh en you are sick. You will be in the hospital a 
lot to get the chemotherapy.  In the induction phase, you will receive chemotherapy, including the 
new combination, cyclophosphamide and topotecan  and you will also have a procedure(s) called 
a stem cell harvest. You will be connected to a machine that will remove blood from you, take out 
the baby cells (stem cells) that grow up to be normal blood cells, and then give the rest of the 
blood back to you.  During consolidation, you will  get either one or two cycles of very high doses 
of chemotherapy, followed by either one or two st em cell transplants. The last phase of therapy is 
called maintenance. During this phase you will be  taking pills by mouth twice a day for two 
weeks. Then you will have 2 weeks that you do not take the pills. This phase lasts for six months. Throughout the treatment you will have some extra blood draws for special research tests.   
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when  they are in a research study.    These good 
things are called “benefits.”  A benefit of being part of this study may be a chance that your 
cancer will go away for as long as possible. We don’ t know for sure if there is any benefit of 
being part of this study. We expect that the in formation learned from this study will help other 
patients with high-risk neuroblastoma in the future.

Page 123 5.  Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad 
things are called “risks.”  With this trea tment you can have problems, both during and 
after the treatment. The risks to you from this  study involve very low blood counts, possible  
infections and organ damage. You will be give n medicines to help your blood counts recover 
after the treatment, to prevent infection, and to reduce organ damage. There is also a 
chance of the cancer cells growing back. We will check you closely so we can treat the 
problems you may have. Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not.  Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start.  There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor can tell you about.  Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have. 
 
7.  We are asking your permission to collect a dditional blood and bone marrow specimens.  We want 
to see if there are ways to tell how the cancer will respond to treatment. These samples would be 
taken when other standard blood tests are be ing performed, so there would be no extra 
procedures. This part of the study is optional. Y ou can still take part in this study even if you 
don't allow us to collect the extra blood or bone marrow samples for research.

ANBL0532, Phase III Randomized Trial of Single vs. Tandem Myeloablative Consolidation 
Therapy for High-Risk Neuroblastoma 
 PART 1: CONSENT FOR INDUCTION THERAPY  
 
When the word “you” appears in this consent form, it refers to you or your son or daughter; “we” 
means the doctors and other staff.  
WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study.  Your study doctor will explain the clinical trial to 
you.     The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is carrying out this study. COG is an international research group that conducts clinical trials for children with cancer at more than 200 hospitals in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands,  and Switzerland. It is 
common medical practice to treat children with cancer on research studies like this one.  You are being asked to take part in this study because you have high risk neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer.  Neuroblastoma shows up as a lump or mass in the belly or around the spinal cord in the chest, neck, or pelvis. Neuroblastoma is a cancer of nerve cells. It develops in nerve cells that are outside of the br ain.  It often spreads to bone, liver, lymph nodes 
and bone marrow, which is the soft tissue in the center of bones where blood cells are made. You have the type of neuroblastoma that is called High Risk because your tumor has spread from where it started or because your type of tumor is harder to treat.    It is common to enroll children and adolescents with cancer in a clinical trial that seeks to 
improve cancer treatment over time. Clinical tr ials include only people who choose to take part. 
You have a choice between a standard treatment for High Risk neuroblastoma and this clinical 
trial. Please take your time to make your decision about taking part in this clinical trial.  You may discuss your decision with your friends and family.  You can also discuss it with your health care team.  We encourage you to include your child in the discussion and decision to the extent that 
she or he is able to understand and take part.  If you have any questions, you can ask your 
study doctor for more explanation.

WHAT IS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF TREATMENT FOR THIS DISEASE? 
 
The treatment for neuroblastoma includes 3 parts (phases) of therapy called Induction, Consolidation and Maintenance.  During Induction therapy anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy) 
and surgery are used to kill and remove as much tumor as possible.  Blood stem cells are 
collected during the Induction phase of therapy.  After collection the blood stem cells are frozen and stored to be used during Consolidation phase of treatment.  Blood stem cells are the cells that create new blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Blood stem cells can be collected from the blood by using a machine that can separate out the part of blood that has stem cells and then return the remaining blood back to the patient. 
 
During the Consolidation phase of treatment extr emely high doses of chemotherapy are given to 
better kill any remaining neuroblastoma cells. The extremely high doses of chemotherapy destroy healthy bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the hollow of flat bones of the body that produces new blood cells.  The peripheral blood stem cells that were stored during the 
Induction phase of treatment are given back to the patient after the high dose Consolidation 
chemotherapy.  These stems cells allow the bone marro w to return to normal so that new blood 
cells can be made. This type of therapy is called a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant. Once the patient has healed from the effects of high  doses of chemotherapy, radiation therapy is 
given to the first place the tumor was found and to any additional places where the tumor was 
found after Induction therapy.   
 During the third phase of therapy, Maintenance, an oral drug, called cis-retinoic acid (Accutane) is given.  
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
 This study is being done because more than half of the patients with high risk neuroblastoma 
will not be cured of their disease.  The main purpose of this research study is to find out if using 2 cycles of high dose Consolidation chemotherapy, instead of 1 cycle, will decrease the chance that the 
neuroblastoma will grow back after therapy.  This research study will also find out if adding a 
new anti-cancer drug to Induction therapy will decrease the number of patients who have tumor 
present at the end of the Induction phase of therapy.  This research study will also find out if patients whose tumor does not go away with initial therapy will need a higher dose of radiation therapy.  
The treatment will be described in two separate consent forms.  Part 1 will discuss the use of a 
drug added to the standard anti-cancer drugs used in the Induction phase of neuroblastoma treatment.  It will also explain standard blood stem cell collection and surgery.  Part 1 of the consent is being given to you now.  
Your doctor will give you Part 2 (the second consent form) of the study to you after you have 
completed the Induction phase of therapy.  You will not be able to participate in Part 2 of this study if your tumor has grown larger or spread to new areas in your body.  The second consent (Part 2) will discuss the Consolidation and Maintenance phases of therapy.  You do not have to take part in Part 2 of the study.  You can discuss this with your doctor and make that decision after you have finished the Induction therapy.   
  ANBL0532  
Page 133  
Part 1 of this study will collect information about your neuroblastoma and about the effects of 
the first phase of treatment, Induction which lasts about 20 weeks (5 months).   Part 1 of this study will test the addition of the combination of chemotherapy, 
cyclophosphamide/topotecan, to the standard chemotherapy combinations used in the Induction 
phase of treatment for high risk neuroblastoma.  The use of cyclophosphamide and topotecan during induction phase of treatment is experimen tal.  This study is designed to help understand 
whether this new treatment will increase our ab ility to kill or remove your tumor cells.   
 During this part of the study, we will: 
 
 Look at how well high risk neuroblastoma responds to this new Induction therapy. 
 Study how certain genes (genes direct activiti es of cells) affect how you respond to the 
cyclophosphamide and topotecan induction chemotherapy. 
 Study whether your immune system (blood ce lls that help fight infection) can produce 
cells that will find and kill neuroblastoma.   
 Study how topotecan is broken down by your body. 
 Study whether new tests can be used to find small amounts of neuroblastoma cells. 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
About 664 subjects will take part in this st udy. The study will last about 3-4 years.   
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS STUDY? 
 
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study and to check how you are doing during treatment.  These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study.  If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your study doctor.   
 
 Physical exam 
 Blood tests 
 Bone marrow tests 
 Pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential 
prior to treatment 
 Various scans (x-ray tests to determine whether your 
tumor is responding to therapy) 
 Tests of kidney function 
 Tests of lung and heart          
        function 
 Hearing tests 
 Urine Tests

Induction Chemotherapy  
This treatment uses chemotherapy to make the tumor as small as possible, hopefully allowing it 
to be removed.  All patients will begin treatment with the Induction phase of chemotherapy, which is divided into six 3-week cycles. There are three different drug combinations used during 
the six cycles. Cycles 1 and 2 will use the new combination of cyclophosphamide and 
topotecan.  Cycles 3 and 5 use the anti-cancer drugs etoposide and cisplatin.  Cycles 4 and 6 use the anti-cancer drugs vincristine, cy clophosphamide, and doxorubicin and the drugs 
MESNA. MESNA is given to help protect the bladder from potential damaging effects of cyclophosphamide. The drugs used Cycles 3, 4, 5 and 6 are standard drugs used for the treatment of high risk neuroblastoma study. Cycl es of chemotherapy w ill be given approximately 
every 21 days.  An additional drug referred as the myeloid growth factor (eg: filgrastim (G-CSF)) is given after the chemotherapy. It helps start the production of white blood cells (infection fighting cells) and will help your body recover from  treatment. Any myeloid growth factor may be 
given after chemotherapy for induction cycles 1 and 3-6 whereas only filgrastim (G-CSF) (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) has to be specifically given after cycle 2. 
 
Methods for Giving Drugs
 
Your doctor will recommend the placement of a tube, or catheter, into a large vein in the chest 
or neck during a short operation as the standard way to give chemotherapy into a vein. This tube is called a central line.  You will be given medication to help you sleep during this 
procedure and pain medication afterwards to help you stay comfortable. The central line is used 
to give chemotherapy drugs and to take small amounts of blood for testing during treatment. A central line will be used to give chemotherapy even if you do not participate in this study.  The risks associated with central lines will be explained to you by your surgeon.  You will be given a 
separate informed consent form to read and sign prior to having a central line inserted.    
You may also receive one of your medications as an injection under the skin.   
 
Schedule and Methods of Giving Chemotherapy 
A schedule of how and when the drugs will be given during the Induction phase of therapy is 
listed below. 
 
Various methods will be used to give drugs:. 
 
PO - Drug is given by tablet or liquid swallowed through the mouth (PO). IV - Drug is given using a needle or tubing inserted into a vein. It can be given by IV push over several minutes or by infusion over minutes or hours SUBQ - Drug is given by injecting a needle into the tissue just under the skin (SUBQ shot) 
 
Most drugs on this study will be given using a needle or tubing inserted into a vein (IV).

 Stem Cell Harvest 
After the second cycle of Induction is finished, your stem cells will be collected using a procedure called apheresis.  During apheresis, your blood is collected into a machine that filters 
out the stem cells and the filtered blood is returned to your body.  This procedure may need to be done several times to collect enough stem cells for the Consolidation phase of therapy. This procedure will be performed at [local institution]. The stem cells will be frozen and stored until needed for the Consolidation phase of therapy. 
 
The risks of Stem Cell Harvests can be found in Attachment #2.   
 
Surgery 
After the fifth cycle of Induction, you will have surgery to remove as much remaining tumor as 
possible.  The surgeon will talk to you about your surgery and any possible risks involved with 
the surgery.  
 Additional Medicines
 
You may get some extra medications, like antibiotics, to help fight infection.  Other medications may be given to lessen the side effects of chemotherapy.  These medicines are part of standard 
care. 
 
  ANBL0532  
Page 137 Additional optional research studies 
 
We would like to collect additional blood to learn more about how chemotherapy drugs are 
broken down in your body, to see if certain genes ( genes direct the activities of cells) will affect 
whether you experience bad effects after chemotherapy, whether your immune system is able 
to find neuroblastoma tumor cells and to test new methods for finding tumor cells. We will obtain all blood specimens through your central venous catheter.  We will try to collect additional blood when you are already having blood drawn for routine purposes.    
We would like to use any leftover portions of your bone marrow or stem cells that are not 
needed to treat you to carry out special biol ogy research studies to learn more about 
neuroblastoma. These studies will test new methods for finding tumor cells.   Blood tests
 
Before starting treatment, we would like to take additional blood (20 mL = 4 teaspoons) to see if your immune cells can recognize neuroblastoma tumors.   
 
Before starting treatment, we would like to take additional blood (10 ml = 2 tsp) to look at how certain genes (genes direct the activities of cells) may effect whether you have side effects after chemotherapy.  
During Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of Induction therapy we would like to take additional blood (4 ml = 
just less than 1 teaspoon) to study how topotecan is broken down by your body.    Before starting Induction therapy and at the end of Induction therapy, we would like to collect additional blood (4 mL = just less than 1 teaspoon) to test new methods of finding neuroblastoma. 
 
Bone marrow Tests
 
 We would also like to take 5 mL (1 tsp) of extra bone marrow at diagnosis and at the end of induction and to take 0.5 mL (1/10 of a tsp) after Cycle 2 of Induction to study new methods of 
finding tumor cells. This bone marrow will be taken when we are normally taking a sample to 
see how you are responding to therapy.  The extra bone marrow will be shipped to a central lab for storage.    Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Tests
 
We would also like to obtain 1 mL (1/4 tsp) of stem cells that you do not need for your treatment 
to store for future research.  These stem cells will be collected during your standard stem cell 
collection and will be shipped to a central lab for storage.   
You and your physicians will not get the results of these blood, bone marrow and stem cell 
tests.. You will not benefit from allowing us to perf orm these extra studies. We will try to take the 
blood samples when we are already taking blood for standard therapy.  The blood will be taken 
from your central line and will not require extra blood draws.  You can request that we stop 
collecting these specimens at any time during your treatment.  You will continue to get treatment on the study whether or not you allow us to collect these additional samples. 
Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each sentence, 
choose "Yes" or "No" then add your initials and date after your answer.  No matter what you 
decide to do, it will not affect your care.  If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor 
or nurse, or call our research review board at IRB's phone number included in this consent.

 HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY? 
 
The first part of the treatment takes about 5 months.   As long as your tumor doesn't get worse, 
you will be offered the option to continue on Part 2 of this clinical trial once you have completed Induction therapy. You will need to get more therapy for neuroblastoma whether or not you take part in Part 2.   
We will continue to collect some medical information about how you are doing for 10 years after you enter the study. Keeping in touch with you and checking on how your health is every year 
for a while after you complete treatment helps us understand the long-term effects of the study.   Your doctor or the study doctor may decide to take you off this study for the following reasons:   he/she believes that it is your best interest 
 your disease comes back during treatment 
 you had side effects from the treatment that are considered too severe 
  ANBL0532  
Page 139  new information becomes available that shows that another treatment would be better for 
you 
 
You can stop participating at any time. However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, 
we encourage you to talk to the study doctor and your regular doctor first.  
 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY AND HOW ARE THE RISKS DIFFERENT FROM 
TREATMENT?  
Treatment Risks 
All people who get cancer treatment are at risk of  having side effects. In addition to killing tumor 
cells, cancer chemotherapy can damage normal tissue and produce side effects. Side effects 
are usually reversible when the medication is stopped but occasionally persist and cause serious complications. A person can die from these and other complications.  Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. Drugs may be given to prevent or decrease nausea and vomiting. Hair loss is usually temporary but on very rare occasions it may be permanent. Some chemotherapy may lead to sterility.  Sterility is the inability to have children. There is also the possibility that a second cancer may develop years later as a result of the chemotherapy.  The risks of the individual drugs given as standard treatment are listed on the tables in Attachment #1.  Side effects can be increased when 
chemotherapy drugs are combined.  The most common serious side effect from cancer treatment is lowering of the number of blood cells resulting in anemia, increased chance of infection, and bleeding tendency. Low blood 
counts are described in your Family Handbook for Children with Cancer. You will be taught more about caring for your child when his or her blood counts are low.   There is a risk that the treatment plan will not cure the cancer or that the cancer can go away after the treatment and then come back at a later date.   Reproductive risks:
 
Because the drugs and/or radiation therapy in this study can affect a developing fetus (unborn 
baby in the womb), you should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study. Ask about counseling and more information about preventing pregnancy. The administration of chemotherapy described may cause infertility (being less able to produce a viable egg or sperm) or sterility (being unable to produce a viable egg or sperm). We will talk to males who have reached puberty about sperm banking. 
 For Women
: 
The treatment on this study can affect an unborn child. You should not become pregnant or 
breast feed your baby while being treated on this study. If you are sexually active and are at risk of getting pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use an effective method to avoid pregnancy or you must not have sex. The study doctor will talk to you about acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study. You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctor about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor. If you 
  ANBL0532  
Page 140 become pregnant during the research study, pleas e tell the investigator and your doctor 
immediately. 
 
If you are nursing a baby, the drugs used in this research could pass into the breast milk. You 
should not nurse your baby for the whole time you are getting the study medicines. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your 
doctor about the length of time you need to avoid nursing. 
 
For Men : 
The treatment on this study can damage sperm.  You should not father a child while on this 
study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child. If you are sexually active and are at 
risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex. The investigator will talk to you about the acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study. You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctor about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor. If your partner becomes pregnant during the research study, please tell the investigator and your doctor immediately. 
 
 
Risks of Study

Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting Risks  
 
 
Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting  
These procedures are usually safe. Side effects that can occur during PBSC collection include 
nausea, vomiting, fainting or dizziness, seizures, skin rash, hives, flushing (redness and 
warmness of the skin, usually the face), blood lo ss, and infection. Tingling of the lips, muscle 
cramping and, very rarely, changes in the heart rhythm can occur. These can be prevented or 
made milder by giving calcium supplements, either by mouth or IV. Very rarely, (less than 1 in 
1,000 procedures), clotting may occur in the apheresis machine or in a patient and is potentially life-threatening. To reduce the risk of clotting, you will be given a drug called ACD (acid-citrate-
dextrose). This drug may increase the risk of bleeding and may cause temporary tingling of the 
lips and limbs, muscle cramping, seizures, or changes in the heart rhythm.

ANBL0532, Phase III Randomized Trial of Single vs. Tandem Myeloablative Consolidation 
Therapy for High-Risk Neuroblastoma:  
 
PART 2 A: CONSENT FOR PATIENTS RANDOMIZED TO CONSOLIDATION THERAPY  Consolidation and Maintenance Phases of Therapy for High Risk Neuroblastoma 
(Please note that this consent MUST be signed before the patient proceeds for consolidation 
therapy) 
 
When the word “you” appears in this consent form, it refers to you or your son or daughter; “we” means the doctors and other staff.  
WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
 
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study.  Your study doctor will explain the clinical trial to 
you.  The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is carrying out this study. COG is an international research group that conducts clinical trials for children with cancer at more than 200 hospitals in 
the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands,  and Switzerland. It is 
common medical practice to treat children with cancer on research studies like this one. 
 You are being asked to take part in this study because you have high risk neuroblastoma and you have participated in Part 1 of this study. N euroblastoma is a type of cancer.  You have the 
type of neuroblastoma that is called High Risk because your tumor has spread from where it started from or because your type of tumor is harder to treat.    It is common to enroll children and adolescents with cancer in a clinical trial that seeks to improve cancer treatment over time. Clinical tr ials include only people who choose to take part. 
You have a choice between a standard treatment for High Risk neuroblastoma and this clinical trial. Please take your time to make your decision about taking part in this clinical trial.  You may discuss your decision with your friends and family.  You can also discuss it with your health care team.  We encourage you to include your child in the discussion and decision to the extent that 
she or he is able to understand and take part.  If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation.  
 WHAT IS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF TREATMENT FOR THIS DISEASE? 
The treatment for neuroblastoma includes 3 parts (phases) of therapy called Induction, 
Consolidation and Maintenance.  During Induction therapy anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy) 
  ANBL0532  
Page 153 and surgery are used to kill and remove as much tumor as possible.  Blood stem cells are 
collected during the Induction phase of therapy.  After collection the blood stem cells are frozen and stored to be used during Consolidation phase of treatment.  Blood stem cells are the cells 
that create new blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Blood stem 
cells can be collected from the blood by using a machine that can separate out the part of blood that has stem cells and then return the remaining blood back to the patient.  You have already received this part of therapy.  During the Consolidation phase of treatment extr emely high doses of chemotherapy are given to 
better kill any remaining neuroblastoma cells. It is standard therapy to give one cycle of this extremely high dose chemotherapy. The high doses of chemotherapy destroy healthy bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the hollow of flat bones of the body that produces new blood cells.  The peripheral blood stem cells that were stored during the Induction phase of treatment are given back to the patient after the high dose Consolidation chemotherapy.  These 
stems cells allow the bone marrow to return to normal so that new blood cells can be made. This type of therapy is called a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant. Once the patient has healed from the effects of high doses of chemotherapy, radiation therapy is given to the first place the tumor was found and to any additional places where the tumor was found after Induction therapy.   
 
During the third phase of therapy, Maintenance, an oral drug, called cis-retinoic acid (Accutane) is given.  
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
The main goal of this research study is to find out if using 2 cycles of high dose Consolidation chemotherapy, instead of 1 cycle, will decrease the chance that the neuroblastoma will grow back after therapy.   In this study, you will get either 2 cycles of high 
dose Consolidation chemotherapy or 1 cycle of  high dose Consolidation chemotherapy.  It is 
standard to give only one cycle of high dose Consolidation chemotherapy.  Smaller clinical trials have studied the safety of giving 2 cycles of high  dose Consolidation chemotherapy to treat high 
risk neuroblastoma.  We do not know whether using 2 cycles of Consolidation chemotherapy will be better for treatment of high risk neuroblastoma.  
Tandem stem cell transplant for children with neuroblastoma is experimental. 
 
This research study will also find out if patients whose tumor did not disappear with initial induction therapy will need a higher dose of radiation therapy.   
 This study is being done because more than half of the patients with high risk neuroblastoma will not be cured of their disease.    
The treatment is described in two separate consent forms.  You have already read the first 
consent form (Part 1) and completed Part 1 of treatment. We are now presenting Part 2 (the second consent form) of the study. The second consent (Part 2) will discuss the Consolidation and Maintenance phases of therapy.    
 
During this part of the study, we will: 
 Compare the effects, good and/or bad, of using 2 cycles of high dose Consolidation 
chemotherapy with 1 cycle of high dose Consolidation chemotherapy on children with high risk neuroblastoma to find out which is better. 
 Study whether a higher dose of radiation, given only to patients with tumor remaining 
  ANBL0532  
Page 154 after induction therapy, will decrease the chance that tumor will grow back.   
 Study whether your immune system (blood ce lls that help fight infection) can produce 
cells that can recognize and kill neuroblastoma.   
 Study whether new tests can be used to find small amounts of neuroblastoma cells. 
 Study how cis-retinoic acid (Accutane) is  broken down by your body and study whether 
your genes (genes direct activities of cells) effect how you respond to cis-retinoic acid 
therapy. 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
About 664 subjects will take part in this st udy. The study will last about 3-4 years.   
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS STUDY? 
 
Random Assignment  
 If you participate in this part of the study you will be given one of 2 different treatment plans. The treatment plan you get is decided by a proce ss called randomization. Randomization means 
that the treatment is assigned based on chance. It is a lot like flipping a coin, except that it is done by computer to make sure that there are about the same number of people on each treatment plan of the study.  You or your doctor can not choose what treatment you will have.  
 
Treatment Plan
 
The treatment plan involves cancer fighting medicine called chemotherapy plus radiation 
therapy.  The treatment on this part of the clinical trial takes about 9-11 months. It is divided into 2 stages.   The two different treatment plans are the same except for some differences during the Consolidation phase of therapy. The rest of the treatment that is given is standard therapy for 
people with high risk neuroblastoma.   The two treatment arms are as follows: 
 A:  Single Myeloablative Consolidation Therapy 
 B:  Tandem Myeloablative Consolidation Therapy 
 
Myeloablative therapy means that you will receive very high doses of chemotherapy that 
will destroy bone marrow cells. Stem cells are given back after the chemotherapy to 
replace the bone marrow cells that were destroyed.  
 You will receive consolidation treatment after you have finished induction therapy and signed this consent.  
 
Randomization  
 
After you have finished induction therapy and signed this consent, you will be randomized to receive either a single (one cycle) of extrem ely high dose chemotherapy (Single Myeloablative 
Consolidation Therapy) or tandem (two cycles) of extremely high dose chemotherapy (Tandem 
Myeloablative Consolidation Therapy).  
 The rest of the Consolidation therapy and Maintenance therapy will be the same in both groups 
of patients.

Treatment Plan Tables  
 
The following drug therapies compare standard c onsolidation chemotherapy and stem cell 
transplant to the experimental tandem consolidation chemotherapy and transplant.    
 
Various methods will be used to give drugs:.  
PO - Drug is given by tablet or liquid swallowed through the mouth (PO). IV - Drug is given using a needle or tubing inserted into a vein. It can be given by IV push over several minutes or by infusion over minutes or hours SUBQ - Drug is given by injecting a needle into the tissue just under the skin (SUBQ shot) 
 
Most drugs on this study will be given using a needle or tubing inserted into a vein (IV). 
 
Treatment for participants who are on treatment plan A  
 After you finish induction therapy, you will get one cycle of very high dose chemotherapy and a 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The transplant will begin with treatment with very high doses 
of the chemotherapy drugs carboplatin, etopos ide and melphalan. Etoposide and carboplatin 
are given as a continuous infusion for 4 consecutive days. The drug melphalan is given as a daily dose for 3 days. After the high dose chem otherapy treatment, your stored stem cells will 
be given IV (through the central line). These stem cells were collected from you during the 
induction phase of therapy and frozen.  This is called a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.  
You will be given filgrastim (GCSF) starting on t he same day you receive your stem cells and 
continuing until your white blood cells have returned to a safe number, usually about 2 weeks.
 
 
Drug  How the drug will be given Days  
Carboplatin IV over 24 hours -7,-6,-5,-4 
Etoposide IV over 24 hours -7,-6,-5,-4 
Melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes  -7,-6,-5 
Blood Stem Cells IV  0 
Filgrastim (GCSF) SUBQ (or) IV  0-14 
 
Treatment for participants who are on treatment plan B  
 
After completion of induction therapy, you will begin the first of the two cycles of very high dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic st em cell transplant. The first transplant will begin with 
treatment with very high doses of the chemotherapy drugs thiotepa and cyclophosphamide given IV over 6 total days. After the high dose chemotherapy treatment, some of your stored stem cells will be given IV (through the central li ne). These stem cells were previously collected 
from you during the induction phase and frozen.  You will be given filgrastim (GCSF) starting on 
the same day you get your stem cells and you w ill continue to get filgrastim (GCSF) until your 
white blood cells have returned to a safe number, usually about 2 weeks.

  ANBL0532  
Page 157  
Between 6-10 weeks from the start of the first treatment a second cycle of very high dose 
treatment is given. The treatment includes the drugs etoposide and carboplatin, which are given as a continuous infusion for 4 consecutive days. The drug melphalan is also given as a daily dose for 3 days during this treatment. After this second high dose chemotherapy treatment, 
some of your remaining stored stem cells will be given back to you. You will be given the same 
care as the first transplant. You will be given filgrastim (GCSF) starting on the same day you get your stem cells and you will continue to get  filg rastim (GCSF)  until your white blood cells have 
returned to a safe number, usually about 2 weeks.   
Drug  How the drug will be given Days

Blood Stem Cells IV  0 
 Filgrastim (GCSF) SUBQ (or) IV  0-14 
 
 
Radiation Therapy  
 It is standard to give radiation treatment to the area of the main tumor and to areas that still showed signs of active disease at the end of Induction phase of treatment.  Radiation therapy 
will begin after you have gotten better from the immediate side effects of the high doses of 
chemotherapy. If you are randomized to arm B (2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy) you will get radiation therapy after you have recovered from the 2
nd transplant. Radiation therapy 
usually starts about a month after the transplant.  The radiation therapy doctors will discuss this 
with you in more detail. The radiation is given in one short session each day, for a period of about 3- 4 weeks. Radiation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting, and often causes 
the blood counts to drop temporarily, which may r equire treatment with filgrastim (GCSF) or 
transfusions (give you blood). Other risks are discussed below. 
 You will get a higher dose of radiation treatment if x-ray tests performed at the end of Induction therapy still show tumor (a lump).  The higher dose of radiation will only be given to the area 
where tumor is present.  This higher dose of radi ation is experimental.  We are studying whether 
this higher dose of radiation will decrease the risk of tumor growing back.   
 MAINTENANCE PHASE OF THERAPY
 
Maintenance therapy will begin after you have recove red from effects of radiation therapy.  The 
use of an immune therapy that targets neuroblastoma (a medicine called chimeric 14.18 antibody) combined with the prior standard therapy of cis-Retinoic acid (Accutane) has recently been shown to improve survival for children with high risk neuroblastoma.  Chimeric 14.18 antibody is only available to patients with high risk neuroblastoma by enrolling onto another clinical trial.  It is strongly encouraged that you speak with your physician about receiving 
chimeric 14.18 therapy.  If you are not able to get ch14.18 therapy or choose not to get it, then 
you will get cis-Retinoic acid (Accutane) therapy alone.  Cis-Retinoic acid is given by mouth, 
twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by two wee ks without the drug. This cycle will be repeated 6 
times for a total of 6 months of treatment.
 
 
 
Standard Medical Tests  
  ANBL0532  
Page 158 Before treatment on this study begins, and while receiving treatment, you will have a series of 
standard medical tests: 
 
 Physical exam 
 Blood Tests 
 Bone marrow tests 
 Tests of vision and hearing  
 Urine tests  Various scans (x-ray tests to see 
where the tumor is in your body) 
 Tests of kidney function 
 Tests of lung and heart function 
 Hearing tests 
 Dental exams 
 
Research study tests and procedures  
 
The following tests will be done because you are part of this study. These tests are not part of 
standard care.  
Some copies of the scans (x-rays) used to make  the diagnosis of your disease and to see how 
your tumor responded to therapy will be sent to a central review center as part of COG quality 
control.  We would like to collect additional blood to see if certain genes (genes direct the activities of cells) will effect whether you experience bad effe cts after chemotherapy, to see if your immune 
system is able to recognize neuroblastoma tumor cells and to test new methods for finding tumor cells. We will get all blood specimens through your central venous catheter.  We will try to get these additional blood samples when you are already having blood drawn for routine purposes.    
We would like to use any leftover portions of your bone marrow that is not needed to treat you to 
carry out special biology research studies to learn more about neuroblastoma. These studies will test new methods for finding tumor cells.   Blood tests
 
Before starting cis-retinoic acid (Accutane) treatment, we would like to take additional blood (20 
ml = 4 teaspoons) to see if your immune cells can recognize neuroblastoma tumors.   
 After you have received the first 14 days of cis -retinoic acid, we would like to take additional 
blood (5 mL = 1 tsp) to look at how certain genes (genes direct the activities of cells) may affect whether you have side effects. 
 
At the end of Consolidation phase of therapy (after completing radiation therapy) and at the end of Maintenance therapy, we would like to obtain additional blood (2 ml = 1/2 teaspoon) to test new methods of finding neuroblastoma.  Bone marrow tests
 
We would also like to take 0.5 ml (1/10 tsp) of extra bone marrow at the end of Consolidation therapy and at the end of Maintenance therapy to study new methods of finding tumor cells.  This bone marrow will be taken when we are normally taking a sample to see how you are responding to therapy.  The extra bone marrow will be shipped to a central lab for storage.   
  ANBL0532  
Page 159  
You and your physicians will not be given the results of these blood and bone marrow tests. You 
will not benefit from allowing us to perform these extra studies. We will try to take the blood samples when we are already taking blood for standard therapy.  The blood will be taken from your central line and will not require an extra blood draw.  You can ask that we stop collecting 
these specimens at any time during your treatment.  You will continue to get treatment on the 
study whether or not you allow us to collect these additional samples.  Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each sentence, choose "Yes" or "No" then add your initials and date after your answer.  No matter what you 
decide to do, it will not affect your care.  If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor 
or nurse, or call our research review board at IRB's phone number included in this consent.   I agree to the have additional bone marrow obtained for research purposes (to find new ways to detect neuroblastoma).

The Consolidation phase of therapy takes about 2 - 3 months (Arm A) or about 4 - 5 months 
(Arm B).  The Maintenance phase of therapy will last an additional 6 months.   
 
We will continue to collect some medical information about how you are doing for 10 years after 
you enter the study. Keeping in touch with you and checking on how your health is every year 
for a while after you complete treatment helps us understand the long-term effects of the study.   Your doctor or the study doctor may decide to take you off this study for the following reasons:  he/she believes that it is your best interest 
 your disease comes back during treatment 
 you experiences side effects from the treatment that are considered too severe 
  ANBL0532  
Page 160  new information becomes available that shows that another treatment would be better for 
you 
 
You can stop participating at any time. However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, 
we encourage you to talk to the study doctor and your regular doctor first.  
 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY? 
 
Treatment Risks 
All people who have cancer treatment are at risk of having side effects. In addition to killing 
tumor cells, cancer chemotherapy can damage normal tissue and produce side effects. Side 
effects are usually reversible when the medication is stopped but occasionally persist and cause serious complications. A person can die from these and other complications.  Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. Drugs may be given to prevent or decrease nausea and vomiting. Hair loss is usually temporary but on very rare occasions it may be permanent. Some chemotherapy may lead to sterility.  Sterility means that you will not be able to have children. There is also the possibility that a second cancer may develop years later as a result of the chemotherapy.  The risks of the individual drugs given as standard treatment are listed on the tables in Attachment #1. Side effects can be increased 
when chemotherapy drugs are combined.  The most common serious side effect from cancer treatment is lowering of the number of blood cells resulting in anemia, increased chance of infection, and bleeding tendency. Low blood 
counts are described in your Family Handbook for Children with Cancer. The high doses of chemotherapy used during the Consolidation phase of treatment will cause very severe lowering 
of the blood cell numbers.  You will be at risk to develop a life-threatening infection and bleeding 
following the very high doses of chemotherapy. To lim it the risk of infection, your child will 
remain in a special hospital room until blood counts return to safe levels. Your stem cells that were previously collected and stored will be us ed to help your body make new blood cells.   
 It is possible that it will take a very long time for your blood cells to be made.  This can happen if the stem cells were injured in your body even before they were removed or if the stem cells are injured during the collection, freezing or thawing processes.  If this happens, you will have a high chance that you will develop a severe infection and/or bleeding. This is very unlikely to happen, but would almost certainly be fatal.  Even after your body makes blood cells after the transplant, your ability to fight infection will be low for weeks to months after the transplant is complete.  You will be more likely to develop an infection in the months after transplant, especially from viruses. 
 
There is also a small risk of severe organ damage, especially to liver and kidney, with an even smaller risk to the heart and lungs. Though rare, the kidney damage can be severe enough to require dialysis. The liver damage can also be severe, resulting in jaundice and, occasionally, complete failure of the liver to function. This damage may be reversible or irreversible, and if irreversible, the liver failure would be fatal.  
 
There is a chance that the stem cells may contain tumor cells. These cells could result in the tumor coming back.  These problems alone or in combination may be severe enough to be life-threatening. The 
purpose of using stem cells is to decrease the chance that these problems will happen. Your 
  ANBL0532  
Page 161 doctor will also give you antibiotic and blood transfusions to decrease risk for infection or 
bleeding.    
Months or years after treatment other side effects may appear.  
 We know that the chemotherapy drugs cyclophosphamide, melphalan and etoposide 
can cause leukemia.  
 Radiation therapy may cause bone cancers or other kinds of sarcomas.  
 Cyclophosphamide and melphalan will cause damage to the sexual glands. As a 
result, if you are a boy, you will almost certainly not be able to have biologically related children, and, if you are girl, you are likely to need hormones or other 
interventions to have children. 
Reproductive risks: It is unknown what effect(s) these treatments may have on an unborn child. As the drugs 
and/or radiation therapy in this study can affect a developing fetus (unborn baby in the womb), 
you should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study. For this reason, if you 
are of child-bearing age, you will be asked to practice an effective method of birth control 
while participating on this study. The use of Isotretinoin can cause birth defects to 
unborn children if taken during pregnancy. Ask about counseling and more information 
about preventing pregnancy. Having the chemotherapy described may cause infertility (being 
less able to produce a viable egg or sperm) or sterility (being unable to produce a viable egg or 
sperm). We will talk to males who have reached puberty about sperm banking. 
 
For Women
: 
The treatment on this study can affect an unborn child. You should not become pregnant or 
breast feed your baby while being treated on this study. If you are sexually active and are at risk 
of getting pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use an effective method to avoid pregnancy or you must not have sex. The study doctor will talk to you about acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study. You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctor about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor. If you 
become pregnant during the research study, pleas e tell the investigator and your doctor 
immediately. 
 
If you are nursing a baby, the drugs used in this research could pass into the breast milk. You 
should not nurse your baby for the whole time you are getting the study medicines. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your 
doctor about the length of time you need to avoid nursing. 
 
For Men : 
The treatment on this study can damage sperm.  You should not father a child while on this 
study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child. If you are sexually active and are at 
risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex. The investigator will talk to you about the acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study. You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctor about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be 
  ANBL0532  
Page 162 permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions 
about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor. If your partner becomes pregnant during the research study, please tell the investigator and your doctor immediately. 
 
There is a risk that the treatment plan will not cure the cancer or that the cancer can go away 
after the treatment and then come back at a later date.  
 
Risks of Study
 
Tandem transplants are experimental.  We have over 10 years of experience with tandem transplant, but we are still learning about the risks that happen after this type of treatment.  The side effects described above may be increased if you have tandem (2 cycles) of high dose Consolidation chemotherapy.     If you receive the tandem therapy (2 cycles) you will receive an additional cycle of high dose 
Consolidation chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa.  These drugs are often used for 
high dose Consolidation chemotherapy. You will re ceive them together, as the additional cycle 
of high dose Consolidation chemotherapy.   
 
You may get a higher dose of radiation if you still had tumor remaining after finishing the Induction phase of treatment.  For most patients, the area receiving the additional radiation dose 
will be small.  However, it is possible that the use of higher doses of radiation may be more likely to cause the side effects of radiation that are described in Attachment #2.     Please see the attachment at the end of the consent (Attachment #2) for more information 
regarding the risks associated with radiation therapy and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting 
and Reinfusion .  
 
Information may also be found in the COG Family Handbook   For more information about risks and side effects, ask your child’s study doctor. 
 
In addition to the risks described above, there may be unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this study.  Your physician will be checking closely to see if any of these side effects are occurring. Routine 
physical exams and laboratory tests will be done to m onitor the effects of treatment. Side effects 
usually disappear after the treatment is completed.  
 
Treatment on this study may have risks we don't know about.  We may stop this treatment if 
we learn of serious, unexpected risks. We will explain the effects of stopping, and we will offer other treatments.

Risks of Radiation Therapy and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting and Reinfusion  
 
Radiation Therapy Risks  
The risks of radiation therapy depend on the parts of the body being treated. Some possible 
risks are described below, but you should talk to your child’s doctor to see which apply to your 
child. Radiation therapy can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, red or dry skin, low blood counts, 
hair loss (permanent or temporary), jaw pain and swelling, temporary weakness or loss of sensation. Some patients have a week or two of low grade fever and sleepiness can occur six to eight weeks after radiation therapy is done. Da mage to body organs such as the brain, eyes, 
heart, lung, liver, and kidneys can occur. Radiation therapy can also cause abnormal bone growth. There is also a small chance that radiation can cause another type of tumor years later.  
Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting and Reinfusion
 
These procedures are usually safe. Side effects that can occur during PBSC collection include 
nausea, vomiting, fainting or dizziness, seizures, skin rash, hives, flushing (redness and 
warmness of the skin, usually the face), blood lo ss, and infection. Tingling of the lips, muscle 
cramping and, very rarely, changes in the heart rhythm can occur. These can be prevented or 
made milder by giving calcium supplements, either by mouth or IV. Very rarely, (less than 1 in 
1,000 procedures), clotting may occur in the apheresis machine or in a patient and is potentially life-threatening. To reduce the risk of clotting, you will be given a drug called ACD (acid-citrate-
dextrose). This drug may increase the risk of bleeding and may cause temporary tingling of the 
lips and limbs, muscle cramping, seizures, or changes in the heart rhythm.  
 
The risks associated with infusing the cells back into your body include dark urine, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and high blood pressure. All of these are temporary and go away after the infusion is done. As with any procedure, there may be side effects we do not expect.

ANBL0532, Phase III Randomized Trial of Single vs. Tandem Myeloablative Consolidation 
Therapy for High-Risk Neuroblastoma:  
 
PART 2 B: CONSENT FOR PATIENTS TO BE NON-RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO SINGLE 
MYELOABLATIVE CONSOLIDATION THERAPY 
 
Consolidation and Maintenance Phases of Therapy for High Risk Neuroblastoma (Please 
note that this consent MUST be signed before the patient proceeds for consolidation therapy) 
 When the word “you” appears in this consent form, it refers to you or your son or daughter; “we” means the doctors and other staff.  
WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study.  Your study doctor will explain the clinical trial to 
you. 
 The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is carrying out this study. COG is an international research group that conducts clinical trials for children with cancer at more than 200 hospitals in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands,  and Switzerland. It is 
common medical practice to treat children with cancer on research studies like this one. 
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have high risk neuroblastoma and you have participated in Part 1 of this study. N euroblastoma is a type of cancer.  You have the 
type of neuroblastoma that is called High Risk because your tumor has spread from where it started from or because your type of tumor is harder to treat.   
 
It is common to enroll children and adolescents with cancer in a clinical trial that seeks to improve cancer treatment over time. Clinical tr ials include only people who choose to take part. 
You have a choice between a standard treatment for High Risk neuroblastoma and this clinical trial. Please take your time to make your decision about taking part in this clinical trial.  You may 
discuss your decision with your friends and family.  You can also discuss it with your health care 
team.  We encourage you to include your child in the discussion and decision to the extent that 
she or he is able to understand and take part.  If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation.  
 
WHAT IS THE CURRENT STANDARD OF TREATMENT FOR THIS DISEASE? 
The treatment for neuroblastoma includes 3 parts (phases) of therapy called Induction, 
Consolidation and Maintenance. During Induction therapy anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy) 
and surgery are used to kill and remove as much tumor as possible.  Blood stem cells are 
collected during the Induction phase of therapy.  After collection the blood stem cells are frozen 
  ANBL0532  
Page 178 and stored to be used during Consolidation phase of treatment.  Blood stem cells are the cells 
that create new blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Blood stem cells can be collected from the blood by using a machine that can separate out the part of blood 
that has stem cells and then return the remaining blood back to the patient.  You have already 
received this part of therapy.  During the Consolidation phase of treatment extr emely high doses of chemotherapy are given to 
better kill any remaining neuroblastoma cells. It is standard therapy to give one cycle of this extremely high dose chemotherapy. The high doses of chemotherapy destroy healthy bone 
marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the hollow of flat bones of the body that produces new 
blood cells.  The peripheral blood stem cells that were stored during the Induction phase of treatment are given back to the patient after the high dose Consolidation chemotherapy.  These 
stems cells allow the bone marrow to return to normal so that new blood cells can be made. This type of therapy is called a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant. Once the patient has 
healed from the effects of high doses of chemotherapy, radiation therapy is given to the first 
place the tumor was found and to any additional places where the tumor was found after Induction therapy.    During the third phase of therapy, Maintenance, an oral drug, called cis-retinoic acid (Accutane) 
is given. 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
 Most of the patients enrolled on this study have very high risk neuroblastoma.  The main goal of this study applies to them. That goal is to find out if using 2 cycles of high dose Consolidation chemotherapy, instead of 1 cycle, will decrease the chance that the neuroblastoma will grow back after therapy.  However, some types of high risk neuroblastoma have a lower risk of having tumor grow back.  These types of neuroblastoma are described as being in one of two groups.  These groups are: 
 Patients who are between the ages of 12 and 18 months at diagnosis of neuroblastoma.  
Their neuroblastoma tumor has spread to distant sites (stage 4), does not have increased levels of the MYCN gene, but does have other high risk biologic characteristics. 
 Patients who are greater than 18 months of age at diagnosis of neuroblastoma.  Their 
neuroblastoma tumor has spread locally (stage 3), does not have increased levels of the MYCN gene but does have other high risk biologic characteristics. 
 
Very few patients with high risk neuroblastoma (about 5-10%) have these types of 
neuroblastoma.  Previous clinical trials have not always used high dose Consolidation chemotherapy to treat these types of high risk neuroblastoma. We need to learn more about the best way to treat this smaller group.  We want to evaluate how patients in this group respond to 
treatment after 1 cycle of high dose Consolidation therapy.   
 
This research study will also find out if patients whose tumor did not disappear with initial 
induction therapy will need a higher dose of radiation therapy.    The treatment is described in two separate consent forms.  You have already read the first 
consent form (Part 1) and completed Part 1 of treatment. We are now presenting Part 2 (the 
second consent form) of the study. The second consent (Part 2) will discuss the Consolidation and Maintenance phases of therapy.    
 
  ANBL0532  
Page 179 During this part of the study, we will: 
 Find out if patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have a lower risk of the tumor 
coming back can be treated with 1 cycle of  high dose Consolidation chemotherapy. 
 Study whether a higher dose of radiation, given only to patients with tumor remaining 
after induction therapy, will decrease the chance that tumor will grow back.   
 Study whether your immune system (blood ce lls that help fight infection) can produce 
cells that can recognize and kill neuroblastoma.   
 Study whether new tests can be used to find small amounts of neuroblastoma cells. 
 Study how cis-retinoic acid (Accutane) is broken down by your body and study 
whether your genes (genes direct activities of cells) effect how you respond to cis-
retinoic acid therapy. 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY? 
About 664 subjects will take part in this st udy. The study will last about 3-4 years.   
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS STUDY? 
If you participate in this part of the study you will be given the following treatment plan.  
 
Treatment Plan  
The treatment plan involves cancer fighting medicine called chemotherapy plus radiation 
therapy.  The treatment on this part of the clinical trial takes about 9 months.  
 Myeloablative therapy means that you will receive very high doses of chemotherapy that 
will destroy normal bone marrow cells.  
 You will receive consolidation treatment after you have finished induction therapy and signed this consent.

Treatment Plan Tables  
The following drug therapies will be used for Single Myeloablative Consolidation.    
 Various methods will be used to give drugs:
  
PO - Drug is given by tablet or liquid swallowed through the mouth (PO). IV - Drug is given using a needle or tubing inserted into a vein. It can be given by IV push over several minutes or by infusion over minutes or hours SUBQ - Drug is given by injecting a needle into the tissue just under the skin (SUBQ shot)  Most drugs on this study will be given using a needle or tubing inserted into a vein (IV). 
 
Treatment  
 After you finish induction therapy, you will get one cycle of very high dose chemotherapy and a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The transplant will begin with treatment with very high doses of the chemotherapy drugs carboplatin, etopos ide and melphalan. Etoposide and carboplatin 
are given as a continuous infusion for 4 consecutive days. The drug melphalan is given as a daily dose for 3 days. After the high dose chem otherapy treatment, your stored stem cells will 
be given IV (through the central line). These stem cells were collected from you during the induction phase of therapy and frozen.  This is called a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.  
You will be given filgrastim (GCSF) starting on t he same day you receive your stem cells and 
continuing until your white blood cells have returned to a safe number, usually about 2 weeks.

Melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes  -7,-6,-5 
Blood Stem Cells IV  0 
Filgrastim (GCSF) SUBQ (or) IV  0-14 
 
Radiation Therapy  
It is standard to give radiation treatment to the area of the main tumor and to areas that still showed signs of active disease at the end of Induction phase of treatment.  Radiation therapy will begin after you have gotten better from the immediate side effects of the high doses of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy usually starts  about a month after the transplant.  The 
radiation therapy doctors will discuss this with you in more detail. The radiation is given in one 
short session each day, for a period of up to 3 weeks. Radiation to the stomach may cause 
nausea and vomiting, and often causes the blood counts to drop temporarily, which may require treatment with filgrastim (GCSF) or transfusi ons (give you blood). Other risks are discussed 
below.  
You will get a higher dose of radiation treatment if x-ray tests performed at the end of Induction 
therapy still show tumor (a lump).  The higher dose of radiation will only be given to the area where tumor is present.  This higher dose of radi ation is experimental.  We are studying whether 
this higher dose of radiation will decrease the risk of tumor growing back.   
  ANBL0532  
Page 182 MAINTENANCE PHASE OF THERAPY  
Maintenance therapy will begin after you have recove red from effects of radiation therapy.  The 
use of an immune therapy that targets neuroblastoma (a medicine called chimeric 14.18 
antibody) combined with the prior standard therapy of cis-Retinoic acid (Accutane) has recently 
been shown to improve survival for children with high risk neuroblastoma.  Chimeric 14.18 antibody is only available to patients with high risk neuroblastoma by enrolling onto another clinical trial.  It is strongly encouraged that you speak with your physician about receiving 
chimeric 14.18 therapy.  If you are not able to get ch14.18 therapy or choose not to get it, then you will get cis-Retinoic acid (Accutane) therapy alone.  Cis-Retinoic acid is given by mouth, 
twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by two wee ks without the drug. This cycle will be repeated 6 
times for a total of 6 months of treatment.
 
 
 Standard Medical Tests
 
Before treatment on this study begins, and while receiving treatment, you will have a series of 
standard medical tests: 
 Physical exam 
 Blood Tests 
 Bone marrow tests 
 Tests of vision and hearing  
 Urine tests  Various scans (x-ray tests to see 
where the tumor is in your body) 
 Tests of kidney function 
 Tests of lung and heart function 
 Hearing tests 
 Dental exams 
 
Research study tests and procedures  
The following tests will be done because you are part of this study. These tests are not part of 
standard care.  
Some copies of the scans (x-rays) used to make  the diagnosis of your disease and to see how 
your tumor responded to therapy will be sent to a central review center as part of COG quality 
control.  We would like to collect additional blood to see if certain genes (genes direct the activities of cells) will effect whether you experience bad effe cts after chemotherapy, to see if your immune 
system is able to recognize neuroblastoma tumor cells and to test new methods for finding tumor cells. We will get all blood specimens through your central venous catheter.  We will try to get these additional blood samples when you are already having blood drawn for routine purposes.    
We would like to use any leftover portions of your bone marrow that is not needed to treat you to 
carry out special biology research studies to learn more about neuroblastoma. These studies will test new methods for finding tumor cells.   Blood tests
 
Before starting cis-retinoic acid (Accutane) treatment, we would like to take additional blood (20 
ml = 4 teaspoons) to see if your immune cells can recognize neuroblastoma tumors.   
 After you have received the first 14 days of cis -retinoic acid, we would like to take additional 
blood (5 mL = 1 tsp) to look at how certain genes (genes direct the activities of cells) may affect whether you have side effects. 
 
  ANBL0532  
Page 183 At the end of Consolidation phase of therapy (after completing radiation therapy) and at the end 
of Maintenance therapy, we would like to obtain additional blood (2 ml = 1/2 teaspoon) to test new methods of finding neuroblastoma. 
 
Bone marrow tests
 
We would also like to take 0.5 ml (1/10 tsp) of extra bone marrow at the end of Consolidation therapy and at the end of Maintenance therapy to study new methods of finding tumor cells.  This bone marrow will be taken when we are normally taking a sample to see how you are responding to therapy.  The extra bone marrow will be shipped to a central lab for storage.   
 
 
 
 
You and your physicians will not be given the results of these blood and bone marrow tests. You 
will not benefit from allowing us to perform these extra studies. We will try to take the blood samples when we are already taking blood for standard therapy.  The blood will be taken from 
your central line and will not require an extra blood draw.  You can ask that we stop collecting 
these specimens at any time during your treatment.  You will continue to get treatment on the study whether or not you allow us to collect these additional samples.  Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each sentence, choose "Yes" or "No" then add your initials and date after your answer.  No matter what you 
decide to do, it will not affect your care.  If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor 
or nurse, or call our research review board at IRB's phone number included in this consent.  I agree to the have additional bone marrow obtained for research purposes (to find new ways to detect neuroblastoma).

HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY? 
 
  ANBL0532  
Page 184 The Consolidation phase of therapy takes about 2 - 3 months.  The Maintenance phase of 
therapy will last an additional 6 months.    
We will continue to collect some medical information about how you are doing for 10 years after you enter the study. Keeping in touch with you and checking on how your health is every year 
for a while after you complete treatment helps us understand the long-term effects of the study.    Your doctor or the study doctor may decide to take you off this study for the following reasons:  he/she believes that it is your best interest 
 your disease comes back during treatment 
 you experiences side effects from the treatment that are considered too severe 
 new information becomes available that shows that another treatment would be better for 
you 
 You can stop participating at any time. However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, 
we encourage you to talk to the study doctor and your regular doctor first.  
 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
Treatment Risks 
All people who have cancer treatment are at risk of having side effects. In addition to killing 
tumor cells, cancer chemotherapy can damage normal tissue and produce side effects. Side effects are usually reversible when the medication is stopped but occasionally persist and cause serious complications. A person can die from these and other complications.  Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and fatigue. Drugs may be given to prevent or decrease nausea and vomiting. Hair loss is usually temporary but on very rare occasions it may be permanent. Some chemotherapy may lead to sterility.  Sterility means that you will not be able to have children. There is also the possibility that a second cancer may develop years later as a result of the chemotherapy.  The risks of the individual drugs given as standard treatment are listed on the tables in Attachment #1. Side effects can be increased 
when chemotherapy drugs are combined.  The most common serious side effect from cancer treatment is lowering of the number of blood cells resulting in anemia, increased chance of infection, and bleeding tendency. Low blood 
counts are described in your Family Handbook for Children with Cancer. The high doses of chemotherapy used during the Consolidation phase of treatment will cause very severe lowering 
of the blood cell numbers.  You will be at risk to develop a life-threatening infection and bleeding 
following the very high doses of chemotherapy. To lim it the risk of infection, your child will 
remain in a special hospital room until blood counts return to safe levels. Your stem cells that were previously collected and stored will be us ed to help your body make new blood cells.   
 It is possible that it will take a very long time for your blood cells to be made.  This can happen if the stem cells were injured in your body even before they were removed or if the stem cells are injured during the collection, freezing or thawing processes.  If this happens, you will have a high chance that you will develop a severe infection and/or bleeding. This is very unlikely to happen, but would almost certainly be fatal.  Even after your body makes blood cells after the transplant, your ability to fight infection will be low for weeks to months after the transplant is complete.  You will be more likely to develop an infection in the months after transplant, especially from viruses. 
 
  ANBL0532  
Page 185 There is also a small risk of severe organ damage, especially to liver and kidney, with an even 
smaller risk to the heart and lungs. Though rare, the kidney damage can be severe enough to require dialysis. The liver damage can also be severe, resulting in jaundice and, occasionally, 
complete failure of the liver to function. This damage may be reversible or irreversible, and if 
irreversible, the liver failure would be fatal.   There is a chance that the stem cells may contain tumor cells. These cells could result in the tumor coming back.  
These problems alone or in combination may be severe enough to be life-threatening. The 
purpose of using stem cells is to decrease the chance that these problems will happen. Your doctor will also give you antibiotic and blood transfusions to decrease risk for infection or bleeding.   
 
 Months or years after treatment other side effects may appear.  
 We know that the chemotherapy drugs cyclophosphamide, melphalan and etoposide 
can cause leukemia.  
 Radiation therapy may cause bone cancers or other kinds of sarcomas.  
 Cyclophosphamide and melphalan will cause damage to the sexual glands. As a 
result, if you are a boy, you will almost certainly not be able to have biologically 
related children, and, if you are girl, you are likely to need hormones or other interventions to have children.
 
 Reproductive risks:
 
It is unknown what effect(s) these treatments may have on an unborn child. As the drugs 
and/or radiation therapy in this study can affect a developing fetus (unborn baby in the womb), you should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study. For this reason, if you 
are of child-bearing age, you will be asked to practice an effective method of birth control while participating on this study. The use of Isotretinoin can cause birth defects to unborn children if taken during pregnancy. 
 
Ask about counseling and more information about preventing pregnancy. Having the chemotherapy described may cause infertility (being less able to produce a viable egg or sperm) or sterility (being unable to produce a viable egg or sperm). We will talk to males who have reached puberty about sperm banking.  
For Women
: 
The treatment on this study can affect an unborn child. You should not become pregnant or 
breast feed your baby while being treated on this study. If you are sexually active and are at risk of getting pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use an effective method to avoid pregnancy or you must not have sex. The study doctor will talk to you about acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study. You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctor about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor. If you 
become pregnant during the research study, pleas e tell the investigator and your doctor 
immediately. 
 
  ANBL0532  
Page 186 If you are nursing a baby, the drugs used in this research could pass into the breast milk. You 
should not nurse your baby for the whole time you are getting the study medicines. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your 
doctor about the length of time you need to avoid nursing. 
 
For Men : 
The treatment on this study can damage sperm.  You should not father a child while on this 
study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child. If you are sexually active and are at 
risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex. The investigator will talk to you about the acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study. You will have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctor about the length of time you need to avoid pregnancy or abstain.   Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor. If your partner becomes 
pregnant during the research study, please tell the investigator and your doctor immediately. 
 
There is a risk that the treatment plan will not cure the cancer or that the cancer can go away 
after the treatment and then come back at a later date.  
 
Risks of Study
 
The side effects of high dose chemotherapy are more severe than the side effects of standard doses of chemotherapy. 
 
You may get a higher dose of radiation if you still had tumor remaining after finishing the Induction phase of treatment.  For most patients, the area receiving the additional radiation dose will be small.  However, it is possible that the use of higher doses of radiation may be more likely to cause the side effects of radiation that are described in Attachment #2.    
 
Please see the attachment at the end of the consent (Attachment #2) for more information regarding the risks associated with radiation therapy and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting 
and Reinfusion .  
 
Information may also be found in the COG Family Handbook  
 For more information about risks and side effects, ask your child’s study doctor.  In addition to the risks described above, there may be unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this study. 
 
Your physician will be checking closely to see if any of these side effects are occurring. Routine physical exams and laboratory tests will be done to m onitor the effects of treatment. Side effects 
usually disappear after the treatment is completed.  
 
Treatment on this study may have risks we don't know about.  We may stop this treatment if 
we learn of serious, unexpected risks. We will explain the effects of stopping, and we will offer 
other treatments. 
  ANBL0532  
Page 187 ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY? 
 
This experimental treatment may have benefits. This experimental treatment may turn out to be 
better at treating neuroblastoma than treatments we have used in the past. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee. We may find out that this treatment is not better.  It is hoped that the information learned from this study may help future patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. 
 
 
 
 
WHAT OTHER OPTI ONS ARE THERE? 
Instead of being in this study, you have these options: 
 Current standard therapy even if you do not take part in the study.  
 Other stem cell transplant therapies.  
 More treatment with standard doses of chemotherapy  
 No further chemotherapy but just radiation therapy and cis-retinoinc acid therapy. 
 No further therapy.   
 
You are encouraged to discuss these options with your regular doctor as well as other trusted 
personal and family advisors.  
WHAT ABOUT CONF IDENTIALITY? 
 
Efforts will be made to keep your personal information confidential. We cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. Your personal information may be disclosed if required by law.  The Children’s Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal 
government, which will help us protect the privac y of our research subjects. Information about 
the certificate is attached at end of this consent. 
 
Organizations that may inspect and/or copy your research records for quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as:  
 The Children's Oncology Group 
 Representatives of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Food and Drug Administration

Risks of Radiation Therapy and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting and Reinfusion  
 
Radiation Therapy Risks  
The risks of radiation therapy depend on the parts of the body being treated. Some possible risks are described below, but you should talk to your child’s doctor to see which apply to your 
child. Radiation therapy can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, red or dry skin, low blood counts, hair loss (permanent or temporary), jaw pain and swelling, temporary weakness or loss of sensation. Some patients have a week or two of low grade fever and sleepiness can occur six to eight weeks after radiation therapy is done. Da mage to body organs such as the brain, eyes, 
heart, lung, liver, and kidneys can occur. Radiation therapy can also cause abnormal bone growth. There is also a small chance that radiation can cause another type of tumor years later.  
Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting and Reinfusion
 
These procedures are usually safe. Side effects that can occur during PBSC collection include 
nausea, vomiting, fainting or dizziness, seizures, skin rash, hives, flushing (redness and 
warmness of the skin, usually the face), blood lo ss, and infection. Tingling of the lips, muscle 
cramping and, very rarely, changes in the heart rhythm can occur. These can be prevented or made milder by giving calcium supplements, either by mouth or IV. Very rarely, (less than 1 in 
1,000 procedures), clotting may occur in the apheresis machine or in a patient and is potentially 
life-threatening. To reduce the risk of clotting, you will be given a drug called ACD (acid-citrate-
dextrose). This drug may increase the risk of bleeding and may cause temporary tingling of the lips and limbs, muscle cramping, seizures, or changes in the heart rhythm.  
 
The risks associated with infusing the cells back into your body include dark urine, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and high blood pressure. All of these are temporary and go away after the infusion is done. As with any procedure, there may be side effects we do not expect.

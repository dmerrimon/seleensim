  1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL E 
 
1.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  
 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in both men and women in the United States.
1 Over 200,000 patients are diagnosed with lung cancer every year in the 
United States. More than 80% of these patients have non- small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) 
and over half of them present with advanced stage disease at the time of diagnosis.  Platinum based chemotherapy remains the mainstay of first line treatment for patients with advanced stage NS CLC. In a prospective randomized study that compared four commonly used 
platinum -based chemotherapy regimens for patients with stage IIIB or stage IV disease: 
cisplatin plus paclitaxel, cisplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus docetaxel, and carboplatin plus paclitaxel, no regimen was found to have a significantly better response rate or survival time.
2 The response rate for all 1,158 of the eligible patients was 19%, and the median 
survival time was 7.9 months (95% CI, 7.3- 8.5 months). The results from this study indicate 
that the combination of platinum with third generation chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, gemcitabine) has limited benefit in the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC.   Unfortunately treatment benefit from 1
st line cytotoxic chemotherapy 
is usually short lived with a median time to progression of 3 to 5 months. Standard second 
line treatment options are few, limited to docetaxel, pemetrexed, and erlotinib for patien ts 
with good performance status . 3-5 Therefore it is essential to develop effective treatment 
options for patients with relapsed/refractory NSCLC. Many patients with 
relapsed/refractory NSCLC also have marginal  performance status and it is important to 
develop therapies that are tolerable.  
 
1.2 Angiogenesis  
 Angiogenesis, an essential step for tumor growth and progression is defined as the growth of new blood vessels from existing vasculature.
6 Due to its critical role in several tumors 
including NSCLC, its inhibition represents a rational therapeutic strategy. VEG F is key 
ligand and regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis, including from tumors, with the signaling occurring mostly through VEGFR2 .
7 The two main mechanisms 
of VEGF inhibition are the use of monoclonal antibodies against circulating VEGF and 
small molecules that inhibit its tyrosine kinase activity. Several VEGFR TKIs have been 
tested as single agents in patients with NSCLC, and it is not surprising that the response rates to these drugs in molecularly unselected patients have been disappointing.
8-10 Sunitinib 
is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of VEGFR and PDGFR . The phase II  study of 
sunitinib in  47 previously treated NSCLC patients showed potential  therapeutic benefit 
(median progression- free survival (PFS) 11.9 weeks) , and one patient had a confirmed 
partial response.8  
 Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against circulating VEGF  was the first 
antiangiogenic drug to be approved for NSCLC, with its use restricted to patient with non-squamous histology due to the increased risk of life -threatening bleeding in squamous cell 
carcinoma.
11 Two randomized clinical trials, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
4599 and Avastin in Lung (AVAiL), comparing chemotherapy alone or with bevacizumab, 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 9 of 57 
  showed improved response rate and progression -free survival (PFS) for the combination 
therapy.
12,13 However, only the ECOG 4599 study showed a survival benefit. VEGFR  
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) compete with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the active site of the kinase domain. Due to the well -conserved ATP binding site of the kinases, most 
VEGFR TKIs inhibit multiple receptors including PDGFR .
14,15 Additionally, recently 
published research shows that expression of VEGF -A correlated with mutations in TP53, 
suggesting that TP53 mutational status may also play a role in response to antiangiogenic therapies.  
16,17 
 PDGF  promotes tumor cell proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis.
18 The 
PDGF  pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis through its effects on pericytes and 
vascular smooth muscle cells, which in turn secrete VEGF.19 This signaling cooperation 
could be explored with a dual inhibitor. One of the major obstacles for further development of anti -angiogenesis inhibitors is the lack of reliable predictors for response. We believe that 
with the use of a potent single agent T KI against VEGFR and PDGFR  in a molecularly 
selected patient population may lead to a significant benefit in some patients and further 
evaluation of responders with a comprehensive molecular profile both at diagnosis and at 
progression, may provide valuable information predictors f or response and mechanisms of 
resistance.  
 1.3 Nintedanib (BIBF1120)  
 Nintedanib is a TKI of VEGFR1 -3, PDGFR -A, PDGFR- B, and FGFR1 -3.
20 In the phase I 
monotherapy study, nintedanib was well tolerated with dose limiting toxicities  of elevated 
AST, ALT, and GGT. Other toxicities included nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
and fatigue.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined at 200 mg bid. When 
nintedanib (at 200mg bid) was used in combination with chemotherapy (FOLFOX, 
pemetrexed, docetaxel, and paclitaxel/carboplatin) it showed no added safety concerns. This 
led to two separate ph ase III studies in patients with NSCLC in the 2nd line setting comparing 
chemotherapy alone to chemotherapy in combination with nintedanib. Both studies met 
their primary endpoint of PFS with no unexpected toxicities. 21 
 
1.3.1 Preclinical D evelopment and P harmacokinetics  
 
Nintedanib (BIBF1120) is a potent, orally available triple kinase inhibitor 
targeting VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and FGFRs.  
 Nintedanib inhibits the signalling cascade mediating angiogenesis by binding to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of the receptor kinase domain, 
thus interfering with cross -activation via auto -phosphorylation of the receptor 
homodimers. 
 The specific and simultaneous abrogation of these pathways results in effective growth inhibition of both endothelial and, via PDGF - and FGF -receptors of 
perivascular cells which may be more effective than inhibition of endothelial cell 
growth via the VEGF  pathway alone. Furthermore, signalling by FGF -receptors 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 10 of 57 
  has been identified as a possible escape mechanism for tumour angiogenesis 
when the VEGF pathway is disrupted.  
 Besides inhibition of neo- angiogenesis, it may alter tumour maintenance by 
inducing apoptosis of tumour blood vessel endothelial cells. Inhibition of receptor kinases may also interfere with autocrine and paracrine stimulation of tumour 
angiogenesis via ac tivation loops involving VEGF, PDGF, and bFGF utilized by 
vascular and perivascular cells such as pericytes and vascular smooth muscle 
cells.  
 In addition, preclinical models show that nintedanib (BIBF1120) may have a 
direct anti -tumour effect on those malignant cells which overexpress PDGFR 
and/or FGFR (e.g. H1703 NSCLC cells).  
 IC50  (nmol/L)  
VEGFR (1 / 2 / 3)  34 / 21 / 13  
PDGFR (α / β)  59 / 65  
FGFR (1 / 2 / 3)  69 / 37 / 108  
Flt-3 26 
RET  35 
Src, Lck, Lyn  156 / 16 / 195  
 
In vitro, the target receptors are all inhibited by nintedanib in low nanomolar concentrations. In in vivo nude mouse models, nintedanib showed good anti -
tumour efficacy at doses of 50 – 100 mg/kg, leading to a substantial delay of 
tumour growth or even complete tumour -stasis in xenografts of a broad range of 
differing human tumour types. Histological examination of treated tumours showed a marked reduction of tumour vessel density by approximately 80% .
20 
 The metabolism of nintedanib (BIBF1120) was predominantly characterized by 
the ester cleavage of the methyl ester moiety yielding BIBF 1202, which was 
further metabolized by conjugation to glucuronic acid yielding the 1- O-
acylglucuronide.  Data collected i n this study show that nintedanib (BIBF1120) 
has a favorable PK and excretion profile with almost no elimination via the urine, only 0.7% of total [14C] radioactivity was eliminated via the urine.
21 The 
metabolic characteristics are predominantly independent of cytochrome P450-
catalysed metabolic pathways.22 
 
A soft gelatine capsule formulation of nintedanib is used in man. After oral administration, nintedanib is absorbed quickly. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) generally occur 2 to 4 hours after administration. So far, no evidence for a deviation from dose proportionality of the PK of nintedanib has been observed. Steady state is reached latest after one week of dosing. The terminal half -life of 
nintedanib is in the range of 7 to 19 h. Nintedanib is mainly eliminated via faeces.
22  
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 11 of 57 
   
Nintedanib (BIBF1120) is non- mutagenic, even at high doses.  
 
Two exploratory studies in rats revealed a teratogenic effect of nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) with a steep dose/effect relationship and an early onset of 
embryofetal deaths at low dosages. This effect was observed at dose levels 
resulting in plasma drug concentra tions comparable to or below those in humans. 
Because the concentration of nintedanib (BIBF1120) in semen is unknown, males 
receiving nintedanib (BIBF1120) and having sexual intercourse with females of 
childbearing potential should use latex condoms. Women of childbearing 
potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during and at least 3 
months after the last dose of nintedanib.  
 1.3.2 Clinical D evelopment of Nintedanib  
 
Nintedanib is being evaluated in several cancers. Additionally, nintedanib is in 
advanced phase III for the non- cancer indication idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
(IPF). As of 15 Feb 2013, 3556 cancer patients, over 1000 patients with IPF, and 
140 healthy vol unteers had been treated with nintedanib or nintedanib matching 
placebo, in monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.  
 
Phase I  
Phase I dose selection studies revealed that nintedanib (BIBF1120) is generally 
well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse effects such as gastrointestinal 
symptoms (nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and reversible 
elevations of liver enzymes. Initial signs of clinical activity including an 
encouraging rate of patients with stabilisation of their tumour of 54% and 68%, respectively, have been observed in patients with various solid tumours .
23 
 
Based on the Phase I dose escalation trials with nintedanib (BIBF1120) monotherapy, the maximum tolerated dose was defined to be 250 mg for twice daily dosing in Caucasians and 200 mg twice daily in Japanese patients with a manageable safety profile in adv anced cancer patients. Based on the overall 
safety profile, the RP2D for nintedanib as monotherapy is 200 mg bid  
 
The maximum tolerated dose for combination therapy of nintedanib (BIBF1120) 
in combination with pemetrexed, docetaxel, paclitaxel/carboplatin and FOLFOX is 200mg bid. Combination of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with other anti -cancer 
drugs revealed a similar adve rse event profile as compared to nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) monotherapy except for the chemotherapy related toxicities. There 
was no change of the pharmacokinetic parameters of nintedanib (BIBF1120) or 
of the cytotoxic compounds due to the combined treatment. D ose limiting toxicity 
consisted mostly of liver transaminase elevations as in the monotherapy phase I trials with the exception of the combination of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with 
pemetrexed, where fatigue was the most relevant dose limiting toxicity.  
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 12 of 57 
  Available pharmacokinetic data indicate that the systemic exposure needed for 
biological activity can be achieved starting with doses of 100 mg nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) once daily.  
 
The predominant adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain and fatigue of mostly low to moderate severity. Dose limiting toxicities 
(DLT) were mainly confined to reversible hepatic enzyme elevations (AST, ALT, 
γ-GT) which increased dos e-dependently. Most cases occurring at doses of 250 
mg and above, and a very low incidence at doses below 200 mg and were 
reversible after discontinuation of nintedanib treatment. All adverse events 
observed after single administration of single doses of nintedanib to healthy 
volunteers were only of CTCAE grade 1 severity and fully reversible.
22 
 
NSCLC In a phase II trial in NSCLC patients the safety profile of nintedanib (BIBF1120) 
observed in phase I trials could be confirmed. Most commonly reported drug-
related AEs were nausea (57.5%), diarrhoea (47.9%), vomiting (42.5%), anorexia (28.8%), abdominal pain (13.7%) and reversible alanine transaminase (13.7%) and aspartate aminotransferase elevations (9.6%) In conclusion it was generally 
well tolerated and displayed single agent activity in advanced or recurrent 
NSCLC patients. Median overall survival (OS) was 21.9 weeks. Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0–1 patients (n = 56) had a median PFS of 11.6 weeks and a median OS of 37.7 weeks. Tumour stabilisation was achieved in 46% of patients (ECOG 0–1 patients: 59%), with one confi rmed partial 
response (250 mg bid.).
24  
 LUME -Lung 1 was an international, randomized, double -blind, phase III trial 
assessing the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus nintedanib as second line therapy for non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  In total, 1314 patients with 
Stage IIIB/IV or recurre nt NSCLC (all histologies) who had progressed after 1st 
line chemotherapy were randomized in 1:1 fashion to either receive Nintedanib 200mg BID + Docetaxel (n=655) or Placebo BID + Docetaxel (n=659).  
 LUME -Lung 1 met its primary endpoint by showing a statistically significant 
improvement of PFS for all patients regardless of histology (median PFS 3.4 versus 2.7 months; HR 0.79, p=0.0019) for Nintedanib in combination with docetaxel.  
 A significant improvement in OS was demonstrated in patients with adenocarcinoma (HR 0.83, p=0.0359, median 10.3 to 12.6 months).    Patients with a poor prognosis defined as time since start of 1st line therapy <9 months also experienced significant OS improvement from the addition of nintedanib to docetaxel (HR 0.75, p=0.0073, median OS 7.9 to 10.9 months).  The predominant adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 13 of 57 
  pain and fatigue of mostly low to moderate intensity after monotherapy with 
nintedanib (BIBF1120). Dose limiting toxicities were dose dependent hepatic 
enzyme elevations that were reversible after discontinuation of nintedanib (BIBF1120) treatment. These l iver enzyme elevations were only in few cases 
accompanied by a simultaneous increase of bilirubin. In general common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE version 3, grade three liver 
enzyme increases were reported in the dose groups of 250 mg twice daily or 
higher. They also were reversible and usually occurred within the first two months of treatment.  
 
Hypertension or thromboembolic events were rare and did not suggest an 
increased frequency as a consequence of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120).
21 
 
LUME -Lung 2 was a similar randomised, double -blind, phase III study of 
nintedanib plus pemetrexed versus placebo plus pemetrexed in patients with advanced non- squamous non- small cell lung cancer after failure of first line 
chemotherapy.  
 Based on a preplanned futility analysis of investigator -assessed PFS, enrolment 
was halted after 713/1300 planned patients had been enrolled.  The analysis (based on conditional power for PFS by investigator assessment) suggested that the study was futile and that the primary endpoint of centrally assessed PFS would likely not be met. The futility analysis was based on conditional power; there was no formal testing of null hypothesis as planned for primary analysis no safety issues were identified.  
 Even though the study was stopped prematurely, the primary endpoint of this Phase III trial was met; treatment with nintedanib plus pemetrexed resulted in a significant prolongation of centrally reviewed PFS compared with placebo plus pemetrexed (median PF S 4.4 vs. 3.6 months with a HR 0.83; p=0.0435).  The 
disease control rate was also increased significantly in nintedanib- treated 
patients. There was no improvement in OS in nintedanib- treated patients. 
Nintedanib 200 mg bid in combination with pemetrexed h ad an acceptable and 
manageable safety profile, with no new or unexpected safety findings. The most 
frequent AEs were reversible increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal 
events.
25 
 Ovarian Cancer  
A randomised phase II maintenance trial in ovarian cancer in which the efficacy and safety of nine months of continuous twice daily doses of nintedanib (BIBF1120) following chemotherapy was investigated, has identified the potential activity of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with a 36- week PFS of 16.3 % 
compared to 5.0 % in the control group. The safety profile was consistent with findings previously reported for nintedanib (BIBF1120) administered as monotherapy as mentioned above.
26   
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 14 of 57 
  Nintedanib was evaluated in a Phase III randomized, placebo‐ controlled, double ‐
blind, multicentre ovarian study with 1366 patients.  Patients received nintedanib 
plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin for six 
cycles. This was followed by monotherapy nintedanib or placebo for up to 120 weeks. The tr ial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically 
significant improvement in progression- free survival (HR 0.84; 95%CI 0.72 -  
0.98; p=0.0239, median PFS 17.3 months for nintedanib and 16.6 months for 
placebo). Overall survival data are immature but currently show no trend in either 
direction. Main adverse events were GI side effects and increased hematological toxicity .

 Colorectal Cancer  
A Phase I/II, open- label, randomised study of nintedanib plus mFOLFOX6 
compared to bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 in 120 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was performed, demonstrating an acceptable safety profile of nintedanib in combination with mFOLFOX 6. In comparison to bevacizumab, nintedanib showed a similar magnitude of efficacy, a similar safety/tolerability profile, a similar exposure and dose intensity of mFOLFOX6.
28  
 A Phase III study is going to start in late 2014 to evaluate the efficacy of nintedanib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after failure of 
previous treatment with standard chemotherapy and biological agents 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
Renal Cell Cancer  
Nintedanib has been studied in a randomized phase II study in metastatic clear 
cell RCC with sunitinib as the control arm.  Similar efficacy was seen in both arms of this study. AEs observed more frequent in the nintedanib arm included diarrheal, nausea, f atigue and infection, whereas AEs more frequent in the 
sunitinib arm consisted of bleeding, anaemia, hypertension, hand- foot syndrome 
and stomatitis.
29 
 Hepatocellular Cancer  
The efficacy and safety of nintedanib versus sorafenib in Asian Patients with 
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma was investigated in a randomised phase II 
trial. Nintedanib showed similar efficacy to sorafenib, with a favourable  and 
manageable AE profile. More patients in the sorafenib arm had severe AEs and drug- related AEs compared with patients in the nintedanib arm, and more patients 
in the sorafenib arm required dose reduction compared with the nintedanib arm. Nintedanib AEs  were manageable; in the nint edanib arm there were fewer 
hypertension, palmar -plantar erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome, and transaminase 
elevation events .

  1.4 Next G eneration S equencing  
 It is a standard of care at our institution to perform next -generation sequencing in the tumor 
specimens from patients with metastatic NSCLC and at the time of disease progression 
when feasible following targeted therapies.  Next generation sequencing involves targeted 
exon sequencing of ‘clinically significant’ cancer genes using next -generation sequencing 
technology.  1.5 Rationale  
 There has been limited benefit with angiogenesis inhibitor drugs when used with 
molecularly selected pat ients in NSCLC. We propose that patients who are molecularly 
selected for treatment with nintedanib based on the presence of mutations ( VEGFR1 -3, 
PDGFR -A, PDGFR- B, RET
21,31, and FGFR1 -3) will have clinically meaningful benefits in 
terms of RR and PFS. Furthermore we plan to perform exome sequencing of paired tumor 
(pre and post treatment) in order to better define molecular marker predictors for response 
and resistance.  
 1.6 Benefit – Risk Assessment  
 
Although considerable progress has occurred in understanding the biological characteristics of cancer as well as the development of more effective treatment regimens, most patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic tumo rs succumb to their disease. Thus, there is a 
substantial need for novel therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome for patients with 
advanced or metastatic non- small cell lung cancer.   
 Antiangiogenic treatment with the orally available triple angiokinase inhibitor nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) with inhibition of VEGFR, PDGFR , RET and FGFR offers the chance to 
control both locally recurrent and distant metastatic disease on an outpatient basis. 
Treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120) may have the potential to provide significant benefit 
to patients with locally advanced and/or metasta tic non-small cell lung cancer by slowing 
tumor progression and metastasis, since its cellular target is expressed on the t umor 
vasculature in most malignancies. Induction of endothelial cell apoptosis may result in 
subsequent degradation of tumor vessels and subsequent tumo r necrosis. Additionally, 
tumor growth may be affected by direct anti -tumour effects, e.g. tumor cells that express 
VEGFR, PDGFR, RET, or FGFR.  
 
The risks of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120) in adult patients are primarily related to:  
• the gastro -intestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain)  
• increases in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, γ -GT) 
• fatigue, asthenia and anorexia.  
 Liver enzymes must be followed closely during treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120).  
 Therapy with the trial drugs must be interrupted in the event of relevant hepatic toxicity and further treatment is to be withheld until recovery of the abnormal laboratory parameters.  
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 16 of 57 
   
Impairment of immune and of kidney function, thromboembolic events and GI perforations 
are considered possible side effects of treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120) as they have been reported for some other drugs in the class of angiogenesis inhibitors. Thus far these 
side effects have been observed in the trials conducted with nintedanib (BIBF1120), but not 
to a relevant degree. Hypertension is also supposed to be a possible side effect of VEGFR 
inhibitors and a slightly increased frequency of hypertension has been observed in the trials 
with nintedanib (BIBF1120) to a mild to moderate degree and only few cases of CTCAE grade 3 or 4 hypertension have been observed. With respect to bleeding as one of the 
potentially serious side effects of antiangiogenesis agents in the LUME –Lung 1 trial 
involving 1314 patients more bleeding events were reported for nintedanib- treated 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients (all grades: 17.1% vs. 10.9%; grade ≥3: 2.9% vs. 1.3%) than for those with adenocarcinoma (all grades: 10.9% vs. 11.1%; grade ≥3: 1.5% vs. 1.3%). Fatal bleeding events, serious skin reactions, thrombosis, and perforations occurred at a low frequency and were balanced between both arms regardless of histology.  
 
Based upon a non- clinical safety study in vitro , nintedanib (BIBF1120) may have a potential 
risk of phototoxicity (skin and eyes) in vivo . Few cases of photosensitivity reactions (less 
than 1 %) and of CTCAE grade 1 intensity only have been reported from the clinical studies 
to date. If adequate precautions are taken (avoidance of prolonged ultraviolet (UV) 
exposure, use of broad spectrum s unscreen and sunglasses), treatment with nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) is considered safe.

 5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Nintedanib is an oral drug which will be administered on an outpatient basis at a dose of 
200 mg twice daily  during each 28 -day cycle. Starting with cycle 64 , cycles will last 12 
weeks.  Patients should take nintedanib approximately 12 hours apart at around the same 
time every day  after food intake .  Capsules should not be opened and should be swallowed 
unchewed with approximately 8oz of water .  If a patient misses a dose, the patient should 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 21 of 57 
  be instructed not to take or make up that dose and to resume dosing with the next scheduled 
dose.  Patients will be instructed to bring all unused capsules and their medication diary to 
each study visit for assessment of compliance.   
 
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Diarrhea should be treated at first signs with adequate hydration and anti -diarrheal 
medicinal products, e.g. loperamide, and may require interruption, dose reduction, or 
discontinuation of therapy. 
 
Supportive care for nausea and vomiting may include medicinal products with anti -emetic 
properties, e.g. glucocorticoids, antihistamines, or 5- HT3 receptor antagonists and adequate 
hydration.  In the event of dehydration, administration of electrolytes and fluids is required.  
Plasma levels of electrolytes should be monitored if relevant GI AEs occur.  Interruption, 
dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy may be required despite appropriate supportive 
care.  
 If co -administered with nintedanib, strong P -gp inhibitors, e.g. ketoconazole or 
erythromycin, may increase exposure to nintedanib.  In such cases, patients should be 
monitored closely for tolerability of nintedanib.  
 
Strong P -gp inducers, e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort, may 
decrease exposure to nintedanib.  Co- administration with nintedanib should be carefully 
considered.  
 
5.3 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative pregnancy test within 14 
days prior to the first dose of nintedanib.  Women will be considered to be of childbearing 
potential unless surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal 
ligation/salpingectomy, or post -menopausal for at least two years.  
 
Female and male patients (along with their female partners) are required to use a highly 
effective method of birth control  during participation in the study and for 3 months  
following the last dose of  nintedanib.  A highly effective method of birth control is defined 
as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently 
and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine 
devices (IU Ds), sexual abstinence, or vasectomized part ner.  
 If a patient is suspected to be pregnant, nintedanib should be immediately discontinued.  In addition, a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is 
confirmed that the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume dosing.  
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 22 of 57 
  If a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during therapy or 
within 3 months  after the last dose of  nintedanib, the investigator must be notified in order 
to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.4 Duration of Therapy 
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s 
health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the protocol therapy 
should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the case report 
forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one 
of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression  
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment  of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable  
for further treatment in the judgment  of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non- compliance with the study protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study 
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
• NCCN decides to close the study 
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as indicated in the study calendar . 
 
5.5 Duration of Follow -up 
 
There is a 28- day follow -up visit following the last dose of study drug.  Patients will be 
monitored as per routine care thereafter for progression and survival, and that data will be captured in the case report forms.   Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse 
events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. 
  6.0 DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Criteria for Interruption of T reatment with N intedanib  
 
Treatment with nintedanib has to be interrupted in case any of the criteria listed in the table 
below is  fulfilled.  
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 23 of 57 
   
If one criterion is met, nintedanib has to be interrupted  
• nausea of CTCAE grade ≥ 3 despite supportive care  
• vomiting of CTCAE grade ≥  2 despite supportive care  
• diarrh ea of CTCAE grade ≥  2 for more than 3 consecutive days despite supportive 
care 
• AST and/or ALT of CTCAE grade ≥  2 in conjunction with bilirubin of CTCAE 
grade ≥ 1 
• AST and/or ALT of CTCAE grade ≥  3 
• other non- hematological adverse event of CTCAE grade ≥  3 considered drug-
related  
 
6.2 Criteria to Restart N intedanib  
 
A patient is eligible to restart nintedanib if all criteria listed in the table below  are met.  
 If a patient has to interrupt intake of nintedanib due to an adverse event for more than 14  
days, the decision to restart treatment with nintedanib needs to be discussed and agreed upon between the investigator and the s tudy supporter . 
 
All criteria have to be met in order to restart nintedanib  
• nausea CTCAE grade ≤ 2 
• vomiting CTCAE grade ≤  1 
• diarrhoea CTCAE grade < 2  
• AST and ALT CTCAE grade ≤  2 and bilirubin CTCAE grade ≤ 1  
• no other non- hematological adverse event grade CTCAE ≥  3 which is considered 
drug-related  
 
6.3 Dose A djustments of N intedanib  
 
As initial measure for  the management of side effects, treatment with nintedanib should be 
temporarily interrupted until the specific adverse reaction has resolved to levels that allow continuation of therapy. Nintedanib treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose. Dose adjustments in 100 mg steps per day (i.e. a 50 mg reducti on per dosing) based on individual 
safety and tolerability are recommended as described in the sections above .  In case of 
further persistence of the adverse reaction(s), i.e. if a patient does not tolerate 100 mg twice daily, treatment with nintedanib should be discontinued.   The following dose levels will be used in case dose adjustments are required for management of undue toxicity.   
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 24 of 57 
   
Dose -level:  0 -1 -2 -3 
Dose:  200 mg  BID 150 mg  BID 100 mg  BID Discontinue  
  
Of note:  
If the dose of nintedanib had to be reduced due to toxicity, it will stay on the lower dose level for the entire time of administration.  
 6.4 Management of A dverse E vents  
 
 CTCAE  Adverse reaction  Dose adjustment  
    Diarrhea ≥ grade 2 for more than 7 consecutive days 
despite anti -diarrheal treatment 
   OR 
   diarrhoea ≥ grade 3 despite anti -diarrheal treatment   
 
 
1st episode  
Reduce dose from 200 mg twice daily to 150 mg twice daily  
 
2nd episode  
Reduce dose from 150 mg twice daily to  100 mg twice daily  
   
 3rd episode  
 Stop treatment      Vomiting ≥ grade 2  
    AND/OR  
    Nausea ≥ grade 3 despite anti -emetic treatment

with bilirubin of ≥ grade 1 
   OR 
   AST and/or ALT elevations of ≥ grade 3  
   Other non -hematological or hematological adverse 
reaction of ≥ grade 3  
 
Please note, dose adjustmen ts are only required in adverse events that are drug- related.  
 If nintedanib will be combined with compounds that are solely metabolized by the liver and / or induce liver enzyme elevations, both molecules should be reduced in case of liver enzyme elevations according to the defined dose reductions for nintedanib as m entioned 
above and for the other compound as mentioned in their prescribing information.

(QASMC) at Washington University 
 
The PI is required to notify the QASMC of any unanticipated problem occurring at WU or any BJH or SLCH institution that has been reported to and acknowledged by HRPO as 
reportable.  (Unanticipated problems reported to HRPO and withdrawn during the review 
process need not be reported to QASMC.)  
 
QASMC must be notified within 10 days  of receipt of IRB acknowledgment via email to a 
QASMC auditor. 
 
7.4 Reporting Requirements for Secondary Sites  
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptly notify the Washington 
University PI and research coordinator of all reportable events (as described in Section 7.6) within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s 
PI of the event.  This notification may take place via email if there is not yet enough information for a formal written report (using either an FDA MedWatch form if required or an ins titutional SAE reporting form if not).  A formal writte n report must be sent to the 
Washington University PI and research coordinator within 10 working days  of the 
occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI of the event.  The death of 
a research participant that qualifies as a reportable event should be reported within 1 
working day of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI of the 
event.  
 The research team at a secondary site is responsible for following its site’s guidelines for 
reporting applicable events to its site’s IRB according to its own institutional guidelines.   
 
7.5 Reporting to Secondary Sites  
 
The Washington University PI (or designee) will notify the research team at each secondary 
site of all reportable events that have occurred at other sites within 10 working days  of the 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 28 of 57 
  occurrence of the event or notification of the PI of the event.  This includes events that take 
place both at Washington University and at other secondary sites, if applicable. 
 
 
7.6 Reporting to Boehringer Ingelheim  and NCCN 
 
7.6.1 Definitions  
 
Adverse event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who 
received a pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
 
Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately life -threatening, results in persistent or significant disability / 
incapacity, requires or prolongs patient hospitalisation, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,  or is to be deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important 
medical event when based upon appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions.  
 Patients may be hospitalised for administrative or social reasons during the trial (e.g. days on which infusion takes place, long distance from home to site…). These and other hospitalisations planned at the beginning of the trial do not need to be reporte d 
as an SAE.  
 
Severity of adverse event  
The severity of the AE should be judged based on the following:  The severity of adverse events should be classified and recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) <add version>  in the 
(e)CRF.  
 
Causal relationship of adverse event  
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or 
re-challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant 
diseases an d relevant history. Assessment of causal relationship must be recorded 
for each adverse event.  
 Causality will be reported as either “Yes” or “No”.  
 Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.  
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 29 of 57 
  No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational 
product administered and the  AE.  
 
Worsening of the underlying disease or other pre -existing conditions  
Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre -existing conditions will be 
recorded as an AE in the CRF.  
 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination, and laboratory test results  
Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results will be recorded as an AE in the CRF , if they are judged clinically relevant by the investigator. 
 
7.6.2 Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESI)  
 
The following events are considered as protocol -specified events of special interests:  
 Any gastrointestinal - and non- gastrointestinal perforation, leakage, fistula 
formation, abscess  
 In such case the following additional information need to be collected, documented in the respective comment field of the CRF page and the respective narratives of the SAE. That has to be forwarded to Boehringer Ingelheim:  
• Location of perforation, leakage, fistula, abscess  
• Location/extent of abdominal tumor manifestations,  
• Imaging & reports (CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, pathology, etc.)  
• Prior surgery (location, wound healing complications)  
• Concomitant diseases with GI involvement (e.g., M Crohn, vasculitis, 
tuberculosis, diverticulitis)  
• Thromboembolic events (or predisposition)  
 
Drug -induced liver injury  is under constant surveillance by sponsors and 
regulators and is considered a protocol -specified adverse event of special interest 
(AESI). Timely detection, evaluation, and follow -up of laboratory alterations of 
selected liver laboratory parameters to dis tinguish an effect of the investigational 
drug from other causes are important for patient safety and for the medical and scientific interpretation of the finding.   The following are considered as protocol -specified AESI:  
 
• An elevation of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation 
measured in the same blood draw sample  
• An elevation of AST and/or ALT >2.5 fold ULN combined with an elevation of bilirubin to >1.5 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample  
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 30 of 57 
  Patients showing above laboratory abnormalities need to be followed up until the 
protocol specific retreatment criteria have been met and according to Appendix C  of 
this clinical trial protocol.  
 
Protocol -specified AESI are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to Serious 
Adverse Events, even if they do not meet any of the seriousness criteria .  
 
7.6.3 SAE reporting to Boehringer Ingelheim (BI)  
 
Upon inclusion into a trial, the patient’s condition is assessed (e.g. documentation 
of history / concomitant diagnoses and diseases), and relevant changes from baseline 
are noted subsequently. 
 All adverse events, serious and non- serious, occurring during the course of the 
clinical trial (i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through 30 days  
following cessation of treatment) will be collected, documented by the investigator.  
 
The investigator shall report all SAEs and non- serious AEs which are relevant to a 
reported SAEs and AESIs by fax using BI IIS SAE form  (Appendix D)  to BI Unique 
Entry Point as detailed below in accordance with the following timelines:  
• within five (5) calendar days upon receipt of initial and follow -up SAEs 
containing at least one fatal or immediately life -threatening event;  
• within ten (10) calendar days upon receipt of any other initial and follow -up 
SAEs.

 or 215 -358-7699 
 For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity, treatment required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. The investigator will determine the relationship and expectedness with the investigational drug to all AEs as defined in the listed adverse event section of Boehringer Ingelheim’s (BI’s) Investigator Brochure for the Product.   The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once the clinical trial has ended. However, if the investigator becomes aware of an SAE(s) that occurred after the patient has completed the clinical trial (including any protoc ol 
specified follow -up period), it should be reported to BI if considered relevant by the 
investigator.  
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 31 of 57 
   
7.7 Timeframe for Reporting Required E vents  
 
Adverse events will be tracked  during study treatment and for 30 days following the last 
day of study treatment.  For the purposes of this protocol, adverse events collected and 
documented on CRFs are  grade 3 , 4, or 5 adverse events.  
 
 
8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
8.1 Nintedanib (BIBF1120)  
 
8.1.1 Nintedanib Description  
 
Molecular formula:  C
33H39N5O7S 
Molecular weight:  649.8 
 
8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 
Ten hours following the first intake of nintedanib, mean plasma levels of VEGF and bFGF showed a trend to increase in relation to the baseline level, which could be indicative of successful blockade of angiogenesis receptors.  
 8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
After oral administration, maximum plasma concentrations generally occurred between 2 -4 hours after dose.  Steady state was latest reached within one week of 
dosing.  The pharmacokinetics of nintedanib can be considered time -independent.  
 Nintedanib is mainly metabolized by esterases.  
 The terminal half -life of nintedanib varied between 7 and 19 hours.  The major route 
of elimination was via fecal/biliary excretion.  The contribution of renal excretion to the total clearance was low.  The overall recovery was considered complete within 
4 days after single dosing. 
 
8.1.4 Suppliers  
 
Nintedanib will be provided by Boehringer Ingelheim. 
 
8.1.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Nintedanib is provided as soft gelatin capsules containing a suspension of milled active as the salt.  It is available in two dose strengths corresponding to 100 mg and 
150 mg. 
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 32 of 57 
  8.1.6 Storage  and Stability  
 
Store below 30°C.  Protect from exposure to high humidity.  
 
8.1.7 Administration  
 
Patients should take nintedanib approximately 12 hours apart at around the same time every day after food intake.  Capsules should not be opened and should be swallowed unchewed with approximately 8oz of water.  
  9.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
9.1 Specific H ypothesis   
 
The genomic landscape of cancer is complex and evolves through the process of clonal evolution innately and in response to treatment. Unbiased exome and transcriptome sequencing performed on tumor samples at time of diagnosis in responders and non-responders will help us identify unique variations that confer susceptibility to nintedanib. 
Moreover, genomic analysis at time of progression after treatment with nintedanib (after 
response  (CR/PR/SD)  lasting for 6 months or longer) will provide some unique insights into 
mechanisms under lying acquired resistance.  
 
9.2 Tumor Biopsy  Specimens for Research  
 
9.2.1 Collection of Specimens  
 If archival tissue samples are available and/or a biopsy is obtained for clinical 
purposes  at the time of disease progression , WUSM may request a tissue sample for 
research sequencing, including whole exome and transcriptome sequencing.  The specimens will be collected in accordance with standard of care practice and will be 
taken to the Washington University Tissue Procurement core for processing and 
storage per ins titutional practice.

  12.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
 
12.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 8 weeks.  
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).
32  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Malignant lymph nodes :  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measure d and followed.  
 Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardi al effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts. 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 35 of 57 
   
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection  as target lesions.  
 Target lesions :  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend its elf to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcul ated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also 
be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presen ce, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment . 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation 
is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot 
be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have slice 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 36 of 57 
  thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, t he 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality use d at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body pa rts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same 
type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as 
closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath- hold 
scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
PET -CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  
However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical  
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the 
PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with 
conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the 
PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, 
confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about  radiation exposure at CT, 
MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published.
33-35  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria 
which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first -line trials in 
ovarian cancer.36 
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 37 of 57 
  Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease 
is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an ef fusion may be a side 
effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, addit ional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site o f disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis 
or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively 
described in  the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the 
indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
12.4 Response Criteria  
 
12.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 38 of 57 
  Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstr ate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study. 
 
12.4.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in 
size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion i ncrease.     
 Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal 
Investiga tor). 
 
12.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

may be accepted as disease progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation 
of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not 
advised  
  
12.4.4 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 40 of 57 
  until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
12.4.5 Progression -Free Survival  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression 
or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
12.4.6 Response Review  
 
It is strongly recommended that all responses be reviewed by an expert(s) 
independent of the study at the study’s completion.  
 
 13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, an 
independent  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSM C) will be specifically convened for this 
trial to review toxicity data at least every 6 months.  A DSMC will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 clinical investigators and a biostatistician.   Like investigators, DSMC 
members are subject to the Washington University School of Medicine  policies regarding standards 
of conduct. Individuals invited to serve on the DSMC will disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the trial principal investigator and/or appropriate university officials, in accordance with institution policies. Potential conflicts that develop during a trial or a member’s tenure on a DSMC 
must also be disclosed.  
 
 The DSM report will be prepared by the study statistician with assistance from the study team, will be reviewed by the DSMC, and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (QASMC).  This report will include: 
 
• HRPO protocol number, protocol title, Principal Investigator name, data coordinator name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
• Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of study  
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 41 of 57 
  • History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop dates and reason  
• Study- wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  including numbers from 
participating sites  
• Protocol activation date  at each participating site  
• Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  at each 
participating site  
• Expected accrual end date 
• Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who have met each objective  
• Measures of efficacy  
• Early stopping rules with supporting data a nd list the number of participa nts who have 
met the early stopping rules  
• Summary of toxicities  at all participating sites  
• Abstract submissions/publications  
• Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
 
Further DSMC responsibilities are described in the DSMC charter.  
 Until such a time as the first secondary site activates this protocol, a semi- annual DSM report to be 
prepared by the study team will be submitted to the QASM Committee beginning 6 months after study activation at Washington University.  The study principal investigator and c oordinator will monitor for serious toxicities on an ongoing 
basis. Once the principal investigator or c oordinator becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE 
will be reported to the HRPO and QASMC according to institutional guidelines  (please refer to 
Section 7.0) .

  14.0 AUDITING  
 As coordinating center of this trial, Washington University (via the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) will monitor each participating site to ensure that all protocol requirements are being met; that applicable federal regulations are being followed; and that best practices for patient safety and data collection are being followed per protocol.  Participating sites will be asked to send copies of all audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notification will be sent to the Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will 
obtain the audit materials from the participating institution.  
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 42 of 57 
  Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sen t to the research team. However, if 
during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be asked 
to provide the additional charts within two working days. 
 Items to be evaluated include:  
• Subject screening and enrollment  
• Reporting of adverse events  
• Maintenance of HIPAA compliance  
• Completeness of regulatory documentation  
• Completeness of participant documentation  
• Acquisition of informed consent  
• IRB documentation  
• Issues of protocol adherence

  15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
15.1 Study O bjectives and E ndpoints  
 
15.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
Response rate (partial response plus complete respo nse) after two cycles of therapy  
 
15.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
• To evaluate progression free survival  
• To correlate outcomes with specific mutations  
• To further evaluate extreme responders with exome and transcriptome 
sequencing.  
• To evaluate the mechanisms of secondary resistance  
 
15.2 Study Design   
 
This is an open label, single -arm pilot study to obtain preliminary information of the efficacy 
of single agent nintedanib.  A total of 20 patients will be enrolled in this study. The sample 
size is determined primarily based on clinical feasibility rather  than statistical power.  
However, the proposed sample size will provide us a reasonable precision to estimate the 
preliminary information. 
37If 4 responders are observed out of 20 patients, for example, we 
would have 80% confidence that the “true” rate would fall between 9% and 36%. If the 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 43 of 57 
  “true” response rate is 20% or higher, there would be 80% chance of observing at least 3 
responders out of 20 patients. Conversely, there would be <10% chance to observe 3 or 
more responders if the true rate is less than 5%.  
 
15.3 Data Analysis    
 
As a pilot study for proof of principal, the data analysis will be descriptive in nature. 
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample, as well as response, toxicity by grade and loss to follow up will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Kaplan -Meier 
product limit estimator will be used to describe the distribution of progression free survival. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for RR and 6- month PFS will also be calculated.  
 15.4 Correlative Studies Analysis  
 
The association between response and specific mutation status will be assessed by 
permutation analysis. Taking the relationship between FGFR1  expression and RR as an 
example, for  instance,  we first compute the observed test statistics, e.g., the sample mean 
difference between responders versus non -responders.  Then to simulate the null distribution 
of the test statistics, or the distribution of the observed mean differences if there were tru ly 
no difference, we repeat the following 10,000 times: we randomly shuffle the response 
status, and then calculate the sample difference between the newly designated groups. The 
permutation p- value equals the proportion of simulations from the null distribution that 
exceed the observed test statistics.  
 
 
16.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Washington University requires that each participating site sends its informed consent document to be reviewed and approved by the Washington University Regulatory Coordinator (or designee) prior to IRB/IEC submission.     Site activation is defined as when the secondary site has received official written documentation from the coordinating center that the site has been approved to begin enrollment.  At a minimum, 
each participating institution must have the following docume nts on file at Washington University 
prior to study activation:  
• Documentation of IRB approval of the study in the form of a letter or other official 
document from the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show 
which version of the protocol was approved by the IRB.  
• Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must include a statement that data will be shared with Washington University, including the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if applicable), and 
the Washington University study team. 
• Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572 (if applicable), and the CVs of all 
participating investigators.  
• Protocol signature page signed and dated by the investigator at each participating site. 
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 44 of 57 
  The coordinating center Principal Investigator (or designee) is responsible for disseminating to the participating sites all study updates, amendments, reportable adverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent 
modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electronically to the secondary sites within 4 weeks 
of obtaining Washington University IRB approval.  Activated secondary sites are expected to 
submit protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt unless 
otherwise noted.  Upon t he secondary sites obtaining local IRB approval, documentation of such 
shall be sent to the Washington University study team within 2 weeks of receipt of approval.  
 Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual continuing reviews, protocol 
amendments or revisions, all SAE reports, and all protocol violations/deviations/exceptions must 
be kept on file at Washington University.  
The investigator or a designee from each institution must participate in a regular conference call to 
update and inform regarding the progress of the trial.

APPENDIX C: Procedures for the follow -up of a potential DILI case (Hy’ s Law case) in IIS 
with nintedanib (BIBF 1120)  
_________________________________________________________________________  
Introduction  
 Drug -induced liver injury  
Drug -induced liver injury (DILI) has been the most frequent single cause of safety- related drug 
marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years (e.g., iproniazid), continuing to the present (e.g., ticrynafen, benoxaprofen, bromfenac, troglitazone, nefazodone). Accordingly, detection of drug-induced liver injury of an investigational compound has become an important aspect of patient´s safety  guarding in drug development.  
 The US -FDA has published a Guidance for Industry entitled, “Drug- Induced Liver Injury: 
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation” which outlines the detection, evaluation, follow -up and 
reporting of drug- induced liver injury in clinical trials. Drugs that have the potential for inducing 
severe liver injury may be identified by marked peak aminotransferase elevations (10x- , 15xULN), 
or the combination of hepatocellular injury (aminotransferase elevation ≥3xULN ) and altered liver 
function (hyperbilirubinemia ≥2xULN ) which is defined as potential “Hy´s law case” 
if not explained 
by other causes including evidence of biliary obstruction (i.e., significant elevation of alkaline 
phosphatase, ALP, >2X ULN) or some other explanation of the injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol 
hepatitis, concomitant use of other known hepatotoxic drugs) . This constellation predicts a poor 
outcome and although very rare, these potential cases have to be well characterized  as soon as being 
identified as other confounding conditions may be the cause.   
 
In further consideration of this FDA Guidance, a ny potential “Hy’s Law case” has to be reported in 
an expedited manner to the FDA (i.e., even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been 
excluded) and be followed-up appropriately. The follow -up includes a detailed clinical evaluation and 
identification of possible alternative etiologies for the “Hy´s Law case” constellation such as 
concomitant diseases (e.g. Hepatitis B) and/or other concomitant therapies that might potentially be 
hepatotoxic.  
 
Although rare, a potential for drug- induced liver injury is under constant surveillance by sponsors 
and regulators. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow -up of 
laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters  to ensure patients´ safety.  
 The concept below has been worked out by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) in order to guard patient´s safety and to respond to regulatory requirements. It is the basis for all clinical studies and should be applied as appropriate.  
Defintion  
 The following changes in the laboratory values are considered to be a protocol -specific significant 
adverse event for all patients with normal values for ALT/AST at baseline:  
  
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 51 of 57 
  - an elevation of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation measured in the 
same blood draw sample  
-  an elevation of AST and/or ALT >2.5 fold ULN combined with an elevation of bilirubin to 
>1.5 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample.  
 These definitions are in line with the current dose reduction recommendations as outlined in all study protocols  for BIBF 1120. 
 Patients showing these laboratory abnormalities need to be followed up until the protocol specific 
retreatment criteria have been met  
 
For patients with elevated ALT/AST values at baseline special considerations apply, if they are 
eligible for inclusion into the trial, e.g. if liver metastasis are present and do not qualify as exclusion 
criterion. For those special cases the BI contact pe rson should be involved. 
 
Procedures  
1. Protocol -specified significant events are to be reported i n an expedited manner similar as  
Serious Adverse Events, even if they do not meet any of the seriousness criteria and 
documented in the eCRF  
 
2. Replication of the following laboratory tests for confirmation within 48 hours:  
 
- AST, ALT,  
- bilirubin measurement (total and direct bilirubin)  
- Alkaline Phosphatase  
- Haptoglobin 
- Complete blood count and cell morphology 
- Reticulocyte count  
- CK 
- LDH  
The results of these repeated laboratory tests must be documented on the eCRF /CRF forms and reported im mediately via the SAE form to BI.  
3. An evaluation of the patient within 48 hours with respect to but not limited to:  
 
- Abdominal ultrasound or clinically appropriate other imaging and investigations 
adequate to rule out biliary tract, pancreatic,  intra - or extrahepatic pathology, 
e.g. bile duct stones,  neoplasm, hepatic tumour involvement, biliary tract, pancreatic or intrahepatic pathology, vascular hepatic conditions such as portal vein thrombosis or right heart failure. These data need to be collected, 
documented in the respective field of the eCRF / CRF / additional documentation form, and the respective SAE form has to be updated and forwarded to BI  
 
 
  
Protocol Version:  02/02/24   Page 52 of 57 
  - detailed history of current symptoms and concurrent diagnoses and medical history  
 
- detailed history of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription 
medications, herbal and dietary supplement preparations and eg steroids as concomittant suppportive treatment), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets detailed history of e xposure to environmental chemical agents  
 
4. In case that both imaging and laboratory value did not unequivocally confirm cholestasis as 
the reason of ALT / AST increas e, in particular if AP < 2x ULN,  
then please complete the following laboratory tests : 
 
- Clinical chemistry  
alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase (either plasma or red blood cell), albumin, 
PT or INR, CK, CK -MB, coeruloplasmin*, α -1 antitrypsin*, transferrin, ferritin, 
amylase*, lipase*, fasting glucose*, cholesterol, triglycerides  
- Serology 
Hepatitis A (Anti- IgM, Anti -IgG), Hepatitis B (HbsAg, Anti -HBs, DNA), 
Hepatitis C (Anti- HCV, RNA if Anti -HCV positive), Hepatitis D (Anti- IgM, 
Anti-IgG)*, Hepatitis E (Anti- HEV, Anti -HEV IgM, RNA if Anti -HEV IgM 
positive)*, Anti -Smooth Muscle antibody (tit er)*, Anti -nuclear antibody (titer)*, 
Anti-LKM (liver -kidney microsomes) antibody*, Anti -mitochondrial antibody*, 
Epstein Barr Virus (VCA IgG, VCA IgM), cytomegalovirus (IgG, IgM), herpes simplex virus (IgG, IgM), varicella (IgG, IgM), parvovirus (IgG, IgM )  
- Hormones, tumormarker  
TSH*  
- Haematology  
Thrombocytes*, eosinophils*  
 *If clinically indicated and in case that additional investigations are needed (e.g immunocompromised patients.)  
 
5. Initiate close observation of all patients with elevated liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations by repeat testing of ALT, AST,  bilirubin (with fractionation into total and direct) and AP at least weekly until the laboratory values return to normal or to the values as defined in the protocol.

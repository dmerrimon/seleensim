Study Title:  
A Phase 2, Double-Blind, Randomiz ed, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-Center 
Study to Evaluate the Efficac y, Safety, and Tolerability of Ora l Omadacycline in Adult 
Subjects with Nontuberculous Mycob acterial (NTM) Pulmonary Dise ase Caused by 
Mycobacterium abscessus Complex (MABc) Study Number: 
PTK0796-NTM-20203 
Study Phase:  2 
Study Rationale: 
Omadacycline is an aminomethylcycline, a tetracycline class ant ibiotic, for intravenous or 
oral administrati on. Intravenous NUZYRA® (omadacycline) and oral NUZYRA tablets 
have been approved by the United S tates (US) Food and Drug Admi nistration (FDA) for 
the treatment of adult patients w ith community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute 
bacterial skin and skin structu re infections caused by suscepti ble microorganisms. 
More than 140 nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species have b een identified, with 
more than half of the NTM pulmonary infections in the US associ ated with Mycobacterium 
avium  complex (MAC) ( Prevots 2010; Spaulding 2017 ). Mycobacterium abscessus 
complex (MABc) is the second most common NTM grouping causing h uman disease in 
the US, comprising about 10% of all NTM pulmonary infections ac ross various study sites 
(Prevots 2015). In 2010, the number of national cases of NTM pulmonary infec tions was 
estimated as 86,244 ( Strollo 2015). More recently in 2019, the number of NTM pulmonary 
cases was estimated to b e as high as 115,000 nationally ( Insmed Presentation 2021). The 
annual prevalence of NTM pulmona ry infections in the US in 2015 was estimated as 11.7 
per 100,000, representing a 7.5% annual increase from 2008 (Winthrop 2020).  Infections caused by MABc are notoriously difficult to treat du e to intrinsic resistance to 
many classes of antibiotics. Few oral antibiotics demonstrate i n vitro activity against 
MABc, making long-term treatment e xtremely difficult. Currently  there are no 
FDA-approved treatments for pul monary disease caused by MABc. C urrent treatment 
options (off-label t reatments) are t
ypicall y lengthy and require complex, multi-dru g

Study Design: 
This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled , parallel-group, multi-
center study in adults with NTM pu lmonary disease caused by MAB c. 
 
 
Following a Screening period of up to 56 days (8 weeks) prior t o dosing, eligible subjects 
will be randomized (1.5:1) to r eceive either 300 mg once daily oral omadacycline 
monotherapy or matching placebo.  
Subjects will attend monthly visi ts during the approximately 84  day (3-month) 
double-blind treatment period and w ill complete a 14-day safety  tele-visit as well as a 
safety follow-up call approximate ly 30 days after their last do se of test article.

 Approximate Duration of the Study: Following an estimated recruitmen t period of approximately 24 months, the total duration 
of subject participation in the  study is approximately 5 months  which includes a total 
duration of study treatment for a pproximately 3 months (84 days ). 
Study Population:  Approximately 75 subjects (45 o madacycline and 30 placebo) will  be enrolled at up to 
20 sites. Subjects will be randomized (1.5:1) to receive either  omadacycline or placebo. 
Subjects will be stratified accord ing to their use of prior ant ibiotics for treatment of MABc 
NTM infection (received prior treatment vs. no prior treatment) . 
Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects must meet all of the f ollowing criteria at Screening a nd/or Baseline to be eligible 
to participate in the study: 1. Written and signed informed consen t must be obtained before any  protocol-specific

 STATISTICAL METHODS: 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before database lock and 
analyses of data. Summary data  will be tabulated and presented by treatment group. 
Sample Size Determination:  
As the study is exploratory wit h respect to determination of ef ficacy, the sample size 
determination is provided to bett er ensure sufficient subjects are enrolled to provide an 
initial assessment of efficacy r ather than test a specific hypo thesis. With a randomization 
ratio of 1.5:1, a sample size of 75 subjects (45 omadacycline and 30 placebo) will provide 
approximately 80% power to detect a n absolute treatment differe nce of 30% in clinical 
response rate at Day 84, based on c linical response rates of 15 % and 45% in the placebo 
and omadacycline treatment groups  respectively, using a Mantel- Haenszel test with 
2-sided alpha level of 0.05.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 9 of 68 Analysis Sets:  
The following subject analysis  sets have been defined: 
 Intent-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set includes all randomized subj ects. 
 Per-Protocol Analysis Set incl udes all randomized subjects who received at least 
1 dose of test article and comple ted the study without major pr otocol deviations 
that affect the assessment of efficacy. 
 Safety Analysis Set includes al l subjects who received at least 1 dose of test article. 
 
Safety Assessments:   
All safety data will be analyzed  in the Safety Analysis Set. Ad verse events will be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary of R egulatory Activities. The incidence of 
treatment-emergent adverse even ts will be presented by system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT); by SOC, PT , and relationship to test artic le; and by SOC, PT, and 
severity. Serious AEs and treatme nt-emergent adverse events that lead to discontinuation 
of the test article will als o be presented by SOC and PT. Descr iptive statistics for clinical 
laboratory test results , vital signs, and EC G parameters, inclu ding change from baseline, 
will be presented by timepoint c ollected and for the overall mo st abnormal post-baseline 
value (for clinical laborator y results and vital signs). Incide nces of potentially clinically 
significant clinical laborator y results, vital signs, and ECG parameters, as defined in the 
SAP, will also be summarized by timepoint collected and the ove rall most abnormal 
post-baseline value (for clinical  laboratory results and vital signs). 
Efficacy Assessments: 
The study is exploratory with res pect to efficacy determination . Efficacy will be evaluated 
based on endpoints defined by subjec t-reported NTM symptoms, su bject-reported 
outcomes and quality of life meas ures, and microbiologic assessment. Additional 
endpoints to assess efficacy will be defined in the SAP. Nomina l p-values are provided as 
descriptive statistics. 
Clinical response at Day 84 will be defined as (1) improvement in severity of a t least 50% 
of symptoms present at baselin e and (2) improvement in severity  of at least 50% of 
symptoms present at baseline and no deteriora tion in severity o f symptoms present at 
baseline. Subjects who receive alternative antibiotic therapy f or treatment of the NTM 
infection, withdraw consent, and/ or die before reaching Day 84 will be considered as not 
achieving clinical response. For both definitions, the number a nd percentage of subjects 
with a clinical response and no clinical response will be summa rized by treatment group in 
the ITT Analysis Set. Exact 2-si ded 95% confidence intervals fo r the point estimates of the 
clinical response rates in eac h treatment group will be determi ned using the 
Clopper-Pearson method. The odds ra tio (omadacycline /placebo) and p-value will be 
calculated using Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel test, stratified by prior antibiotic use. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints based on patient-reported outcomes  and quality of life 
assessments and microbiologic a ssessments will also be analyzed  to provide supportive 
evidence of efficacy.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 19 of 68 3 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Pulmonary Disease  
More than 140 nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species have been identified, with more 
than half of the NTM pulmonary i nfections in the United States (US) associated with 
Mycobacterium avium  complex (MAC) ( Prevots 2010; Spaulding 2017 ). Mycobacterium 
abscessus  complex (MABc) is the second m ost common NTM grouping causing human 
disease in the US, comprising a bout 10% of all NTM pulmonary in fections across various 
study sites ( Prevots 2015). In 2010, the number of national cases of NTM pulmonary 
infections was estimated as 86,244 ( Strollo 2015 ). More recently i n 2019, the number of 
NTM pulmonary cases was estimated to be as high as 115,000 nati onally ( Insmed 
Presentation 2021 ). The annual prevalence of NTM pulmonary infections in the US in 2015 
was estimated as 11.7 per 100,000, representing a 7.5% annual increase from 2008 (Winthrop 2020).  
Infections caused by MABc are notoriously difficult to treat du e to intrinsic resistance to 
many classes of antibiotics. Few oral antibiotics demonstrate i n vitro activity against MABc, 
making long-term treatment extr emely difficult. Currently there are no Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for pulmonary disease caused by MABc. Current 
treatment options (off-label treat ments) are typically lengthy and require complex, multidrug 
regimens ( Strnad 2018 ). M. abscessus  isolates display in vitro resistance to most oral 
antibiotics and are generally s usceptible to a limited number o f parenteral agents. Previous 
guidelines recommend using a m ultidrug regimen including ≥ 2 of these antibiotics to which 
the organism is susceptible in vitro. Recent work suggests a la ck of consensus among treating 
physicians, with a variety of regim ens employed against this organism ranging from 2 to 5 
drugs in the initial phases of therapy ( Daley 2020 ). 
Most of the antibiotics recomme nded for the treatment of MABc p ulmonary infection have 
safety and tolerability profiles  that are not conducive to an extended treatment course. 
Current treatment regimens are frequently associated with serio us adverse effects and poor 
patient adherence contributing to poor clinical outcomes. With these current treatment 
challenges, expert NTM clinicians and patient advocacy groups h ave emphasized the urgent 
need for developing new antibiotics  for the treatment of NTM in fections. Ideally, these 
antibiotics would have potent  in vitro activity and a high barri er to the emergence of 
resistance. A favorable safety and tolerability profile and the availability of an oral 
formulation both take on added importance because of the antici pated prolonged treatment 
duration. An antibiotic with the se properties has the potential to improve both microbiologic 
and patient quality of life outco mes in patients with MABc pulm onary disease. 
Therefore, a clear unmet need exi sts for an effective and safe antibiotic that is well-tolerated 
and can be administere d orally. Omadacyclin e has the potential to f
ill this unmet need. 
3.2 Omadacycline  
The investigational product, omadacycline (formerly named PTK 0 796), is the first member 
of the aminomethylcycline class of antibiotics, which are semis ynthetic derivatives of the 
Omadacycline  Paratek  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 20 of 68 tetracycline class. As a class , tetracyclines have been in use for approximately 70 years. They 
are well-tolerated and have prove n effective in the treatment o f a variety of bacterial 
infections. Intravenous NUZYRA (omadacycline) and oral NUZYRA t ablets have been 
approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adult patients with  community-acquired 
bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) 
caused by susceptible microorganisms. 
While data from the completed non clinical program supports dosing up to 90 days, this is the 
first clinical trial that will  administer study dosing of omada cycline beyond 14 days of 
therapy. Current-use data indicate  that omadacycline is being u sed for chronic dosing without 
any safety signal identified, through Paratek’s post-marketing pharmacovigilance program 
and published cases studies. Review of post-marketing off-label  use reports did not reveal 
any trends or recommended updates to the current reference safe ty information. As of 
January 2021, 5 case series have b een published that together r eport experience on 
19 patients with NTM infections, predominately M. abscesses  (Frizzell 2020 ; Gill 2019; 
Minhas 2019; Morrisette 2021; Pearson 2020 ). Patients were treated with oral omadacycline 
for periods ranging from 4 week s to 20.6 months, all but one as  part of a mult idrug regimen. 
Omadacycline was overall safe and well-tolerate d. Clinical succ ess was reported in 
16 patients. Reported events were c onsistent with the establish ed safety profile and are not 
unexpected. These real-world observational reports of treatment with omadacycline for NTM 
provide support to progress to a  randomized controlled trial se tting, including long-term 
dosing. 
Please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information 
on omadacycline. 
3.3 Properties of Omadacycline tha t Address the Unmet Treatment Need for 
M. abscessus  Complex Pulmonary Infection  
Omadacycline has several key cha racteristics that may prove ben eficial to patients with 
MABc pulmonary infection: 
 Potent in vitro activity versus M. abscessus  complex subspecies  
 No antagonism in vitro when tes ted in combination with other an timicrobials 
commonly used to treat M. abscessus  infections 
 Demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of M. abscessus  pulmonary infection 
 Favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) and dosing regimen  
 Extensive penetration into lung t issue compartments including e pithelial lining 
fluid and alveola r macrophages  
 Half-life of 17 hours supports once-daily dosing  
 No dosing adjustments are require d for age, weight, race, sex, renal or hepatic 
impairment   
 Established safety profile in pr e-clinical studies and Phase 3 clinical trials conducted 
in CABP and ABSSSI populations (up to 14 days of dosing) 
 Does not prolong the QTc interval

5.1 Overall Study Description  
This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled , parallel-group, multi-center 
study in adults with NTM pulmonary disease caused by MABc. The study design is shown in 
Figure 1 . 
Figure 1. Study Design Schema 
 
 
 
Following a Screening period of up to 56 days (8 weeks) prior t o dosing, eligible subjects 
will be randomized (1.5:1) to r eceive either 300 mg once daily oral omadacycline 
monotherapy or matching placebo. Subjects will be stratified ac cording to their use of prior 
antibiotics for treatment of MA Bc NTM infection (received prior treatment vs. no prior 
treatment). Subjects will attend monthly visi ts during the approximately 84  day (3-month) double-blind 
treatment period. In addition, subj ects will complete a 14-day safety tele-visit as well as a 
safety follow-up call approximate ly 30 days after their last do se of test article. Total duration 
of subject participation i s approximately 5 months.  
Refer to the Schedule of Assessm ents for a compl ete summary of subject visits and 
assessments.  
5.2 Rationale for Study Design  
This study is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of oma dacycline in addition to non-
pharmacologic standard of care in NTM subjects caused by MABc. Non-pharmacologic 
measures, including patient education, airway clearance techniq ue, inspiratory muscle 
training, and exercise training, are  considered the first line of therapy in these subjects and 
will be permitted during the study ( Lan 2020). A 3-month, monotherapy, placebo-controlled 
study design will allow the best assessment of omadacycline wit hout any confounding

Confidential and Proprietary Page 29 of 68 7.3 Dose Selection Rationale  
The dosing regimen of omadacyclin e selected for this study is b ased on the demonstration of 
efficacy in a mouse model of M. abscessus  pulmonary infection, as well as the totality of 
nonclinical and clinical experience to date, including in vitro  antibacterial activity, PK 
characteristics, and the overall  safety and tolerability profile of the FDA-approved dosing 
regimens for treatment of CABP and ABSSSI. 
In a nonclinical C3HeB/FeJ mouse model of M. abscessus  pulmonary infection, 
omadacycline efficacy was demons trated using the dose best representing the human 
equivalent exposure ie, area under the concentration-time curve  (AUC) of the human 300 mg 
oral dose. The C3HeB/FeJ mouse wa s previously demonstrated to provide utility as a mouse 
model of M. abscessus  pulmonary infection for a ntibacterial studies ( Maggioncalda 2020 ; 
Story-Roller 2019). Administration of a corticoste roid (dexamethasone) allows fo r initial 
proliferation of and s ubsequent sustained M. abscessus  pulmonary infection and pathology 
following infection via a n aerosolized route. 
As detailed in the Investigator’s Brochure, the steady state AUC ( hr*µg/mL) for the 300 mg 
oral dose is 11.156, while the stea dy state free AUC (hr*µg/mL) of the 300 mg oral dose is 
8.92 (adjustment for free frac tion by 20% human plasma protein binding; on file at Paratek). 
Therefore, a mouse dose was sele cted to represent a steady state free AUC (hr*µg/mL) of 
approximately 9. Omadacycline PK parameters in C3HeB/FeJ mice were determined after subcutaneous 
administration of omadacyclin e doses of 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg in  order to calculate the 
appropriate mouse dose to study in the efficacy model. Followin g determination of key PK 
parameters, adjustment for fre e fraction in mice (33.9% mouse p lasma protein binding; data 
on file at Paratek), and graphica l assessment of the mouse free  area under the concentration-
time curve from t ime zero to 24 hours (AUC
0-24) (hr*µg/mL) versus mouse doses studied, the 
resulting linear equation was util ized to calculate the appropriate mouse dose. Specifically, 
the data demonstrated that a mo use subcutaneous dose of approximately 15 mg/kg every 
24 hours (q24h) best represents a human AUC 0-24 (hr* µg/mL) of 9 (on file at Paratek). 
The American Type Culture Coll ection (ATCC) reference strain M. abscessus  19977 
(omadacycline minimum inhibitor y concentration [MIC] values of 0.25 to 0.5 µg/mL) and 
the clinical isolate M9501 (omadacycline MIC value of 0.25 µg/m L) were evaluated in the 
mouse model of efficacy (MIC data on file at Paratek). Mice wer e infected via aerosolization 
and treatment was initiated 1-week  post-infection. Mice were tr eated with either 
omadacycline (15 mg/kg q24h), imi penem (200 mg/kg every 12 hour s; positive control) or 
vehicle (phosphate buffered sal ine; q24h) for 4 weeks and the bacterial burden in the lungs 
was evaluated at various tim epoints (0, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks) throughout the study. 
Efficacy was determined as a reduction in lung bacterial burden  compared to vehicle 
controls. 
M. abscessus  lung burden in the vehicle contro l group increased throughout the course of 
infection as expecte d. In the positive cont rol group (imipenem treatment), M. abscessus  lung 
burden decreased gradually over th e duration of the study. For mice infected with the 
Omadacycline  Paratek  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 30 of 68 reference strain ATCC 19977, at th e final timepo int of 4 weeks of treatment, omadacycline 
produced >3 log 10 reduction in total lung colony f orming units compared to mice in the 
vehicle control group. Similarly, o madacycline treatment reduce d lung burden of the clinical 
strain M9501 by 2 log 10 at the conclusion of 4 w eeks of treatment.  
Therefore, based on the demonstration of omadacycline efficacy in the mouse model of M. 
abscessus  pulmonary infection at the equivalent human steady state free AUC (hr*µg/mL) of 
approximately 9, the 300 mg oral dose will be evaluated in this  human clinical study. 
Phase 3 clinical trials in CABP and ABSSSI have demonstrated th at omadacycline has an 
acceptable safety profile. Additionally, the 300 mg oral dose b eing used in this study has 
been approved by the FDA for these indications.  
7.4 Description of Treatments

multivitamins containing multiva lent cations (eg, aluminum, mag nesium, calcium, bismuth, 
iron, or zinc) for 4 hours. 
7.6 Dose Adjustments and Interr uptions of Test Article  
No dose adjustments or planned interruptions of test article wi ll be permitted during this 
study. 
7.7 Method of Assigning Pati ents to Treatment Groups  
All eligible subjects will be randomized via an IxRS that assig ns them to the treatment group 
in a 1.5 to 1 ratio (omadacycline:  placebo). The site delegate will contact the IxRS after 
confirming that the subject fulfi lls all the inclusion criteria  and has none of the exclusion 
criteria. The IxRS will assign a t est article to the subject ba sed on a computer-generated

Confidential and Proprietary Page 31 of 68 randomization schedule. The randomization will be a blocked ran domization sequence 
stratified by prior an tibiotic use fo r treatment of MABc NTM infection (prior antibiotic use 
and no prior antibiotic use) as de fined in the IxRS specificati ons. Subjects randomized into 
the study will be assigned the tr eatment corresponding to the n ext available number from the 
computer-generated randomizati on schedule. The subject is consi dered randomized when the 
IxRS provides the test article ass ignment, regardless of whether the subject actually receives 
any test article. 
7.7.1 Subject Numbering  
Upon the subject signing the inf ormed consent, site personnel s hould enter the subject in the 
IxRS, and the subject will be assigned a unique s ubject number.  Subjects who have been 
pre-screened but who do not sign an ICF will not be assigned a subject number. A subject 
who discontinues participation or is withdrawn before receiving  a treatment assignment, and 
who is re-screened at a later ti me will be assigned a new subje ct number and recorded as 
re-screened. Re-screening is at  the discretion of the investiga tor and in consultation with the 
medical monitor. The investigator will maintain a subject maste r list to document every 
subject who has signed an ICF using the subject number assigned  by the IxRS. A copy of this 
list should be retained in the investigator’s study files.  
7.8 Dispensing Test Article  
Each study site will be supplied by the sponsor with the test a rticle. Oral test article supplies 
are completely blinded, and bli nded study personnel can conduct storage, dispensation, and 
reconciliation. The IxRS will assign the test article kit to be  given to the subject. 
Oral test article will be supplie d to the sites in labelled, bl inded kits that contain 6 blister 
cards (12 tablets per card, 72 tab lets per kit) of omadacycline  (150 mg) tablets or matching 
placebo tablets. Each kit contai ns enough test article for 4 we eks of test article administration 
between visits. At each visit when test article is dispensed (B aseline, Day 28, Day 56), study 
personnel will access the IxRS and be assigned a test article k it to be given to the subject. 
The study coordinator/staff will instruct the subject on the use of oral test article. 
7.9 Blinding  
The investigator and sponsor will be blinded to treatment group  assignments throughout the 
study. The sponsor designee (eg, clin ical supply manager, IxRS vendor, etc.) will have a 
designated randomizatio n administrator who w ill maintain the ra ndomization codes in 
accordance with standard operating procedures to ensure the bli nd is properly maintained and 
that only sponsor personnel who require knowledge of treatment assignments will be 
unblinded (eg, staff involved in maintaining the randomization codes). 
Randomization data are kept stri ctly confidential until the tim e of database lock and 
unblinding at the end of the study. U nblinded treatment assignments will be provided to 
study sites after the study has concluded.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 32 of 68 All test articles will be supplie d in identical packaging there by maintaining t he blinding for 
all site staff and subjects. 
Unblinding by site personnel is on ly to occur in the case of su bject emergencies (see 
Section 7.10 , below).  
7.10 Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Emergency unblinding should only b e undertaken when it is essen tial to treat the subject 
safely and efficaciously. Most often, test article discontinuation and knowledge of the 
possible treatment assignments a re sufficient t o treat a study subject who presents with an 
emergency condition. It is encouraged for the investigator, when contemplating unblinding, to contact the sponsor or sponso r’s designated medical monitor or designee to confirm the 
need to unblind, prior to unblinding (see Section 2 for contact information). However, if 
required, the investigator can unblind without consulting the m edical monitor. 
Emergency code breaks are perform ed using the IxRS. When the in vestigator contacts the 
system to unblind a subject, he/she  must provide the requested subject identifying 
information and confirm the n ecessity to unblind the subject. The investigator will then 
receive details of the drug tre atment for the specified subject and a fax or e-mail confirming 
that the treatment assignment o f the subject was unblinded. The  system will automatically 
inform the sponsor’s monitor and the sponsor that the code has been broken. 
It is the investigator’s responsib ility to ensure that there is  a procedure in place at their site to 
allow access to the IxRS code br eak information in case of emergency. The investigator will 
inform the subject how to contact  his/her backup in cases of em ergency when he/she is 
unavailable. All steps outlined a bove will be followe d, including contacting  the medical monitor as soon 
as possible and not more than 24 hour s afterwards. It will be t he responsibility of all study 
personnel to ensure th at, except for the a bove procedure, inves tigator blinding is maintained 
until after study completion. 
7.11 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 All antibiotics administered for the subject’s MABc or MAC infe ction within 2 years 
prior to the date of informed c onsent will be recorded in the e CRF.

through Day 84/EOT visit 
 Use of isotretinoin within 2 week s prior to Screening and throu gh Day 84/EOT visit 
 Subjects will be instructed to avoid taking antacids and multiv itamins containing 
multivalent cations (eg, alumi num, magnesium, calcium, bismuth,  iron, or zinc) for 
4 hours before and within 4 hour s after oral doses  
 
7.13 Permitted Treatments  
All other treatments not specified as prohibited are permitted during the study. Subjects 
requiring additional or alternativ e therapy for their MABc NTM pulmonary disease will be 
discontinued from test article. F urther treatment for their inf ection is at the discretion of the 
investigator or the subject’s  health care provider and will be considered as a concomitant 
medication. 
Subjects should be encouraged to contact site personnel before starting any new treatment. 
7.14 Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will record daily test article dosing information in a paper diary. Study personnel at 
the site should monitor oral test article compliance at each st udy visit by comparing the 
returned test article with the  dosing information reported by t he subject. Compliance and any 
unresolved discrepancies will be  documented in the source docum ent and on the drug 
inventory record. The test article eCRF should reflect the reco nciled dosing information 
provided by the subject.

the study site. Relevant findings t hat are present prior to the start of test article must be 
included in the relevant medical  history/current medical condit ions screen on the subject’s 
eCRF. New clinically s ignificant findings made after the start of test article which meet the 
definition of an AE mu st be recorded as an AE in the subject’s eCRF. 
8.5 Vital Signs  
Vital signs including blood pressu re, heart rate , body temperat ure, and pulse oximetry will be 
measured at the timepoints as specified in Appendix 1. 
The subject’s vital signs should be capture d after at least 5 m inutes (+ 5 minutes) of rest 
while in a non-standing position (s upine or sitting). Subsequen t vital sign measurements 
should be captured in the  same non-standing position. 
8.6 Height, Weight and Bo dy Mass Index  
Height and body weight should be obtained with the subject’s sh oes off and recorded in the 
eCRF at the timepoints as specified in Appendix 1. Body mass index will be automatically 
calculated upon entry of height  and weight in the eCRF. 
8.7 Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12-lead ECG should be  obtained using site equipment. The ECG will be obtained 
after the subject has been in a s emi-recumbent position for app roximately 10 minutes at the 
Screening and Day 84/EOT Visit. Reading and interpretation of t he ECG will be performed 
locally by the investigator, and ha rd copies of the reports ret ained in the files. 
8.8 Computed Tomography Scan – Chest  
Computed tomography scans of the  chest will be performed using site equipment or local 
radiology facility. High resoluti on CT scan is preferred, if available. The CT scan will be 
interpreted by appropriately quali fied personnel who are certif ied or licensed to interpret 
chest radiographs according to app licable regional requirements , reviewed by the investigator 
or qualified personnel and the c onclusions of thi s review will be the basis for subject 
inclusion. The review report shoul d be included in the source d ocuments. 
Sites may utilize results of a che st CT scan performed within 3  months prior to Screening to 
determine eligibility (radiographic evidence of MABc infection). If no CT scan was obtained 
within the 3 months prior to Screening, a CT scan will be requi red at Screening. A follow-up 
chest CT scan will also be performed at the Day 84/EOT visit.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 38 of 68 8.10 Sputum Collection For Microbiology  
A Central Specialty Microbiology L aboratory will be used for an alysis of all sputum 
specimens. Details on the collect ion supplies, shipment of samp les and reporting of results 
are provided to investigators in  the Central Laboratory Manual.   
Pre-dose expectorated or induced s putum specimens (approximatel y 5 mL) will be collected 
at all timepoints as indicated in Appendix 1. To improve the probability of obtaining a good 
sputum specimen, at least 2 and pr eferably 3 spontaneously expectorated sputum samples 
will be obtained from subjects at each time point. During Screening, samples will be collected 
after the subject signs the inf ormed consent. For all subsequen t visits, sputum samples should 
be collected on 2 to 3 consecutive  days (when possible), just prior to, and up through the day 
of the scheduled visit.  
If a subject is unable to produce sputum spontaneously and independently, sputum induction 
may be performed by appropriately qualified site staff to obtain one induced sputum specimen. Please refer to Appendix 3. If a subject is still unable to produce sputum despite 
reasonable efforts at any visit  post-Baseline, t his will be con sidered as a negative culture 
result at that timepoint. Sterile, leak proof, non-wax, disposa ble plastic containers will be 
used to collect specimens. Detai led instructions will be provid ed by site staff to subjects on 
how to collect and handle samples  aseptically to avoid contamin ation. Subjects will also be 
instructed to keep sputum sampl es refrigerated, not frozen, unt il ready to transport to the site. 
Upon receipt at the site, samples should be kept refrigerated u ntil ready to ship to the central 
specialty microbiology lab. Shippi ng should occur within approximately 2 days of receipt 
from subject to avoid overgrowth by contaminating normal flora.  No fixative or preservatives 
are to be used with sputum sampl es. Detailed instructions for c ollecting, processing, and 
shipping sputum specimens will be provided in the Central Labor atory Manual. 
The Central Specialty Microbiology Lab will process the sputum specimens. Acid f ast bacilli 
smear testing from sputum will be performed on all specimens re ceived. Specimens will be 
further cultured in both solid and liquid med ia and identification of genus and species will be 
performed, to the subspecies level for M. abscessus . Results confirming M. abscessus  
infection will be used to verify  subject eligibility during Scr eening. 
In vitro susceptibility testing of antimicrobial drugs that may  be used to treat M. abscessus  
pulmonary infection will be perfo rmed, and molecular characterization for select drug 
resistance markers will be perfo rmed. Susceptibility results wi ll not be reported to site 
personnel during the study. 
8.11 Serum and Plasma Collection for Biomarkers ( optional )  
Serum and plasma for biomarkers  will be collected and stored at  a central laboratory for 
future use for all subjects w ho provide consent for this option al portion of the study.  
Samples may be stored for a pe riod of up to 2 years after the c ompletion (termination) of the 
study, or longer, to see if there may be indicators associated with NTM lung infections and

8.12 NTM Symptom Assessment Questionnaire  
The NTM Symptom Assessment Questionnaire is a tool created by P aratek to evaluate 
efficacy based on individual subject  assessment of symptoms. It  is a self-administered 
questionnaire that evaluates a list of 12 common NTM symptoms, asking subjects if they 
have experienced each symptom w ithin the past 7 days. Responses are provided using a 
4-point scale (absent, mild, mod erate, severe) and should refle ct the subject’s perceived 
overall impression of their sympt oms over the past 7 days. This  questionnaire is completed 
by the subject without interpretation of the subject’s response  by a clinician or  site staff. 
In addition, at Screening, subjects will be asked to list up to  3 of their most bothersome 
symptoms.  
The NTM Symptom Assessment Questionnaire will be completed at S creening, 
Baseline/Day 1 (prior to first dos e of test article), and the D ay 28, Day 56, and Day 84/EOT 
Visits. Responses at Screening and Baseline/Day 1 will be used to determine eligibility. 
8.13 Other Patient-Reported Outcomes  and Clinician-Assessed Outcomes   
Patient-reported outcomes are b eing utilized in this study to h elp understand and assess the 
subject’s health, quality of life  or functional status associat ed with the disease under study 
and treatment received. The PROs  are completed by the subject w ithout interpret ation of the 
subject’s response by a clinicia n or site staff but should be r eviewed for completeness and to 
assess potential AE information. 
All PROs described below will  be completed the Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84/EOT visits. In 
addition, the QOL-B, SGRQ, and PRO MIS Fatigue will be collected  at Day 1/Baseline visit 
(prior to first dose of test article). 8.13.1 Quality of Life – Bronchiectasis  
The QOL-B is a self-administere d, patient-reported outcome meas ure assessing symptoms, 
functioning and health-related qua lity of life for patients wit h non-cystic fibrosis 
bronchiectasis using a s eries of 37 questions.  
8.13.2 St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire  
The SGRQ is a self-administere d questionnaire th at assesses health-related quality of life in 
subjects with chronic pulmonar y disease by evaluating 3 health domains:  
 symptoms (distress caused by respiratory symptoms) 
 activity (effects of d isturbances to mobili ty and physical acti vity) 
 impacts (the effect of  disease on factors su ch as employment, p ersonal control of 
one’s health, and need for medication)

8.13.3 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short Form 
v1.0 – Fatigue 7a Daily  
The PROMIS Fatigue is a self-a dministered questionnaire that as sesses fatigue and its impact 
on physical, mental, and social act ivities. The fatigue short form is universal rather than 
disease-specific and assesses fatigue over the past 7 days. 
8.13.4 Patient Clinical Impression of Severity  
The PGI-S is a self-administere d, single questi on assessed using a 7-point scale that measures 
a subject’s perception of disease severity. 
8.13.5 Patient Clinical Impression of Change  
The PGI-C is a self-administere d, single questi on assessed using a 7-point scale that 
measures a subject’s perceived cha nge in clinical status and overall improvement. 
8.13.6 Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness  
The CGI-S is administered by an e xperienced clinician who is fa miliar with the disease under 
study. The CGI-S is a 1-item obser ver-rated scale that rates illness severity based upon 
observed and reported symptoms,  behavior, and function over the  past seven days. 
8.13.7 Clinical Global Impression – Improvement  
The CGI-I is administered by an e xperienced clinician who is familiar with the disease under 
study and who can make an expert judgment about the total pictu re of the subject at each 
visit. The CGI-I is a 1-item obser ver-rated scale that rates to tal subject improvement 
compared to baseline and whether or not, per clinical judgment,  it is due entirely to drug 
treatment.  
8.14 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the for m of signs, symptoms, 
disease, or laboratory or physiolo gic observations occurring in  a person given a test article or 
in a clinical study. The event doe s not need to be causally rel ated to the test article or clinical 
study. An AE includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
 Any clinically signifi cant worsening of a  preexisting condition. 
 An AE occurring from overdose of a  test article, whether accide ntal or intentional. 
Overdose is a dose greater than t hat specified in the protocol.  
 An AE occurring from abuse (eg, use for nonc linical reasons) of a test article. 
 An AE that has been associate d with the discontinuation of the use of a test article.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 41 of 68 8.15 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an AE that: 
 Results in death. 
 Is life-threatening (see below). 
 Requires hospitalization or pr olongation of an existing hospita lization (see below). 
 Results in a persistent or significant disabili ty or incapacity  (see below). 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
 Additionally, important medical e vents that may  not result in d eath, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi talization may be considered SAEs when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, the  event may jeopardize the subj ect and may require 
medical or surgical interventi on to prevent any one of the outc omes listed above in 
this definition. Examples of suc h events include allergic bronc hospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result i n hospitalization, or developme nt of drug dependency 
or drug abuse. 
 
An AE is considered “life-threat ening” if, in the view of the i nvestigator or sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It do es not include an AE that, had 
it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. For example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure w ould not be considered life-threatening, even 
though hepatitis of a more severe  nature can be fatal. Similarl y, an allergic reaction resulting 
in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or  anaphylaxis can be fatal. 
Hospitalization is official admission to a hospital. Hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization constitutes criter ia for an AE to be serious; however, it is not in itself 
considered an SAE. In the absen ce of an AE, a hospitalization o r prolongation of a 
hospitalization should not be rep orted as an SAE by the participating investigator. This is the 
case in the following situations: 
 The hospitalization or prolongati on of hospitalization is neede d for a procedure 
required by the protocol.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 42 of 68 8.16 Other Reportable Information  
Certain informati on, although not considered an SAE, must be re corded, reported, and 
followed up as indicated for an SAE. This includes: 
 Pregnancy exposure to a test article:  If a pregnancy is confir med, use of the test 
article must be discontinued immediately. Information about pre gnancy exposure 
includes the entire course of pregnancy and delivery, and perin atal and neonatal 
outcomes, even if there are no abno rmal findings . Both maternal  and paternal 
exposures are considered other re portable information. For expo sure involving the 
female partner of a male subjec t, the necessary information mus t be collected from 
the subject, while respecting the  confidentiality of the partne r. 
 Lactation exposure to a test ar ticle with or without an AE. 
 Overdose of a test article as specified in this protocol with o r without an AE. 
 Inadvertent or accidental expos ure to a test ar ticle with or wi thout an AE. 
 
8.17 Overdose  
Any administration of omadacycline of greater than 600 mg within a 24-hour period will be 
an overdose, regardless of wheth er the overdose is intentional or accidental. It is a reportable 
event and the sponsor must be notified within 1 business day. 
The physician managing the overdos e may order any test he/she thinks is necessary to 
manage the subject properly. 
8.18 Medication Errors  
Medication errors are the resul t of administration or consumption of the wrong product, by 
the wrong subject, at the wrong time, and/or by the wrong admin istration route, due to human 
error. Medication errors include, but a re not limited t o, the followin g: 
 The administration and/or consumption of tes t article that has not been assigned to the 
subject 
 Administration of expired test article 
 
All AEs and SAEs must be handled a s specified in this protocol whether or not they are 
associated with a medication erro r. A medication error associated with an SAE (including 
overdose, inadvertent exposure, and/or accidental exposure) wil l be reported with the SAE on 
the SAE Report Form. All other medication errors will be report ed by e-mailing the Clinical 
Test Article Error Inci dent Report Form to clinicalsafety@propharmagroup.com .

Confidential and Proprietary Page 43 of 68 8.19 Recording and Reporting  
A subject’s AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from the  signing of the ICF to the 
time of the Follow-up assessment. T he investigator must instruct the subject to report AEs 
and SAEs during this time period. Reports of death after the la st study contact with the 
subject will be reported to the  sponsor and additional informat ion relative to the cause of 
death will be sought and documented. 
All AEs and SAEs must be recorded  on source documents. All AEs and SAEs for subjects 
who receive a treatment assignment will be recorded in the eCRF s. 
The investigator must follow  up as medically necessary on all A Es and SAEs until the events 
have subsided, the condition has returned to Baseline, or in ca se of permanent impairment, 
until the condition stabilizes. Adverse events should be based on t he signs or symptoms detecte d during the physical 
examination and on clinical evalu ation of the sub ject. In addit ion to the information obtained 
from those sources, the subject should be asked the following n onspecific question:  “How 
have you been feeling since your last visit?” Whenever possible , AEs should be reported as a 
diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms. If a defin itive diagnosis is not possible, 
the individual signs and symp toms should be recorded using standard medical terminology. 
If an AE requires a surgical or d iagnostic procedure, the illness leading to the procedure 
should be recorded as the AE , not the procedure itself. 
Death should be recorded in the eCRF as an outcome of an AE. An y unanticipated risks to 
the subjects must be reported pr omptly to the IRB/IEC/REB.  
8.19.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAEs and follow-up informat ion must be reported within 1 bu siness day or 24 hours as 
required by local regulations by ema iling a completed SAE Report to the email address 
below.  E-Mail: 8.19.2 Assessment of Relatedness  
The investigator will assess cau sality (ie, wheth er there is a reasonable possibility that test 
article caused the event) for al l AEs and SAEs. The relationshi p will be characterized using 
the following classification: 
 Not Related:  This relationshi p suggests that there is no assoc iation between test 
article and the reported event . The event can be explained by o ther factors such as an 
underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident,  and no plausible 
temporal or biologic relationship exists between test article a nd the event. 
 Related:  This relationship suggest s that a definite causal rel ationship exists between 
test article administration and the AE, or there is a reasonabl e possibility that the

Confidential and Proprietary Page 44 of 68 event was caused by the test article, and other conditions (con current illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medicati on reaction) do not 
appear to explain the event. 
Adverse events and SAEs also wil l be assessed for their potenti al relationship to the protocol. 
A protocol-related AE is one that is not related to the test article but is considered by the 
investigator or the medical mo nitor (or designee) to be related to the research conditions, ie, 
related to the fact that a subject is part icipating in the stud y. For example, a protocol-related 
AE may be an untoward event rela ted to a medical procedure requ ired by the protocol. 
8.19.3 Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of  an AE will be classified using t he following criteria: 
 Mild:  These events are usually transient, require minimal or n o treatment, and do not 
interfere with the subj ect’s daily activities. 
 Moderate:  These events result i n a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate e vents may cause some interferen ce with normal 
functioning but pose no significant or permanent risk of harm. 
 Severe:  These events interrupt  a subject’s usual daily activit y and may require 
systemic drug therapy o r other treatment. S evere events are usu ally incapacitating. 
 
Changes in the severity of an A E should be documented as a new event to allow an 
assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intens ity to be performed. 
8.19.4 Laboratory Findings  
Protocol-defined safety laborat ory test results will be analyze d as part of specific laboratory 
safety analyses. Additional laboratory test results at other ti mepoints may be available to the 
investigator as part of standard clinical practice. Throughout the study, laboratory-related abnormalities should be recorded a s AEs only if considered clin ically significan t, outside the 
range of expected values given the s ubject’s Baseline assessmen ts and clinical course, and 
not known to be part of another AE diagnosis. 
8.19.5 Worsening or Progression of Disease Under Study  
Worsening or progression of N TM pulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium abscessus  
including worsening of baseline  symptoms, sho uld not be recorded as an AE unless the 
worsening/progression also meets t he criteria for a serious AE (in which case the event also 
should be reported as an SAE). If worsening or progression of d isease under study requires 
additional antibiotic therapy, subject will be discontinued fro m test article and this reason for 
discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF.  8.19.6 Pregnancies  
To ensure subject safety, each pr egnancy in a subject on test a rticle must be r eported to the 
sponsor within 1 business day of l earning of its occurrence. Test article should be 
discontinued immediately, and the  pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome,

Confidential and Proprietary Page 45 of 68 including spontaneous or voluntar y termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or mate rnal and/or newborn 
complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a C linical Trial Pregnancy Form  and reported by the 
investigator to the sponsor. Pre gnancy follow-up should be reco rded on the same form and 
should include an assessment of the possible rela tionship to th e test article of any pregnancy 
outcome. Any SAE experienced duri ng pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report 
Form. 
8.20 Concomitant Medication Assessments  
The investigator should instruct the subject to notify the stud y site about any new 
medications they take after the start of the test article. All prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and recre ational drugs taken within the 
timeframe defined in the entry c riteria prior to the start of t he study and during the study, 
must be recorded in the eCRF. M edication entries should be specific to trade name, the single 
dose and unit, the frequency and route of administration, the start and discontinuation dates 
or indication that the medicat ion continues, and the reason for therapy.  
8.21 Subject Discontinuation or Withdrawal  
Reasons why a subject may discont inue or be withdrawn from the study include, but are not 
limited to, AE, worsening of dise ase under study, lost to follo w up, withdrawal by subject, 
physician decision, death, and othe r (specify reason eg, subjec t non-complianc e or study 
termination by the sponsor). Subjects may volunta rily withdraw from the study for any 
reason at any time. Subjects are c onsidered withdrawn from the study if they state an 
intention to withdraw , or fail to return for visits, or become lost to follow up for any other 
reason. In the event a subject i s lost to follow-up, every poss ible effort should be made to 
contact the subject and determin e the reason for discontinuation as local law permits. The 
due diligence measures taken mus t be documented in the subject’ s source documents. If 
premature withdrawal from the study occurs, the investigator should determine the primary 
reason for a subject’s premature withdrawal fro m the study and record the date and primary 
reason on the eCRF. Subjects who di scontinue study treatment pr ematurely should complete 
the EOT visit and Safety Follo w-up assessment, if possible (see  Schedule of Assessments – 
Appendix 1). Exceptions to this include s ubjects who withdraw consent or are considered lost 
to follow-up after appropriate  due diligence measures have been  taken. 
Site personnel must al so contact the IxRS to register the subje ct’s discontinuation from test 
article. 
For subjects who are lost to f ollow up, the investigator should  show “due diligence” by 
documenting in the source documen ts the steps taken to contact the subject (eg, dates of 
telephone calls, registe red letters, etc).

10.1 Study Completion and Po st-study Test Article  
A subject will have successfully completed the study after the planned test article regimen 
has been administere d, and all assessments and visits have been  performed up through the 
final Follow-up assessment. The study will be completed when th e last subject has either 
discontinued or complete d the Follow-up assessment. 
No long-term follow up of subjects  is planned, with the excepti on of pregnancies, as 
described in Section 8.19.6, and SAEs described in Section 8.15 . 
Sites will be notified by either the sponsor or IxRS to stop en rollment when the desired 
number of treated subjects have been enrolled. Sub jects already  consented, but not yet 
randomized, will be allowed to cont inue screening procedures. 
Upon study completion, the investig ator will provide the sponso r, IRB/IEC/REB, and 
regulatory agency with final re ports and summaries as required by regulations. The 
investigator must submit a written report to the sponsor and th e IRB/IEC/REB within 
3 months after the completion o r termination of the study. 
10.2 Study Suspension or Termination  
The sponsor may suspend or termin ate the study or part of the s tudy at any time for any 
reason. Should termination be n ecessary, subjects should be see n as soon as possible and 
treated as described in Section 8.21 for prematurely withdrawn subjects. The investigator 
may be informed of additional pr ocedures to be followed to ensu re that adequate 
consideration is give n to the protection of t he subject’s inter ests. The investigator will be 
responsible for informing IRBs a nd/or Ethics Committees of the early termination of the 
study. 
If the investigator suspends or  prematurely terminates their pa rticipation in the study, the 
investigator will promptly infor m the sponsor and the IRB/IEC/REB and provide them with a 
detailed written explanation. S ubjects should be seen as soon a s possible and treated as 
described in Section 8.21  for prematurely withdr awn subjects. The investigator will also  
return all test articles, conta iners, and other study materials  to the sponsor.

Confidential and Proprietary Page 49 of 68 12 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 General Considerations  
All analyses of data for this study will comply w ith Internatio nal Council on Harmonisation 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements fo r Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use 
(ICH-E9) and the sponsor’s guidanc e documents and standards. St atistical analyses will be 
performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS®). 
The statistical analysis plan (SA P) incorporating the sections below, along with mock tables, 
figures, and listings shells, w ill be prepared, approved, and finalized by the sponsor prior to 
database lock. This plan will define populations for analysis, outline all data handling 
conventions, and specify statist ical methods to be used for ana lysis of safety and efficacy. 
Descriptive statisti cs, including the numbers and percentages f or categorical variables, and 
the numbers, means, standard devi ation, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous 
variables will be provided. Exploratory analyses may also be pe rformed. Listings of 
individual subject’s da ta will be produced. 
All eCRFs must be completed, entered, and source-data verified;  all safety and microbiology 
laboratory results must have bee n reported; all AEs must have b een fully characterized (eg, 
relationship to test article de termined) and coded; and all que ries must have been resolved 
prior to database lock and unbli nding. Determination of inclusi on in the analysis populations, 
characterization of protocol devi ations as majo r/minor, and fin al approval of the SAP will 
also be completed pri or to database lock. 
12.2 Determination of Sample Size  
As the study is exploratory wit h respect to determination of ef ficacy, the sample size 
determination is provided to bett er ensure sufficient subjects are enrolled to provide an initial 
assessment of efficacy rather th an test a specific hypothesis. A sample size of 75 subjects will 
provide approximately 80% power t o detect an absolute treatment  difference of 30% in 
clinical response rate at Day 84, based on clinical response ra tes of 15% and 45% in the 
placebo and omadacycline treatm ent groups respectively, using a  Mantel-Haenszel test with 
2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
12.3 Analysis Populations  
The following subject analysis  sets have been defined: 
 Intent-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set includes all randomized subj ects. 
 Per-Protocol Analysis Set incl udes all randomized subjects who received at least 
1 dose of test article and comple ted the study without major pr otocol deviations that 
affect the assessment of efficacy. 
 Safety Analysis Set includes al l subjects who received at least 1 dose of test article.

Demographics (including age, ge nder, ethnicity, and race) and b aseline characteristics will be 
summarized in the ITT Anal ysis Set by treatment group.  
Descriptive statistics of the duration of test article treatmen t will be provi ded by treatment 
group in the ITT and Safety Analysi s Sets. The number and perce ntage of subjects who 
prematurely disconti nued test article and t he reason for discon tinuation as well as the number 
and percentage of subjects premat urely discontinuing the study and the primary reason for 
discontinuation will be presented by treatment group in the ITT  Analysis Set. 
12.5 Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The study is exploratory with res pect to efficacy determination . Efficacy will be evaluated 
based on endpoints defined by subjec t-reported NTM symptoms, subject-reported outcomes 
and quality of life measures, and microbiologic assessment. Add itional endpoints to assess 
efficacy will be defined in the S AP. Nominal p-values will be provided as descriptive 
statistics. 
12.5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary determination of eff icacy is based on subject asses sment of symptoms. Several 
definitions of clinical response will be defined, including but not limited to those listed in 
Section 4 ; all definitions will be  provided in the SAP.  
For each definition, the number a nd percentage of s ubjects with a clinical response and no 
clinical response will be summarized by treatment group in the ITT Analysis Set. Exact 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the po int estimates of the clinical response rates in 
each treatment group will be dete rmined using the Clopper-Pears on method. The odds ratio 
(omadacycline relative to placeb o) and p-value will be calculat ed using Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test, stratified by prior antibiotic use. The estimand attributes for clinical response will be provided in detail in the  SAP. In general, clinical res ponse will use bot h a treatment 
and composite policy strategy for  handling intercurrent events.  Subjects who receive 
alternative antibiotic therapy for  treatment of the NTM infecti on and/or die before reaching 
Day 84 will be considered as not achieving clinical response. S ubjects with missing data due 
to withdrawal of consent will also be considered as not achievi ng clinical response. 
Analyses will be repeated in the P er-Protocol Analysis Set as d etailed in the SAP. 
12.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
12.5.2.1 Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life

the point estimate of the percenta ge of subjects of subjects wi th a decrease in mycobacterial 
load in each treatment group will be determined using the Clopp er-Pearson method. The odds 
ratio (omadacycline relative to placebo) and p-value will be ca lculated using 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test , stratified by prior antibiotic us e. 
Kaplan-Meier methods will be utilized to determine the time to growth in liquid media only 
and time to first negative sputum  culture in the ITT Analysis S et. Time to growth in liquid 
medium only will be defined as the number of days from the date of test article 
administration to the date of the  first assessment where growth  is detected in liquid medium 
only. Time to first negative sputum culture is defined as the n umber of days from the date of 
test article administration to t he date of the first negative sputum culture. S ubjects who died, 
withdrew, or took alternative antib iotic therapy for treatment of the NTM infection prior to 
growth in liquid medium only or negative sputum will be censore d at the date of the death, 
study withdrawal, or the start date of the alternative antibiot ic therapy respectively. The 
median, 25th and 75th percentile for time to growth in liquid media and time to firs t negative 
sputum culture will be provided with 2-sided 95% CIs. A p-value  will be determined using a 
log-rank test. 
12.6 Safety Endpoint(s)  
All safety data will be analyzed  in the Safety Analysis Set. Ad verse events will be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary of R egulatory Activities. The incidence of treatment-emergent 
adverse events will be presented by system organ class (SOC) an d preferred term (PT), by 
SOC, PT and relationship to tes t article, and by SOC, PT and severity. Serious AEs and 
treatment-emergent adverse events that lead to discontinuation of the test artic le will also be 
presented by SOC and PT. Descriptiv e statistics fo r clinical laboratory, vital signs, and ECG 
parameters, including change fro m baseline, will be presented b y timepoint collected and for 
the overall most abnormal post-ba seline value (for clinical lab oratory and vitals sign 
parameters). Incidences of poten tially clinicall y significant c linical laboratory results, vital 
signs and ECG parameters as defined in the SAP, will also be summarized by timepoint collected and the overall most a bnormal post-baseline value (fo r clinical laboratory and vital 
sign parameters).

13.5 Direct Access, Data Handling,  and Record Keeping  
13.5.1 Investigator  
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC/REB review, and 
regulatory inspections by providi ng direct access to source data and documents. 
All information will be recorded on source documents. All requi red data will be recorded in 
the eCRFs. 
13.5.2 Sponsor  
The data are entered into an ele ctronic database via eCRFs. The  sponsor medical monitor 
reviews the data for safety inf ormation. The data are reviewed for completeness and logical 
consistency. Automated valida tion checks identify missing data,  out-of-range data, and other 
data inconsistencies. The cen tral safety and microbiology data will be processed 
electronically. Requests for data  clarification are forwarded t o the study site for resolution. 
13.6 Protocol Adherence  
13.6.1 Violations/Deviations  
Investigators will agree to apply due diligence to avoid protoc ol deviations. Under no 
circumstances should the investig ator contact the sponsor or it s agents to request approval of 
a prospective protocol devia tion, as no authorized deviations a re permitted. If th e investigator 
feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the stu dy this must be considered a 
protocol amendment and it cannot be implemented unless such an amendment is agreed upon 
by the sponsor and approved by the I RB/IEC/REB. All significant protocol deviations will be 
recorded and reported in th e Clinical Study Report. 
13.6.2 Protocol Amendments  
Any change or addition to the protoc ol can only be made in a wr itten protocol amendment 
that must be approved by the spons or, Health Authorities where required, and the 
IRB/IEC/REB. Only amendments tha t are required for subject safe ty may be implemented 
prior to IRB/IEC/REB approval. N otwithstanding the need for app roval of formal protocol 
amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety 
of any subject included in this st udy, even if this  action repr esents a deviation from the

 Sputum Induction Guidelines 
Introduction 
Collection of adequate sputum sam ples (approximately 5 mL) is critical. Sputum samples 
will be collected by the subject (at home) and/or at the study site. In the event the subject is 
unable to spontaneously expector ate the required volume of sput um, induction may be 
performed at the study site by qua lified site staff. This guidance document is intended to 
provide recommendations for obtaining an adequate sputum sample  via sputum induction. 
Recommended Equipment 
 Standard handheld nebulizer – t horoughly cleaned and disinfecte d 
 Sputum specimen containers with labels 
 Sputum collection tubes (provided by the Central Laboratory) 
 Hypertonic sodium chloride soluti on (at minimum 3%, plus 5% and 7% if needed) 
 Other clinic supplies (eg, disin fectant/germicidal/alcohol wipe s, gloves, masks, 
tissues, paper towels, etc.) 
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS TO SPUTUM INDUCTION 
 This procedure should not be performed in subjects in which sev ere coughing may be 
harmful, such as subjects with: o Recent or recurrent hemoptysis 
o Acute respiratory distress 
o Acute hypoxia (SaO
2 in room air of < 90%) 
o Known pneumothorax 
o Rib fractures or chest wall musculoskeletal injury 
o Unstable cardiac conditions 
o Recent eye surgery 
 
Instructions: 
Preparation 
 Subjects should be instructed not to eat at least 1 hour prior to sputum induction. 
 Subjects should be informed of the purpose of this procedure be fore commencing.  
 The procedure should be discussed with the subject: 
o They will experience a salty taste in their mouth 
o They may cough 
o They will likely produce lung secretions that they will need to  expectorate 
o If they have pre-existing hyperre active airways eg, asthma, the y will receive 
pre-medication with an inhaled bronchodilator 
 Sputum induction should occur in a private, contained room, fol lowing clinic 
processes to ensure sterilizati on and prevent contamination.  
 Site staff performing induction should wear gloves and an N95 m ask for the duration 
of the procedure.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 64 of 68  All collection containers should ha ve a sputum collection label  completed with 
subject identifiers (ie: sub ject #, visit ID, collection date a nd time). 
 The induction procedure should sta rt with using lower concentra tions of saline (eg, 
3%) as per the investigator’s  discretion. Approximately 3-6 mL of hypertonic saline 
should be placed in the nebulizer. 
 Subjects should be sitting up or  in a semi-fowler position. 
 
Nebulization 
 Nebulization time is approximate ly 10 minutes in total, with br eaks in nebulization at 
5-minute intervals or if the pati ent has respiratory distress, excessive coughing. 
 Nebulization may extend to 15 minut es if the patient is in no d istress and more 
sputum needs to be collected. 
 Nebulization should stop at 15 min utes total time, even if inad equate sputum is 
collected. 
 The saline concentration may be i ncreased to a maximum of 7% per investigator 
discretion. 
 Subjects should be instructed to b reathe slowly and deeply (pau sing at peak 
inspiration) through the nebuliz er mouthpiece in haling the sali ne mist.  
 If the subject needs to expector ate during nebulization, turn off the nebulizer and 
allow the subject to expector ate into the container. 
o If a sufficient specime n is collected, procedure can stop.  
o If an insufficient volume of sput um is collected, the subject s hould resume the 
nebulization treatment and compl ete the full 15-minute duration  in three 
5-min intervals.  
 Subjects should be encouraged to b low their nose as needed during the induction to 
help prevent nasal secretions from becoming mix ed with the sput um specimen. 
 Upon completion, subjects should take a few deep breaths, swall ow the extra saliva in 
their mouth and attempt to forcefully cough up a sputum sample into a sputum 
container. The container should be  closed immediately after the  appropriate volume 
of sputum (approximate ly 5 mL) is collected. 
 Closely monitor the subject for t olerability issues or side eff ects. 
 The sputum sample should be ref rigerated until it is sent to th e central specialty

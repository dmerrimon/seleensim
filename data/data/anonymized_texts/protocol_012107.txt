Enrolling Participants:  Enrolling  sites will recruit participants. These sites will collaborate with o utpatient practices 
within ECHO ISPCTN states that provide primary care services to children (<18 years old). 
Sites will serve a population base of at least 40% Medicaid/uninsured children, <60% non -
Hispanic White children, or >40% of families residing in rural communities . Sites are 
encouraged, but not required, to have a high Spanish -speaking population . 
Description of 
Study Intervention:  • Vaccine Uptake App:  24-week (8 weeks with weekly push notifications; 2 monthly 
push notifications for 2 months  [1 notification per month]; 8 weeks without) exposure 
to a mobile phone application (app) designed to improve parental knowledge, 
attitudes, and self -efficacy regarding pediatric COVID -19 vaccination. The app will 
address logistical and motivational barriers to pediatric COVID -19 vacci nation. 
Participants will also receive eight weekly nudges (cues to action) regarding vaccinating their child that will be sent to partic ipants via push notifications to their 
mobile devices. Through branching logic, users will access content tailored to their 
COVID -19 vaccine knowledge and confidence gaps, locality, degree of rurality -
urbanicity, primary language (English/Spanish), race/et hnicity, and child’s age.   
• General Health App: 24 -week ( 8 weeks with weekly push notifications; 2 monthly 
push notifications for 2 months [1 notification per month] ; 8 weeks without ) exposure 
to a mobile phone app designed to provide information on general pediatric health 
and infection prevention and mitigation strategies based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention  (CDC) . Nudges regarding these topics will be sent to participants via push 
notifications to their mobile devices.

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 19 of 73 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
The research objective of the current proposal is to determine the effectiveness of a vaccine communication 
mHealth app on parental decisions to vaccinate their children against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). The 
COVID -19 pandemic inflicts disproport ionate harm on individuals from underserved communities, including 
those in rural settings. Maximizing vaccine uptake in these communities will decrease infection rates, severe 
illness, and death. Given that most US families from rural communities use smart phones (80% overall, 7 6% of 
families earning <$30,000/year) and have home internet (72% overall, 57% of families earning <$30,000/year),1 
mHealth interventions hold the promise of broad uptake to these populations. Bundling multiple proven 
mHealth vaccine -uptake interventions into a single app may maximize the impact of deploying such a tool to 
increase COVID -19 vaccination. The new knowled ge gained from the completion of this study will directly inform 
future efforts to increase COVID -19 vaccination rate s across diverse settings and provide an evidentiary base for 
app-based vaccine communication tools that can be adapted to future vaccine -deployment efforts.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
Introduction  
COVID -19 vaccines demonstrate excellent effectiveness (50 -90%) against infection and symptomatic disease, 
and more importantly, almost 100% protection from severe disease and death,2,3 including from newer 
circulating variants. However, nearly 3 in 10 Americans state they probably or definitely will not get vaccinated, and many I deA states have higher rates of COVID -19 vaccine refusal.
4 Moreover, individuals from Black and 
Hispanic communities express higher vaccine hesitancy, despite experiencing significa ntly worse disease burden 
and mortality.5-8 The NIH has identified these vulnerable populations, as well as individuals from rural, medically 
underserved, and migrant communities, as high priorities for vaccination and vaccine communication efforts.9 
Key goals of vaccine communication highlighted by the NIH include: (1) providing assurance of vaccine safety; (2) 
highlighting collective and individual benefits to vaccination; (3) explaining the vaccine development and 
approval process; (4) addressing v accine  hesitancy; and (5) monitoring and countering misinformation. These 
communication objectives require tailoring to specific target audiences to be effective and must, therefore: (1) leverage close community partnerships to identify relevant information need s and cultural context; and (2) 
employ scalable and impactful communication strategies that encourage vaccination across diverse segments of 
the population. The proposal will also leverage the previous work of the study team and resources developed by 
the NIH Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL).

COVID -19 Vaccines for Children  
From December 11 through May 10, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the emergency 
use authorization (EUA) of the COVID -19 vaccine for individuals and adolescents as young as 12 years of age. 
Currently, the Pfizer BioNTech COVID -19 vac cine is the only vaccine authorized by the FDA for use in children in 
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial

Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 20 of 73 ages 6 months and older, which includes 2 - and 3 -dose series for some age groups and vaccine formulations ..11 
SARS- CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID -19 disease, has infected more than 3 million children and killed more 
than 300 children. High COVID -19 vaccination coverage among children is critical to lessen the public health 
burden on children’s physical, menta l, and social health.12,13 
Parents/caregivers vary in their confidence/hesitancy to vaccinate their children against SARS -CoV-2.14 
While there is a good amount of literature on adults and vaccine hesitancy, there is much less information about 
children . A recent nationally representative study of parents ’ intentions  and perceptions of COVID -19 
vaccination was published by Szilagyi et al.14 The survey covered February 17 to March 30, 2021. In that survey, 
a parent’s race and ethnicity were associated with the likelihood of their child getting vaccinated with 44% of 
parents who we re White and 47% of parents who were Black answering somewhat or very unlikely to vaccinate 
their child  versus 42% overa ll and 36% of parents who were Hispanic and 35% of A sian American. Age of parent 
and of th eir child w ere associated with younger ages being more likely to answer somewhat or very un likely to 
vaccinate their child. The most trusted source of information about the COVID -19 vaccine was the child’s doctor, 
with 72% of parents indicating that they completely or mostly trust their child’s doctor.  Interestingly, 50% 
indicated trust in the CDC and 48% in the AAP. No other source of information approached 50%.  When these 
results were analyzed controlling for parent and child factors, parent perceptions , child receipt of influenza 
vaccine and parental receipt of COVID -19 vaccine, trust in the child’s doc tor remained significant while other 
parent and child factors , including child’s age and race/ethnicity were no longer significant predictors of 
indicating very likely or likely to get a vac cine for the ir child.  It is worth noting that,  among adults , intent to 
vaccinate has changed and gotten more positive over time.14, 15 
Vaccine Hesitancy is Higher in Rural Communities and ISPCTN States, which are an Ideal Setting for Testing the Effectiveness of an mHealth Vaccine Uptake App  
The Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes I deA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ECHO 
ISPCTN) includes 18 states from geographically diverse areas of the US.
16 Unfortunately, most ISPCTN states 
report lower than average rates of COVID -19 vaccine uptake, as shown in Figure 2. Many ECHO ISPCTN states 
have a disproportionately high number of rural residents compared with non -ISPCTN states, and COVID -19 
vaccine hesitancy —and vaccine coverage rates —lag significantly in  rural communities across the US when 
compared to their non -rural counterparts17; only 39% of rural Americans are vaccinated versus 46% of urban 
Americans. Community feedback from ECHO ISPCTN sites highlights significant vaccine hesitancy and barriers to COVID -19 vaccination. For example,
 community advisory board feedback from stakeholders in rural Nebraska 
emphasizes that access to COVID -19 vaccine among eligible children and their families, particularly those with 
low English fluency, is very low. Additionally, there is significant concer n from community members regarding 
the safety of COVID -19 vaccines. In Mississippi, surveys of rural families across diverse racial and ethnic 
backgrounds demonstrate very high levels of COVID -19 vaccine hesitancy, and in some higher -risk groups such 
as rural Black families, 40% or more of respondents may be vaccine hesitant. Hesitancy among rural Black 
individuals in Mississippi aligns with findings of lower vaccine uptake nationally. Overall, 32% of Black Americans 
are vaccinated against COVID -19 versus 45% of White Americans.18

PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 21 of 73 Based on these findings, further focus group data on COVID -19 vaccine motivators, barriers, and sources of 
hesitancy are being obtained by ECHO ISPCTN sites to identify targets for intervention, especially among Black 
and Hispanic parents from both rural a nd non -rural areas as well as rural White parents. The study team will use 
this information for customizing the mHealth Vaccine Uptake app, as outlined in Section 8 below. We expect the data from this qualitative study to be available well in advance of th e start of this randomized control trial.  
Finally, the ISPCTN has established a strong record of clinical trials conduct in behavioral, clinical, and 
telemedicine- based interventions. Most relevant to this protocol, the iAmHealthy feasibility  trial, whose co -
Principal Investigator ( PI) is a co -investigator on the current protocol, enrolled rural children and parents into a 
24-week telemedicine- based behavioral health intervention, achieved goal enrollment of 104 parent -child dyads 
and retention rates >85% over the study period. Thus, conducting vac cine communication research within the 
ISPCTN provides a unique opportunity to determine the effectiveness of interventions in states and communities 
experiencing disproportionately low COVID -19 vaccine uptake while building upon a strong record of 
accompl ishment for successfully fielding technology -based behavioral intervention trials.

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 23 of 73 2.3 GUIDING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK: THE HEALTH BELIEF MODEL  
Many factors contribute to an individual’s decision to engage in a health promotion or disease prevention 
activity. The Health Belief Model (HBM), first developed in the early 1950s, provides an organizing framework to 
understand people’s health behavior decisions.19 The HBM relies on the assumption that individuals’ health 
decisions stem from a desire to avoid and/or recover from illness and an individual’s belief that they can take specific actions to prevent, cure, or reduce the severity of illness. The HBM has bee n used to assess vaccine 
hesitancy for other vaccines, including influenza and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines.
20,21 Specific 
components of the HBM are summarized in Figure 3.  
The HBM provides an 
organizational framework 
for understanding the 
considerations of parents 
and caregivers in deciding 
whether to vaccinate their children against COVID -19. 
HBM constructs as applied to parental COVID -19 
vaccine decision making include:  
1. Perceived susceptibility 
of their children being 
infected with SARS -CoV-2. 
2. Perceived severity of COVID -19 disease or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS -C) in their 
children.  
3. Perceived benefits that their children may experience from receiving a COVID -19 vaccine.  
4. Perceived barriers (both attitudinal and logistic) that parents/caregivers may have to obtaining COVID -19 
vaccination for their children.  
5. Cues to action (personal stories/vignettes, advice, and prompts received from others, including social norms) to trigger a parent/caregiver to vaccinate their children against COVID -19. 
6. Self-efficacy or belief in one’s own capacity to complete the steps necessary to vaccinate their children 
against COVID -19 (e.g., identifying a vaccination site, scheduling an appointment, arranging transportation, 
being able to pay, etc.).  
Other individual and community -level factors may influence the above elements, including race, ethnicity, and 
education level, among others. mHealth vaccine communication apps can address multiple domains of the 
Health Belief Model simultaneously and hold the potential for customization to incorporate relevant  Figure 3.  Health Belief Model components.  

Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 24 of 73 community, cultural, and/or individual factors,22 which should improve the effectiveness of the app to increase 
COVID -19 vaccination rates among app users.  
mHealth Tools Can Increase Vaccine Confidence and Vaccination Rates  
mHealth tools such as mobile apps and decision support tools demonstrate the potential to positively affect 
vaccination rates.23-26 In an Italian study of a smartphone app to increase parents’ knowledge and empowerment 
when deciding to vaccinate their child against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), use of the smartphone app 
increased parental knowledge and confidence in choosing MMR vaccination and increased parental reported intention to vaccinate. However, actual immunization actions taken after the inte rvention period were not 
measured. Similarly, in a cluster- randomized trial of a web -based decision aid for informing parental decision -
making about MMR vaccination, the web -based tool, when compared to a leaflet intervention, was associated 
with lower par ental -reported decisional conflict and higher vaccination rates among parents deciding whether 
to give the first dose of MMR vaccine to their child. A follow -up study of the web -based tool also found it more 
cost-effective than traditional approaches.  
Cues to action, which can include behavioral nudges, are a proven effective means of increasing vaccine uptake in various settings.
27,28 Text messages and voice phone calls can serve as effective prompts to action, and such 
prompts maximize their impact when they include customized information relevant to the individual recipient. In a large field experiment conducted in the US, text messa ge nudges alone increased flu vaccination rates 
among 49,000 participants by 5%. Nudges were most effective when they we re phrased as there being a vaccine 
reserved for a participant’s child and when they used language that would be expected to come from their 
healthcare provider.  
Narrative messaging and vignettes can also serve as prompts to action. Narrative messaging can present 
information to users in a culturally congruent context and has been shown to increase vaccination rates, 
particularly in HPV vaccination.
29,30 A systematic review of educational interventions for increasing HPV 
vaccination identified two interventional trials that evaluated the impact of narrative stories on vaccination 
outcomes at up to 2 months. In one study, adolescent participants who viewed  narrative videos featuring peers 
and experts were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those viewing other message formats.31  
Tailored messaging, including culturally congruent storytelling,  can provide information to users in a less 
threatening and more relatable format by using likable characters with similarities to the end -user. Such 
messaging can engender an emotional connection, which may help persuade individuals to engage in recommended health behaviors.
32 Another example of using narrative interventions to promote vaccine uptake 
is the CANImmunize app, originally piloted as ImmunizeCA.24,33 The CANImmunize app, used in Ca nada to assist 
in tracking of vaccination status and to deliver information on vaccines to users, includes video education and personal endorsements for vaccines, combined with push notifications, medical records keeping, and self -
directed learning to incr ease vaccination uptake. Initial reports suggest high usage of the tool, including 
narrative elements, but controlled trials of the CANImmunize app on vaccination rates are lacking.

PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 25 of 73 In summary, prior research highlights the potential impact of several mHealth interventions to increase vaccine 
acceptance and uptake. However, findings from these studies may not be directly applicable to COVID -19 
vaccination. Prior mHealth -based interven tional and large -scale clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of 
mHealth vaccine -uptake tools are generally lacking. Given that national efforts to use mHealth tools to increase 
vaccine uptake have been deployed in other countries,33 establishing an e videntiary base for their effectiveness 
may have major public health program development and implementation implications. Additionally, prior interventions focus on vaccines that had been licensed through the standard FDA approval process following 10 to 15 years of research and development. By contrast, COVID -19 vaccines are only available to some US age 
groups under FDA EUA to facilitate the availability of unapproved medical treatments during public health 
emergencies. EUA for the first COVID -19 vaccines  came after an unprecedented 1 year of development and 
testing. Multiple surveys demonstrate that the newness of these vaccines raises safety concerns for many individuals. Finally, many mHealth interventions lack customization for specific community - and/ or individual -
level factors that may influence vaccine decision -making, such as race, ethnicity, or geography (such as rurality). 
Our mHealth Vaccine Uptake app uniquely combines several proven effective methods for increasing 
vaccination rates with user c ustomization to increase pediatric COVID -19 vaccination rates across diverse 
settings.  
 
 
2.4 EVIDENCE OF CAPABILITY: THE CHILDREN’S COVID -19 STUDENT SYMPTOM CHECKER AND 
MHEALTH SOFTWARE PLATFORM  
The co -Pis of this protocol have extensive experience developing and deploying customizable mHealth clinical 
decision support apps for healthcare providers. These apps have been used by >50,000 users and incorporate 
user analytics that enable assessment of engagemen t with the app.34-36 We have also created customizable 
mHealth apps for COVID -19 infection response decision -making for parents (COVID -19 Student Symptom 
Checker) that, in partnership with community stakeholders and school districts, have been translated i nto 
multiple languages, including Spanish and Nepali (Figure 4).

PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 26 of 73 These apps were built using software 
and data infrastructure developed at and owned by the University of 
Nebraska Medical Center  (UNMC) . The 
important functionalities of the 
previous two apps that will also be deployed for the Vaccine Uptake app 
in the current protocol are:  
1. Customization at both the local institution and individual user 
levels for an experience that is uniquely tailored to each user’s local context and personal background.  
2. A development environment that enables content viewing in multiple languages.  
3. A content management interface that enables rapid content modification and updates.  
4. Push notifications to participants to trigger app usage.  
5. Back -end analytics to measure user interactions with app components.  
Further details of the functionality of our mHealth tool are outlined in Section 8 below.

PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 27 of 73 Preliminary data since release of the COVID -19 
Student Symptom Checker app in August 2020 
shows that these tools demonstrate broad 
uptake and use across diverse racial and 
ethnic backgrounds, with more than 85% of eligible households having registered for the tool. The median weekly number of students 
screened by the app was 7,000 (Figures 5a & 
b). User feedback demonstrated that parents 
used the app to make decisions on whether to 
obtain SARS -CoV-2 testing and whether to 
send their children to school. Fee dback from 
school districts showed that school nurses and 
principals used the app to help them counsel parents regarding school attendance and to review components of school response plans included within the app.  
Finally, members of our team have experience 
developing and testing the effectiveness of 
vaccine communication interventions. 
Specifically, Dr. Paul Darden has assessed the 
impact of text messaging interventions on 
HPV vaccination rates
37; conducted 
prospective clinical trials of multi- modal, 
clinic -based interventions to increase HPV 
vaccination rates38; and assessed parental 
perceptions of barriers to vaccination through the Pediatric Research in Outpatient Settings (PROS) Network, a national practice -based 
research network.
39  
In summary, our team has the expertise in mHealth tool development and deployment, clinical trials conduct, and vaccine communication to conduct the proposed study.

3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
This study poses minimal risk to participants  (see definition of participants in Abbreviations & Definitions).  
Participants (in both the Vaccine Uptake app and General Health app arms) will provide protected health 
information (PHI) (e.g., children’s names, dates of birth, and dates of vaccination) to the study team. While the 
study team will make every effort to store this electronic information in secure electronic databases and 
physical documents in secure facilities, there remains a risk of accidental a s well as mandated disclosure of PHI.  
Participants will view content and answer questions related to the COVID -19 pandemic that may provoke some 
emotional stress or anxiety relating to the pandemic and/or COVID -19 vaccination.  
The study will expose participants to content providing guidance in accordance with the most current 
recommendations from the CDC /ACIP . This information is subject to change. While educational content for both 
arms will undergo revisions in real time, participants may not always choose to access updated information after the study team posts it. In addition, app content will likely recommend vaccination with the COVID -19 vaccine 
while it is still available under FDA EUA rather than FDA approval for some of the participants based on their 
age.  
3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Participants who receive the Vaccine Uptake app will receive self -directed, multi -format education on the 
COVID -19 vaccine, which may reduce participant stress and/or anxiety in decision making regarding whether 
their child should receive the COVID -19 vacci ne and increase their knowledge about vaccination.  
Caregiver participants who receive the Vaccine Uptake app will receive information on local resources for 
vaccinating their children against COVID -19, which may result in increased vaccination uptake among 
participants’ children.  
Caregiver participants who receive the General Health app will receive general health and infection prevention 
education, which may improve their own knowledge and risk reduction behaviors, which may decrease their 
own, and their children’s risk of contrac ting an infection and suffering the negative consequences from the 
infection.  
There is also  potential for benefit to other parents and their children in the future if the study demonstrates that 
the intervention provides an effective means of educating parents about and increasing pediatric uptake of COVID -19 vaccine.  
3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
We do not anticipate significant health risks to participants and will make every effort to minimize the possible risks described in Section 3.1. The benefit of understanding the effect of a vaccine -education mHealth tool on 
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 30 of 73 promoting pediatric COVID -19 vaccination uptake outweighs the risks. Standards of medical care provided to 
participants’ children will not be altered based on participants’ study -related activities.  
This protocol minimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly informing participants about risks  
(Section 3.1, above) s o that they can join in partnership with the researcher in recognizing and reporting harms; 
(b) having staff properly trained in administering study procedures that may cause psychological distress, such 
as survey administration; and (c) providing safety m onitoring.  
If the FDA issues new warnings or precautions or withdraws EUA/approval for any of the COVID -19 vaccines for 
any of the included pediatric age groups during the study, the study team will take responsive action. Actions will include prompt notification of participants via at least one of the following methods: app push notification, text message, phone call, email, registered mail, as well as possibly study termination depending on the severity of the concern, as determined by the P Is and data safety monitoring board (DSMB).

increase the number of children receiving a 
complete COVID -19 vaccine series since series 
completion provides children with maximal 
protection afforded by vaccination. Self -report of 
vaccination will not be used,  only verified 
vaccination records, to avoid introduction of recall 
and social desirability biases in the assessment of 
the endpoint. The study team will define vaccine 
series completion as per the current Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices  (ACIP ) 
guidance  for the vaccine product.  For children who 
receive a product that requires more than 2 doses 
for the primary series, receipt of up to 3  doses will 
be considered complete.

5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
This multi -site, parallel, randomized, controlled trial will assign parents/caregivers of children eligible to receive 
COVID -19 vaccine seen at participating clinics to receive either the mHealth Vaccine Uptake app or the General 
Health app containing gene ral infection and child health topics. Randomization will be stratified by site using a 
permuted block design with varying block size . Outcome is receipt of COVID -19 vaccine by the 
parents’/caregivers’ children.  
5.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
Rationale for a randomized trial:  Based on the Health Belief Model and prior evidence, factors contributing to 
individuals’ vaccine hesitancy, confidence, and/or refusal likely are multi -factorial and vary widely across 
individuals. Randomization of participants to the Vaccine Uptake or t he General Health app study arms, outlined 
further below, is designed to minimize selection bias of individuals with specific attitudes or beliefs into a single 
study arm. For example, individuals who have lower vaccine hes itancy may be at baseline more interested/open 
to participating in the Vaccine Uptake study arm, whereas individuals with greater hesitancy may be more likely 
to decline.40 This potential bias ideally will be minimized by having participants consent to engaging in whatever 
study arm to which they are randomly assigned.  
Rationale for using the mHealth app platform developed at UNMC in the intervention and control study arms: 
Most parents/caregivers, including those in rural areas, have access to a mobile device and the internet (see Section 2. 1, Background). Prior studies support the feasibility of deploying app -based interventions aimed at 
increasing vaccination rates. Based on community feedback and our team’s experience deploying app -based 
interventions for COVID -19 symptom screening, ensurin g that the app imposes a low  data burden is important 
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 32 of 73 to maximizing uptake. Consequently, the platform developed at the UNMC uses data at only four time points: 1) 
initial download/registration (approximately 200 -300 megabytes ), 2) recording of sessions (2 -3 
kilobytes/session ), 3) push notifications (2 -3 kilobytes/notification ), and 4) periodic updates (20 -30 
kilobytes/update). Thus, our mHealth app platform incurs a very low data demand, which minimizes the barrier to use for participants.  
Rationale for use of a control mHealth app:  Participants in the General Health app arm will receive access to an 
mHealth app to ensure similarity in access to intervention materials (e.g., sending out of a link to register for app access via the same platforms) and barriers to access (e.g., low tec hnology literacy, lack of an internet -capable 
device). The goal is to compare the impact of the customized, targeted content over generic information on an 
app, not the ability to access content on an educational app.

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 33 of 73 Limitations of using a mHealth control:  App content, even if not customized or vaccine -related, may still elevate 
vaccination rates above what they would be with no intervention due to reducing barriers to accessing general 
information about infection control and prevention.  
5.3 END OF STUDY DEFINITION  
The study will end for the participant after they have reached 29 weeks of enrollment and either completed 
their 24-week assessment or failed to complete it by week 2 9. 
6. STUDY POPULATION  
6.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
6.1.1 PARTICIPANTS  
For this study, there will be two sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria : 
1. Parents/caregivers who will receive either the Vaccine Uptake app  or General Health app  
2. Children of the above -mentioned parents/caregivers who are eligible to receive COVID -19 vaccine in 
their state  
Parent/caregiver inclusion criteria:   
• Age of majority, as defined by the state of residency  
• Access to a mobile device that can store and run the study app for 24  weeks. Devices that can run the 
app include mobile phones and tablets running Android or iOS operating systems  
• Able to speak and read in English or Spanish  
• Be a parent/caregiver with primary medical decision -making and legal authority to consent to 
vaccination decisions for at least one child who meets the child inclusion criteria  
Child inclusion criteria:   
o Age 6 months to less than age of majority, as defined by the child’s state of residence  
o Has not received any doses of COVID -19 vaccine based on parent/caregiver report  
o Eligible to receive COVID -19 vaccine  
o Patient at a participating clinic  
Rationale for parent/caregiver inclusion criteria:  Parent/caregiver vaccine confidence/acceptance will vary 
widely, ranging from those who firmly refuse the COVID -19 vaccine to those who strongly endors e the COVID -19 
vaccin e for their children. All parents/caregivers, regardless of baseline vaccine hesitancy/confidence, are 
eligible to participate in the study. Subject randomization is intended to balance the proportion of vaccine 
refusing/vaccine endorsing participants. Pare ntal vaccine hesitancy will not be assessed prior to enrollment. 
Such assessment may bias enrollment towards those individuals with greater vaccine acceptance through social

Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 34 of 73 desirability bias. Unlike vaccine -hesitant individuals, baseline vaccine refusing parents/caregivers are unlikely to 
be willing to participate in vaccine communication efforts and, therefore , will likely decline study participation 
during recruitment or informed consent.40 
Due to evolving COVID- 19 EUAs by age categories and variable availability of vaccine by state, the study team 
may rescreen parents who do not meet enrollment criteria at initial screening.  
6.1.2 SITES  
Participating clinics must meet all  the inclusion criteria:  
• Provide primary pediatric general healthcare to at least 100 unique pediatric patients in the last 12 
months; this can include family medicine clinics. Given that primary pediatric care in rural settings often 
occurs in family medicine clinics, including t hese clinics as potential performance sites will increase the 
generalizability of the findings  
• Have electronic health record (EHR) or billing database infrastructure to identify potential participants 
by reviewing the medical records of children within the study inclusion criterion of child -age range  
• Have ability to access their state’s COVID -19 vaccination registry  
• Meet at least one of the following diversity, equity, and inclusion criteria for the patient population 
served:  
o <60% non -Hispanic White;  
o >40% from a rural zip code as defined by rural -urban community area (RUCA) code ≥ 4; or  
o >40% on Medicaid/Medicare or uninsured . 
• Sites are encouraged, but not required , to ha ve a high Spanish -speaking population.  
Sites are not required to stock and administer pediatric COVID -19 vaccines to  serve as enrolling sites.  
6.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
6.2.1 PARTICIPANTS  
Parent/caregivers exclusion criteria:  
• Has only a child or children with known contraindication to all COVID -19 vaccines  
• Has only a child or children whose other parent/caregiver is already a current or past participant in the 
study  
• Has a child or children enrolled in any other COVID -19 vaccine study of any kind  
• Past or present participation in a COVID -19 vaccine or behavioral trial  
• Has cognitive impairment that limits their ability to engage with the app content and/or make medical 
decisions regarding vaccination, based on the site investigator’s assessment and local human subjects 
research policies  
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 35 of 73 Child exclusion criteria:  
• Not a patient of a participating  clinic  
• Prior receipt of least one dose of COVID- 19 vaccine  
• Receiving or scheduled to receive COVID -19 vaccination at the time of parental consent  
• Known medical contraindication to all COVID -19 vaccines  
• Ineligible to receive COVID -19 vaccine  
• Prior or current participation in a COVID -19 vaccine study of any kind  
 
Rationale for parent/caregiver exclusion criteria:  One or multiple parents/caregivers may have decision -making 
authority for a child’s vaccinations. Our primary outcome is the proportion of children who complete COVID -19 
vaccination, not individual parental decision -making. Additionally, although only one  parent/caregiver is 
enrolled, it is likely that information to which they are exposed during the course of the trial will be shared with 
another parent/caregiver who has decision -making authority if presen t. 
6.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
Participants will require sufficient access and literacy in technology to operate a mobile device and to download and interact with apps typically used on such devices. If participants have barriers in accessing sufficient Wi -Fi or 
mobile data bandwidth for initial app download (the only portion of app use anticipated to incur use levels above 1  mb), the enrollment visit will be arranged to take place somewhere with Wi -Fi to which the participant 
can freely connect.  
If participants change or lose their phone or change operating systems, participants can contact the App Team 
for technical support.  
 
7. RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, CONSENT, SCREENING, & ASSESSMENTS  
7.1 RECRUITMENT  
The target population will include all parents/caregivers meeting the inclusion criteria listed in Section 6 .1. 
Please see Section 11.2 for enrollment numbers. Recruitment methods will prioritize enrolling participants from 
rural and underrepresented racial and ethnic communities, as these communities have experienced 
disproportionately lower vaccination rates and  greater hardship due to the COVID -19 pandemic. T o address the 
issue of potentially underperforming sites and clinics , we will ask ISPCTN sites to  identify at least two clinics that 
can participate in the trial  to achieve a goal of 24 participating clinics . In addition, enrolling sites will over -recruit 
by 15% to account for participant withdrawals . We will also allow competitive enrollment across clinics to 
enable high -performing sites to contribute maximally to achieving goal overall study enrollment.  
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 36 of 73 Based on sample size estimates and weekly minimum recruitment goals, t he goal accrual is 60 parent/caregiver 
participants per site across 15 enrolling  sites  with approximately 2 participating  clinics per site . The a nticipated 
accrual rate is a minimum of 7 -8 participants per week per enrolling  site over a n 8-week recruitment period .  
Recruitment  for all enrolling sites will be competitive; there is no initial enrollment cap per enrolling site. 
Because of the compressed nature of recruitment, potential poor performance of enrolling sites must be 
addressed early in the recruitment process .  
Site investigators  and coordinators will meet weekly to review accrual. Sites will also receive weekly reports of 
enrollment performance, and high -performing sites will provide insights and support/mentorship for lower -
performing sites with the help of Data Coordinating and Operations Center ( DCOC ) and protocol leadership.  
Sites will be prompted to share best practices as well as issues with recruitment  during the weekly meetings . As 
part of recruitment, we will record how many subjects were approached, how  many declined and the reason for 
declining (e.g., out of age range, non -rural zip code, or declined)  using a log developed by the enrolling site 
research staff. These logs will be monitored overall and by site.  
At the end of each week of recruitment, the study team will assess accrual and make an explicit  decision about 
adjusting recruitment strategies. Additional strategies to achieve goal recruitment will include:  
1. Extend the recruitment window for all sites beyond the initial 8 -week period . 
2. Targeted supplemental advertising through social media and local media outlets  
Stopping rule: The project goal is to recruit at least 892 parents/caregivers during  the recruitment period. At 3 
months after study start, 20% of participants must be recruited. If recruitment does not meet this milestone, 
then the study P Is will report enrollment progress to the DSMB and obtain recommendations.  
7.1.1 INITIAL RECRUITMENT METHODS  
For efficiency, identification of potential participants will rely on several methods to capitalize on existing 
electronic health record databases and clinical workflows at study recruitment sites. Proposed identification methods include retrospective list s of recently seen patients and traditional advertisements for self- referral.  
• Retrospective.  Site coordinators (or other designated personnel) can  identify potential participants by 
reviewing a list of consecutively seen patients provided by participating clinics. The practice will develop the list from 12 months of patient -visit data (e.g., billing records). The site coordinator/designee will 
organ ize this list from more to less recent clinic visit dates and remove duplicate patients. The generated 
list will include patient zip code, race/ethnicity, and gender. Sites will be instruc ted to contact non -
White and/or rural participants first to help ensure diverse participant enrollment. DCOC will provide a list of rural (RUCA ≥4) zip codes based on the 7/13/2019 revision of the 2010 RUCA Codes crosswalk.
41 
• Traditional. Sites may engage in traditional clinical trial recruitment methods focused on participant 
self-identification. Sites can recruit participants through various methods, including, but not limited to, 
provider recommendation at appointment visits, electronic  health record messaging systems, and quick

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 37 of 73 response (QR) codes. DCOC will provide a menu of options from which sites can choose, such as flyers, 
email, or advertisements on social media in English and Spanish. The DCOC will obtain IRB approval for all recruitment materials. Recruitment materials wi ll provide information  to contact the site 
coordinator/designee for more information . During the consent process, site coordinators will ask 
participants recruited through the traditional method how they learned of the study.  
• In person recruitment . This type of recruitment is possible only for those sites  for which the research 
team is part of the participating clinic. The enrolling site research staff must be employed by the Institution under which the participating clinic is affiliated, before engaging in any research -related 
activities.  Refer to  section 7.4.2 for more details about this type of recruitment. The staff of the 
participating clinics cannot be involved in any research -related activities.  
 
Based on ECHO ISPCTN clinics’ recent experience with patient recruitment, we expect that the retrospective 
list method will have the highest yield. To allow research staff to contact potential participants, enrolling sites  will send an opt -out/opt -in letter to potential participants, which will have the participating clinic s’ logo 
and letterhead, and if possible, be signed by the lead clinicians . This letter will describe the study and inform 
families that research staff collaborating with the participating  clinic will contact them. If families do not 
wish the research team to contact them, the letter will ask participants to contact the enrolling site or participating  to opt out of being contacted about the study.  The letter sent to potential participants will 
include the following documents:  
• Opt-out/opt -in letter  
• Informed consent form ( ICF) with detailed description of the study  and with H ealth Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (H IPAA ) language embedded  (ICF+HIPAA)  
The research team will send the Opt -Out/Opt -In Letter and ICF+HIPAA by postal mail, e -mail, or other 
methods.  
7.1.2 RECRUITMENT STANDARDIZATIO N 
To ensure participant safety and consistent and high -quality data submission in compliance with protocol and 
study operations, the DCOC and study team will train enrolling  site study staff. The DCOC expects all enrolling  
site study staff to take responsibility for learning the study, primarily by studying the protocol and manual of procedures ( MOP ), to ensure compliance with the protocol and GCP. The enrolling  site study staff will receive 
training through the following methods: a mandatory training session  in the form of an Investigator Meeting, 
and as needed training in the form of one -on-one enrolling site-specific training and /or other targeted training. 
DCOC personnel will train all enrolling  site study staff on the protocol, reporting procedures for study deviations, 
potential study deviations, and noncompliance, as well as essential documentation for study conduct. The DCOC will train enrolling site study staff on in -person and tele informed consent processes and documentation.

Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 38 of 73 Enrolling  site study staff must document all training and provide the DCOC with this training documentation. The 
DCOC will train enrolling  site study staff on any relevant study electronic data capture (EDC) system(s) to ensure 
that staff understand how to utilize the system to perform study -specific data collection and other necessary 
processes.  
7.2 RETENTION  
User Acceptance Pilot Testing   
Prior to the start of participant enrollment, the apps for the Vaccine Uptake and General Health app arms will 
undergo pilot testing to optimize user acceptance. The re will be  approximately  5 testers from each of the 
following groups (total: 15):  
1. Self-identified rural (English -speaking)  
2. Self-identified non -rural (English -speaking)  
3. Spanish -speaking  
We will ensure that approximately  5 testers among the two English -speaking groups will  not be non -Hispanic 
White.  Each testing session will last one hour and will involve reviewing user workflow and formative feedback 
on app content, including appropriateness of customizations by race, ethnicity, and rurality. User acceptance 
testing participants will receive $20 per test in which they participate.  
Participant Remuneration.  Participants in the randomized trial will receive $20.00 for each assessment that is 
completed. There are four assessments, these will occur at baseline and weeks 8, 16, 24. The total 
compensation that participants may receive is $ 80.00. 
Study team activities to maximize participant retention include the following:  
• Enrolling  site coordinators will instruct participants to register in the app and will be available to refer 
participants to the Nebraska App Team if assistance is needed  
• Research  Team members will contact participants to confirm completion of app registration  
• Scheduled push notifications during weeks 1 -8 and then monthly for 2 months  will prompt participants 
to engage with in-app content  
• Ad hoc  push notifications regarding national and local updates to vaccine availability/eligibility will 
prompt participants to engage with in-app content  
• Enrolling  site coordinators will contact participants at weeks 8, 16,  and 24 for follow -up assessments  
• Enrolling  site coordinators will perform follow -up contact attempts for participants who do not 
complete their  assessments at weeks 8, 16, or 24 
• Contact methods for communicating with study participants will comprise multiple modalities, including 
(but not limited to): email, phone call, and/or text messages

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 39 of 73 7.3 SCREEN FAILURES AND RESCREENS  
7.3.1 SCREEN ING  PROCEDURE S AND SCREEN FAILURE S 
For potential participant s recruited with the retrospective method, s ite coordinators will contact (by phone  or 
other methods ) potential participants to briefly introduce the study. If potential participant s are interested in 
learning more about the study, site coordinator s will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria with potential 
participants to ensure they qualify . These data will be recorded by the research staff in the EDC.  If potential 
participant s are eligible, the site coordinator will perform  the consent process  as described in section 7. 4.1. 
Potential participant s should have received the ICF +HIPAA,  and they should have had time to read the 
documents.  
For potential participants recruited with the traditional method, site coordinator s will ask participants  if they 
would like to have a copy of the ICF +HIPAA form  sent to them  before discussing the study. If potential 
participant s agree to discuss the study without a hard or electronic copy of the ICF +HIPAA , site coordinator s will 
review the inclusion and exclusion criteria with potential participants to ensure they qualify. I f potential 
participant s are eligible, site coordinator s will perform the consent process , as described in section 7. 4.1.    
The study team will consider participants who undergo screening but do not enroll  or consent to participate  in 
the trial a s screen failure s, such as participants contacted by the research team but who do not meet inclusion 
and/or exclusion criteria.  
Site coordinators must document and retain the following information for screen failures: basic demography, 
screen failure details, inclusion and/or exclusion criteria the participant did not meet, and other details as 
required.  The data collected will be recorded by the research team in EDC. This data collection will be done 
before obtaining consent from the potential participants.  
7.3.2 RESCREENS  
Site coordinators may rescreen parents/caregivers who initially do not meet enrollment criteria that are likely to change over time. Examples include parents/caregivers of children who age into the CDC/ ACIP -recommended 
COVID -19 vaccination minimum age limit or who gain vaccination access due to progressing state prioritization 
schemes.  
7.4 INFORMED CONSENT  
This research study does not involve more than minimal risk  of harm to participants  and does not involve 
procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. The research study 
has been designed to perform all the study related procedure s remotely , and study personnel will not interact in 
person with potential participants  during the intervention .  The potential participants will be provided with a 
written statement regarding the research (ICF +HIPAA) before the consent process . A waiver of consent 
documentation  has been granted  for adult participants (parents/caregivers).  
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 40 of 73 Moreover, a full waiver of assent has been requested/granted. Children will not have to sign an assent and/or 
verbally agree to be part of this study. The ethical j ustification for requesting a waiver of assent  is that this 
research study does not involve more than minimal risk  of harm to participants and does not involve procedures 
for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context.  Children participati ng in the 
study involves only medical chart review or access to the state reg istry to collect COVID -19 vaccination record.  
7.4.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
After determining that participants meet all  inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, site 
coordinator s or research team members will conduct the informed consent process to obtain a verbal consent. 
The study team anticipates that site coordinators/research team members will remotely conduct most consent 
processes (e.g., via telephone, or video conference platform, etc.).  However, some in -person consenting could 
occur . The in -person consent will be done only by enrolling sites research staff m embers.  Eligible potential 
participants should have received a copy of the ICF +HIPAA  before being contacted by site coordinator s or 
research team members . This will allow potential participants to follow the information present ed by the site 
coordinator s/research team member s on their copy of the documents.  
Informed consent is a process that starts before a participant agrees to participate in the trial and continues 
throughout the individual’s trial participation. Site coordinators /research team members  will inform participants 
that participation is voluntary, that they may withdraw from the trial at any time without prejudice, and that nonparticipation will not adversely affect their medical care.  
Site coordinators/ research team members  will explain the study  to participants in terms participants can 
understand and answer any questions that may arise. The explanation will state the purposes, procedures, and 
potential risks of the study  and describe participants’ rights as research participants. Participants will have the 
opportunity to carefully review the  ICF+HIPAA  and ask questions before consenting. Site coordinators/research 
team members will give participants the opportunity to discuss the study  with their family or surrogates or think 
about participating in the study before agreeing to participate.  
The enrolling site coordinators /research team  member  that performed the consent process  must sign and date 
the ICF+HIPAA. Moreover, the research team member will have to document the informed consent process, 
following the current University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences ( UAMS ) Institutional Review Board policy.  The 
consent process will be documented in a “Process Note .” ICF+HIPAA and the “Process Note” forms will either be 
hand -signed or signed via electronic means such as DocuSign.  
7.4.2 IN-PERSON CONSENT  
Enrolling s ite coordinators /research team members  will coordinate with participating clinic staff to schedule a 
series of days to complete screening and consenting processes with previously contacted potential participants. 
If uncontacted, potentially qualifying participants visit the clinic during these days, site coordinators/ research 
team  members  may screen  and consent these individuals in person at the time of the visit or schedule a later 
time to do so. Site coordinators /research team members  will ask participants how they learned of the study.

PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 41 of 73 If clinic staff identify potential participants during a regular clinic or telemedicine visit, clinic staff can give, fax, or  
email potential participants study information (e.g., study pamphlet) and can give, fax, or email the potential 
participants’ cont act information to the site coordinators/research team members . The site 
coordinators/research team members may contact potential participants to describe the study and, if participants agree, complete the consent process, including verifying eligibility.  
7.5 ASSESSMENTS  
7.5.1 ENROLLMENT  
At the end of the consent process , the enrolling  site research team will complete the enrollment survey with 
participants. This survey will ask for the contact information of the participant (name, phone number, physical address, and email address)  and self -identified rurality . The survey will ask for the name, race/ethnicity, sex, 
name of child ren’s primary care  clinic and  physician, and birthday  of the participant’s children . The site 
coordinator/ research team will record this information in the EDC.  
7.5.2 APP REGISTRATION AND USAGE (ADHERENCE)  
During enrollment, site coordinators/research team members will ask participants if they would like assistance downloading and registering with the app. If participants request assistance, they will be scheduled with a Research Team member for technical assistance. After enrollment, caregiver participants will be block -
randomized within their  participating clinic  by the enrolling site  to either the Vaccine Uptake or General Health 
app study arms (see Section 8.2 for complete details on randomization). A Res earch  Team member will then 
register the caregiver in the assigned ap p using their assigned study number  as well as  the caregiver 
participant’s self -identified race, ethnicity, gender identity, rurality, and clinic of recruitment  collected at 
enrollment .  The Research  Team will send  caregiver participants the instructions on how to download their 
assigned app. Once downloaded, participants will enter their email address to retrieve their registration. The 
Research  Team will follow up with participant s who have not used the app within one week of 
registration /instructions successfully sent  via telephone, email, or video conference to confirm the completion 
of app registration. Each  time the app is opened, every selection made within the app will be tagged and 
recorded with both the caregiver participant’s study  number  and a time dat e stamp. This data will be tracked 
throughout the caregiver participant’s 24- week intervention to determine adherence (Section 8.3).  
7.5.3 BASELINE AND FOLLOW -UP ASSESSMENTS ( WEEK 8, 16, 24)  
BASELINE ASSESSMENT  
After enrollment and app registration, caregiver participants will be sent a link to the b aseline survey with 
questions regarding their vaccine hesitancy, intent to vaccinate, perceived risks and benefits of the vaccine, who 
they trust for vaccine information, and disease avoidance behaviors. The survey will also ask some household -
level questi ons, including:

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 42 of 73 • highest education achieved by their children’s mother,  
• insurance status,  
• household members,  
• vaccination status of household members,  
• COVID -19 infection status of household members,  
• increased infection vulnerability status (e.g., chronic health condition or other circumstances increasing 
vulnerability) of household members, and  
• experience of household members with any one of a set of common challenges (e.g., lack of food, 
housing, etc.).  
All these questions, aside from vaccine hesitancy, will come from the RADX -Up Common Data Elements.42 To 
assess vaccine hesitancy, caregiver participants will answer questions derived from the WHO SAGE Vaccine 
Hesitancy Scale that will be adapted to COVID -19 vaccines.43  
WEEK 8 ASSESSMENT  
At the week 8  time point , the caregiver participants will be sent a link to an assessment that asks for the 
following topics:  
1. Vaccine status of eligible children  
The surveys will ask caregiver participants for the dates, brands, and administrators for all COVID -19 
vaccinations that any of their children received since enrollment, if any. For each vaccinated child, the 
survey will ask participants to upload a photo of the vaccination card. If a participant is unable to upload the 
photo or the writing on a card is illegible, the enrolling site personnel will contact  the participant to schedule 
a time for a video conference to view and verify the card information.  
2. Usability of the app  
Surveys will include a systems usability assessment measured by the System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS 
is a simple, ten -item scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability.44 SUS instructions will 
ask caregiver participants to record their immediate response to each item, rather than thinking about 
items for a long time. Responses range from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree. The SUS yields a single 
number representing a com posite measure of the overall usability of the system. SUS s cores have a range 
of 0 to 100, with 100 representing a perfect score.  
WEEK 16 ASSESSMENT  
Caregiver participants will complete a n assessment at  or around week 16. Table 1 lists the content of this 
assessment.

PARTICIPANT VACCINE STATUS FOLLOW -UP 
Study staff will assess COVID -19 vaccination status as noted above. For any child who is not card -verified at the 
8-, 16- , or 24-week assessment, site coordinators/ study team members  will review the child’s vaccination 
records in their clinic’s electronic medical record system and/or the state immunization registry beginning at 
Week 25 to determine COVID -19 vaccine status.

8.1 SOFTWARE , FUNCTIONALITY,  AND CONTENT OF THE INTERVENTION  
Overview:  Participants in the Vaccine Uptake and General Health app arms will receive access to different 
mobile apps designed to provide health information. Content of the Vaccine Uptake app will focus on vaccine 
uptake, while content of the General Health app wil l focus on infection prevention and general child health.  
8.1.1 APP SOFTWARE  
The Nebraska App Team will build t he Vaccine Uptake and General Health apps using custom software created 
by Drs. Ellen Kerns and Russell McCulloh (protocol chairs) as a decision -support tool. The software creates 
pathways (i.e., decision trees) by linking together a series of question car ds in which the user’s response 
determines the next step. For the Vaccine Uptake App, the decision trees will be customized according to the user’s demographic information entered at registration, language preference (Engl ish or Spanish), and local 
context (state vaccination program stage/tier by age, local vaccination sites’ contact information, vaccination endorsement by local leaders and clinic staff, etc.). After the initial use session in which users complete their registration, the app will remember their registration characteristics and renders the pathways accordingly for 
every subsequent use. Figure 7 outlines how individual user and site data contribute to the presentation of customized app content.

Vaccine Uptake app.  
 
8.1.2 CONTROL ( GENERAL HEALTH APP )  
Specific elements of the General Health app will include:  
• Push notifications:  The app will deliver messages directly to participants’ mobile devices prompting 
them to vaccinate their child and directing them to view specific app content ( 8 weeks with weekly push 
notifications; 2 monthly push notifications for 2 months [1 notification per month] ). 
• Content areas: Specific topics presented as pathways are outlined in the schedule of push notifications 
(Table 2), but the general categories of topics included are:  
o General infection prevention and mitigation measures  
o General child health topics  
o General COVID -19 information from the “How to Protect Yourself & Others” page for COVID -19 
on the CDC website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/prevent -getting -
sick/prevention.html.  
o Table 2 shows the schedule of push notifications during the study period (intervention topics 
may change according to qualitative interview feedback)  
 
8.1.3 INTERVENTION EXPOSURE (VACCINE UPTAKE APP)  
The intervention app will consist of 3 pathways: 1) step -wise decision support with narrative vignettes, 2) self -
directed learning on each selected topic area, 3) area- specific vaccine access information and corresponding 
push notifications. The Health Belief Model ( Section 2.3 ) will drive topics for the vignettes and self -directed 
learning. Specific content will be guided by the qualitative interviews being conducted in an ongoing study and 
will include (among others identified): Safety; Effectiveness and personal/family susceptibility/vulnerability; 
Benefits (personal, family, community); Trust, decision -making/autonomy; Availability/accessibility. The list 
below provides specifics of the pathways and push notifications:  
• Step -wise decision support with narrative vignettes:  Using this pathway, participants will view 
information about COVID -19 vaccination in the form of short stories that include images of children, 
healthcare providers, and family members, as appropriate. The study team will tailor images and text content of  the narrative vignettes to participant registration demographics. For instance, rural White 
adult participants with teenage children will mostly view vignettes featuring rural, White parents, teens, and healthcare providers discussing issues noted in the qualitative study to be of interest to this 
demographic group. Similarly, Hispanic participants of infants will mostly view vignettes featuring 
Hispanic parents, infants, and healthcare providers discussi ng issues of interest to this demographic 
group, etc. As everyone benefits from gaining input from diverse sources, pathways will not exclusively 
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 46 of 73 feature messengers with complete demographic concordance. Participants can review other vignettes of 
interest to them or explore different questions within vignettes through in -app navigational buttons.  
• Step -wise self -directed learning: Using this pathway,  the app will give participants a menu of topics. 
Clicking on any of these will provide the participant general information on the topic and external links derived from the CDC and local health authorities, including hyperlinks that will open an internet browser window withi n the app. Unlike a website frequently asked question page, users will access 
information through branching logic based on topic area.  
• Vaccine access: Using this pathway, the app will give  participants local vaccine availability, 
recommendations for vaccination (e.g., at what age children can receive the vaccine locally), links to sign-up for a vaccination appointment locally, and resources for traveling to vaccination sites, etc.   
• Push notifications:  The app will deliver m essages directly to participants’ mobile devices through 8 
weekly and 2 monthly push notifications. These messages will direct participants to view specific app 
content (scheduled once weekly  and once monthly , see Table 2 for topic schedule) and alert participants 
to local or national changes to vaccine availability or vaccination recommendations (as necessary, up to once weekly).  
• Content areas : The study team will use the Health Belief Model  (Section 2. 3, Figure 3) to derive general 
content, and the qualitative study interviews will guide specific content, including (among others identified):  
• Vaccine Safety  
• Vaccine Effectiveness  
• Personal/family susceptibility/vulnerability to COVID -19 disease morbidity and mortality  
• Benefits of vaccination (personal, family, community)  
• Trust in government, healthcare systems regarding vaccination; decision -making/autonomy in 
choosing vaccination for children  
• Vaccination Availability/accessibility  
8.1.4 COMMUNICATION ADDRESSING VACCINE HESITANCY IN THE VACCINE UPTAKE AP P 
The qualitative project will use focus groups of specific sociodemographic groups in four states to understand the communication sources people rely on and misinformation influencing COVID -19 vaccine decision -making. 
The mHealth app will use principles outlined by NIH CEAL as we construct the pathways (Table  2).
10,45 The focus 
groups will identify ke y misinformation , which will be used in each pathway. For  example,  in the vignettes there 
will be testimonials from their clinic staff , and the step -wise decision making will present accepted facts without 
reinforcing misinformation.46,47

8.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  
Randomization:  The study will use a 1:1 parallel design at the caregiver level to assign caregivers to the 
intervention (Vaccine Uptake app) or the control (General Health app) arm. The study team will stratify 
randomization by participating  clinic  and in varying block of participants using a permuted design. 
Randomization will occur after enrollment and before the baseline assessment.  
8.4 STUDY INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE  
The study team will measure and monitor compliance using app usage analytics. The study team will summarize 
app usage measures as follows:  
• Cumulative number of times app was accessed (sessions) to determine total content exposure  
• Average session duration  
• Median weekly app sessions to determine rate of engagement over time

content from at least one app pathway.  
 
9. STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
9.0 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
See Sections 3.3 and 5.3  
9.1 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
The study team will consider the following to be an early -terminated participant: any participant who completes 
the informed consent process and enrolls in the study but later withdraws their consent, or the site investigator removes the participant from t he study. The study team will not replace early terminated participants; instead, 
sites will over recruit to account for early -terminated participants. 
 
Participants may  withdraw from the study at their own request, or the site investigator, DSMB, and/or DCOC can 
withdraw a participant. If a participant withdraws from the study, site coordinators or investigators can ask the participant why they chose to withdraw. Site coo rdinators will document the reasons for withdrawal.
 
9.2 LOST TO FOLLOW -UP 
The study team will consider participants lost to follow -up if they  do not have vaccination status confirmed by 
the end of the vaccine follow -up period (either survey/self -report or via EMR/registry check) .  
To minimize the number of participants lost to follow -up, the study team will send survey links and notify 
participants  beforehand , asking participants to respond to  the survey link. Survey reminders will be sent to non -
respondents daily for 3 days. Site coordinators will then contact  any remaining non -respondents.  
10. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
10.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
The primary endpoint is child initiation and completion of COVID -19 vaccination by the end of week 24  post 
caregiver randomization. Verification of vaccine receipt will occur by any of the following methods:  
1. Photograph of the child’s vaccine card, furnished by the caregiver  
2. Medical records documentation of child vaccine receipt  
3. Recorded vaccine receipt in the appropriate state vaccine registry  
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 53 of 73 Secondary endpoint #1  is child receipt of ≥1 dose of the COVID -19 vaccination series by the end of week 24 post 
caregiver randomization. Verification of vaccine receipt will be the same as for the primary endpoint.  
Secondary endpoint #2  is enrolled caregiver domain scores on the modified SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Scale 
adapted for the COVID -19 Vaccine from baseline and the end of week 16 post caregiver randomization. 
Caregiver participants will complete this survey  electronically.  
10.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
Because this study is of an educational intervention  and poses minimal risk , adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) are not expected. T he study team will not solicit AEs or SAEs but  will provide all 
participants with a site -specific telephone number to report AEs/SAEs. The study team will track severe and 
serious AEs that are potentially study related.  
10.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An AE is defined as any untoward occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or 
not considered intervention related (21 CFR 312.32 [a]).  Section 10.3.3.3 include s a list of potential AEs; 
however, the study team will not solicit AEs or SAEs but will provide all participants with a site -specific 
telephone number to report AEs/SAEs. The study team will document  severe AEs and SAEs and will track SAEs .  
10.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
We will consider an AE or suspected adverse reaction “serious” if, in the view of the PIs, medical monitor, DSMB, 
or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacitation or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be 
considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and 
may require medical or surgical interven tion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 54 of 73 10.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
10.3.3.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
These are the guidelines to describe the severity of AEs:  
Mild. Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
Moderate. Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate 
events may cause some interference with daily functioning.  
Severe. Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life threatening or incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” 
does not necessarily equate to “serious.”  
10.3.3.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All severe AEs and SAEs must have their relationship to trial intervention assessed by the clinician who examines 
and evaluates the participant based on temporal relationship and her/his clinical judgment. We will grade the 
degree of certainty about causality by using the categories below.  
Related. We know the AE occurred with the trial intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the trial 
intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the trial intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evide nce to suggest a causal relationship between the trial 
intervention and the AE.  
Not Related. There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the trial intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the trial intervention and event onset, or there is an established alternate etiology.  
10.3.3.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The site investigators will be responsible for determining whether a severe AE or SAE is expected or unexpected. A severe AE or SAE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information  previously described for the trial intervention.  
Potential events could include the following.  
• Anxiety  
• Depression  
• Feeling stigmatized or threatened  
10.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The study team will provide participants with a site -specific telephone number to report severe AEs or SAEs. 
Since this study will not administer the COVID -19 vaccine or any other intervention beyond the app, the study 
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 55 of 73 team will not actively solicit AEs or SAEs  or monitor any events related to COVID -19 vaccination . When site 
coordinator s or site investigator s learn of a severe AE or SAE, they will refer participants to their primary care 
physician  and will record the severe AE or SAE into the EDC and will track the SAE.  
Site coordinator s/research team members  will record severe AEs as described in the next section and in the 
(MOP). Severe AE data collection typically includes event description, time of onset, if available, resolution time 
and day, if available, and the site investigator’s assessment of severit y, relationship to study participation or 
intervention (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. S ite coordinator s/research team m embers  must appropriately document 
severe AEs occurring during the trial, regardless of relationship to the trial. The study team  will track severe AEs 
until one of the following criteria are met: resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained or is judged by the site investigator to be no longer clinically significant, or the participant withdraw s from the 
study. The study team  will track  all SAEs by asking site coordinator s/research team members  about the SAE 
every 14 days until re solution or until the site investigator determines the event is chronic or until the 
participant is stable. The DCOC may request other supporting documentation of the event, and site investigators or site coordinators should provide this documentation as s oon as possible.  
Site coordinators /research team members  will document changes in a severe AE in the source document and 
EDC to allow for an assessment of the duration of the event. Severe AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each episode.  
Participants may report severe AEs for seven days after completing all study procedures and SAEs for 30 days 
after completing all study procedures. Site coordinators and/or DCOC safety personnel will record and track 
according to this protocol and DCOC sta ndard operating procedures (SOPs).  
10.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Severe AEs will be included in the statistical analysis, and s ite coordinators /research team members  will 
document  severe AEs in the EDC system and follow the reporting procedures outlined in the MOP. The MOP 
section on documenting  severe AEs will encompass the requirements of  the: 
1. cIRB policies and procedures  
2. SOPs for the Streamlined, Multisite, Accelerated Resources for Trials IRB Reliance platform (SMART IRB)  
3. ICH E6(R2), GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): Guidance for Industry  
4. local IRB policies and procedures, when applicable. If there are discrepancies between the procedures, the most stringent of the procedures  will be followed .  
The DCOC will report severe AEs to the c IRB for its yearly continuing review. The DCOC will report to the central 
IRB (cIRB), as specified in the study -specific IRB communication plan, based on recommendations of the SMART 
IRB. Sites will also report severe AEs to the local IRB, per local IRB policies and procedures, and make them

10.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
10.4.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (UPIRTSOs) to be any problem, event, or new information that is:  
• Unanticipated or unexpected;  
• Related to the research; and  
• Involves new or increased risks to subjects or others.  
A UPIRTSO is not necessarily an AE or an SAE. For example, a breach of confidentiality is a potential UPIRTSO that is not an AE or SAE.  
The MOP provides additional details.  
10.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
Site coordinators /research team members  must report potential UPIRTSOs, per this protocol, to the cIRB, via the 
method(s) specified in the MOP, and directly to the DCOC. If the c IRB determines the issue is, indeed, a 
UPIRTSO, the DCOC will notify persons and entities as required by c IRB policies and procedures, the study -
specific communication plan, and the DSMB charter. S ite coordinators /research team members  must also report 
these events to their local institutions according to the rules and regulations of the local institution. The cIRB will 
report the issue to OHRP, per the policies of the cIRB. The cIRB required reporting times are p rovided in the 
contemporaneous version of 10.2, Information that must be reported to the IRB and IRB actions , which is 
available via  http://irb.uams.edu/irb -policies/current -irb-policies/principal- investigator -responsibilities/ . The 
reporting times, at the time of the approval of this protocol, are in the table below.

11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Our hypothesis for our primary endpoint is that unvaccinated children of caregivers assigned to the Vaccine 
Uptake app will be more likely to achieve COVID -19 vaccine series completion than those children whose 
caregivers are assigned to the General Health  app. The null hypothesis is that the vaccination series completion 
rate among children of caregivers assigned to the Vaccine Uptake app will not differ from the vaccine series completion rate among children of caregivers assigned to the General Health app .  
11.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
The primary outcome for this study is the proportion of unvaccinated children who complete the COVID -19 
vaccine series during the study period. The underlying assumption, based on available data for ISPCTN site states, is that without the mHealth intervention, the COVID -19 vaccine uptake would occur in 30% of children.
 17 
Justification of primary outcome effect size.  Table 5 summarizes vaccination rates among children 12 -17 years 
old through July 31, 2021, as published by the CDC.48 Based on these data, we see that vaccination rates decline 
with decreasing age and that ECHO ISPCTN states demonstrate a trend toward lower overall and by -age 
vaccination rates.  When excluding Vermont, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire (states that are par t of the 
highest regional vaccine uptake rates in the US), the other 15 ECHO ISPCTN states ha ve vaccination rates 
significantly lower than non -IDeA states. Assuming that cumulative vaccination rates continue to increase over 
time and that vaccination rates for children <12 years old will continue the trend toward lower vaccination rates, we anticipate that 30% overall vaccination rates among eligible c hildren at the time of study launch is 
reasonable.

*Difference from non -IDeA  state residents (p=0.028)   
 
We based the 10% increase  in vaccination rates on the cumulative estimated effects of intervention components 
within the Vaccine Uptake app. As discussed in the Background , behavioral nudges such as text messages ( i.e., 
push notifications within the app) are associated with a 5% increase in vaccination rates.49 App-based education 
and communication has shown variable increases in vaccination rates and intent to vaccinate, up to 8 -10%.50,51 
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 59 of 73 Thus, a combined 10% increase in vaccination rates is reasonable to expect from the Vaccine Uptake app since it 
combines multiple approaches in the same intervention.   
Public Health Impact . In this study , we are estimating that using the Vaccine Uptake app will result in a 10% 
increase in the proportion of children who will complete COVID -19 vaccination. When looking at the impact of a 
10% increase in pediatric vaccination rates, based on a US population o f 53.7 million children 5 -17 years of age,52 
such an increase would result in an additional 5 million vaccinated children. Previous research has shown that 
app-based vaccine uptake interventions are less costly than more traditional methods , such as paper handouts 
and communication tools. We estimate a cost of $10,000 dollars for the first year of a customized version of the 
Vaccine Uptake app per state. Deployment of the Vaccine Uptake app nationally would cost a little as $500,000 
dollars per year, or 10 cents per additional child who completes COVID -19 vaccination.  
In determining sample size, each caregiver is considered to be a cluster with an average of 2 unvaccinated 
children. To demonstrate an improvement in the proportion of unvaccinated children of caregivers who complete the COVID -19 vaccination series due to the mHealth intervention from 30% to 40%
27,53,54 would require 
758 caregivers (379 per arm) , at the two -sided 0.05 significance level with power of 0.90 and an intraclass 
correlation coefficient of 0. 60. The table below shows  the sample size needed to have  90% power to  detect a 
10-percentage point increase in the proportion of children who complete the vaccination series using the 
Vaccine Uptake app with varying levels of intraclass correlation . To ensure that there are at least 758 caregivers, 
the primary analysis population, we expect to randomize 8 92 caregivers to account for up to 15% of randomized 
participants who do not use the Vaccine Uptake app or General Health app after downloading it during 
enrollment.

11.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
This study will have three analysis populations:  
1. ITT population –  This population will include all participants randomized into the study.  
Title:  Improving pediatric COVID -19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool: a randomized, controlled trial   
PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 60 of 73 2. Modified ITT (mITT) population –  This population will include all participants who are randomized into 
the study, were eligible for the study, and completed at least one session in the app involving the use of 
at least one pathway.  
3. Per-protocol (PP) population -  This population will include all participants in the mITT population who 
were maintained in the study for the full 27 weeks.  
The primary population for analysis will be the ITT population. Study statisticians will perform additional analyses on the PP and mITT population s. 
11.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
11.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
Following finalization of the protocol, but prior to data lock, the DCOC statistical team will issue a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) as a separate document, which will provide detailed analytical plans for the set of analyses outlined below. The statisti cal team will conduct all statistical analyses following the statistical principles for 
clinical trials as specified in ICH Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (ICH Topic E9). The study team will describe and justify any deviations from the planned analyses in the final integrated clinical study report. The study team will present all study data and summary tables for the overall study and by study sites.  
The statistical team will summarize descriptive statistics for continuous data by using mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, as appropriate. The team will also summarize categorical data by using frequency and percent, and they wi ll investigate any outliers detected during data review and will define 
in the SAP methods for handling outliers or data transformation.  
11.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
COVID -19 Vaccine Series Completion. For each vaccine -eligible child, the primary endpoint will be whether or 
not the child initiates and completes the COVID -19 vaccine series during the 24 weeks of the intervention 
period . The study team will define vaccine series completion as per  the current ACIP guidance  for the vaccine 
product.  For children who receive a product that requires more than 2 doses for the primary series, receipt of up 
to 3 doses will be considered complete. Vaccine doses will only be valid for study purposes if given within the 24 
weeks of study participation. Additional  doses, when required for primary series completion, will only be valid if 
they are in accordance with  ACIP -recommended interval minus a 4 -day grace period, in accordance with 
recommendations of the ACIP. Also, per ACIP, there will be no maximum interval between valid doses. Incorrect 
second vaccine product (i.e., mixed series) will be invalid for study purpose s. The statistical team will use a 
mixed model with the binomial di stribution and the logit link to compare the two intervention groups with 
respect to the proportions of children who complete COVID -19 vaccination, using a site random effect and 
controlling for clustering by caregiver.

PI: Jessica Snowden, MD    
Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 61 of 73 11.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Vaccine Series Initiation. For each vaccine -eligible child, this secondary endpoint will be defined as whether or 
not the child initiates the COVID -19 vaccine series during the 16 weeks of study participation. Vaccine series 
initiation will be receipt of at least 1 valid dose of any COVID -19 vaccine product. Vaccine doses  for series 
initiation  will only be valid for study purposes if given within the 16 weeks of study participation. The statistical 
team will use a mixed model with the binomial distribution and the logit link to compare the two intervention 
groups with respect to the proportions of children who initiate COVID -19 vaccination, using site as a random 
effect and controlling for clusteri ng by caregiver.  
Parental attitude toward pediatric COVID -19 vaccination. The study team will evaluate parental attitude 
toward pediatric COVID -19 vaccination by using the vaccine hesitancy questionnaire that includes ten 
statements with ordinal responses using a 5 -point Likert scale. At baseline and week 16 , the study statisticians 
will generate summary statistics for each of the 10 questions for the two intervention groups. Similarly, the 
change in responses from baseline to end of study will be determined for each interv ention group. The study 
statisticians will use the general linear mixed model to evaluate the intervention effect on responses to each measure at baseline and end of study, and they will use this model to evaluate the change in each measure by 
using site a s a random effect. Within each intervention arm and for each statement, the study statisticians will 
use the Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine if the change in response from baseline to end of study is 
significantly different  from zero.  
11.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
The DCOC will detail reported intervention -related severe AEs and SAEs experienced by participants and will 
summarize these by the intervention arm. The DCOC will present summary statistics for overall and by sites.  
11.4.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
The statistical team will summarize baseline and demographic characteristics by intervention group and will 
apply summary statistics for both continuous and categorical variables. For continuous variables , descriptive 
measures will include number of non -missing values, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum. For categorical variables, descriptive statistics will include frequency counts and percentages by category.  
11.4.6  PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
There are no planned interim analyses of efficacy for this study.  
11.4.7  SUB -GROUP ANALYSES  
If there are enough  study participants in specific racial/ethnic categories and or urban/rural and/or age group 
categories, the study team will perform the planned analyses for the primary efficacy analyses within subgroups.

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 62 of 73 11.4.8  SENSITIVITY  ANALYSES  
While some participants may choose not to use the app beyond the  initial download session, the ir outcomes will 
still be assessed and used to determine efficacy of the intervention. App interactions —or lack thereof— will be 
informative to understanding how participants engage with delivered content and how those interactions —or 
lack thereof —correlate with primary and secondary endpoints. The statistical team will use logistic regressio n 
analyses to determine the association between mHealth usage level s and co mpletion or initiation of COVID -19 
vaccine series . 
11.4.9  TABULATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT DATA  
The statistical team will provide a detailed description of participant disposition, will tabulate the number of 
enrolled participants overall and by study site, and will present this data as counts and percentages. Additionally, the statistical team will summarize the number of participants either completing or discontinuing the study using counts and percentages.  
11.4.10  EXPLORATORY ANALYSES  
The statistical team will use logistic regression analyses to determine the association between  demographic 
factors including rurality  and completion or initiation of COVID -19 vaccine series . 
 
12. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1.1  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
The trial may be suspended or stopped per any stopping/suspension specifications in the DSMB charter. The cIRB may also stop or suspend the trial. Early termination of the study may be permanent if there is sufficient cause.  
The suspending or terminating party will provide, directly or indirectly, written notification documenting the 
reason for trial suspension or termination to the following, as applicable: trial participants, PIs, site investigators, 
cIRB, local IRBs, NIH, D COC, and OHRP. Persons and offices notified will include those specified in the trial MOP, 
the cIRB’s policies and procedures, and the SMART IRB policies and procedures.  
The suspending or terminating party will also contact trial participants and inform them of any changes to the 
trial visit schedule. Circumstances that may warrant trial termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements

Version #: 10  cIRB (UAMS IRB) #: 273761  
Date: 02/13/2023  Page 63 of 73 • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
If the trial is temporarily suspended, it may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data 
quality are addressed and are satisfactory to the DSMB, the cIRB, the local IRB(s) (when applicable), the funding 
agency, and the DCOC.  
12.1.2  CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY  
The study team will record data from the software to a HIPAA -compliant cloud PostGres Azure database. Sites 
and study team members will conduct all trial activities in as private a manner as possible.  
Records will be maintained as required by the privacy and security rules promulgated by the HIPAA (Title 45 of 
the CFR Part 164). 55,56  
During the trial, site investigators and/or site coordinators will keep all trial records in secure locations that only authorized personnel can access. Examples of secure locations include but are not limited to: 1) locked file cabinet(s) in a limited (ba dge or key) access room, or 2) password -protected computer systems. Study personnel 
may only transmit records that contain PHI, as defined by HIPAA, through an open email system if the personnel encrypt the data. Password protection alone is insufficient f or data transmission through an open email system 
(e.g., Outlook). After trial completion, access to trial records will be limited (see next section).  
Certain bodies/institutions may need to review information, including the participant information, for any of the 
following reasons: to process information or to ensure compliance with the protocol and other applicable requirements (such as the policies an d procedures of the cIRB). Institutions/bodies that may have access to the 
participants’ information include:  
• UAMS IRB (cIRB) and other oversite offices  
• IRB for the site through which the participant is consented  
• OHRP  
• DCOC  
• NIH 
Individuals with access to trial records will be:  
• Study PIs 
• Site investigators  
• Site coordinators  
• Data managers at enrolling  site(s)  
12.1.3  FUTURE USE OF STORED SPECIMENS AND DATA  
No specimens will be collected or stored for this trial. Regarding stored data, site investigators, site coordinators, and study team members will document all trial interactions, and these will be password protected in a secured 
facility/location.

The clinical trial outlined in this protocol is part of the ECHO ISPCTN, a branch of the program supported by the 
NIH.  
The data coordination, technical instruction, data standards, quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA), 
and operational coordination for the clinical trial protocol outlined here (and for the ECHO ISPCTN overall) is provided by the DCOC.  
The Steering Committee governs the ECHO ISPCTN and includes representatives from all site awardees, as well as representatives from the DCOC and the NIH. Overseeing the work of the Steering Committee is the NIH ECHO 
office, as well as an executive Leadersh ip Committee.  
A team of content experts and DCOC staff completed this protocol, and the ECHO ISPCTN Steering Committee 
reviewed it. The NIH Protocol Review Committee and the DSMB further reviewed the protocol.  
12.1.5  SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
Ensuring participant safety is the responsibility of all study team members, especially the PIs, site investigators, site coordinators, and monitors. A medical monitor and the DSMB will provide oversight.  
The medical monitor will be a pediatrician with expertise in infectious disease and vaccinations and will be 
independent of the trial. The NIH will convene the DSMB, and it will meet regularly, according to its charter.  
The entities that will receive reports include, but are not limited to, the DCOC and the NIH. The DSMB charter 
will provide additional information.  
12.1.6  CLINICAL MONITORING  
We will conduct enrolling  site monitoring to ensure that site investigators and site coordinators are protecting 
the rights and well -being of trial participants, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, 
and that the conduct of the trial complies with the  currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with ICH GCP, 
and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
• A DCOC team member or designee will remotely monitor enrolling sites to ensure data quality and 
integrity via weekly phone meetings and queries of EDC entries.  
• On-site monitoring visits will also be performed at each site, per the Site Monitoring  Plan, if needed for 
cause.  
• The DCOC will conduct an enrolling site close -out visit at the end of the study.

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 66 of 73 • Clinical site monitors will document details of their activities and findings, per the Site Monitoring  Plan. 
The Site Monitoring  Plan describes the monitoring details (i.e., who will conduct, at what frequency, at 
what level of detail, and distribution of monitoring reports).  
12.1.7  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
Each IRB -approved site entering data will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data 
collection, documentation, and completion. Each site will follow the MOP and any additional written site -specific 
SOPs. The operating procedures will inclu de, but are not limited to, procedures for: 1) performing the consent 
process; 2) data collection, entry, review, and submission processes; 3) assigning roles and responsibilities of site 
personnel; and 4) training methods for study staff. Sites will provi de direct access to all their facilities, source 
data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the DCOC and inspection by local 
and regulatory authorities. When electronic health records are source data/documents, sites must pro vide read -
only access for the monitors and auditors and anyone else authorized to inspect or verify records.  
Following the DCOC monitoring SOPs, the monitors will verify that the  site is conducting the clinical trial and 
generating , document ing (record ing), and report ing data  in compliance with the protocol, the Site Monitoring  
Plan, site -specific SOPs, the ICH GCP E6(R2), and applicable regulatory requirements.  
The DCOC will implement quality control procedures for the database and DCOC -maintained records in 
accordance with the Site Monitoring  Plan, MOP, data safety monitoring plan (DSMP), and applicable SOPs. The 
DCOC may communicate information about any data anomalies to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
The DCOC will address issues uncovered during quality assurance, quality control, or monitoring activities 
through simple corrections or root -cause analysis, followed by instituting corrective and preventative action 
(CAPA), as appropriate and as described  in the MOP.    
12.1.7.1  DATA  QUALITY ASSURANCE  
To assure the quality of the data collected, the protocol study team will provide training specific to entering data related to the endpoints of  initiation and completion of COVID -19 vaccination. The site research team will re -
confirm  a subsample of participating caregivers ’ report of COVID -19 vaccination for their child/children.  
The DCOC will provide sites with the randomly selected caregiver IDs for re -confirmation . After the sites 
complete the re- confirmation process, the DCOC will identify discrepancies and t he DCOC site manager will 
meet  with the site research coordinator and/or site investigator to review any  discrepancies. Together they will 
discuss and document the corrective action for each error identified. The corrective action may include updating 
discrepant data in  the EDC system or additional training. The DCOC will keep the protocol study team informed 
of the kinds and types of discrepancies.

12.1.8.1  DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
A formal data management plan will describe and document the data and workflow for the trial. The data 
management plan and associated documentation will specify all operations performed on data from origination to database lock, including detailed descriptions of source documentation, case report forms (CRF), instructions for completing forms, data handling and record keeping procedures, procedures for data monitoring, and reconciliation procedures and coding dictionaries to be used, if applicable. The data management plan will also describe the specific  data collection and management responsibilities required of the sponsor, PIs, site 
investigators, site awardees, clinics, and DCOC. The data management plan contents will be consistent with 
those described in the Good Clinical Data Management Practices (G CDMP). The DCOC will provide the data 
management plan components that document operations performed on the data to the PIs for review and 
approval prior to implementation.  
Data collection is the responsibility of the trial staff at the individual sites under the supervision of the site 
investigator. The site investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported. All source documents must be completed using standard good documentation 
practices (i.e., the ALCOA -C method [attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate and complete]).  
It is best practice for site coordinators to use hardcopies of any data recorded on paper case -report forms or 
trial visit worksheets/assessment forms as source document worksheets for recording data for each participant 
consented. Data recorded in EDC der ived from source documents must be consistent with the data recorded on 
the source documents.  
Site personnel will enter data (including demographics and intervention -specific questionnaires) into an EDC 
system that complies with HIPAA regulations, provided by the DCOC. During this process, sites will assign each 
participant a participant identification number and include this number in the EDC and source documents. The EDC system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Study person nel will enter clinical data directly 
from the source documents.  
12.1.8.2  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
Throughout the course of the trial, all sites will retain the source documents on site in accordance with current site-specific medical record storage procedures.  
Sites must retain all trial documents in accordance with local and/or federal regulations, whichever is most stringent. Sites will not destroy any records without the written consent of the DCOC. The DCOC will inform all site investigators when they no lon ger need to retain these documents.

Date: 02/13/2023  Page 68 of 73 12.1.9  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations are any instances in which study team members and site personnel (e.g., site investigator, 
site coordinator, etc.) do not follow the study procedures as written in the protocol. Protocol deviations are not allowed, unless the DCOC or Op erational PI gives specific written permission for the deviation. Anyone who 
receives written permission for a protocol deviation must keep this with other study documentation. Sites must record all deviations in the trial source documents. Whenever a devi ation occurs, the DCOC will conduct an 
assessment (which they do not need to write) of the severity and risk of the deviation. Depending on the results 
of the assessment, the DCOC will request/ensure that there is either a corrective action or a simple one- time 
correction, as appropriate. A corrective action institutes a process designed to keep the specific problem from 
reoccurring. Typically, assessors will determine the root cause of the problem to develop the most appropriate corrective action plan.  
We will provide the specific methods for handling deviations in the trial -specific MOP and/or trial -specific SOPs.  
12.1.10  PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
We will conduct this trial in accordance with the following publication and data sharing policies and regulations:  
• NIH Public Access Policy , which ensures that the public has access to the published results of NIH -
funded research. It requires scientists to submit final peer -reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from 
NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central  upon acceptance for publication.  
• ECHO ISPCTN Publications and Presentations Policy , which ensures accurate, responsible, and efficient 
communication of findings from ECHO ISPCTN clinical trials. The ECHO ISPCTN Steering Committee has 
approved and ratified the ECHO ISPCTN Publications and Presentations Policy, which includes 
representati ves from all site awardees, as well as representatives from the NIH and the DCOC.  
• NIH Data Sharing Policy and the policy  on the Dissemination of NIH -Funded Clinical Trial Information 
and the Clinical Trials Registration and Results Information Submission Rule. We will register this trial 
at ClinicalTrials.gov, and we will submit trial results to ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition, we will make every attempt to publish results in peer -reviewed journals. Other researchers my request data from this trial 
by contactin g Jeannette Lee, PhD, at the DCOC.  
12.1.11  CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY  
The independence of this trial from any actual or perceived influence, such as by the pharmaceutical industry, is 
critical. Therefore, we will disclose and manage any actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the design and conduct of this trial. The trial leadership in conjunction with the NIH ECHO office has established policies and procedures for all trial group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.
